0,2020/01/05,Swachh Survekshan 2020: Bengaluru tops in social media,"After scoring rather badly in the Swachh Survekshan (SS) League 2020, there is some good news for Bengaluru. The city is one of the top 10 cities on social media.

According to the SS-Josh Tracker, following Bengaluru are Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Mumbai (Maharashtra), Patiala (Punjab), Raipur (Chhattisgarh), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Thane (Maharashtra), Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Navi Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh).

This means that there are a lot more people in the city discussing issues pertaining to SS 2020 on social media than in other cities.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is making a concerted effort through various platforms, especially social media, to create awareness among citizens about the ongoing SS 2020.

“SS 2020 carries a total weightage of 6,000 that is divided equally into four areas. SS League carries 1,500 marks. We are expecting to score well in Q3, which carries total marks of 1,000,” a senior official said.

The city's rank in Q1 is 2,768 and in Q2 is 910. Of the 280 cities in Karnataka, the city is ranked 62 in Q1 and 24 in Q2.

The BBMP is now set to launch an intensive campaign for better scores under citizens’ feedback. Over the past few years, the city has fared badly in this section owing to poor response. Officials said scoring in this section was important as it carried a weightage of 1,500 marks.

Usually, broad questions are asked, such as awareness about SS, whether the neighbourhood and public/commercial areas are clean, whether community or public toilets are clean, whether segregated waste is collected, whether citizens are aware about Open Defecation Free (OFC) or Garbage Free City (GFC) status of the city.

“The problem with Bengaluru is that apart from garbage and visual cleanliness, citizens generally blame BBMP for every other issue. This is one of the reasons for poor score in this category,” officials said.

Citizens' feedback is collected either face-to-face, random outbound calls, through the Swachhata helpline (1969), Swachhata App and the Vote for your City app, and the SS2020 portal.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/swachh-survekshan-2020-bengaluru-tops-in-social-media/article30487843.ece
1,2020/01/05,Bengaluru engineer gets perfect score in CAT,"When results of the Common Admission Test (CAT) – the gateway to IIMs and top management institutes in the country – were announced on Saturday, the Harinarayanan family was overjoyed. Ashwin H., a 22-year-old engineer from Bengaluru, had secured a perfect score in his second attempt at the competitive exam.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Ashwin, who is employed in a private IT firm, said he is yet to come to terms with his success. “The 100 percentile is the result of two years of hard work,” he said.

Since the results were declared, his parents R.M. Harinarayanan, an entrepreneur, and V.S. Sreedevi, a homemaker, have been distributing sweets to neighbours and visitors.

The electronics and communications engineer graduated from PESIT last year and joined a private IT firm. “I wrote the CAT last year as well, and secured 99.36 percentile.”

However, he wasn’t happy with the score even though he got calls from IIM Kozhikode and Faculty of Management Studies-University of Delhi. He felt he could do better. “So, I decided to give CAT another shot,” he said.

After familiarising himself with the different sections and subjects, he spent most of his time solving mock papers and analysing the results. “After writing the CAT this year, I analysed the results based on the answer key. I was expecting 99.9 percentile; but securing 100 percentile is just fantastic,” he said.

“I hope to join one of the top IIMs – Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Kozhikode, Lucknow or FMS-Delhi. But I would definitely prefer IIM-Bangalore, as I will be closer to home,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pqf02h/article30487525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGASHWINHWHOSECUREDTHEPERFECTSCOREINCAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-engineer-gets-perfect-score-in-cat/article30487526.ece
2,2020/01/05,Yediyurappa promises ₹1 crore for Chitra Santhe,"Lakhs of visitors thronged the Chitra Santhe, Karnataka's biggest annual street art fair, organised by the Chitrakala Parishath on Sunday.

After inaugurating the event, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said that ₹1 crore will be earmarked for next edition of the festival in the coming budget.

The 17th edition of the event saw artists display their works in 1,660 stalls on the stretch from Shivananda Circle to Windsor Manor Circle.

“The drawings and the portraits here are so beautiful that it manages to draw everyone’s attention, and one day isn’t enough to see all these magnificent works of art,” said the chief minister. ""This year's theme is based on farmers, which is very close to my heart.”

S. Tejaswini, a visitor, said, “This is the seventh consecutive year for me. It is different each time as they have different themes and purposes each year. This year's theme is farmers.”

Visitors and art lovers enjoyed the experience of interacting with artists who had come from across the country to display their works.

Simran Katwani, who specialises in bottle art, said, “The Chitra Santhe is one of the best art festivals in the country. It is my fifth year. I am happy that I got a stall. Here, I get to enjoy a variety of creative art forms.”

With only sawdust and sand, Sheeja Ranjit makes art “out of nothing”. “'The event provides great exposure for aspiring artists. Here, art gets appreciated, and artists get exposed to opportunities,” she said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/u1mkcm/article30486878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGCHITRASANTHE2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cm-promises-1-crore-for-chitra-santhe/article30486880.ece
3,2020/01/05,200 cases of pipeline gas leaks last year,"Last year proved to be a challenging period for officials of GAIL Gas Limited who spent the better part of 2019 on damage-control duty fixing leakages caused by unscientific excavation by civic and private agencies. Last year, around 200 cases of pipeline gas leakages were reported, a drop from 350 in 2018.

Officials attributed this to intensive crackdowns and awareness programs. “Most of the pipeline gas leaks occur due to negligence on the part of civic and private agencies, but the jurisdictional police have started booking GAIL officials, too. It was only with the intervention of the authorities concerned that the cases were dropped,” said a GAIL official.

In an attempt to reduce the number of cases this year, GAIL is intensifying its awareness drive, and plans to slap a ₹1 lakh fine on the agency responsible for damaging a pipeline.

“We will be distributing pamphlets and holding meetings with civic agencies and private companies involved in digging work, and will share information on the pipeline network of the city. We have also came out with a format of an FIR for the police with relevant sections from the Petroleum And Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition Of Right Of User Inland) Act and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act. We will submit it to the police for further action as these acts are cognisable and non-bailable in nature,” the official added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/200-cases-of-pipeline-gas-leaks-last-year/article30486728.ece
4,2020/01/05,Fire Department to get 90-metre aerial ladder platform,"Fire safety remains a challenge with high-rises mushrooming across the city. To tackle the problem, the Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services is set to procure a 90-metre hydraulic Aerial Ladder Platform (ALP) that will be able to reach the 35th floor of a high-rise.

“We have called for global tenders. The last date of submission is January 6. We must ideally get it by the end of the year,” said Sunil Agarwal, ADGP, Fire and Emergency Services, adding that it is expected to cost around ₹20 crore.

At present, the tallest ladder that the department has is a 54-metre ALP. “There are two 54-metre ALPs in the city, and one each of 32-metre in Mangaluru and Hubballi. The 90-metre ALP will have a collapsing ladder,” said Mr. Agarwal.

ALPs are extremely useful to not only fight fires in tall buildings but also for rescue operations. “They can work on fuel, electricity and also on batteries,” Mr. Agarwal added. The ALP will be attached to a huge water bowser, and water can easily be pumped up till 90 metres.

According to senior officials, the 90-metre ALP will be one of the tallest in the country. “It will cover almost all the high-rise buildings in the city,” said a senior official.

Any building above 15 metres is considered as high-rise according to the National Building Code.

B.K. Hamppagol, former Deputy Director (Technical), Fire and Emergency Services, said that the number of ALPs is insufficient, given the rate at which Bengaluru is expanding. “The city needs at least 6 ALPs, which needs to be located across the city,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fire-department-to-get-90-metre-aerial-ladder-platform/article30486685.ece
5,2020/01/05,"‘There is some awareness on fire safety, but still a long way to go’","Beyond Carlton, a charitable trust formed after the Carlton Towers fire tragedy in February 2010 that claimed nine lives, aims to make India fire-safe. Nearly a decade later, Uday Vijayan, managing trustee and president of the trust, says there's still a long way to go in terms of fire safety and awareness. Edited excerpts:

Do you think there is enough awareness about fire safety?

According to 2016 National Crime Records Bureau data, we lose 45 people in fires every day. That said, I would say that fire safety awareness has improved, though there is still a long way to go. We are running a marathon and not a 100 metres dash.

Beyond Carlton prepared a five-year blueprint in an effort to make Bengaluru 100% fire safe. What is the status?

The blueprint was prepared in consultation with the Karnataka Fire & Emergency Services, and Janaagraha in 2018. Some action has happened after a lot of push and effort. The officials of the Karnataka Fire & Emergency Services have been cooperative. Our role as a catalyst will continue until it is implemented.

What more needs to be done to raise awareness about fire safety and precautions to be taken?

People are becoming aware about fire safety norms and rules. Many are reaching out to Beyond Carlton seeking help. However, a lot more needs to be done at various levels with the many stakeholders. But, we believe it begins with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which gives building sanctions. With awareness drives being taken up in schools, we believe at least the next generation will be better prepared and equipped to take things forward.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/54b5r9/article30490889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGCARLTONTOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/there-is-some-awareness-on-fire-safety-but-still-a-long-way-to-go/article30486449.ece
6,2020/01/05,German Shepherd from Delhi steals the show,"The 132nd and 133rd All Breeds Championship Dog shows and the 28th and 29th FCI International Championship Dog shows that attracted hundreds of visitors from across the city over the past three days came to an end on Sunday.

A German Shepherd owned by Ritesh Mittal from Delhi was adjudged the ‘Supreme Best Dog of the Show.’

C.V. Sudarsan, president, Madras Canine Club, which organised the event, said that the ‘Supreme Best Dog of the Show’ title was awarded for the first time to choose the best dog from among the four championships that happened over three days.

A Siberian Husky owned by Vijay Prabhakaran, son of actor and politician Vijayakant, won the ‘Best Dog of the Show’ title in two of the four championships. Thus, three dogs — the German Shepherd, Siberian Husky and a Doberman owned by Vasudeva Reddy — competed in the final round.

Mr. Sudarsan, who is also the secretary of Kennel Club of India, said that the event had the most participation — 505 dogs — this season.

8,2020/01/05,Judo national player fears dropping out of the sport due to eviction,"The narrow alleys in Sathyavani Muthu Nagar leads to the house of 18-year-old C. Bharati, a resident of the slum but a national level Judo player and a gold medalist in her State.

She is now living with fear as she will lose her house once the eviction of one of the city’s largest slum resumes. In fact, the eviction has been halted temporarily with the demolition of her neighbour’s house.

Resettling to Perumbakkam, far away from her present dwelling, will snatch away the opportunity to practice the sport due to the distance factor, she laments.

Ms. Bharati, her brother C. Surya, a 10th-standard student and C. Sangeetha, a 7th standard student - live in a 300 sq.ft house in SM Nagar. Despite their poor economic background, their parents E. Chakravarthy and C. Lalitha somehow manage to fund their children’s sports and educational expenses.

Player C. Bharathi (3rd from right) with her family at Sathywanimuthu Nagar on January 5, 2020 | Photo Credit: R. Ragu

“All three of them are judo players. While Bharati is a national player, Surya has participated in district level tournaments and the youngest Sangeetha has started practise recently. However the government has started evicting the houses in our locality and my neighbour’s house was the last to be demolished before it was halted.. Once it resumes mine will be razed down,” says Mr. Chakravarthy, a plumber.

Once they are relocated to Perumbakkam, more than 20 kilometeres from the city, they will not be able to continue the sport. “We start practice at 5.30 a.m at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and again at 4.30 p.m. So everyday we have to start from Perumbakkam at 3 a.m and return at 10 p.m. which is impossible. Our education will also be affected,” says Ms. Bharati, who has been practising the sport since she was in 4th standard.

Mr. Chakravarthy met a senior official of Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in October asking for a house in K.P. Park or anywhere within the city so that his kids could continue the sport. “The [TNSCB] official had asked me to come once we receive the eviction order. But now the official has been shifted,” he rues.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vruyeb/article30485817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHARATHIJUDOPLAYER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/judo-national-player-fears-dropping-out-of-the-sport-due-to-eviction/article30485819.ece
9,2020/01/05,Bridge over Buckingham Canal to be completed by June,"Work to construct a four-lane bridge across the Buckingham Canal on the Tiruvottiyur-Ponneri-Panchetti Road is picking up pace.

The Highways Department had to redesign 18 of the 28 pillars that will hold up the kilometre-long bridge due to oil and water mains running beneath the structure.

“The lines are at a depth of 1.5-2 m and cannot be shifted since they run throughout the entire length of the road. We have sought some land from the Indian Oil Corporation for use during construction. If that is given, it will help us speed up the work,” an official said.

The two-lane bridge is being replaced since it became weak after an accident some years ago when a vehicle toppled into the water below. “We have already pre-cast the girders and beams and by Pongal, work to launch the beams will commence. Work on the riverbed will be taken up after the water recedes. Right now, there is a lot of rainwater,” the official added.

Diversion created

The construction, which began in 2016, is expected to be completed in June this year. “We had to create a temporary diversion road along the canal bank without affecting water flow. The road also crosses a railway track that is used by a lone train that runs occasionally. So, we had to form a temporary railway gate to ensure traffic flow was not affected. Since Chennai Metro work is happening on Tiruvottiyur High Road, we were unable to divert traffic there,” another official explained.

Therady resident Rajkumar said the road was a crucial one, especially since it allowed thousands of labourers from Tiruvottiyur to reach their factories in Manali and beyond. “We were happy when the Maattu Mandhai flyover was completed. But then this work began and travelling became tedious again. Hopefully, the construction will be completed soon,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/se9n1/article30482087.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04JANTHbrigeworkunderway,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bridge-over-buckingham-canal-to-be-completed-by-june/article30482088.ece
10,2020/01/05,Ex-diplomat’s memoirs launched,"After gaining independence from the British, one of the early initiatives of the then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was to plant tree saplings.

“He did not think of constructing big buildings. He started planting trees, as that was the foundation for the kind of Singapore the founding fathers aspired for. Over a million trees were planted,” recalled K. Kesavapany, who was Singapore’s High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1997 to 2002.

Speaking at an event to launch his biography, From Estate to Embassy: Memoirs of an Ambassador, at an event organised by the Madras Book Club, he recalled those vandalising trees would get punished and be fined. “Initially, it was a failure. Then a massive campaign was launched. We even brought in religious organisations and went to schools. Even today, the trees are pruned, watered and cared for,” he said.

The book, co-authored with Anitha Devi Pillai, was released by K.S. Sankaran of Makino Asia, Singapore, and Makino, India.

The run-up to the show was one filled with training and grooming sessions for the participating dogs. “For a month before the shows, we ensure the dogs train twice a day with professional handlers and trainers. They are given premium dog food as well as good supplements and special care is taken of their skin,” said T.K. Chandrashekar, a resident of Chennai, whose dogs participated in the shows and emerged victorious in several categories. Mandli Chandrashekar Reddy, whose golden retrievers participated in the show, said such events brought together people who love animals. “For us, the focus is not on anything commercial, but to meet like-minded people who are truly passionate about dogs.”

German Shepherds, Belgian Shepherds, Chippiparais, Rottweilers and Shih Tzus seemed to be the crowd favourites and several children were seen interacting with the dog handlers and asking them questions.

“Through these dog shows, people can also learn about the different breeds and about the standards in place internationally,” said Steve Almeida from Goa, whose four boxer dogs were participating in the shows.

Tough competition

“Through the process of elimination, 10 dogs from over 480 dogs which participated today will be selected and they will be judged for the ‘Best in Show’ awards,” said S. Siddhartha, honorary secretary, Madras Canine Club, which organised the shows.

From 9 a.m. on Sunday as well, several breeds will participate in the dog shows at the M.K. Cricket Sports, Old SPIC YMCA Grounds, in Nandanam.

In his compliant, Adnan said that he had booked a flat at the developer’s ‘The Avenues AT The Esplanade’ project in Tondiarpet for about ₹41.19 lakh.

The buyer and developer entered into a construction and sales agreement on March 25, 2013 and the buyer paid ₹40.27 lakh, according to the complaint.

The developer undertook to deliver the flat within 24 months with a grace period of 6 months, but till date the construction had not been completed, it added.

TNRERA noted that Section 18 of the RERA Act gives a homebuyer the right to demand the amount paid by him towards the purchase of the flat along with interest and compensation on the ground of failure on the part of the promoter to hand over the flat as per the terms of the agreement. It said the refund should be made along with an interest of 10.15% per annum for the amounts paid from the dates of respective payment till repayment by the developer. It fixed the ₹2 lakh compensation for mental agony, hardship and inconvenience caused to the homebuyer and a litigation cost of ₹20,000.

Hundreds of visitors, mainly children, were enthralled as the 1855 vintage engine rumbled ahead and back for few hundred metres, with steam hissing out and drops of coal and water spattering on those standing beside the tracks.

“I have seen only the new engines. This is the first time I am seeing a vintage engine. It is really amazing,” said V. Sai Srinivasan, an eight-year-old who had come with his father to see the locomotive run.

The Perambur Loco Works organised a Steam Loco Show on Saturday afternoon from 3 p.m to 5 p.m. “We plan to organise it on every Saturday. This will ensure that the engine is in running condition. The EIR 21 was in service till 1909. After that it was pedestalled at the Jamalpur workshop and then at the Howrah railway station. In 2010 we restored it,” said Arun Devaraj, chief workshop manager, Perambir Loco Works.

A glistening plate on the locomotive reads: Kitson Thompson Hewitson Engineers — 1855.

“An official told us that the maximum speed of this engine is around 45 kmph. But it really looks very beautiful. I wish to learn how it operates and how they maintain it,” exclaimed S. Hemant Kumar , a class IX student from Vepampattu. Even adults were amazed by the sheer beauty of the locomotive.

“The shrill whistle takes us back in time. My father used to speak about the old Anglo-Indian steam engine drivers,” said Vincent Francis, who had accompanied his son.

Officials said that if the ICF lake is restored and boating is started, it will promote tourism in the locality.

“The Steam Loco Show at the Perambur Loco Works, boating in the ICF Lake and a visit to the Rail Museum can be a good combination,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/zc6qs0/article30482052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04JANTHSTEAMLOCOMOTIVEEVR211,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vintage-steam-locomotive-turns-out-be-a-real-charmer/article30482053.ece
16,2020/01/05,‘Partnerships for affordable and innovative cancer drugs needed’,"Noting that there are a large number of drugs to treat cancer but not one has come out of India, Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organisation (WHO), called for partnerships to bring out innovative and affordable drugs.

“Though Indian companies have been manufacturing many of the biosimilars and generics, we need more innovation. This can come about only if there is a partnership between government, science ministry, academia and pharma sector to bring out innovative and affordable drugs. Some of them may be biosimilars but some need to be novel therapies,” she said, while delivering the Dr. S. Krishnamurthi Centenary Memorial Oration on “Cancer in India: Challenges and Opportunities” on Saturday.

The country has a huge wealth of knowledge on medicinal plants that could be used for newer therapies for prevention and treatment of cancer, she added. She called for more research on genetic and environmental determinants of cancer in India.

She said perhaps it was time for a National Cancer Mission to make a dent on India’s cancer burden in the future.

Comparing clinical trials for cancer medicines to other disease categories, Dr. Swaminathan said there was disporportionate investment from private industries particularly from pharma on oncology drugs.

“Are we looking at the right investments in cancer research and development. In India, we need to think about affordable and sustainable models of care. A huge number of drugs have come over the last 15 to 20 years to treat cancer; there are newer immunotherapies now. We find that a number of them generated significant returns for the companies. But have they really benefited a large number of patients and how much benefit there has been is something we need to look at,” she said.

Talking about cervical cancer, Dr. Swaminathan stressed the need for new vaccines that are more affordable and vaccine schedules that make it easier. “Vaccine cost and availability are a major hurdle. There are not enough vaccines for all countries that want to vaccinate their girls. There are 11 new products now, one of which is an Indian product that is likely to complete its trial by 2022,” she said. The Indian quadrivalent vaccine has entered phase-III trials.

HPV vaccine

There was a need to ensure that HPV vaccination becomes part of the vaccination schedule in India, she added.

Ayushman Bharat has two arms - health insurance and strengthening of primary care health system, she said, adding: “At the moment, the insurance side is moving faster... The other aspect of strengthening of health and wellness centres and primary health centres needs a big push. If this is done, we will start seeing early detection, and prevention of cancer.”

She said Cancer Institute was a perfect example of how a NGO could serve as a model for a government programme to scale up.

17,2020/01/05,Evictions at slum settlement grind to a halt yet again,"With the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly session set to get under way on Monday, the drive to evict people from Sathyavani Muthu Nagar on Pallavan Salai, one of the largest slum settlements in the city, has been halted temporarily.

The drive started a week ago. Of the nearly 2,000 families that face eviction, 600 were sent off to Perumbakkam. Residents said that they were willing to move after the academic year got over.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan visited the residents and later issued a statement claiming that Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had assured him that the demolition drive would be temporarily stopped until the exams ended.

But, on Friday, Water Resources Department officials, who were undertaking the drive as a part of Cooum River Eco-restoration Project, began evicting families again. In protest, two men from the slum, Manikandan, 25, and Babu, 42, jumped into the Cooum.

The WRD and Greater Chennai Corporation officials claimed that instructions to stop evictions were issued as rural local body elections were being conducted. Several families were ready to move but the drive was stopped after instructions from the Deputy Chief Minister’s office, officials said. “On Friday, we were asked to resume but were told to stop again on Saturday as the Assembly session is to begin on Monday [January 6],” a senior official said.

Meanwhile, residents are irked by the false promises of politicians and the inconsistency of officials. “We trusted the Deputy Chief Minister [O. Panneerselvam], but he did not keep his word. A few families have decided to not move from this place,” a resident said.

Blocking right of way

WRD officials said houses were being cleared as they were blocking Cooum’s right of way.

The width of the river near the settlement had narrowed to 20 m. “If the exercise is completed, a stretch of 900 m and width of 50 m can be retrieved. Of the 14,250 encroached structures identified along the Cooum river, about 10,000 have been removed so far,” an official said.

Life has been tough for those who have already been evicted. On Saturday, 50-year-old Indrani stood staring at the rubble in S.M. Nagar with tears in her eyes. It was her house till a few days ago. Relocated to Perumbakkam, she now has to travel 40 km for her husband’s cancer treatment. Ms. Indrani is among the people who were evicted first from the locality. “There is no water or electricity in Block 101 [of Perumbakkam]. The lift does not work. The strain of travelling to the city for treatment is taking a toll,” she said.

The evictions violated the U.N. Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions and Displacement, 2007, that mandates that evictions should not take place in inclement weather, at night, during religious holidays or festivals, prior to elections, and during or before school/college examinations, said Vanessa Peter, policy researcher, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4sf1ll/article30481976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04JANTHSATHYAVANIMUTHUNAGARSLUMEVICTIONANDCOOUMRIVERTNSCB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/evictions-at-slum-settlement-grind-to-a-halt-yet-again/article30481977.ece
18,2020/01/05,Anahat Singh moves into final of British Junior Open,"Anahat Singh made the final of the under-13 girls’ category at the prestigious British Junior Open, beating Egyptian Janna Galal 7-11, 11-7, 13-11, 5-11, 17-15 here on Sunday.

The morning session belonged to Anahat after her gruellling semifinal against second seed Janna. The India lost the first game before battling back and taking the match in a scintillating fifth.

The excitement reached a crescendo in the decider with Janna racing to a 7-1 lead and Anahat catching up and saving four match balls. Soon Janna found herself facing three match balls before Anahat eventually won. The Indian faces another Egyptian, Amina Orfi, the top seed, in the title-round.

“Absolutely delighted about Anahat reaching the final. Her transition from under-11 to 13 has been extraordinary.

However, Mr Rijiju said that the focus was on the 2024 and 2028 Olympics and the goal was to be among the top 10 countries in those Games.

The minister while interacting with national campers at the LNCPE, Kariyavattom, said that the Union Government will soon implement innovative programmes and allocate more budget for developing sports in the country.

The minister said that his ministry was in touch with corporates to attract sponsorship for the sports development fund which had seen a decrease in funding this year.

The minister said he had requested all ministries for providing financial assistance and job opportunities for sportspersons who do well in national and international competitions. He assured the sportspersons that the government would leave no stone unturned to provide them with the best diet, coaches and modern sports facilities which would empower them to perform well in international stage.

21,2020/01/05,Celebrating all festivals,"Of all the memories I have of my childhood, festivals hold a distinct place in my mind and heart. Back then, festivals only meant fun, holiday and good food. I did not even realise the significance or importance of most of them but I was keen and eager to celebrate all of them.

I was born into a family which followed and practised Hinduism and I too followed the same by virtue of being born into the family. All the festivals of Hindu tradition were celebrated at home in a simple manner, and my mother left no stone unturned to ensure that the basic rituals are followed. My mother used to take charge of everything as she still does the same and on festival days, she would wake me up early saying that one should not sleep till late on such a holy, auspicious day.

So, festivals meant waking up early but this was not restricted to only Hindu festivities. I would be woken up early on Buddha Purnima, Mahavir Jayanti, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti and Id-ul-Fitr, along with all the festivals associated with the religion I followed. On all these occasions, she would ask me to visit the temple or have good thoughts and do good things. I did not know why I was supposed to do all that.

One day I asked her the same. She explained to me that all festival days are said to be holy and auspicious, and this stands true for all religions. So, if such a large number of people are considering this day as holy, then certainly there is positivity everywhere and it means this day actually has some significance. You may not celebrate it in a similar way as the followers of that religion do, but you can worship and pray to whichever god you believe in on those days and treat that day as a festival to just remain positive. You can go around and wish everyone to just be a part of the holiness that the festival spreads. What’s wrong in enjoying the happiness of others around you? You can always celebrate the beauty and idea of the festival. So, I grew up celebrating this simple idea and concept of my mother.

As I went to a convent school, the merry making during Christmas in school was something I looked forward to. When in school and even today, during exams, my mind would pray and take the name of our Father in heaven along with other prayers. Every Christmas, I would visit a temple with my family and a church because it’s a holy day. I always wonder how my mind instantly starts praying for a while in case I hear the azan when I am in distress or worry. I utter the name of the gods I worship. The azan reminds me of the gods I pray to and the power of prayers. As soon as I hear the azan from the nearby mosque in the evening, I know it’s time to go to my puja room for evening prayers and rituals. Honestly, all this is a part of me and my life. My faith and belief in my religion stands as strong as ever and I am an ardent follower of my religion but this does not deter me from being happy on the occasions of different festivals of my country and their prayers remind me of mine. The beauty and thought behind every religion and prayer is remembering the power above you.

Of late, I come across social media updates on various national issues which are affecting our country. What surprises and saddens me is seeing people pouring out their anger, angst and rage on one another at a personal level. Friends on social media have started turning into foes and using unacceptable statements against one another. When there is a political issue across the country, which we know would have an impact on all of us, it should be dealt with by not indulging in personal arguments. This is about the country and we all stand together even if we have a difference of opinion. Our views might be different as our faith and festivals are but what we all should celebrate together is the idea of our India. No matter how differently we live or speak, the only constant in our minds should be to protect this beautiful idea of India that our forefathers dreamt of and finally gave us to take care of.

22,2020/01/05,Towards complete legal literacy,"It is a great irony that law students pay a lot of money to learn what everyone should have the right to know free. For, the law of the land does not apply only to lawyers just because they know it. The most Orwellian part of the story is that the state expects us to obey the law, whether we know it or not.

Legal awareness in India has largely been remedial, rather than preventive. Free legal aid, as it exists today, mainly focuses on the right to be represented by a lawyer in court. It has not been effectively extended to legal awareness programmes to enable people to be “aware” of the law. What we are left with is a peculiar situation in which the alleged “offender” comes to know about the law only after he has committed the “offence”. It is often forgotten that the purpose of law is to regulate the conduct of the members of society. If the people are absolutely unaware of what they can or cannot do, whose conduct are we trying to regulate? The situation is strikingly similar to a boxing match between a professional and an amateur, with the rider that the amateur has not been told the rules of the game.

The people themselves are also at fault. There is a widespread apathy among even educated people towards “knowing” the law. The general perception is that the law is too complex even to attempt understanding it. Unless one receives a summons from the court or a notice from the Income Tax Department, the common refrain is that one does not need to “know” the law. As a result, legal literacy in India ranges from absolute ignorance to utter confusion.

Finally, the role of the state has been far from satisfactory. Since Independence, there have been efforts to combat poverty, malnutrition and even illiteracy. However, there has been very little effort in trying to make people aware of the laws to which they are subject. The web of laws, ordinances, regulations and notifications being issued daily, apparently seek to compel us to act in a certain way. The laughable aspect is the assumption in every court or department of the government, that all of us “know” the law the moment it is published in the official gazette. I do not think I need to waste any words on how many lawyers, let alone the ordinary people of this country, care to read the contents of the gazette.

All these factors go into the creation of the sad reality of a legally illiterate India. Yet, the legal fraternity cannot escape from this unending blame game. Though there have been efforts to refine the law from within the ivory tower, precious little has been done to disseminate legal awareness among the masses. It may not sound nice, but till the time the awareness of law is restricted only to the black-robed fraternity to the exclusion of others, the road ahead for India is pitch dark. Most of the “non-law” people I meet feel relieved that they are spared the torture of reading thousands of pages of legislation and case laws. While indeed it is a nightmare for law students like me, the comfort of not knowing the law is a Kafkaesque dream. They may not know the law, but they are subject to it. In case they violate it, they are not allowed to plead that they did not know it. It is elitism of the highest degree to suggest that a few thousand law graduates every year are entitled to “know” the law, while all others are bound by it without being told what the law says.

Until we attain substantial legal literacy, one can expect violations of fundamental rights, torture by the police, bribery in the name of “fees”, and myriad incidents where justice seems like a pipe dream for many. Interpreting and twisting the law may well be the job reserved for jurists, but it is certainly a basic right of each one of us to know what the law is.

23,2020/01/05,A disability is nothing to hide,"One lazy Sunday afternoon, sipping my evening tea, I was searching through my digital pensieve to find something to remember. As I was going back in time from the serene present to my boisterous engineering and prudent MBA days, I realised something.

I have come a long way, completing my electrical engineering degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. I have had career stints as developer, sales manager and marketing manager.

If a classification algorithm is run on the pictures in my pensieve, two groups would emerge out — in one, I have a veil around my amputated arm (dupatta during engineering and scarf during MBA), and in the other, I was comfortable with no camouflage around my arm.

The probability of one being comfortable in one’s own skin goes up with age, urbanisation, and education. I will not call age as a significant contributor, as it usually comes with the latter two. For me, education was the biggest influencer. It was a shift in my mindset: from what if peers concentrate on my disability over my abilities, to presenting an intellect that allows no distraction; and from spending a considerable amount of time thinking about ways to avoid the stares and attention, to more productive activities.

There were times when I have played badminton in a fully covered salwar-kameez with dupatta. And, times when I avoided swimming pools, to avoid wearing swimsuits. I have marched forward from all that inhibitions. I have taken a lot of people in the journey of my evolution, and they have evolved too.

Did the stares stop? No. But, it wasn’t as condescending.

Did the questions on my disability disappear? No. But, it wasn’t as uncomfortable.

Did they treat me like equals? No. But, it wasn’t an unequal treatment either.

Would they have preferred me hiding my arm? We will never know, as I am done shying away. And, in the process, I am sure all the people I have met would agree that there is one less way of classification: those with disabilities and those without. Those I have played badminton with, would vouch for that. Those I have swam with, would agree to that.

Corrections began with me. And, hence any change you desire has to begin with you.

If you have gone through something in life that’s out of control, worrying about it is of no help. Focusing on dreams and thinking of ways to eliminate obstacles helped me brood less, work more and move forward.

At no point, I will say I did all of this by myself. It was a collective work, and will be for anyone else in a similar state. Liberal parents and extended family, impartial teachers, non-judgmntal friends, and progressive society — help from everyone I have met, is what has made me, me. My journey has taught me discrimination of any sort would only become an obstacle for one’s desire to progress and become better individuals. Equal opportunity and treatment will change the individual beyond the imagination.

Irrespective of the external factors, today I strongly believe, be who you want to be and stop sacrificing at the cost of yourself. Wear the dress you like. Eat the food you prefer. Dance. Sing. Play. Challenge yourself. Run a marathon. Fall in love, with someone you like. And, most important, fall in love with yourself.

Finally, I close with a quote from Epicurus: “Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.”

24,2020/01/05,"Four trains in one night, a journey into the unknown","As it happened over half-a-century ago, I could have easily forgotten the train trip from Bangalore (not Bengaluru then) to Kottaiyur in Tamil Nadu. Looking back now, I still get a thrill.

The railway route from Bangalore to Karaikudi, about 5 km from Kottaiyur, passed via Jolarpet, Erode and Tiruchirapalli, but one had to change three trains.

The only convenient train from Bangalore was the Madras Mail leaving around 8.45 p.m. Get down at Jolarpet and hop on to the Madras-Mettupalyam Mail Express around midnight, arriving at Erode around 3 a.m. Again, after taking the train to Tiruchirapalli, board the Madras-Dhanushkodi Express around 6.30 a.m. and get off at Kottaiyur around 9 a.m.

For me, it was like going into the unknown because I knew no Tamil. I was going for a job interview at the Central Electrochemical Research Institute. At Tiruchirapalli, I managed to shower and change into pants and a coat with a beautiful tie. I was travelling third class, but there were just a few villagers who were respectful towards me obviously because of my clothes.

The only passenger

I was the only passenger alighting at Kottaiyur, and the stationmaster asked if I got off by mistake. It appeared odd to him that some city dweller should come to Kottaiyur, which had no government offices or businesses. He said I should have alighted at Karaikudi to go to the institute.

There were regular bus services to Karaikudi, but to go to the bus stop, I had to walk almost the same distance to the institute. So, I walked taking a village pathway big enough for one person. In less than half an hour, I was exhausted and sweating because of hunger and the warm clothing.

I came across a boy on a rickety bicycle who spoke broken English. He pointed to a vacant piece of land, saying the institute must be coming up only there as there was no other site in the village.

I was at a loss to know how I got a typed mail with the heading “Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Karaikudi” with Kottaiyur on the right corner with the date. I had a vague feeling that even without its own building, the institute would have an office somewhere. I decided to search at Kottaiyur and turned back half-way from Karaikudi. I was back again near the railway station and headed towards the village. I saw some amazing Chettinad mansions, but no people in sight.

I turned a corner where the street ended with just three or four houses. The last one was fairly big with a large front door right on the roadside. The door was ajar and within about 30 feet, the main door too was open.

I dashed in and a young man appeared with a questioning look. I asked him if he could direct me to the institute, but before waiting for an answer, I asked him for a glass of water and sat down on the steps. Just then the boss-to-be came and when he discovered who I was, I knew the interview was over because the only thing he said was, “When will you start work?” As they say, the rest is history.

25,2020/01/05,"Let the mind fly, take the train","One of the spin-offs of economic reforms is that the middle class has taken wing. But if flying has reduced travel time, it also has taken away the charm of travel.

Flying from Delhi to Chennai takes a little more than two hours, but a traveller misses the myriad sights of the vast, beautiful lands along the long, meandering railway track. A tiny oval window looks out into a monotony of white fluffs and blue skies, shutting the vision to a void. Travel on the tracks opens the vision to a continuum of thriving life in all its kaleidoscopic colours, sights and smells.

Flying lands people into an altogether different cultural and geographical milieu without letting them feel the diverse cultural snapshots that keep coming in regular succession, as the train trundles through bustling cities, thriving towns, humming stations, rolling hills and meadows, crooning jungles and cascading rivers.

A railway station is a microcosm of a town with its culinary delights, cultural imprints and pace of life. It is never cut off from the life of the city. An airport carries its signature in a standardised format, leaving the city outside its precincts.

The railway station has an orderly chaos, a rhythm in its cacophony and a loveable diversity in its swarm with the pleasure and pain of travel writ on faces. The airport wears an orderly look, but deprives travellers of any pain and pleasure with their faces blank.

In a railway carriage, one is at ease in one’s berth with all limbs free and the pleasure of soaking in the air at the halting stations. It makes travel as much pleasure as arriving is. On an aircraft, one is huddled and confined to a cramped seat. The limbs are motionless and the mind is thoughtless.

26,2020/01/05,"Mend fences, keep the conversation going","During a short trip to my hometown, I dug out some of my childhood albums. Most of the photos had five or six friends hugging or leaning casually against motorcycles.

My wife was quick to point out that she had not met one of the friends in the photos. He had been a bosom pal in college, but we are not on talking terms and in touch. I have had several scrumptious meals at his home and roamed on his motorbike as if it was mine. We had bunked classes together to watch matinee shows, and I had fought with other boys for his sake.

However amiable and social we are, we all have a set of persons to whom we have stopped talking to for some reason or other. They can be friends, relatives, neighbours or colleagues.

My grandfather, for instance, stopped talking to his second son for some reason. During family functions, they would share a common room, travel in the common vehicle and eat in the same hall. But they never sank their ego and remained like that till grandpa’s death. During the cremation, my uncle remained ostensibly guilt-ridden. I can’t imagine a day without talking to my sons, and I wonder what serious issue can force a father and son into such deadlock.

Does the magnitude of a problem determine our threshold to break a beautiful relationship? Often, not. Sometimes the issue would be trivial but vigorous enough to stoke agitated minds. What may appear to be a sinister issue in a fit of rage may turn out to be trivial one as we mature in life.

Trivial matters

People have stopped talking with close friends and family members over unpaid debt of a few hundred rupees, a compound wall encroaching by a few inches, cutting a tree that infringed on the neighbourhood, skirmish between children, wrong parking of vehicles and so on. I am sure that many would repent.

In my school days, I stopped talking to a friend because he used profanity. Despite his repeated efforts to regain my friendship, I remained cold-hearted. What do we aim to achieve by not talking to someone? Do we want them to be out of our life completely? If we keep snipping relationships by avoiding talking to people whenever we find them on a different page, we may be standing alone in society. There is a popular saying, “Conflicts can be reduced if we understand that people are not difficult, but different.”

Often, we assume that the other person may atone for the mistake when we stop talking to them but we don’t realise that every story has another side to it. We need to talk more whenever we hit a rough patch in our relationships. There is no better time than the present to renew broken relationships. For, there is nothing greater than forgiving and forgetting. If we can take a leaf out of our politicians’ lives, it will be how to bury the past and revive relationships.

27,2020/01/05,Setting transplant goals,"Unlike 2018, most of which I spent in ICUs fighting an end-stage critical illness, 2019 was a great year.

My luck began before 2018 had ended. In October, I had a heart transplant and was rid of heart failure. Just the act of becoming disease-free after 11 years liberated me from the chains that shackled me.

The feeling of celebration rippled through every nerve in me. I was not walking, but floating in the air. At 70, to feel so buoyant is a rare emotion, but I live it up. I laugh like a child, my eyes crinkle, and the head bobs as peals of mirth escape my throat.

Between October and December in 2018, as I recuperated in Chennai after my transplant, I planned two goals for 2019. The first was to write. I found myself brimming with ideas that on days, I wrote not one, but two or three articles. If I did not write, I could not sleep and had to get up in the night to pen the draft. The floodgates to an inner passion had opened.

I wrote of my experiences, pieces for students and teachers. I discovered the personal essay and wished to test my writing and publish in top U.S. magazines. This December, my first story got published in Reader’s Digest. I feel good. Many rejections from American magazines also came. I am unfazed because once I understand what western readers want, acceptance is a given.

I joined some free courses in editing and fiction-writing, which I had never attempted. I have since written 10 pieces of fiction and shared them with friends.

Two of my stories have been selected for an e-anthology to be published by AdHoc Fiction (U.K.). One story was recently short-listed in an Australian writing contest. It didn’t win, but I am content with the baby steps I have taken.

Insured and safe

My second goal was to acquire a senior citizens’ health policy. Despite being eligible and healthy, no insurance company was willing to give it to me. No reasons were assigned. When asked, the standard answer was, “Because you are a transplant recipient.”

Frustrated, I complained to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI). It supported me and sent me the most recent notifications which empowered me. I was convinced that insurers were being high-handed.

I requested my transplant surgeon to give me a letter on my present state of health, which he did and offered to answer the queries of insurers.

Armed with his letter and my most recent medical reports (after completion of one year of transplant), I went to the head office of an insurance company in Chennai. There I found the managing director and the senior staff receptive. They promised to consider my application on their medical panel. The MD called me the next morning and assured me they would design a new product and get it approved by the IRDAI.

Three weeks later, when I requested for an update, I was shocked to be told that insurance norms were not permitting the company to issue me a policy. That sparked off a rage in me at the unfairness of it all, and I argued with a ferocious logic that I hadn’t known I had in me. I asked them to redefine their outdated norms and pave the way for modern-day medical interventions, or to give me in writing why they were not insuring me.

I decided to move heaven and earth to get justice, including sending them a legal notice and writing to the highest in the land.

Two days later, I got a pleasant surprise when I was informed that I would be insured the same day. On December 7, I became the first transplant recipient in the country to get health insurance.

To the credit of the company, it’s now coming out with a product for transplant recipients. It will become the first insurer in the country to have taken this step.

As the curtain falls on 2019, I feel it has been one of the best years in my life because I was able to fulfil my goals and re-engineer my life. I believe this power lies within each human being. It is important to draw on it when needed.

32,2020/01/05,"Maharashtra portfolios: Ajit Pawar gets Finance, Anil Deshmukh Home Ministry","Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar has got the finance and planning department while his party colleague Anil Deshmukh is the new Home minister of the State, a senior official said on Sunday.

Also read: Know Uddhav Thackeray’s new team

Besides, first-time Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, who is the son of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, has been given charge of the environment, tourism and protocol departments, he said.

Senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat has got the revenue ministry, the official added.

With this allocation of portfolios, the Sharad Pawar- led NCP has got most of the ‘plum’ ministries.

There were speculations that either Ajit Pawar or Jayant Patil of the NCP would get the Home department, but the portfolio has been allocated to their party colleague Anil Deshmukh.

Earlier, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari approved the allocation of portfolios as proposed by the chief minister.

The list of portfolios to be allocated to ministers was sent to the governor on Saturday evening.

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, had been facing criticism from the opposition BJP for delay in the allocation of portfolios despite being in power for over a month now.

Chief Minister Thackeray and six of his council members - two each from the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress - took oath on November 28.

Thackeray expanded his month-old ministry on December 30 by inducting 36 ministers.

The full portfolio details are as follows:

33,2020/01/05,Five-year-old boy dies after leopard attack in Gujarat,"A five-year-old boy died hours after he was attacked by a leopard at Bharan village in Bharuch district of Gujarat on Saturday, a forest official said.

The victim, Kishan Valvi, died at a hospital at Kim in Surat district where he was admitted after suffering grievous injuries in the leopard attack, Bhavna Desai, assistant conservator of forest, Bharuch, said.

“The minor was attacked by the leopard when he was playing in a sugar cane field at Bharan village in Ankleshwar taluka around 8.30 a.m.. His parents were working as labourers at the farm when the incident occurred,” Ms. Desai said.

“He was rushed to the hospital in Kim, where he died during treatment,” she said. Following the incident, cages were set up in the affected area to trap the wild animal.

This comes a day after a five-year-old girl was killed by a leopard in a similar attack at Patal village in Surat district. Gujarat has witnessed a surge in incidents of leopard attacks. As per the government data, 14 people were killed while 71 others were injured in 80 attacks by leopards in Junagadh and Amreli districts in the last two years.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/five-year-old-boy-dies-after-leopard-attack-in-gujarat/article30483494.ece
34,2020/01/05,Allocation of portfolios taking time as govt. mulls new depts: NCP leader,"The NCP, which is sharing power with the Shiv Sena and the Congress in Maharashtra, on Saturday said the allocation of portfolios to ministers is taking time as the Uddhav Thackeray-led government is mulling creation of some new departments.

NCP chief spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik made this comment in the wake of reports, which claimed that differences among the three ruling parties over sharing of portfolios is causing the delay in the allocation.

Mr. Malik said portfolios are likely to be allocated on Monday. “The government is mulling creation of new portfolios. So, it is taking some time, nothing else,” the NCP leader said, dismissing the media reports.

Although Mr. Malik did not specify the details, sources said the government may have new ministers for the Chief Minister’s Office, commerce, Metro, and others.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and six of his council members — two each from the Sena, NCP and Congress — had taken oath on November 28. The first cabinet expansion took place on December 30. The full-fledged allocation of portfolios, however, is yet to be done.

Sources said the Congress, which has been seeking two additional berths in the government, submitted its list of ministers with the departments allocated to them to the Chief Minister on Friday.

According to the earlier portfolio-sharing arrangement, the three parties had decided that the Congress was to get 12 ministries in the 43-member council of ministers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2baab0/article30483433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMNAWABMALIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/allocation-of-portfolios-taking-time-as-govt-mulls-new-depts-ncp-leader/article30483434.ece
35,2020/01/05,WR recovers tickets worth over ₹2 crore,"Tickets worth over ₹2 crore were recovered by the Mumbai Division of the Western Railway (WR) in 2019. The majority of tickets booked via touts were electronic tickets (e-tickets).

Between January and November 2019 the railway protection force arrested 353 touts in 282 cases. They recovered 8,285 tickets worth over ₹2.07 crore, of which 8,050 were e-tickets worth nearly ₹2 crore.

The bulk of the tickets were bought online using fake IDs and software targeted at automatic booking. “We have created specialised teams to identify these fake IDs and track them down. Typically the touts target people who don’t understand e-ticketing and charge them multiple times for the same ticket,” S.R. Gandhi, senior divisional security commissioner, Mumbai Division, WR, said.

Senior railway officials said on the WR, the key hubs of touting were Andheri and Borivali. “A trend has emerged over the last year of touts booking tickets from other States and sending it to the city. However, this is a small proportion of the tickets we have seized,” a senior railway official said.

Mr. Gandhi said they have also cancelled tickets booked through touts, which would act as a deterrent for passengers seeking services from them. In 11 months in 2019, 4,315 tickets were blocked, leading to the cancellation of journeys of 14,474 people.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wr-recovers-tickets-worth-over-2-crore/article30482059.ece
36,2020/01/05,"Poets, painters voice their dissent through art","“Tumhari raah me mitti ke ghar nahi aate, isilye toh tumhe hum nazar nahi aate (Houses made of mud do not fall on your way, which is why you never see us)” was one of the many verses on display on placards at Azad Maidan, as over 100 artists gathered at the ground to stage a peaceful protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The lines were written by Surendra Rao, who sat shoulder to shoulder with other fellow poets and painters to voice his dissent against the two laws. The protest was organised by the Secular Movement, an organisation of artists from Mumbai and nearby areas, and was held from 12.30 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday.

“The Constitution is secular and allows us to protest rules that are against humanity. Nowhere is it written in the Constitution that people should be divided on the basis of religion. India is a secular country,” Gautamiputra Kamble, president, Secular Movement, said.

Amidst slogans calling for unity, these protesters only made their thoughts known through placards bearing their art. Another poem by Mr. Rao read, “Mai samay ki dhaar me dhas kar khada hoon, main chhapachhap chhapte chhal se ladaa hoon, sat mein sadha hoon isliye jee raha hoon, main tootne wala nahin, kachcha ghadaa hoon (I am standing firmly on the edge of time, fighting deceit that is being printed rapidly, held together by truth and hence alive, I am a raw earthen pot and I will not break).”

Artists were also seen painting various scenes at the maidan, depicting ongoing issues such as farmer suicides, corruption, crimes against women and unemployment and highlighting the importance of solving them rather than indulging in the politics of hate. Artworks also depicted the recent atrocities by the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh police against protesting students.

Prabhakar Kamble, an organiser, said “First, the government should get rid of poverty from the country and then talk about CAA and NRC.” According to him, many paintings at the protest depicted what happened in Assam because of the NRC.

“If it is applied across the country, those who can afford it will move abroad, but what will the poor do? How will those who have not been able to get basic documents like Aadhaar and PAN cards prove their citizenship?” asked Mr. Kamble.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/txrtnp/article30482054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMCAAARTISTSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/poets-painters-voice-their-dissent-through-art/article30482055.ece
37,2020/01/05,People must stand together against divisive laws: Raut on Citizenship Act,"Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the people of the State need to stand together against laws which are aimed at dividing them.

Mr. Raut made the statement while participating in a discussion on the relationship between the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

The event was jointly organised by the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and the Association for Protection of Civil Rights. Apart from Mr. Raut, retired Bombay High Court Justice B.G. Kolse-Patil and advocate Mihir Desai too attended the discussion.

Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its loss in the Jharkhand elections, Mr. Raut said the Sena would give many more shocks to the Central government like it did in Maharashtra.

“Maharashtra has taught the country to fight against those who try to arouse fear in citizens. A true patriot should not be afraid of such laws. Instead, the people responsible for such laws should be afraid of us. Even though the late Balasaheb Thackeray was known as Hindu Hriday Samrat, he always believed that the country belongs to everyone. There should be regard for laws but law should never invoke fear,” Mr. Raut said.

He also accused the Central government of manipulating the youth and citizens of the country.

“The youths who are protesting have the right to vote and the right to decide about the welfare of the country. Both the country and its freedom are in danger when they are treated as criminals. Neither the United Nations nor Mr. Modi’s friend, U.S. President Donald Trump, is in support of the CAA or the NRC,” he said.

Reverting to the traditional style of the Sena, Mr. Raut said the party is not afraid of laws. “Laws are just on paper. The Sena follows its own laws. On behalf of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, I would like to tell the people that we are with them,” Mr. Raut said.

Slamming the government’s claim that the NPR and NRC were not connected, Mr. Desai said the decision to implement NRC was taken in 2003, but it was necessary to form the NPR before that.

“Those who have been excluded in the NPR can appeal and get included and only after this will the final NRC be put together. If they just want to make a population register, they can do it during the 2021 census. A different register only means that they want to kick people out of the country,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/g2sld3/article30482049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMCAASANJAYRAUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/people-must-stand-together-against-divisive-laws-raut-on-citizenship-act/article30482050.ece
38,2020/01/05,Cash van custodian who made away with ₹3.96 cr. held,"The Koparkhairane police have arrested the custodian of a cash van who made away with nearly ₹4 crore meant to be loaded into ATMs.

Sachin Shivaji Wagh was arrested from Thane on Friday night after Assistant Commissioner of Police Satish Govekar received a tip-off on his location. “He had gone absconding and was hiding in Thane,” senior police inspector Suryaklant Jagdale, Koparkhairane police station, said. He said the police were investigating if Mr. Wagh has an accomplice. “We will also try to recover the stolen money,” Mr. Jagdale said.

Securitrans India private limited, an agency responsible for loading cash in ATMs, had registered a case against their employee after realising that he made away with ₹3.96 crore. On December 26, Mr. Wagh, who was the custodian of route number 2 in Koparkhairane, had not reported to work. Prakash Vhankeri, regional manager of the Koparkhairane branch of the firm, found this suspicious and asked for an audit of route number 2. In the audit of 35 ATMs of the 37 on the route, the auditors found discrepancies of the same amount. “We suspect that he would have made away with more than ₹3.96 crore,” Mr. Govekar said.

The crime is suspected to have happened between December 11 and 25. Mr. Wagh was the only one to have the key and the password to the machines on the route. Mr. Wagh had not only taken out the existing money in the machines but also made away with the ones he was in possession of for loading.

Mr. Wagh has been booked under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by banker or agent) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. He was produced before a court on Saturday and remanded in police custody till January 8.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cash-van-custodian-who-made-away-with-396-cr-held/article30482034.ece
39,2020/01/05,MVA govt. will offer more jobs to local youth: Uddhav Thackeray,"Mumbai is soon likely to get a state-of-the-art international exhibition centre, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on Saturday after reviewing the State’s industrial policy at a meeting of the industries department. Mr. Thackeray said the policy will be revised soon and the amendments forwarded to the Centre.

Mr. Thackeray said the priority of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would be to give more jobs to local youth under its industrial policy.

He said, “Ensuring industrial growth while creating maximum jobs for the youth is the priority of our government. From here on, our government will ensure that all policies are drawn up keeping the labourer at the centre of it. Mr. Thackeray also instructed officials of the department to start work on setting up a global exhibition centre either in Mumbai or Navi Mumbai.

The review of the State’s industrial policy, drawn up under the previous regime, was attended by Industries Minister Subhash Desai, Cabinet Ministers Aaditya Thackeray and Anil Parab, and Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta.

The policy was unveiled by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Mr. Thackeray just before the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha election came into effect. The aim of the policy, which was implemented on April 1, 2019, was to attract investments of over ₹10 lakh crore and create around 40 lakh jobs by 2023-24, the then minister for industries and mining, Subhash Desai, had said. He had also reiterated the government’s goal of turning Maharashtra into a trillion dollar (₹1 lakh crore) economy.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no9jdg/article30482029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-govt-will-offer-more-jobs-to-local-youth-uddhav-thackeray/article30482031.ece
40,2020/01/05,22-year-old from Kalyan tops CAT,"Twenty-two-year-old Rahul Gupta from Shahad near Kalyan managed to secure a 100 percentile in the 2019 Common Admission Test (CAT), whose results were announced on Saturday.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Gupta said he learnt about the result in the morning and was over the moon. “I am really happy and very relieved. My focus will now be on the group discussion and personal interviews,” he said.

An alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, Mr. Gupta said it was his third attempt at cracking the entrance test. He is currently based out of Bangalore, where he is working for a financial technology company.

Mr. Gupta grew up in Shahad, where his family still lives, and completed his schooling in Century Rayon School. He specialised in chemical engineering but said he wanted to pursue a career in finance. Mr. Gupta said he didn’t have any plans to go abroad for further studies and was focussing on giving the Xaviers Aptitude Test, which was scheduled for Sunday.

He is one of the 10 candidates who have scored the highest in the 2019 CAT. All 10 were men from technological and engineering backgrounds, of which six were from IITs and two from National Institutes of Technology.

The exam saw the highest number of candidates appearing for it in the last 10 years, with 1.34 lakh men and 75,000 women.

41,2020/01/05,Government invites Bollywood for dialogue on CAA,"A “dialogue over CAA with the government” with “scrumptious dinner” thrown in. An invitation sent to leading Bollywood figures on January 3 to meet Union Minister Piyush Goyal has been doing feverish rounds in the entertainment media WhatsApp groups on January 4. While practically all the big names are said to have been invited for the discussion with the Union Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry, scheduled to be held on January 5 at 8 p.m. at Grand Hyatt, most are yet to confirm their presence. Of those critical of CAA — Javed and Farhan Akhtar and Kabir Khan — are said to have been invited but Anurag Kashyap, Anubhav Sinha, Swara Bhaskar etc. are not on the list of invitees.

The invitation states that the government strongly believes in a healthy discussion around all the possible dimensions of the issue: “The idea behind the meeting is quite inclusive in approach and we request a participation of all the rational thoughts and different points of view pertaining to the Citizenship Amendment Act”. However, one industry insider, on the condition of anonymity, said, “I don’t see a point in going. I don’t think they are willing to listen”.

Organised by film producer Mahaveer Jain, it seems yet another move by the government to try and win the perception war using Bollywood as a weapon. Just as it did before the elections. However, this time, the industry seems more polarised than ever before with a lot of younger stars taking an openly anti CAA/NRC stance and the big names preferring to remain silent. ""The government is rattled. This has been a ceaseless PR disaster for them both nationally and internationally. The protests are not dying and there is a staggering number that is protesting. It's a desperate measure to save face and the government knows how to use Bollywood [for it],"" said another industry person.

While one set believes that tweets from Bollywood stars, in support of the CAA might now start flowing Monday onwards, there is also the perception that though the government might be trying to get in as many names and faces as possible, not many might eventually turn up at the meeting. ""We hope that Bollywood would be shamed into not going for the meeting,"" said an anti-CAA film personality. It can only be speculated for now whether another Bollywood selfie would happen on January 5 night or a statement made.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6lgqvs/article30482092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Javed-Akhtar-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/government-invites-bollywood-for-dialogue-on-caa/article30481987.ece
42,2020/01/05,Crime Branch busts two flesh trade rackets in a single day,"The Mumbai Police Crime Branch busted two prostitution rackets in the city in a single day by arresting a Bollywood production manager at a four-star hotel in Juhu and a 35-year-old man, who forced girls from West Bengal and Bangladesh into the flesh trade, in Dahisar.

Acting on a tip-off, the Social Service Branch (SSB) raided Zed Luxury Residency Hotel on Friday and arrested Rajeshkumar Lal, who worked as a production manager in the film industry. Two Uzbek nationals were rescued in the operation, a Crime Branch official said.

The official said the accused, along with with an Uzbek woman, allegedly provided girls from Uzbekistan to his clients. The SSB made contact with Mr. Lal using a decoy customer and a ‘deal’ was finalised at ₹80,000. In exchange for the money, Mr. Lal agreed to send an Uzbek girl to the hotel in Juhu.

An SSB officer said, “Mr. Lal was taken into custody as soon as he showed up at the hotel. We then rescued the two Uzbek girls after putting him through initial questioning. Prima facie, we have learned that he is in touch with an Uzbek national named Zarina, who was staying in Mumbai earlier. According to our inquiries, Zarina supplied the girls, while Mr. Lal made deals with the clients.”

The officer said the operation might lead the Crime Branch to other film industry professionals. Scores of Uzbek girls work in the industry as dancers or extras and there is a chance that Mr. Lal might not have been running the racket all by himself.

The officer said, “Based on preliminary inquiries, we have learned that Mr. Lal had been active for at least the past seven or eight years. The two women we rescued were in India on tourist visas. It gives rise to the possibility that many more girls might be regularly visiting and leaving the country as part of the racket.”

Mr. Lal was handed over to the Juhu police, who arrested him and charged him under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act. SSB officers said three girls had been rescued in another raid at the same hotel last month.

Meanwhile, the Crime Branch Unit XII on Friday busted a flesh trade racket in Dahisar, where girls from West Bengal and Bangladesh were allegedly forced into prostitution. Crime Branch officers said the racket was being run out of Giri Niwas chawl. An officer said, “We found three girls in the house. Two of them hailed from West Bengal, while the third was a Bangladeshi national with a valid visa.”

The Unit XII arrested Sanjay Das for allegedly running the racket and handed him over to the Dahisar police for further investigation.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4mcd37/article30481956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMRajeshkumar-Lal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crime-branch-busts-two-flesh-trade-rackets-in-a-single-day/article30481958.ece
43,2020/01/05,ATP Cup | Daniil Medvedev blunts Isner’s serve,"World number five Daniil Medvedev blunted big-serving John Isner in an almost flawless straight sets victory at the ATP Cup on Sunday.

The US Open finalist hit 24 winners and made just two unforced errors in the 6-3, 6-1 rout in one hour to ensure Russia clinched the tie against the United States ahead of the doubles.

Unbeaten Russia is top of Group D, while winless United States is all but out of contention for the knockout stages in Sydney.

Earlier, emerging 21-year-old Casper Ruud continued his giant-killing run with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over world number 12 Fabio Fognini on Sunday, before Italy recovered to down Norway.

Ruud levelled the Group D tie in Perth in just 66 minutes and then backed up alongside Viktor Durasovic in the deciding doubles only to be thwarted by Fognini and Simone Bolelli, who prevailed 6-3, 7-6(3).

Italy joins surprise packet Norway with a 1-1 record so far after being swept by Russia in its opening tie on Friday.

Ruud, whose father Christian is Norway’s captain, has led his team’s surprising run, starting the season spectacularly after upsetting not only Fognini but big-serving American John Isner in his first wins over top-20 players.

Great for confidence

“I’m very happy to beat my highest ranked player ever,” he said of Fognini.

“Coming out here and beating two top 20 players at the beginning of the year is great for my confidence.”

The world number 54 was in imperious form with an array of pinpoint shots on the baseline rattling a frustrated Fognini, who badly miscued several forehands.

Ruud broke twice to draw first blood and his accurate serving gave little chance of inroads for the Italian. He broke in the sixth game of the second set to grab a stranglehold en route to his second straight upset.

In the earlier singles match, Stefano Travaglia notched his first win of the season after comfortably beating Durasovic 6-1, 6-1 in 56 minutes.

Misfiring

The world number 84 took advantage of a misfiring Durasovic, who had 16 unforced errors in a horror first set. The one-sided contest continued with Travaglia giving Italy its first taste of victory.

The 28-year-old is representing Italy for the first time after replacing world number eight Matteo Berrettini, who withdrew from the tournament with an abdominal injury.

“It’s very important for me to play for Italy,” Travaglia said. “I tried to play every point at my best and I think I did it.”

Durasovic, ranked 332, has not won a set from two matches after winning just four games against American Taylor Fritz in his opener.

The results: In Sydney: Group C: Bulgaria 2 beat Moldova 1 {Dimitar Kuzmanov bt Alexander Cozbinov 6-1, 7-5; Grigor Dimitrov bt Radu Albot 6-2, 6-3; Dimitrov & Alexandar Lazarov lost to Albot & Cozbinov 6-4, 7-6(4)}.

44,2020/01/05,Near-death experience gives Naomi Osaka new perspective,"A “near-death” experience off the coast of the Turks and Caicos Islands has given reigning Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka a new perspective heading into the 2020 season.

An upbeat Osaka told reporters ahead of the season-opening Brisbane International that she had tried to have a bit of fun and experience new things during the off-season, which meant her “first vacation ever“.

“It was really fun — my sister was there. She made me paddleboard, and then the current took us and I almost died,” a smiling Osaka said.

Osaka said she and her sister had been in shallow waters but she noticed a current had taken them away from the shore.

Can’t swim well

“I’m like, how far out are you trying to take us, because it’s black, like, the water is black now, and the house is like a tiny dot, and I can’t really swim that well,” she said.

“I just feel like I’m experiencing so many things in my life and everything’s really fun and I’m trying to take it all into... perspective that these are things that I’ve never thought I was going to be able to do.”

...Osaka, 22, burst onto the scene in 2018 when she beat Serena Williams to win the US Open, then followed that up by winning the 2019 Australian Open.

The Japanese star reached World No. 1 ranking in 2019 and finished the year at No. 3, behind Australia’s Ash Barty and Czech Karolina Pliskova.

Sore shoulder

She said a sore shoulder meant she had not spent as much time on the court in the off-season as in previous years.

“I didn’t play for most of November, which was a first for me,” she said.

“I’ve never really taken that long of a break before. But I think it was really necessary because my shoulder was kind of worn down.

“But after that, I just did rehab and slowly started playing again and I think that that worked out really well because I don’t feel anything in my shoulder, and I like to think that I’m playing well right now.”

45,2020/01/05,Djokovic concerned about smoke at Australian Open as bushfires continue to blaze,"Tennis world number two Novak Djokovic said he is concerned that smoke might cause some problems at the Australian Open later this month as bushfires continued to blaze across large sections of the southeast on Sunday.

Hundreds of fires in New South Wales and Victoria have killed at least 24 people and destroyed more than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of land over the last few months.

Smoke from the blazes has also resulted in hazardous conditions in Sydney, where the final rounds of the inaugural ATP Cup will take place next weekend, and Melbourne, where the year's first tennis Grand Slam gets underway on Jan. 20.

Seven-time Australian Open champion Djokovic, who is playing in the ATP Cup, said he hoped the crisis would “dissipate” soon but that an action plan would be needed to avoid any impact on the health of players if it did not.

“If it continues same way and if the quality of air is affected in Melbourne or Sydney, I think Tennis Australia probably will be forced to create some rules about it,” he told a Brisbane news conference in the early hours of Sunday morning.

“It's tough for them because ... there's a lot of different things involved. But health concern is a health concern for me and for anybody.”

Disruptions

The smoke has so far caused the most disruption to the sporting calendar in Canberra, where a Twenty20 cricket match was abandoned on Dec. 21 when conditions became too hazardous to continue.

An ATP Challenger/ITF Futures tennis tournament scheduled for next week in the capital was moved to Bendigo, while on Sunday the city's ACT Brumbies rugby team announced they would be moving their pre-season training camp to Newcastle.

The twice Super Rugby champions made the decision after their training ground at the University of Canberra was closed indefinitely “due to hazardous air quality”.

“The small changes we have had to make are nothing in comparison to the distressing position so many people in our region are sadly experiencing at the moment,” coach Dan McKellar said in a statement.

“Player welfare is always a priority and temporarily moving to Newcastle will allow us to continue to prepare for our round one match on January 31.”

The New Year's cricket Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, one of the biggest fixtures on the Australian sporting calendar, moved into its third day without disruption, although there was a distinct smell of smoke in the air on Sunday.

47,2020/01/05,Bangladesh orders arrest of 'fugitive' ex-chief justice,"An arrest warrant was issued against Bangladesh’s first Hindu chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha on charges of embezzling 40 million taka, court officials said on January 5.

Sinha, 68, who lives in the U.S., has been described as a “fugitive” by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in its charge-sheet. Judge K.M. Emrul Kayesh of Dhaka’s Senior Special Judges’ Court took cognizance of the graft charges brought against Sinha and 10 others by the ACC.

“The judge ordered his (Sinha’s) arrest along with 10 others as the ACC accused him of misappropriating and laundering about 4 crore taka ($471,993) in 2016,” public prosecutor Taposh Kumar Pal told reporters. The rest of the accused are former senior officials of Farmers Bank including its ex-managing director.

The ACC in its charge-sheet described all the 11 to be “fugitives”. It alleged that Sinha and 10 others embezzling 40 million taka from Farmers Bank, which was later renamed as Padma Bank Limited, Pal said.

The development came nearly three months after the ACC said it found evidence of fraud involving transactions of 40 million taka borrowed with fake documents by two businessmen from the bank while the amount was deposited in Sinha’s account.

Sinha, who is said to have sought asylum in the U.S., served as the 21st Chief Justice of Bangladesh from January, 2015 to November, 2017.

The case came days after Sinha’s newly-launched autobiography brought him in political spotlight over two years after he was forced to quit amid a row with the government.

The ACC earlier said if required it would quiz Sinha by bringing him back home but “interrogation is not a mandatory provision for investigations“.

In his autobiography “A Broken Dream: Rule of Law, Human Rights and Democracy”, Sinha said he was forced to resign in 2017 following intimidation and threats, drawing a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who accused some anti-government newspapers of backing him.

In a media interview after the book launch in Washington, Sinha urged India to support the rule of law and democracy in Bangladesh, calling the incumbent Awami League government as a “autocratic” one.

48,2020/01/05,Iraqi parliament passes resolution to end foreign troop presence,"Iraq's parliament called on Sunday for U.S. and other foreign military forces to leave amid a growing backlash against the U.S. killing of a top Iranian military commander that has heightened fears of a wider Middle East conflict.

In a war of words between Iran and the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would target any Iranian decision-makers it chose if there were further attacks on U.S. interests by Iranian forces or their proxies.

Qassem Soleimani was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport, an attack that took U.S.-Iranian hostilities into uncharted waters and stoked concern about a major conflagration.

As Washington and Tehran, longtime foes, assailed each other with threats and counter-threats, the European Union, Britain and Oman urged them to make diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.

The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling on the government to work to end all foreign troop presence, reflecting the concern of many in Iraq that the strike could engulf them in a major war between two bigger powers long at odds in Iraq and across the region.

“The Iraqi government must work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, air space or water for any reason,” it said.

Parliamentary resolutions, unlike laws, are non-binding to the government. But this one is likely to be heeded: Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who heads a Shi'ite-led government, had earlier called on parliament to end foreign troop presence as soon as possible.

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iranian-backed militia and U.S. troops fought side by side during Iraq's 2014-17 war against Islamic State militants, their common enemy. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed in Friday's strike.

Some 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, most in an advisory role.

The resolution was passed by overwhelmingly Shi'ite lawmakers, as the special session was boycotted by most Sunni Muslim and Kurdish lawmakers.

One Sunni member of parliament told Reuters that both groups feared that kicking out U.S.-led coalition forces would leave Iraq vulnerable to an insurgency, undermine security and heighten the power of Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias.

'Terrorist in a suit'

Earlier on Sunday, Iran lambasted Donald Trump after the U.S. president threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites hard if Tehran attacks Americans or U.S. assets in retaliation for Soleimani's death.

“Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat 'the Great Iranian Nation & Culture',” Information and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted.

Soleimani masterminded Irans clandestine and military operations abroad as head of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, creating an arc of Shi'ite power with the help of proxy militias confronting the regional might of United States and Israel.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised on Friday that Iran would seek harsh revenge for his death.

Hundreds of thousands of mourners, many chanting, beating their chests and wailing in grief, turned out across Iran to show their respects after Soleimani's body was returned home to a hero's welcome.

Pompeo rejected suggestions that the intelligence assessment that led to the strike on Soleimani was thin and said there was no doubt Iran had absorbed the message from Washington.

“The intelligence assessment made clear that no action - allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning, his terror campaign - created more risk than taking the action that we took last week,” he said on ABC's “This Week” show.

Democratic critics of the Republican president have called the strike that Trump authorised reckless, saying it risked more bloodshed in a dangerous region.

The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said on ABC's ”This Week”: “We do not need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.”

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's powerful, Iran-allied Hezbollah movement, said the U.S. military in the Middle East would pay the price for Soleimani'S death and U.S. soldiers and officers would return home in coffins.

Hezbollah has had numerous conflicts with U.S. ally Israel, including a month-long war in 2006.

Heightened fears of war drove Gulf stocks sharply lower on Sunday.

Iranian targets

Trump tweeted on Saturday that Iran “is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets”.

He said the United States has “targeted 52 Iranian sites”, some “at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD”.

In remarks to Fox News on Sunday, Pompeo said Trump had not threatened to target Iranian cultural sites.

Iran summoned the Swiss envoy representing U.S. interests in Tehran on Sunday to protest at “Trump's hostile remarks”, according to Iranian state television.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Iran's foreign minister by phone to work to de-escalate the situation and invited him to Brussels to discuss ways of preserving world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

It was Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran that touched off a new spiral of tensions after a brief thaw following the accord.

Iran will decide on Sunday about its next step to further roll back its commitments to the nuclear containment deal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying.

The exchanges were a part of the international consultations among various stakeholders that began soon after Iran's Major General Qassem Soleimani was killed in an American drone attack in Baghdad.

""Just concluded a conversation with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif of Iran. Noted that developments have taken a very serious turn. India remains deeply concerned about the levels of tension. We agreed to remain in touch,"" said the Indian minister in a social media message.

Sunday's exchanges were the first since Maj. Gen Soleimani was assassinated on January 3. Hours after the assassination, India had described the slain military figure as a ""senior Iranian leader"" saying peace, stability and security in the Gulf as of ""utmost importance"" to the country. The Indian position is borne out of the fact that the Gulf region hosts nearly seven million Indian citizens who constitute one of the largest foreign work force in the region. That apart India is also partnering the port of Chabahar in Iran that will be used to connect India with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Any conflict with Iran will adversely affect India's investments in Chahbahar.

Late on Sunday evening, Mr Jaishankar sent out a series of social media messages informing that he had telephonic conversation also with the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Oman's foreign minister Yusuf Alawi, and Abdullah Bin Zayed of UAE. ""Had a telephonic discussion with Secretary of State Pompeo on the evolving situation in the Gulf region. Highlighted India's stakes and concerns,"" said the Indian minister in his message.

The US Secretary of State however indicated that he presented the American side of the narrative saying, ""Dr S Jaishankar and I spoke... regarding Iran's continued threats and provocations. The Trump Administration won't hesitate to act to keep American lives, and those of our friends and allies, safe."" An official source acknowledged the divergence in Indian and American ways of thinking regarding Iran and said, ""both may have shared their perspective on the situation.""

Mr Zarif and Mr Jaishankar met in Tehran on December 22 for the 19th India-Iran joint commission meeting during which both sides agreed on accelerating cooperation to complete the infrastructure projects in Chabahar. There has been some speculation among India's diplomacy watchers as the leading US figures did not consult

India immediately after the operation in Baghdad. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan army, and several other global figures before the discussion with his Indian counterpart on Sunday.

President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 agreement between Tehran and six major powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran that have crippled its economy. Hostilities between the countries escalated sharply after Friday's U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that killed Soleimani.

As the two countries assailed each other in a war of words, the European Union, Britain and Oman urged the parties to seek to de-escalate the crisis.

Soleimani, Iran's pre-eminent military commander, was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport, an attack that took long-running hostilities between Washington and Tehran into uncharted territory and raised the spectre of wider conflict in the Middle East.

“Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ‘the Great Iranian Nation & Culture’,” Information and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted.

Soleimani was the architect of Tehran’s overseas clandestine and military operations as head of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised on Friday that Iran would seek harsh revenge for his death.

Mr. Trump responded to that and other strong words from Tehran with a series of tweets on Saturday, saying Iran “is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets”.

Iraqi lawmakers want U.S. forces out

In Iraq, many people including opponents of Soleimani have expressed anger at Washington for killing him and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis on Iraqi soil and potentially dragging their country into another war.

Lawmakers planned a special parliamentary session on Sunday to push for a vote on a resolution requiring the government to ask Washington to withdraw U.S. troops from the country.

“There is no need for the presence of American forces after defeating Daesh [Islamic State)]. We have our own armed forces which are capable of protecting the country,” said Ammar al-Shibli, a member of Parliament’s legal committee.

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militia and U.S. troops fought side by side during Iraq’s 2014-2017 war against Islamic State militants.

The militia were incorporated into government forces under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilisation Forces led by Mr. Muhandis. Some 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, most in an advisory role.

Iran's army chief, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, was quoted by state television on Sunday as saying the United States lacked the courage for military confrontation with Iran.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

According to media reports, a violent mob had attacked the Gurdwara and pelted it with stones on Friday. A team of police had to intervene briskly to control the situation.

Breaking his silence on the incident, Mr. Khan said that there is a “major difference between the condemnable Nankana incident and the ongoing attacks across India on Muslims and other minorities”.

“The former is against my vision & will find zero tolerance & protection from the govt incl police & judiciary (sic),” he tweeted, referring to the Nankana Sahib incident.

Mr. Khan claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “vision supports minorities oppression and the targeted attacks against Muslims.”

He also alleged that the Indian police, supported by the government, are leading attacks against Muslims.

India has strongly condemned vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

54,2020/01/05,Australia’s ‘insurance’ koala population halved by bushfires,"At least half of Australia’s only disease-free koala population, a key “insurance” for the species’ future, is feared dead with more badly hurt after bushfires swept through an island sanctuary, rescuers said on Sunday.

Kangaroo Island, a popular nature-based tourist attraction off the coast of South Australia state, is home to many wild populations of native animals including the much-loved koala, where the populated was estimated at 50,000.

Massive bushfires have flared up in the vast country’s southeast in a months-long crisis, killing nearly half a billion native animals in New South Wales state alone, scientists estimate.

Conditions have been particularly severe in recent days, with an ongoing blaze on Kangaroo Island spreading rapidly and razing 170,000 hectares — one-third of the island — on Friday.

“Over 50% (of the population) has been lost,” Sam Mitchell of Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, which is raising funds to care for the injured koalas, told AFP.

“Injuries are extreme. Others have been left with no habitat to go back to, so starvation will be an issue in coming weeks.” A University of Adelaide study published in July found that the Kangaroo Island koala species is particularly important to the survival of the wider population as it is the only large group free from chlamydia.

The bacterial infection — which causes blindness, infertility and death in the species — is widespread in koalas in the eastern Queensland and New South Wales states and also occurs in Victoria state.

“They are an insurance population for the whole population,” the University of Adelaide’s Jessica Fabijan, who carried out the study, told AFP. “These fires have ravaged the population.” Ms. Fabijan said massive bushfires in New South Wales and Victoria’s Gippsland region, home to major koala populations, is also expected to have killed many animals.

“It’s one of the biggest tragedies for the population since the late 1800s when they used to hunt them for their fur,” she added.

Habitat loss, dog attacks, car strikes and climate change have already led to a sharp decline in the furry marsupial’s population, which is believed to have numbered more than 10 million prior to European settlement of the continent in 1788.

The koalas cannot be removed from the island due to their chlamydia-free status, the state government said, adding that veterinarians were rescuing and treating the injured animals on-site.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d56m0w/article30484075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TOPSHOT-AUSTRALIA-FIRE-ANIMAL-KOALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australias-insurance-koala-population-halved-by-bushfires/article30484076.ece

Major General Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a U.S. drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Soleimani’s killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US.

“They (Iran) attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” Mr. Trump said in a past-mid night tweet amidst remarks of retaliation coming from Tehran.

“The US just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!” he said in another tweet.

This was Mr. Trump’s second threat to Iran in less than 10 hours.

On Saturday night, Trump warned that the U.S. will target 52 sites in Iran some of which are “at a very high level and important to Iran if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.

“Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters, he tweeted.

56,2020/01/05,Al-Shabaab militants attack US-Kenya military base: govt official,"Jihadists from Somalia’s Al-Shabaab group on Sunday attacked a military base used by U.S. and Kenyan forces in Kenya’s coastal Lamu region, a government official said.

“There was an attack but they have been repulsed,” Lamu Commissioner Irungu Macharia told AFP.

He said the attack took place before dawn at the base known as Camp Simba, and that “a security operation is ongoing”, without saying if there had been casualties.

“We are not sure if there are still remnants within,” he said.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying they had “successfully stormed the heavily fortified military base and have now taken effective control of part of the base.” The group said there had been both Kenyan and American casualties, however this could not be immediately verified.

Al-Shabaab said the attack was part of its “Al-Quds (Jerusalem) shall never be Judaized” campaign - a term it first used during an attack on the upscale Dusit hotel complex in Nairobi in January last year that left 21 people dead.

The Somali jihadists have staged several large-scale attacks inside Kenya, in retaliation for Nairobi sending troops into Somalia in 2011 to fight the group, as well as to target foreign interests.

Despite years of costly efforts to fight Al-Shabaab, the group on December 28 managed to detonate a vehicle packed with explosives in Mogadishu, killing 81 people.

The spate of attacks highlight the group’s resilience and capacity to inflict mass casualties at home and in the region, despite losing control of major urban areas in Somalia.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article18868610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOMALIAUSMILITARYDEATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/al-shabaab-militants-attack-us-kenya-military-base-govt-official/article30483990.ece
57,2020/01/05,Indian-Americans in Chicago hold rally in support of CAA,"Braving sub-zero temperature, more than 300 Indian-Americans held a rally in support of the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act or CAA in downtown Chicago on Saturday.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

“A freezing temp of -1C was not able to dampen the gathering of more than 300 Indian diaspora. They came with colourful and meaningful placards, slogans, banners and flags of USA and India. Their message was loud and clear,” said Indian American Dr Bharat Barai, one of the organisers of the rally.

The participants signed a memorandum supporting the CAA and thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the humanitarian help to religiously persecuted minorities in three neighbouring countries. The memorandum was forwarded to the Government of India through the Consul General of India in Chicago.

58,2020/01/05,"Cambodia building collapse kills 36 people, injures 23 others","Thirty-six people were killed and 23 more injured when a tourist guesthouse under construction in Cambodia collapsed, trapping workers under rubble, officials said on Sunday.

Officials said rescue operations ended two days after the seven-storey concrete building collapsed on Friday in the coastal town of Kep, about 160 km southwest of the capital Phnom Penh.

The 36 dead included six children and 14 women, officials said in a statement that did not detail why children were at the construction site.

Kep Governor Ken Satha said that the owners of the building, a Cambodian couple, had been detained for questioning.

However, Prime Minister Hun Sen defended the government response and said that no officials in Kep province would be fired.

“Building collapses don't only happen in Cambodia ... they happen elsewhere ... including in the United States,” Mr. Hun Sen said in a news briefing.

Cambodia is undergoing a construction boom to serve growing crowds of Chinese tourists and investors.

The Kep building collapse came six months after 28 people were killed when a Chinese-owned construction site collapsed in Preah Sihanouk province.

59,2020/01/05,Qassem Soleimani's body returned to Iran,"The body of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in Iraq in a U.S. military strike, was returned to Iran on Sunday, the official IRIB news agency reported.

Soleimani's body was flown to the city of Ahvaz in southwest Iran.

IRIB posted a video clip of a casket wrapped in an Iranian flag being unloaded from a plane as a military band played.

Thousands of mourners dressed in black marched through Ahvaz, in live footage aired on state TV.

Soleimani, the architect of Tehran's overseas clandestine and military operations as head of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport.

Explained: Is West Asia headed for war?

While many Iranians have rallied in recent days to show grief over the death of Soleimani, regarded as the countrys second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, others worry his death might push the country to war with a superpower.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites very hard if Iran attacks Americans or U.S. assets.

60,2020/01/05,Austria's foreign ministry says facing 'serious cyber attack',"Austria's foreign ministry is facing a “serious cyber attack”, it said late Saturday, warning another country could be responsible.

“Due to the gravity and nature of the attack, it cannot be excluded that it is a targeted attack by a state actor,” it said in a statement with the interior ministry shortly before 11.00 p.m. (2200 GMT), adding that the attack was ongoing.

“In the past, other European countries have been the target of similar attacks,” it continued.

Immediate measures had been taken and a “coordination committee” set up, it said, without elaborating.

The attack came as Austria's Greens on Saturday gave the go-ahead to a coalition with the country's conservatives at a party congress in Salzburg, removing the last obstacle to the unprecedented alliance.

The German government's IT network in 2018 was hit by a cyberattack.

61,2020/01/05,China replaces head of Hong Kong liaison office amid ongoing protests,"China has replaced the head of its Hong Kong Liaison Office, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, following more than six months of often-violent anti-government protests in the city.

Wang Zhimin, who had held the post since 2017, had been replaced by 65-year-old Luo Huining, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said on its website late on Saturday. Until November, Luo was the top official of China's ruling Communist Party in the northern province of Shanxi.

Reuters reported exclusively in November that Beijing was considering potential replacements for Wang, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office's handling of the crisis, the worst since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Saturday's statement gave no other details on the change.

Mr. Luo, a loyalist of President Xi Jinping, has not previously held any Hong Kong-related position and is at the age when top Chinese officials typically retire. In Shanxi, he had been tasked with cleaning up a graft-ridden, coal-rich region where corruption was once likened to cancer.

The Liaison Office, which reports to China's State Council, serves as the platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city, and has come in for criticism in Hong Kong and mainland China for misjudging the situation in the city.

Shortest serving Liaison office director

Mr.Wang is the shortest serving Liaison office director since 1997.

Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it had been only a matter of time before Beijing made Hong Kong-related personnel changes, and that the switch did not necessarily indicate a change in policy.

“Beijing is having trouble devising new policy in Hong Kong,” Mr. Ma said.

“Given his age it is possible he is only a stop-gap appointment,” Mr. Ma said of Mr. Luo.

Johnny Lau, a political scientist and commentator, said Mr. Wang's exit was unlikely to placate Hong Kong protesters who have demanded that the city's leader, Carrie Lam, step down.

Writing in the Communist Party's official People's Daily in 2017, Mr. Luo said Shanxi province had been ardently following instructions from Mr. Xi to clean up the mess there.

“All the province's people have deeply felt that the all-out efforts to enforce party discipline have been like spring rain washing away the smog,” Luo wrote.

Before moving to Shanxi, Mr. Luo had been the top party official in the western province of Qinghai.

“Shanxi has gone from being a victim of a regression in its political environment to being a beneficiary of all-out efforts to enforce party discipline,” he wrote in 2017.

'Staunch support'

Mass protests erupted in June in Hong Kong over an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the Communist Party.

Though the bill was withdrawn, protests have continued over a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in city affairs and complaints of police brutality.

Ms. Lam said in a statement on Saturday that the Liaison Office would continue under Mr. Luo's leadership to work with the Hong Kong government for the “positive development” of the relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong.

She added that Mr. Luo's predecessor had provided “staunch support” to the Hong Kong government's efforts to curb violence and uphold the rule of law during the unrest of recent months.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/kqfan9/article30458455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02APHONGKONGPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-replaces-head-of-hong-kong-liaison-office-amid-ongoing-protests/article30483773.ece
62,2020/01/05,Israeli settlement activity in Palestine up 70% in 2019,"The Israeli settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories increased by 70 per cent in 2019, according to a report issued here.

Israel announced tenders to build around 10,000 new settlement units in 2019, compared to 6,800 in 2018, Xinhua news agency reported citing the Palestine Liberation Organization report as saying on Saturday.

Israel has demolished 617 homes that belong to Palestinians, displacing at least 898 citizens, according to the report.

“The anti-Palestinian policies of the U.S. government have encouraged Israel and settlement organizations to escalate their attacks on the West Bank and East Jerusalem,” it noted.

Such moves come behind Israeli government’s intentions to impose sovereignty over the Jordan Valley that takes up around one third of the West Bank to seek electoral gains, the report warned.

The Israeli settlement activity is considered illegal under international law and has been one of the major hurdles to the stalled peace talks between Palestine and Israel since 2014.

63,2020/01/05,Virtual martial law in Pakistan: dissidents,"Noting that the space for debate in their country is shrinking, several prominent Pakistani dissidents currently living in various countries have gathered here at a conference to discuss ways of ensuring greater support for pluralist ideas, human rights, and democracy in Pakistan.

The two-day conference was opened by former Pakistan ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani and will end on Sunday with an event, a statement said.

Several participants including liberals and Baloch, Sindhi, Pashtun, and Seraiki described the situation in Pakistan as one of “virtual martial law.”

Mr. Haqqani in his opening address said Pakistan’s democrats also cannot ignore human rights violations in neighbouring countries.

Attended by scholars, journalists, bloggers and social media activists, many of whom now live in exile, the conference is the fourth to be organised by South Asians Against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH), a group of prodemocracy Pakistanis and is co-hosted by Haqqani and US-based columnist Mohammad Taqi.

This year, the conference size was scaled down as many of the forum’s Pakistani participants were “intimidated or barred from participating,” the statement said.

The prominent participants included former Senator Afrasiab Khattak, former Ambassador Kamran Shafi, former editor of Daily Times Rashed Rahman, journalists Taha Siddiqui, Gul Bukhari and Marvi Sirmed and activist Gulalai Ismail.

64,2020/01/05,Australian firefighters get brief reprieve as death toll rises,"Fire threats eased in parts of southeastern Australia on Sunday after a horror day of blazes that killed one man and injured four firefighters, but authorities warned several fires were still burning at emergency levels and hot weather was set to return.

As the immediate danger passed and cooler weather tempered the intensity of many fires, authorities began assessing the damage from Saturday's wildfires that swept across eastern Victoria and southern New South Wales (NSW) states.

Tens of thousands of homes were without power on Sunday as a large-scale military and police effort continued to provide supplies and evacuate people who have been trapped for days by the fires in coastal towns.

Initial estimates put damaged or destroyed properties in the hundreds, but authorities said mass evacuations by residents of at-risk areas appear to have prevented major loss of life.

“It was an awful day yesterday. It was a very difficult day yesterday,” NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said on Sunday.

A southerly wind late on Saturday helped bring temperatures down from highs above 40 C (104F) and light rain was forecast in some coastal areas in coming days, but officials said that would not be enough to bring the almost 200 fires still burning under control.

Fitzsimmons said the next major flashpoint would come later in the week, but it was too early to gauge the likely severity of the threat.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the immediate focus was on helping people who had lost their homes as well containing the fires still burning.

“The weather activity we're seeing, the extent and spread of the fires, the speed at which they're going, the way in which they are attacking communities who have never ever seen fire before is unprecedented,” Berejiklian said.

Australia has been battling blazes across much of its east coast for months, with experts saying climate change has been a major factor in a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and susceptible to fires.

Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:

* The death of a 47-year old man who was defending a friend's rural property in NSW took the national toll this season to 24.

* In the Southern Highlands region south of Sydney, a new fire was burning out of control after the winds helped drive an existing blaze to jump the Shoalhaven and Kangaroo rivers.

* Another fire near the southern coastal town of Eden was at Emergency level, and the ABC reported police have warned people should leave for evacuation centres.

* Five fires in Victoria had Evacuate Now or Emergency Level warnings.

* NSW Premier Berejiklian says there is no one unaccounted for in NSW; Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews says six people remain unaccounted for in Victoria.

* The federal government has announced an unprecedented call up of army reservists to support firefighters as well other resources including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief.

* RFS Commissioner Fitzsimmons criticised the government for not informing him of its policy proposal, saying he found out about it from the media and it created confusion on one of the busiest days ever for fighting fires. “I was disappointed and I was frustrated in the middle of what was one of our worst days ever on record with massive dislocation and movement of people and a focus on really difficult weather,” Fitzsimmons said.

* Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced criticism for a video he posted on social media outlining how the government is tackling the fires. Morrison has been under sustained attack handling of the crisis after he jetted out for a family holiday in Hawaii. He apologised and returned early but was heckled and snubbed when he toured fire-hit regions in recent days.

* More than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of land has been burnt this fire season.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c9odu9/article30483452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAWILDFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-firefighters-get-brief-reprieve-as-death-toll-rises/article30483453.ece
65,2020/01/05,At least 30 killed in attack on military camp in Libya’s capital,"At least 30 people were killed and 33 others wounded in an attack on a military academy in the Libyan capital late on Saturday, the Health Ministry of the Tripoli-based government said in a statement on Sunday.

Tripoli, controlled by the internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), is facing an offensive by military commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) that began in April.

There has been an increase in air strikes and shelling around Tripoli in recent weeks, with fears that fighting could escalate further after Turkeys Parliament voted to allow a troop deployment in support of the GNA.

Forces allied with the GNA described Saturdays attack on the military camp at Al-Hadhba as “an aerial bombing” launched by their eastern rivals. An LNA spokesman denied involvement.

GNA Health Minister Hamid bin Omar told Reuters earlier in a phone call that the number of dead and wounded was still rising. Tripoli ambulance service spokesman Osama Ali said some body parts could not be immediately counted by forensic experts.

Earlier, the ambulance service appealed for a temporary ceasefire to allow its crews to retrieve the bodies of five civilians killed on As Sidra Road in southern Tripoli and to evacuate families.

Emergency teams withdrew after coming under fire while trying to access the area on Saturday, it said.

The GNA Foreign Ministry called for referring Mr. Haftar and his aides to the International Criminal Court on charges of committing “crimes against humanity”, adding that it will call for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the alleged crimes.

Qatar, which supports GNA, said on Saturday that the attack ”may amount to a war crime and crimes against humanity”.

Ankara, which last week passed a Bill approving a troop deployment in Libya to support Tripoli, also condemned the attack and said the international community needs to take steps to achieve a ceasefire.

“It is crucial for the international community to urgently take necessary steps to halt external support for the pro-Haftar army and its attacks and establish a ceasefire in Libya,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned the attack saying that “rising escalation... further complicates the situation in Libya and threatens the chances of returning to the political process”.

In response to the attack, GNA allied forces have targeted the LNA air base of Al-Wattia in an air strike, around 159 km southwest of Tripoli, a spokesman said in a statement.

Two sources in Haftar forces said four fighters were killed in a drone strike early on Sunday.

An increase in air strikes and shelling in and around Tripoli has caused the deaths of at least 11 civilians since early December and shut down health facilities and schools, the U.N. mission in Libya said on Friday.

Rockets and shelling also shut down Tripoli's only functioning airport on Friday.

On Friday, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire in Libya.

He warned that the delivery of foreign support to warring parties would “only deepen the ongoing conflict and further complicate efforts to reach a peaceful and comprehensive political solution”.

The Parliament which moved to the east in 2014 voted to provide Mr. Haftar with emergency funding on Saturday.

The pro-Haftar chamber also held a series of symbolic votes against the GNA and Turkey, which struck two pacts on maritime boundaries and military cooperation in November.

Saudi Arabia condemns Turkish escalation in Libya

Saudi Arabia condemns “the recent Turkish escalation in Libya” and the Turkish parliament's approval of a troop deployment to Libya, and considers it a violation of U.N. Security Council decisions, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on the state news agency SPA.

The statement added that “the kingdom affirms that this Turkish escalation poses a threat to the security and stability in Libya and a threat to Arab and regional security, as it is an interference in the internal affairs of an Arab country in flagrant violation of international principles and covenants.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6htzqr/article30483430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/libyajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/many-killed-in-attack-on-military-camp-in-libyas-tripoli/article30483429.ece
66,2020/01/05,Pompeo decries pro-Iran factions warning to Iraqi troops,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hit back at a hardline pro-Iran faction in Iraq, after it urged Iraqis to move away from US forces.

The warning from Kataeb Hezbollah came as tens of thousands mourned Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani, whose death in a US strike early Friday brought vows of “severe revenge” from Tehran.

Kataeb Hezbollah’s “thugs are telling Iraqi security forces to abandon their duty to protect (the US embassy in Baghdad) and other locations where Americans work side by side with good Iraqi people,” Mr. Pompeo tweeted.

“The Iranian regime telling Iraq’s government what to do puts Iraqi patriots’ lives at risk. The Iraqi people want out from under the Iranian yoke; indeed, they recently burned an Iranian consulate to the ground,” he wrote, referencing the November sacking of the Iranian consulate in the southern city of Najaf by a protest movement angry at the government and its backers in Iran.

Tens of thousands of Iraqis including Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, political leaders and clerics attended a mass ceremony on Saturday to honor Soleimani, who died in a precision drone strike on Baghdad international airport that killed a total of five Iranian Revolutionary Guards and five members of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi military network.

In its message, Kataeb Hezbollah, a faction of Hashed said, “We ask security forces in the country to get at least 1,000 metres away from US bases starting on Sunday at 5:00pm (1930 IST).” The group’s deadline would coincide with a parliament session on Sunday which the Hashed has insisted should see a vote on the ouster of U.S. troops.

In the first hints of a possible retaliatory response, two mortar rounds hit an area near the US embassy in Baghdad on Saturday, while almost simultaneously two rockets slammed into the Al-Balad airbase where American troops are deployed, security sources told AFP.

In a tweet defending Friday's drone strike assassination of a top Iranian general in Iraq, Mr. Trump said 52 represents the number of Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for more than a year starting in late 1979.

Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently.... — Donald J.

Mr. Trump said some of these sites are “at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!”

Mr. Trump took to Twitter after pro-Iran factions ramped up pressure on U.S. installations across Iraq with missiles and warnings to Iraqi troops — part of an outburst of fury over the killing of Soleimani, described as the second most-powerful man in Iran.

The attack has prompted fears of a major conflagration in the Middle East.

In the first hints of a possible retaliatory response, two mortar rounds hit an area near the US embassy in Baghdad on Saturday, security sources told AFP.

Almost simultaneously, two rockets slammed into the Al-Balad airbase where American troops are deployed, security sources said.

The Iraqi military confirmed the missile attacks in Baghdad and on al-Balad and said there were no casualties. The U.S. military also said no coalition troops were hurt.

68,2020/01/05,Protesters in US rally against prospect of war with Iran,"Demonstrators chanting “no war on Iran” rallied Saturday in Washington, New York and across the U.S. to protest the assassination of a top Iranian military commander in a U.S. drone strike.

Outside the White House, around 200 people gathered as part of a wave of rallies called by left-leaning organizations. They chanted slogans including “No Justice, No Peace, U.S. out of the Middle East.”

Organizers said demonstrations were convened in some 70 US cities to denounce the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani early Friday in Baghdad on orders from President Donald Trump. The attack has prompted fears of a major conflagration in the Middle East.

“We will not allow our country to be led into another reckless war,” one speaker outside the White House said.

The protesters later headed toward the Trump International Hotel, which is just down the street from the presidential mansion.

“Need a distraction? Start of a war,” read a sign held by Sam Crook, 66.

Trump faces a looming trial in the Senate following his impeachment by the House of Representatives in the Ukraine scandal.

Mr. Crook described himself as concerned.

“This country is in the grip of somebody who’s mentally unstable, I mean Donald Trump, that is. He’s not right in the head,” Crook told AFP.

“He’s crazy, and has a childish reaction to everything. And I’m afraid he’s going to inadvertently — he doesn’t really want to, I think — but I think he could easily start some sort of a real conflagration in the Middle East,” Mr. Crook added.

Shirin, a 31-year-old Iranian-American who would not give her last name, said she was worried about the possibility of war with Iran, which has vowed revenge for the death of Soleimani.

“We already spent trillions of dollars fighting unjust wars in Iraq and, you know, the longest war today in Afghanistan. And what do we have to show for it?” she said.

She argued that the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq caused instability throughout the region and strengthened Iran, “which is now, you know, a major political, social and cultural force in Iraq.”

At Times Square in New York, demonstrators marched with signs crying out against the prospect of war with Iran and calling for the withdrawal of the 5,000-odd U.S. troops in Iraq.

“War is not a re-election strategy,” read one sign in that procession.

Demonstrators also marched in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/protesters-in-us-rally-against-prospect-of-war-with-iran/article30483165.ece
69,2020/01/05,Pro-Iran faction urges Iraqi troops ‘get away’ from US forces in bases,"Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline pro-Iran faction in Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi military network, warned Iraqi troops to keep their distance from US forces at military bases.

“We ask security forces in the country to get at least 1,000 metres away from U.S. bases starting on Sunday at 5:00pm (1930 IST),” said the group.

The vehemently anti-American group’s statement came after mortars and rockets hit near the U.S. embassy and a base where U.S. troops are stationed.

Mortar rounds hit an area near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on Saturday evening, security sources told AFP.

Moments later, two rockets slammed into an Iraqi base where American troops are deployed, security sources said.

The Iraqi military confirmed the missile attacks in Baghdad and on Balad base and said there were no casualties.

Planes from the U.S.-led coalition were heard circulating above their bases in Kirkuk province, AFP’s correspondent there said.

A U.S. defence official said the coalition’s surveillance capabilities had been redirected away from the Islamic State group to focus on possible new rocket attacks.

The missile attacks appeared to be the first hints of a retaliatory response to the killing by the U.S. of a top Iranian general near Baghdad airport on Friday.

Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani was killed alongside a top Iraqi paramilitary commander in the U.S. drone attack, which was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Tehran and Washington.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pro-iran-faction-urges-iraqi-troops-get-away-from-us-forces-in-bases/article30482109.ece
70,2020/01/05,Explained: Is West Asia headed for war?,"The story so far: Relations between the United States and Iran hit a dangerous new low on Friday, January 3, 2020, when Major Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian commander, was killed in a U.S. air strike outside Baghdad airport. Gen. Soleimani, who the U.S. held responsible for the deaths of scores of American soldiers in Iraq, was the commander of the Qods Force, the external intelligence and security unit of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). A furious Iran has now vowed a forceful revenge for the killing, raising the risks of a direct war between the U.S. and Iran to an all-time high.

Why did the U.S. launch the drone attack?

As the main architect of Iran’s foreign operations, Gen. Soleimani has been in the cross hairs of the U.S. for years. Ever since he took over the Qods Force in 1998, he expanded the operations of the unit, by deepening Iran’s links with its proxy groups such as Hezbollah and the Badr Organisation, or building new militias such as the Shia Popular Mobilization Units and Houthis. As a leading figure of the Iranian regime, he was seen in public quite often, either attending events in Iran or on the front lines of Iraq or Syria. Attacking him with high-precision air strikes was not an impossible option for the U.S., but U.S. President Donald Trump’s predecessors chose not to take that path as the risks outweighed possible benefits. Mr. Trump ordered the hit as tensions between the two countries were soaring, especially in Iraq.

The latest spell of the crisis was triggered after a rocket attack by Iran-trained Iraqi militias in which an American military contractor was killed in Iraq last month. In retaliation, the U.S. launched air strikes at Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, a Shia paramilitary group trained and funded by the Iranians, killing at least 25. This was followed by an attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday by protesters. The Trump administration held Iran responsible for the storming of the Embassy, and warned of serious repercussions. On Friday, in retaliation, Mr. Trump ordered the drone hit on Gen. Soleimani, who was practically the commander of the Kataib Hezbollah and other Shia militias operating in Iraq. U.S. officials also say that Iran proxies under Gen. Soleimani’s leadership were planning to carry out more attacks on U.S. interests in West Asia and that the assassination was carried out to deter them.

Why is the U.S. targeting Shia militias?

Also killed in Friday’s air strike was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella organisation of pro-Iran Iraqi militias in which Kataib Hezbollah is a member. The PMF was founded in 2014 under Gen. Soleimani’s supervision when Iran was trying to put together militias in Iraq and Syria in the wake of civil wars in both countries. Iran’s main goal was to save the embattled regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and defeat the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq, which was threatening the Baghdad government in 2014. The PMF is constituted of dozens of militias, including the Kataib Hezbollah, Badr Organisation and Kataib al-Imam Ali, through which Gen. Soleimani and Iran in general exercised enormous influence on Iraqi politics. The PMF played an instrumental role in defeating the IS. The militias fought alongside the Iraqi Army, with the U.S. providing air cover, and liberated Iraqi cities in the north and west from the clutches of the IS. But once the IS Caliphate was destroyed and tensions were on the rise between Iran and the U.S. after the U.S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, the PMF militias started targeting U.S. forces in Iraq.

In September, the U.S. State Department shut the consulate in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, citing “repeated incidents of fire from Iran-backed militias”. The decision followed a rocket attack on Basra airport close to where the consulate is located. As U.S.-Iran tensions soared in the wake of Washington doubling down sanctions on Iran, U.S. forces in Iraq came under several rocket attacks. The U.S. repeatedly blamed Iran-backed militias for the attacks. Unlike the previous attacks that did not have any American casualty, the rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk on December 28 killed an American civilian contractor, following which the U.S. launched the hit on Kataib Hezbollah.

What is Iraq’s position?

Iraq is caught between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S., since Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled, has been a major security partner of Iraq. At present, America has about 5,000 troops deployed in various parts of Iraq. On the other side, Iran is Iraq’s more powerful neighbour. Most Shia political parties and leaders in Iraq have deep, historical ties with the Iranian regime. Also, the Shia militias are a parallel military force; it takes its orders directly from Tehran rather than from Baghdad. Thus, Iraq cannot totally ignore Iran. The U.S.’s unilateral use of air power within Iraq targeting Iraqi militias without the permission of the government has upset Baghdad. The Iraqi government had strongly condemned the U.S. air strikes on Kataib Hezbollah; a huge crowd participated in the siege of the American Embassy. The assassination of Gen. Soleimani triggered instant street protests in Iraq, with protesters chanting “Death to America”.

It is a complex situation. The Iraqi government is being pushed to a point where it has to choose between Iran and the U.S. And given the intricacy of Iraq’s domestic power dynamics and the influence Iran wields over the Iraqi polity, Baghdad is unlikely to antagonise a wounded Tehran.

Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi has said Parliament will meet in the coming days to discuss “appropriate measures to preserve the dignity of Iraq and its security and sovereignty”. The question is whether the Iraqi government will ask the U.S. to leave the country. Already, calls are getting louder from the Iraqi political class to expel U.S. troops from the country.

So is war inevitable?

It depends on Iran’s response. After killing Gen. Soleimani, the U.S. has said it is committed to de-escalation. The U.S. is saying that it does not want the situation to spiral out of control. But for Iran, this is not just another attack. Gen. Soleimani was one of the top generals of the regime. Self-preservation or protecting the lives of the top leaders is the primary objective of any regime. A failure means a hole in its deterrence. If Iran’s deterrence capacity prevented previous American Presidents from taking such a step, Mr. Trump decided to ignore that, taking a huge risk. So it is upon Iran not only to take revenge for Gen. Soleimani’s death but also to bolster its deterrence. If not, there is no guarantee that the U.S. or Israel would not carry out attacks in the future, targeting other Iranian leaders. Iran cannot afford to take such a risk.

Iran has multiple options for retaliation. It can target U.S. troops in Iraq, either using mid-range rockets or ballistic missiles. Iran-backed proxies in the region, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the PMF in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen, can carry out attacks, targeting America’s allies and assets. The decision is up to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He could also wait for an appropriate time, plan and execute a surprise asymmetric attack — which is Iran’s main military response model — on the Americans in the region. The risk is that an Iranian attack could trigger a cycle of violence, with both sides targeting each other in West Asia. That is the path to war.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/699m3k/article30480578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THiStock-1007144846,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/is-west-asia-headed-for-war/article30480579.ece

72,2020/01/05,Annulling SEC appointment: Kiran Bedi’s order declared void by CM,"Clearing the ground for a major showdown between the Government and the Raj Nivas, Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has issued an order declaring as “illegal” and henceforth “null and void” a previous order of Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi annulling the appointment of State Election Commissioner T.M. Balakrishnan.

“The appointment of State Election Commissioner of Puducherry is an executive action but his removal can only be through a legislative action as referred in Article 243 K, 243 L & 243- ZB of the Constitution of India, Sec 9(A) of Puducherry Village and Commune Panchayat Act and 15 (A) of Puducherry Municipalities Act,” the order said.

The fresh order comes amid sharp differences between the Lt. Governor and the Chief Minister on the status of the SEC appointment and after a recent direction from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to appoint the SEC after “due process” and in a transparent manner.

While Ms. Bedi claimed that this was an endorsement of her order cancelling the appointment as the MHA had directed the Chief Secretary to select an officer by an open selection and not nomination as done by the Chief Minister, the Chief Minister had categorically ruled out any going back on the appointment as the MHA, in its order, has not cancelled the appointment.

“The incumbent SEC was appointed after the Speaker gave the right to the elected government to appoint the poll officer. MHA has not cancelled the appointment. Moreover, the MHA or Lieutenant Governor have no power to remove an SEC,” he had told a recent press meet.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/kcsjos/article30484707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Narayanasamy-Kiran,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/annulling-sec-appointment-kiran-bedis-order-declared-as-void-by-cm/article30484708.ece

A mobile paddy-processing machine developed by Sreejesh Ananganangadi of Ottappalam can steam, dry, and process paddy. This can be used in any season. As it is a mobile machine, it can be taken to the houses or farms of farmers. It can process around 600 kg paddy a day. Sreenesh is in an effort to make a solar-powered option for the machine.

Theme pavilion

Visitors to the VAIGA, exhibition and International workshop organised by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare with a theme ‘Sustainable growth through Agri-preneurship’, have been greeted with a snake boat filled with fruits, vegetables, and cash crops of the State. VAIGA theme pavilion, set up by Farm Information Bureau, also has a variety of value-added products.

Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) and its stations have set up a pavilion with 34 stalls in the exhibition. The themed display stalls are arranged crop/productwise and stationwise. Additionally, there are stalls for KAU products, where samples of unique value-added products are kept for display.

Five stalls exclusively for KAU RAFTAAR Agri Business Incubation (KAU- RABI) Centre function in the pavilion envisaging agribusiness incubation by utilising the incubation facilities and expertise already available with the Kerala Agricultural University.

Apart from these, exhibition and sales of agricultural products and value-added products from coconut, banana, millets, vegetables, flowers, spices, cocoa, medicinal plants, agricultural equipment, and machineries are also set up.

There is a separate stall for farmer-scientists interaction where the doubts of farmers are cleared by the scientists from the university. Stalls of KAU Intellectual Property Rights Cell (IPR Cell) and KAU publications are the other attractions.

As the State has declared its war against plastics, VAIGA has introduced various organic options for plastics. The stall set up by National Institute For Interdisciplinary Science and Technology is providing many alternatives for plastics, including products from wheat, coir, wood dust, and sugar cane.

They will provide technical support for those who want to start such units.

The Tamil Nadu Horticulture and Plantation Deportment has made a model of Red Fort with various spices. A mobile tomato soup unit by Indian Institute of Processing Technology, Thanjavur, supplies tomato soup for the visitors.

Ignorance about value added products leads to wastage of many agri products, they noted.

The mobile unit introduced by the Institute can process the excess produces at the farm itself. Farm produces including Tomato, green chilli, guava, papaya, plantain, and mango can be processed with the unit.

76,2020/01/05,Defining ‘new middle class’,"A new middle class has emerged throughout the world, which is unique in the sense that it is marked by the individual’s capacity to consume global iconic objects, renowned sociologist Jeffrey C. Alexander of the Yale University has said.

The new concept of this class is characterised not by its participation in the production process but by its capacity to consume. In short, new capitalism is characterised by producing those ‘gods’ that satisfy such identities, Prof. Alexander said. He was presenting a paper on ‘Iconic objects and the new middle class’ at the the valedictory session of golden jubilee celebrations of Department of Sociology, University of Kerala.

Fantasy world

Today, material objects have transformed into branded items. Capitalism has been successful in creating a fantasy world from the world of necessities and other related goods. Contemporary capitalism is theoretically based on consumption habits in that sense, according to him. Global iconic objects that give a status to its owner like Apple i-pads and Samsung Galaxy sets provide a sense of inclusion to its holders, he said.

78,2020/01/05,86-mld water treatment plant shut down in Aruvikkara,"The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) expects to switch on two new high-efficiency pumps at its 86-mld water treatment plant (WTP) in Aruvikkara after a 16-hour shutdown on Sunday morning, completing the second phase of a major renovation programme.

The KWA shut down the 86-mld WTP at 2 p.m. on Saturday to facilitate the replacement of old pumps with the new ones. With the plant down for repairs, the KWA had made arrangements for water supply through tankers and kiosks in city areas.

While the new pumps will be switched on by 6 a.m. on Sunday, water supply to the city is expected to return to normalcy by Monday morning, a KWA spokesperson said.

Water kiosks

The shutdown affected piped water supply to only the PH Division (North) of the KWA. More than 40 water kiosks, installed in various parts of the city, were filled to avert shortage. The new 631-HP and 770-HP pumps are being installed in the raw-water and clear-water facilities of the WTP. The second-phase works also include work on connecting the pumps to the electrical panel.

By Sunday morning, the government-run water utility expects to start raw-water and clear-water pumping using the new sets. Earlier, the raw-water and clear-water units had two pumps each, which are now being replaced with single pumps of higher efficiency.

In phase-I, the KWA had shut down the 86-mld as well as the 74-mld plants at Aruvikkara on December 13 and 14. Phase-III shutdown is set for January 11, when the 86-mld plant will be switched off for six hours. Phase-IV works are planned on February 1 when both the 86-mld and 74-mld plants will be shut down for 16 hours.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/9g2qe2/article30483786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvtvKWAWELDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/86-mld-water-treatment-plant-shut-down-in-aruvikkara/article30481644.ece

87,2020/01/05,"Soon, onus on flat dwellers to dispose of waste","In an effort to involve residents of the city in solid waste management, Tiruchi Corporation has decided to ask resident welfare associations of gated communities and apartments to set up facilities of their own for disposal.

The initiative, which is aimed at disposing the waste at source itself, is expected to be launched soon.

The Corporation, which has taken a number of initiatives to prevent dumping of waste at Ariyamangalam dump yard, estimates that the waste generated from apartments, gated communities and bulk waste generators constitute about 3% of the total waste generated in the city daily.

There are about 500 apartments and 10 gated communities spread across the city, but Srirangam, Cantonment, Thillai Nagar, Woraiyur, Kumaran Nagar and Ramalinga Nagar houses have more of these dwellings.

Under the existing system, apartment dwellers have to segregate waste into degradable and non-degradable and hand them over to garbage collectors appointed by the Corporation.

Under the new initiative, they will have to establish customised solid waste management facilities so as to dispose garbage at source from time of implementation of the new proposal.

“We have planned to ask the apartments and gated communities to set up solid waste management system, and have initiated the process of consulting all stakeholders,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu.

There are a number of avenues to dispose of waste at source. While non-degradable waste can be sent for recycling, degradable waste can be processed to produce organic manure, he said.

Bulk waste generators such as hotels, restaurants, hostels and marriage halls have already been asked to set up waste management system at their location. Some of them have already established such facilities. Similarly, apartments too can set up such facilities.

However, the Corporation is not in a hurry to implement the new proposal. The flat and gated community promoters can provide such facilities while constructing new flats.

It will help flat dwellers and office-bearers to imbibe the practice of managing waste at source, the civic chief added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/409c8j/article30483626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/soon-onus-on-flat-dwellers-to-dispose-of-waste/article30483627.ece
88,2020/01/05,Candidate demands recount of votes,"R. Saravanan, 37, a contestant in Marungulam village panchayat president (reserved) election on Saturday submitted a petition with Thanjavur Block Development Officer demanding recounting of votes.

Mr. Saravanan, who lost the election, was reportedly declared the winner initially but officials reversed the decision later.

Saravanan came to the BDO office along with district-level office bearers of Viduthalai Chiruthalai Katchi and submitted a memorandum to the BDO, S. Prabhakaran, seeking recounting of votes in the panchayat and claimed that the votes polled in his favour were declared invalid overlooking the directions of the State Election Commission.

The SEC had issued clearly that if any additional markings or ink impressions found on the ballot papers due to ink applied on the finger of the voter, such votes should not be categorised as invalid.

But the officials declared 116 votes as invalid out of which 42 ballots were stamped on the election symbol allotted to Saravanan.

“After counting was over, the officials said that I have won the contest by securing 853 votes, six more than my nearest rival. An hour later when I approached the officials to receive the election certificate I was informed that I have been defeated by the person who came second and the election certificate had been issued to him,” Mr. Saravanan said in the petition.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/candidate-demands-recount-of-votes/article30483642.ece
89,2020/01/05,Euro league | Espanyol holds 10-man Barcelona,"Barcelona was pegged back by La Liga’s bottom club Espanyol as Wu Lei struck late to secure a dramatic 2-2 draw in a thrilling Catalan derby.

Luis Suarez appeared to have inspired another turnaround at the RCDE Stadium on Saturday after he cancelled out David Lopez’s opener with a deft half-volley before digging out an exquisite pass for substitute Arturo Vidal to finish.

But a red card for Frenkie de Jong with 16 minutes left gave Espanyol renewed hope and Chinese forward Wu emerged the hero, firing past stand-in goalkeeper Neto to rescue a point in Abelardo Fernandez’s first game in charge.

Sending off

“De Jong’s sending off hurt us,” said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde.

“We could have scored a third and then in one play we conceded. We had the game under control. The red card unsettled us a little.”

Barcelona remains top of the table but only on goal difference, its two-point advantage removed after Real Madrid earlier clinched an impressive 3-0 win away at Getafe.

Atletico Madrid moved up to third after beating Levante 2-1.

Espanyol has not beaten its local rivals in the league since 2009 and is still four points from safety, yet this performance should do wonders for morale.

Rescue mission

It will be hoping for another rescue mission from new coach Abelardo, who took over Alaves with six points from 13 games in 2018 and led it to 14th.

“This can be a turning-point,” he said. “But we have to compete just like today because it won’t be easy.”

Barca now switches its attention to the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia next week, where a Clasico final awaits if Real Madrid beats Valencia in the last four and it can overcome Atletico.

But Valverde will have much to ponder after defensive problems again undermined his team against the league’s bluntest attack.

Impressive start

Real Madrid made a more impressive start to its year as it picked apart a robust Getafe side, even without the suspended Sergio Ramos and injured Eden Hazard.

Raphael Varane was the instigator of two goals at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, first pressuring Getafe’s David Soria into a missed punch and an own-goal, before himself heading home a cross from Toni Kroos.

Luka Modric added a third deep into injury-time after a brilliant first-time pass by Gareth Bale had set Madrid away on the counter-attack.

Thibaut Courtois appears finally to be finding his best form after a rocky start since his summer move from Chelsea, making three strong saves before Varane’s second gave Madrid breathing space.

Two in five

Atletico has struggled for goals this season but scored two in five minutes at the Wanda Metropolitano as Angel Correa converted Kieran Trippier’s cross in the 13th minute before Felipe Monteiro added a second in the 18th.

In between, Levante also equalised through Roger Marti and it might have snatched a point at the end only for Jan Oblak to produce a brilliant save to deny Enis Bardhi.

The results: Sunday: La Liga: Granada 1 (Montoro 24) bt Real Mallorca 0; Real Sociedad 1 (Willian Jose 22) lost to Villarreal 2 (Trigueros 58-pen, Cazorla 72).

Serie A: Brescia 1 (Balotelli 18) lost to Lazio 2 (Immobile 42-pen, 90+1).

La Liga: Saturday: Valencia 1 (Gomez 27) bt Eibar 0; Getafe 0 lost to Real Madrid 3 (Soria 34-og, Varane 53, Modric 90+6); Atletico Madrid 2 (Correa 13, Felipe 18) bt Levante 1 (Roger 16); Espanyol 2 (D. Lopez 23, Wu 88) drew with Barcelona 2 (Suarez 50, Vidal 59).

91,2020/01/05,I-League | Mohun Bagan in cruise control,"The stands were full and noisy, the queues outside the TRC Turf Ground stretching far and everyone waiting for Real Kashmir FC to get going on Sunday.

It never did. Barring a few isolated attempts at the goal and some desperate shooting and heading, the local favourite in its second home game appeared collectively off-colour against a better-prepared Mohun Bagan. It went down 2-0 for its first loss this year even as the visitor, after complaining about the conditions, the artificial turf and even the practice time, completed a dominant victory to top the I-League table with 10 points from five games.

RKFC so far had managed to get off to good starts this season, stumbling in the second half but managing to get away with draws in its first two games before winning the previous outing against champion Chennai City FC. On Sunday, the team seemed to have left its plans back in the hotel.

Busy and clueless

Bagan began well, attacking early on and creating quite a few chances but couldn’t find a break-through. Between them, Joseba Beitia in the middle and Ashutosh Mehta on the right, kept the RKFC defence busy and clueless. In fact, almost every attack that Bagan mounted had the imprint of one of them.

Despite physical superiority, RKFC appeared lost for possession and space. An on-field scuffle early on did not help matters. Papa Babacar Diawara, Bagan’s new Senegalese signing playing his first game, came close to putting it ahead in the 17th minute but, with only the RKFC goalkeeper to beat in front of an empty goal, hit wide.

Kallum Higginbotham was the only RKFC player who appeared to find a way to push the ball forward but could only find Mason Robertson out of position. When he was in position, Mason ended up heading wide. Danish Farooq was off-target upfront and Subhash Singh had an off-day at the back, Mehta outflanking him at will.

The second half was far more balanced. Coach David Robertson clearly had made himself heard during the break. There were more co-ordinated attempts from RKFC, more passes upfront and more breaking through the middle. The game opened up and Bazie Armand had the best chance for RKFC in the 50th minute but sent the ball sailing over.

Deadlock broken

Gnohere Krizo came off the bench and tried to leverage his height but found a match in Bagan defender and compatriot Daniel Cyrus. It finally took a Mehta throw-in, headed by Cyrus and volleyed into the net by Beitia to break the deadlock in the 71st minute. Three minutes later, substitute P.M. Britto put through Nongdamba Naorem for the team’s second goal. RKFC kept trying to pull one back but there appeared no sense of urgency and a complete absence of planning in its shooting.

Robertson later admitted that Bagan managed to fend off the early attacks that RKFC is known for. He added that while his team did grow in the game, Bagan always controlled the proceedings.

The host next plays Punjab FC here in what is likely to be a grudge match after the latter refused to travel last season. It would also be a chance for Robertson’s boys to put Sunday’s disappointment behind.

92,2020/01/05,"I-League | In biting cold, Mohun Bagan beat Real Kashmir 2-0","There was bone-chilling cold. Then there was a Real Kashmir outfit used to such extreme conditions but Mohun Bagan still, making light of both, won their I-League match 2-0 in Srinagar on January 5.

After a barren first half, Joseba Beitia (71st minute) and Nongdamba Naorem (73rd) scored for the Kolkata giants in a span of two minutes, shattering the hopes of home fans.

It was a chilly morning, with the temperature dipping to 1℃, but 11,500 Kashmiri spectators still enthusiastically watched the game against one of India’s biggest and oldest clubs. For tickets, they queued up since 9 a.m., but quite a few of them still could not make it to the ground. Such was the craze.

The game started at 11.30 a.m. at the TRC ground because of bitting cold, but the harsh weather conditions failed to stop the visitors from showing their skills.

The green and maroons had the lion’s share of possession and more shots on target but the home side had more attempts and five more corners in a game which could have gone either way.

Mohun Bagan coach Kibu Vicuna started with newly-signed Senegalese striker Baba Diawara and brought in Dhanachandra Singh in the backline. Scotsman David Robertson, the RKFC coach, however, preferred the same starting XI that won against reigning champions Chennai City in the previous game.

The visitors were strong from the starting whistle and notched up as many as three corners in the space of first six minutes.

Talented winger Nongdamba Naorem had his first chance of the game, in the 22nd minute, but his left-footer from inside the Kashmir box failed to cause any problem for goalkeeper Phurba Lachempa.

Both sides got golden chances to score but the first half remained goalless.

In the second half, while Bagan continued to dominate possession, the home side had better scoring chances in the opening 20 minutes. Bazie had a shot on the turn from deep inside the Bagan box in the 49th minute but the effort sailed over the crossbar.

Then, Sankar Roy made the save of the game in the 65th minute to deny Mason Robertson, who attempted an header from close off a Higginbottom set piece.

By now, Kashmir had thrown in Ivorian striker Gnohere Krizo in the mix and had stepped up their attacks. However, it was the visitors from Kolkata who turned the match on its head within a space of two minutes.

First, off a long Dhanachandra Singh throw from the right-flank, Daniel Cyrus somehow managed to deflect the ball in the path of an onrushing Beitia.

Beitia positioned his body perfectly to meet the loose ball with a right-footed jab, which powered its way through to the Kashmir net. The ball went in off the keeper and Bagan were 1-0 ahead.

A couple of minutes later, another young Bagan talent S K Sahil showed outstanding vision and found substitute P.M. Britto down that same flank with a wonderful through ball. Britto rushed in to clear and floated the ball back in. Naorem, who had an outstanding game, was at the end of this one and blasted a perfectly-connected volley into the back of the net to hand Bagan a 2-0 lead.

Kashmir did make valiant attempts to come back and Loveday Okechukwu missed their best chance with less than five minutes to go. Krizo, too, had an attempt from close, but to no avail.

RKFC co-founder Sandeep Chattoo said, “Definitely Mohan Bagan played a good game but I am quite confident that RKFC won hearts of its fans in Kashmir. Every match is lesson for us to improve further and I am sure we have learnt our lessons.”

Robertson also expressed his thoughts and opined, “We played a good game. We lost our focus for five minutes against a team like Mohun Bagan and they capitalised on it. It’s just these fine margins of football. I am just disappointed.”

Mohun Bagan have 10 points from five games, while Kashmir dropped to eighth spot with five points from four games.

Mohun Bagan coach Vicuna expressed his joy and said, “We won against a tough opponent, but it was not out best match. Real Kashmir were going with their set piece, but we played better football against Churchill brothers. “Today we played good football, and copped with the difficulties of conditions.”

93,2020/01/05,"FA Cup: Manchester City ease past Vale, United and Wolves stalemate","Holders Manchester City began their assault on the FA Cup with a 4-1 victory over fourth-tier Port Vale but Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers face an unwanted replay after drawing 0-0 at Molineux on Saturday.

Goals from Oleksandr Zinchenko, Sergio Aguero, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Phil Foden made it a routine day for City, although Tom Pope had equalised for a Vale side sitting 74 places lower in the standings.

Manchester United, like City, made multiple changes to their starting lineup at Wolves in a tie that never caught fire.

United failed to land a single attempt on target although Marcus Rashford struck the bar before Matt Doherty had a goal ruled out for Wolves.

Leicester City, second in the Premier League, beat Wigan Athletic 2-0, Bournemouth beat Luton Town 4-0 and Portsmouth won 2-1 at Fleetwood in the day's other late kickoffs.

Earlier, third-tier Rochdale held Premier League Newcastle United to a 1-1 draw with 40-year-old substitute Aaron Wilbraham grabbing a late equaliser at Spotland.

Goals by Connor Jennings, Emmanuel Monthe and a late Paul Mullin penalty earned third-tier Tranmere Rovers an unlikely 3-3 draw at Watford after they trailed 3-0 at halftime.

There were two top-flight casualties. Last season's beaten semi-finalists Brighton & Hove Albion went down 1-0 at home to Sheffield Wednesday and Aston Villa lost 2-1 at Fulham.

As has become customary in the FA Cup, Watford and Villa both nine changes to their starting lineups, one less than Southampton who avoid an upset as they beat Huddersfield 2-0 to reach round four.

Although the FA Cup has lost some lustre, Port Vale's Pope provided one of the day's memorable moments.

When Zinchenko's long-range effort put Manchester City in front the floodgates looked set to open.

Instead, the 34-year-old Pope powered a thumping header beyond Claudio Bravo from David Amoo's cross to spark wild scenes of celebration among Vale's 8,000 visiting fans.

They were only level for seven minutes, however, before Aguero finished off good work by Foden.

Deflected shot

City needed a VAR intervention to have Harwood-Bellis's goal ruled legal, the youngster deflecting in John Stones's shot despite initially being ruled offside before Foden completed the scoring.

Vale manager John Askey said his team were “fantastic”.

“I was worried before the games that teams have come here and got annihilated,” he said. “When our goal went in you started to dream a little bit.”

Wolves, playing their 36th game of a marathon season, will have another match to prepare for after their stalemate with a United side who face neighbours Man City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday.

Both sides lacked intensity in the first half in which the only save was Sergio Romero's from Doherty's rasping volley.

There was more urgency after the break and Rashford almost made an immediate impact when his shot was blocked by Wolves' Conor Coady and looped against the woodwork.

Raul Jimenez hit the outside of the post for Wolves and Doherty's goal was disallowed after his header went in off his arm, but excitement was in short supply.

Despite the fixture pile-up, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he was happy with the draw.

“I'm happier to be in the replay than going out — it's a tough place to come,” he said.

Leicester, also in League Cup semi-final action next week, made 10 changes to the side who won at Newcastle on New Year's Day. They needed an own goal by Wigan debutant Tom Pearce to go ahead before Harvey Barnes added their second.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/9617hw/article30483468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1197502395THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fa-cup-manchester-city-ease-past-vale-united-and-wolves-stalemate/article30483469.ece

She inaugurated the 211th Louis Braille birth anniversary celebrations organised by the State government at Thummalapalli Kalakshetram in the city on Saturday.

Ms. Vanita said that all the backlog posts in government departments allotted for the differently-abled, including the visually-impaired, would be filled up by the end of March in a special drive, for which orders have already been issued.

She said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had also instructed the department to give pension to the visually-impaired irrespective of the blindness percentage. The previous governments had sanctioned pensions to the visually-impaired persons who had more than 40% blindness, she said.

The government also announced special hostels and pre-matric scholarships in addition to other schemes, she said.

About Braille, Ms. Vanitha said that every person should draw inspiration from him as he had come up with a solution despite facing odds.

Vijayawada Central MLA M. Vishnu said that the State government had introduced the YSR Kanti Velugu scheme for early detection of ailments with due priority to preventing blindness among children.

Mr. Vishnu said that all arrangements were being made to set up a Braille Press in the State.

Actually I prefer the term ‘ghuspaitis’. Or is it ‘ghuspaitiyas’? Or just ‘ghuspaits’? I’m not a native speaker of Hindi, but I think I’ll go with ‘ghuspaitiyas’. I love how it rolls off the tongue, starting softly in the no-man’s land between mouth and throat, turning sibilant as it morphs into a plosive blasting off the lips, before settling down with a stern tap on the palate, as if to warn listeners that if they do not behave, they could be carted off to the nearest ISO 9000-certified detention centre. I also love ‘ghuspaitiyas’ for another reason: it rhymes with a popular Hindi term for a select breed of sub-humans found abundantly in positions of power, especially in government, politics and media.

Mass propaganda

So yes, like you, I am also alarmed by the violent protests sweeping the country. Last week, for instance, I received authentic videos on WhatsApp that showed students in U.P., many of them not even seven years old, barging into police stations and assaulting innocent cops who were quietly torturing no one in their custody. One particularly grisly video shows a three-year-old girl mercilessly beating up five unarmed cops with a teddy bear. Another shows a gang of four 90-year-old women protesters thrashing two senior police officers and their political masters with a cotton dusting cloth.

But the most disturbing footage of protester violence I’ve seen so far is of a visually challenged, hearing impaired, speech-impaired, armless and legless protester using his special powers of teleportation to damage public and private property, AND THEN, using his special powers of hypnosis to convince millions of people that it was the police that went around breaking motorbikes and cars and government property. Such powerful mass propaganda has left me with no choice but to do my best to clear the air around CAA.

Act of benevolence

Of course, like my favourite godman Jags, I too haven’t read the CAA fully. I have, however, read the full form of ‘CAA’ in the gazette notification, and fortunately for this country, I have the ability to absorb the gist of any document from its font size. The CAA is no exception. Let me assure you, the CAA is an act of absolute benevolence. It only proposes to elevate all Indians, by which I mean, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Christians and Parsis, to the status of livestock.

Tell me: How could it be unconstitutional, in the land of the holy cow, to enact a law that transforms people into cattle — a much loved, highly prized national resource?

In India, there have always lived two kinds of people: cattle and ghuspaitiyas. But after Independence, thanks to 67 years of Congress misrule, the cattle and ghuspaitiyas got mixed up.

Now, I don’t know which school you went to, but you must know that, whatever may be the practice in Western democracies, Indian democracy is governed by Indian values. Protest, dissent, and criticism of the government are an insult to Indian values, whose first and last tenet, in case you’ve forgotten, is to obey authority.

Official role model

Indian democracy has space only for cattle, India’s national animal. The official role model for anyone who wants to be an Indian citizen is the cow. Thus, all those who refuse to be cattle are, by definition, ghuspaitiyas. Fortunately, the CAA-NRC sieve is designed in such a way that the only entities that can pass through its filters are cattle. Think about it: why would anyone oppose CAA-NRC unless they really are ghuspaitiyas who cannot or will not become cattle?

After data, natural resources, and PSUs, human cattle are a nation’s biggest asset. And India, whatever its erstwhile Constitution might say, is first and foremost a business operation for its rulers. In order to run a successful business, it is imperative to count and grade one’s assets. The good quality assets will get citizenship cards. The toxic ones will be sent to self-improvement camps where they can learn how to become proper cattle.

Some commentators have pointed out that India’s human cattle have already been counted and classified through Aadhaar. But Aadhaar didn’t weed out the ghuspaitiyas. Only CAA-NRC, with the help of NPR, can do that. I sincerely hope that, at least in 2020, all Indians will develop the thick skin, passivity, and docility that cattle are known for. Once again, Happy Moo Year.

One of the things that struck me was his enormous decency, he never wrote a nasty word, although he was famous for being short-tempered. He invariably supported his subordinates, whereas I would get impatient reading some of their absurd letters to him.

What I long ago assumed to be weakness in him was, I can see, his determination to bring people together, to keep this highly fragmented country united. Contradictions have to be managed, they cannot be eliminated. He even permitted the RSS to parade officially in the Republic Day march-past in 1963. He was the most unifying, the least divisive, of all our leaders since Independence; those who demonise him today could afford to learn from him the best in Indian nationalism.""

100,2020/01/05,Which hospitalisation policy should I take? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Life cover as a job-seeker

Q. I am 26 years old and live with my mother (47), brother (18) and sister (23). I lost my dad a year ago and I am still studying for my civil services examinations. Our source of income now is my dad’s pension and he has not bought any life insurance plan for us. Which plan will be suitable for us?

RISHIKESH NAMDEO THORVE

A. I assume you are referring to family pension after your father passed away. Without an independent source of income, you will not be able to buy a life insurance policy as the concept of insured value is based on the economic value of your life. You could try to buy a policy based on the assets you own, but insurance companies will need to know you have the income flow to keep paying premiums.

As for your family members, you can buy insurance on their lives if their death will set you back financially. This is called insurable interest. You should also be able to quantify that loss, which determines the sum assured. And again, your ability to keep paying premiums.

Once you start earning, you can buy a policy on your life and make your family members beneficiaries thus securing their future.

Higher health cover for seniors

Q. My wife and I have a joint health policy. It has ₹2.5 lakh cover for hospitalisation and ₹5 lakh for personal accident (PA) for me and ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh respectively for my wife. I am 73 years old and she is 72. Given our age, companies are unwilling to enhance the cover. My son has been taking health insurance cover of ₹2 lakh for each of us through his employer. Can we have the benefit of the combined amount offered under both the policies if the hospitalisation bill exceeds the limits of one of the policies? If so, how do I make the claim. Alternatively, do you suggest we take a new policy with higher cover from any insurance company, provided they agree, considering our age? If the total premium is more than ₹50,000, can both of us claim tax benefits, each up to ₹50,000?

M. AJAYA KUMAR

A. Hospitalisation policies are indemnity policies which means you can make claims only against actual expenses as evidenced by the bills. So, you can choose the policy you want to make the claim under and then, for the excess amount, make the claim under the other policy.

As for higher coverage, please opt for it if you can get it. Here are some more efficient and less costly options.

Maintain one of your two policies as your basic hospitalisation cover. For additional cover, replace your second hospitalisation policy with a top-up or super top-up policy. This will cost less for the same sum assured. You can read about this in greater detail in Cover Note published in the May 5, 2019 edition of The Hindu. (https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/want-extra-cover-on-your-policy/article27035752.ece).

Ensure that your current benefits, like having completed your waiting period for pre-existing conditions, stay intact. You should be able to appeal to the logic of your insurance company and talk them into it!

You can supplement this with a critical illness policy and/or a major surgery policy. These are benefit policies, meaning you can make a claim for the sum assured on the occurrence of the insured peril (the diagnosis of the illness or requirement for surgery) with no reference to actual expenses.

You can also claim under your hospitalisation policy against bills for actual expenses.

Income tax benefits are only for the first insured. In this case it is ₹30,000 as both of you are senior citizens. The ₹50,000 deduction you mention is only if dependent, senior citizen parents are covered under the same policy.

101,2020/01/05,Home loans: 6 popular myths to be aware of,"Just like any other financial product, there are numerous myths and misconceptions circling around home loans. Home loan applicants often fall prey to these myths and end up making wrong choices while selecting loan options. Here is list of the most prevalent home loans myths that you need to be aware of.

Shorter tenure good

Shorter home loan tenure will always have lower interest cost than longer tenure loan, assuming that their interest rates are equal. However, shorter loan tenures would also attract higher EMI vis-a-vis loan with longer tenure.

This can have negative impact on your financial health if it leaves you with little room to invest for other crucial financial goals. Such aggressive repayment tenures without insufficient buffer can also cause you to default on EMIs during financial emergencies. This might have long-term negative consequences on your credit score and your future loan eligibility.

Lowest interest rate

Home loan interest rate is just one of the several factors to be considered while choosing a lender. The other important factors include LTV (loan-to-value) ratio, processing fee and loan tenure.

For example, a lender extending lowest interest rate may require you to opt for a lower LTV ratio, which means that you will need to put in higher down payment money.

Some lenders also charge lower interest rate for borrowers availing loans for longer tenure. Similarly, lenders offering lowest interest rate may charge you higher processing fee and other charges. Hence, take a more holistic view while comparing various loan offers instead of limiting it to interest rates.

Good credit score guarantees loan approval

Credit score is one of the several factors used for evaluating loan applicant’s creditworthiness. Other major factors include your age, monthly income, employer profile, job stability, existing EMI commitments, location, property title, etc. Each of these play a crucial role in assessing your credit profile. Failure to meet any of these criterion will lead to rejection of your home loan application.

Penalty for prepayment

The Reserve Bank of India has barred banks, NBFCs and HFCs from penalising pre-payment or foreclosure of floating rate loans. This has made all floating rate home loan borrowers free to make pre-payment or foreclose loans without incurring any prepayment penalties. Even in case of fixed rate home loans, many lenders do not charge prepayment charges if it is made from the borrower’s own source of funds.

Fixed better than floating

With home loan interest rates recording consistent decline over the last one year, many home loan applicants consider fixed-rate home loans to be a better option to do away with interest rate volatility. However, very few lenders offer fixed rate home loans for the entire tenure.

Those who do, usually charge higher interest rate for fixed rate home loans to reduce their own interest rate risk. What most lenders usually offer are mixed rate home loans whose rates remain fixed for a pre-specified period, say for the first 2, 3 or 5 years of the loan tenure.

After the end of that period, floating rates become applicable. Even the interest rate charged during fixed rate period is higher than interest rate for floating rate home loans at the time of loan sanction.

Direct loan application better

Most home loan applicants reach out to multiple lenders to shop for best loan rates and other features. However, every time one makes direct loan application with a bank or an HFC, the lender will contact credit bureaus to fetch your credit report and evaluate your creditworthiness. Such lender-initiated enquiry is considered as hard enquiry and each of them will reduce your credit score by a few points. Multiple loan applications will reduce your credit score multiple times, which might adversely impact your loan eligibility. Instead, visit online financial marketplace to compare various home loan offers available on your credit score, monthly income, job profile and other eligibility parameters. While these marketplaces, too, will fetch your credit score, it is considered as soft enquiry and hence, would not impact your credit score.

102,2020/01/05,What are your financial goals for 2020?,"With New Year upon us, many would like to hit the reset button and start on a clean slate - be it joining a gym, starting a diet programme or taking a vacation. Better financial decisions will definitely be one among them.

It could be as small as maintaining an expense account or starting a SIP with a mutual fund to buying a property. I reached out to a few people to find out what they have promised themselves on the financial front. Here is what they said:

Bank deposits popular

Unsurprisingly, most of the financial resolutions for 2020 are to increase savings. While there are various investment options available, including mutual funds, equity/debt investments and gold, most people that I spoke to prefer to park their money in banks as fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits (RDs).

Twenty-five-year-old Shiva, who started his working career two years ago, says “I get to save nearly 40% of my income every month in RDs. This year, I want to make a FD for two to three years”

Similarly Srilakshmi Indrasenan, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, says “I ensure that I save ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 every month in RDs. For 2020, I want to make FDs whenever I get bulk payments” Further, Srilakshmi also wants to learn about investing in stock market and mutual funds this year.

But 26-year-old student Prashanth, prefers post office fixed deposits for savings. “Bank returns are very low, so I prefer post office deposits. Nearly 50% of the money I get every month goes to post office deposit schemes. I intend to continue the same this year too.”

Swathi C.S., who has taken a break from work, says “Over 80% of the amount meant for savings goes to RD but this year I would like to make a FD too” Though she has SIP in mutual funds running, she would rather make FDs as the risks are lower. Anjana, another home maker, too, feels the same way. “It is easy to liquidate FD than a mutual fund I feel and for this year, I would definitely make a minimum of two FDs of over ₹50,000 each”

However, senior citizens like Sundar Ram M. says “For me, nearly 90% of my monthly income goes to FDs and other debt instruments. I will continue to do the same this year instead of exploring new investment avenues.” Sundaraman does have minor exposure, less than 2%, in equity shares to ‘try his luck.’

Remember, while bank deposits are safer than stock markets or mutual fund investments which are subject to the risk of capital erosion, it is also not the best way to save, especially for the young.

Also, bank FD/RD rates today are nothing to write home about. To maximise returns, investors need to lock-in when the rates are high.

On the other hand, investing regularly through SIPs in mutual funds over a long -term of 10 years or more, can minimise the risk as well as fetch good returns. Also, on the debt side, investors can consider other instruments such as PPF, NSC, etc apart from RDs and FDs. Thus, a mix of equity and debt instruments , according to each one’s risk appetite, is ideal. For senior citizens though, FDs are a good way to earn regular income as also to preserve capital.

Gold and real estate

Many want to bet on the yellow metal in the New Year given the price appreciation last year. Also, Indians have always had an affinity for gold, particularly in the form of jewellery. So, people like Swathi consider it to be a good investment. She says “I pay around ₹3,500 per month to a jeweller so that I can buy an ornament at the end of the period for my wedding anniversary” This is something she wants to continue every year.

While jewellers’ schemes — where you pay for 11 months and the jeweller pays for one month — appear attractive, it is not a secure investment as there have been examples of fly-by-night operators disappearing with investors’ money. The recent incident of Goodwin Jewellers defaulting hundreds of individuals’ money is a good example of how unsafe such investments are. It is better to invest gold in other ways, including sovereign gold bonds or as gold ETFs. Vinothraj prefers gold ETFs over gold jewellery. He says, “Stock market seems overheated now, so I have started with investments in gold ETFs and will continue investing this year too.” Vinothraj has 5-10% of his portfolio in gold.

Since house property prices in certain regions are correcting, some people are willing to consider real estate as an investment option. Srilakshmi, for one, has started saving towards down payment for a property buy in the near to medium term.

Other goals

For many, taking a long vacation every year has become mandatory and accordingly, some have started saving for that as well.

Take Swathi, for instance. She plans to allocate nearly 20% of income to save for a vacation this year.

Same way, Vinothraj says, “I want to invest in short-term funds to save for a vacation every year.”

Anjana, too, says she plans to create a fund for vacation. “I want to allocate 10% every month towards vacation fund this year. So, at the end of 2020, I can utilise it for my travel,” she says.

People are saving for contingencies too.

Vinothraj says, “For this year I want to create a contingencies fund for medical emergencies.” For now, Vinothraj has health cover offered by his company. “I want to update my health insurance cover for better coverage.”

Swathi, too, wants to save up to 20% of the family’s income towards contingencies in bank deposits.

“I don’t have any insurance but for any emergencies, I would like to set aside some money starting this year.”

While it is important to create a contingency fund, it is equally important to take a plain vanilla term cover for your life. Consider buying additional health insurance after you across 30.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uv8n7q/article28621845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20BUFIRST-SAVINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/setting-the-financial-milestones-for-new-year/article30486965.ece
103,2020/01/05,States stare at over ₹1 lakh crore revenue gap post withdrawal of GST compensation,"States might be facing a consolidated revenue gap of up to ₹1.23 lakh crore on account of withdrawal of compensation after the five-year GST transition period ends on June 30, 2022, says a report by economic think tank National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP).

At the time of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017, the Centre had promised to compensate states for loss of revenue for five years at an agreed formula.

“If the GST compensation is withdrawn after June 30, 2022, consolidated revenue gap of states would vary between ₹1,00,700 crore to ₹1,23,646 crore depending on expected tax buoyancy and reliability of data sources,” the report said.

“This implies that states will need to either generate an equivalent amount of revenue from exiting sources to continue with committed expenditures and/or cut down expenditures to cope up with revenue shock in 2022-23,” it added.

Due to the ongoing shortfall in overall GST collection as well as rising revenue gap between GST compensation requirement and GST compensation cess (GSTCC) mobilisation, timely release of GST compensation has become a matter of contention between the union and state governments.

The report said that the withdrawal of GST compensation and fall in overall State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) collection will have substantial impact on state finances of Punjab, Odisha, Goa, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, among major states.

Among minor states, substantial revenue gap is expected for Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tripura and Meghalaya.

Given the ongoing shortfall in GST collection and uncertainty associated with revenue on account of SGST collection, many states have approached the 15th Finance Commission for possible extension of the GST compensation period by another three years, i.e. up to 2024-25.

“Any shock to state finances due to withdrawal of GST compensation after the GST transition period may have profound impact on India’s fiscal management and thereforemacroeconomic stability,” the report noted.

It pointed out that even if the GST compensation period is extended beyond June 30, 2022, the Centre may not have adequate fiscal space to provide GST compensation to states at the ongoing annual growth rate of 14 per cent, unless either tax buoyancy and/or nominal growth rate of GDP improves.

To provide GST compensation to states, GST Compensation Cess (GSTCC) was introduced along with GST on some specific items to mobilise resources for the GST Compensation Fund.

104,2020/01/05,Further escalation in U.S.-Iran tension may affect India’s exports: FIEO,"Further escalation in the tension between the U.S. and Iran will have implications on India’s exports to the Persian Gulf nation, apex exporters body FIEO said on Sunday.

Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said so far exporters have not flagged any concerns related with exports to Iran.

“However, if the tensions will continue, it may have effect on India’s exports to Iran,” he said.

He added that due to existing trade sanctions on Iran, Iranian shipping lines are only taking Indian consignments to that country.

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. increased after an American drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani last week.

Iran is a key trading partner of India. Its major exports to India are oil, fertilisers and chemicals, while it imports cereals, tea, coffee, basmati rice, spices and organic chemicals, among others.

India’s exports to the Persian Gulf nation in 2018-19 were worth $3.51 billion (about ₹24,920 crore), while imports were valued at $13.52 billion (about ₹96,000 crore).

The trade imbalance is mainly because of India’s import of oil from Iran.

Both the countries are holding negotiations for a bilateral preferential trade agreement (PTA) to increase trade.

Unlike a free trade pact, where two trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate duties on maximum number of goods traded between them, PTA involves removal of duties on certain identified products.

FIEO had earlier said that Iran holds huge export opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, chemicals, machinery, pharmaceuticals, paper and paper products, man-made fibre and filament yarn and essential oils.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/further-escalation-in-us-iran-tension-may-affect-indias-exports-fieo/article30484123.ece
105,2020/01/05,US-Iran conflict: Petrol prices touch all-year high of ₹75.54 per litre in Delhi,"Petrol in Delhi now costs ₹75.54 per litre — the highest in more than a year, while a litre of diesel comes for ₹68.51. Petrol and diesel prices rose for the fourth straight day on Sunday as global oil prices jumped after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general, fanning fresh fears of conflict in the crude-rich Middle East.

Retail pump price of petrol was hiked by 9 paise per litre and that of diesel by 11 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.

While global stock markets were mixed following the U.S. killing of Qasem Soleimani, oil prices jumped more than 3% on Friday. Oil markets will reopen on Monday after the weekend break.

Also Read Trump ordered killing of Iranian General at Baghdad airport

The killing of Soleimani represents “a significant spike in geopolitical risks and could lead to a direct confrontation between the U.S. and Iran,” Oxford Economics said in a commentary.

India is 84% dependant on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in global prices has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil — which forms the raw material for making petrol, diesel and other petroleum products — is priced according to international benchmarks.

Middle East accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being the top suppliers.

Even though the import basket has been sought to be diversified with oil being contracted from nations such as the U.S., pricing in all the regions is governed by international benchmarks and rates went up everywhere following Friday’s strikes.

Officials said there is no immediate threat of any supply disruption to India and the only impact would be felt in prices.

For an economy that is struggling to recover from a six-year low growth rate of 4.5%, a spike in oil prices poses significant risk as it will not just stoke inflation but also lead to higher outgo on government subsidies on cooking fuel.

“Nowhere in the world has seen any supply being stopped because of U.S. strikes. Oil continues to flow as normal,” an official said.

Sunday’s price increase is the fourth straight day of retail prices going up. Since January 2, petrol price has increased by 38 paise per litre while diesel rates have gone up 55 paise.

Prices were unchanged over the new year. Rates of petrol have been on the upswing since December 26 and that of diesel since November 29, 2019. Diesel prices have increased by ₹2.78 per litre over this period while petrol has become costlier by 91 paise.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/4hw4uc/article23293223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19INTHROHPETROLPUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/petrol-diesel-prices-up-for-4th-straight-day-as-us-strike-roils-oil-market/article30483947.ece
106,2020/01/05,National Aerospace Laboratory wants govt. push for Saras Mk2 takeoff,"The government needs to be the “launch customer” to make Saras Mk2 commercially viable, the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), which has developed the first indigenous light transport aircraft, told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology.

The 19-seater aircraft, developed with a target cost of ₹50 crore, is at least 20-25% lower in cost than other aircraft in the similar category.

The aircraft has been in the making for long. The first prototype flew in 2004. But without the initial push from the government, the manufacturing capacity required for commercial production could not be set up, the NAL said.

On a five-day tour of ISRO facilities from December 25 to 30, the committee members visited the NAL on December 28 and were briefed about the aircraft. Later, NAL Director Jitendra J. Jadhav sent a report on the plan for commercial production. Committee chairperson and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh forwarded the report to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu.

“Our job is to study and recommend. We cannot and should not step into the domain of the executive,” Mr. Ramesh said, explaining why he forwarded the report to Mr. Naidu.

Presently, the NAL has only one order from the Indian Air Force for 15 aircraft.

Connectivity plans

The NAL has been pitching SARAS Mk-2 for the government’s UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), since it has the capacity to operate in “ill-equipped”, “semi-prepared” and “unpaved airstrips”. The scheme, launched in October 2016, is aimed at linking up areas that have no air connectivity.

The NAL has said in its report to Mr. Ramesh that the government should be the “launch customer” and place an order for at least 50-60 aircraft, which can be used for VIP services or tackling emergencies in times of natural calamities.

“With the firm commitment for procurement from the government, industries will come forward to set up manufacturing infrastructure. This will also push the growth of the micro, small and medium enterprises and allied service sector,” Mr. Jadhav said in his report.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5iy0i/article30487825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05SARAS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/national-aerospace-laboratory-wants-govt-push-for-saras-mk2-takeoff/article30487826.ece
107,2020/01/05,"Despite ban, unabated use of plastic continues in Odisha","Despite the ban on single-use plastic in all urban areas of Odisha since October 2 last year, the use of plastic continues unabated across the State, largely due to the lack of strong enforcement.

While the government has collected a meagre fine of ₹59.20 lakh, only 21,846 kg of plastic was seized up to December 15, 2019. In 18 out of 30 districts, the district-wise fine collection has not even crossed ₹1 lakh.

The information came to light during a recent video conference meeting between Chief Secretary and all district collectors.

Districts like Balasore and Deogarh have collected a meager ₹2,900 and ₹1,400 respectively during October, November and December. As far as volume of plastic seized in raids is concerned, a total 5 kg of plastic was found by authorities in Deogarh. The amount of plastic seized was 60 kg in Jajpur, 76 kg in Boudh, 117 kg in Nuapada, 125 kg in Jagatsinghpur, 131 kg in Nabarangapur and 192 kg in Balasore.

In December, four districts — Jagatsinghpur, Kadhamal, Kendrapara and Sambalpur — have neither seized any plastic nor collected any fines. The volume of plastic seizure was below 10 kg in 15 districts including, Boudh, Puri Subarnapur, Nayagarh, Nabarangapur, Balasore, Deogarh and Nuapada.

Single-use plastic is easily available at groceries and eateries across the State. Plastic wastes was also found littered on the fringes of wildlife sanctuaries in the State during the month of December, when New Year celebrations were at their peak.

Wildlife experts have expressed concerns over animals consuming plastic leftovers in forests. “When the government duly issued a notification prohibiting the manufacture, sale, trade, import, storing, carrying, transportation and distribution of the single-use plastics, it was incumbent upon it to enforce its instruction,” said Hemanta Rout, a Kendrapara-based environmentalist.

On September 30, the State Forest and Environment Department in a notification issued on September 30, said the State government has prohibited the manufacture, sell, trade, import, storing, carrying, transportation and distribution of the single-use plastics.

At the sidelines of the Women’s Science Congress — part of the Indian Science Congress — several scientists spoke to The Hindu about how institutions and the government can ensure that more women not only choose science but also remain in their field instead of dropping out.

Shyamala Subba Reddy, Professor, Department of Horticulture, University of Agricultural Sciences, who has been teaching for 22 years, said that while there was no dearth of infrastructure, there was a need for women-centric funding for more research work. “There is a need for more supportive system on campuses for young women. Having child care facilities and creches will make a significant difference in ensuring that more women remain in science and research,” she said.

Adequate recognition

Surekha Ramrao Gaikwad, Associate Professor of home science at SSSP College, Parbhani, Maharashtra, spoke about the bureaucracy involved in getting approvals. She held a similar view on the need for incentives for women and adequate recognition for their work.

Reena V. John, who is pursuing her Phd in physical sciences at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, said: “When we are in the labs, we cannot afford to think of timings and will have to work late hours. Having CCTV cameras, ensuring that only authorised people are given access to the labs are some safety measures that can be adopted. My institution has taken steps in this direction,” she said.

Creating platforms

Another researcher, Prachi Shah, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology at Sabarmati University, felt that creating platforms for women to network would help them grow professionally. “Attending conferences and making presentations on our research work would help us get motivation as well as feedback on our work,” she said.

Role of men

Men also have a huge role to play in how our society inculcates the aspirations of women, said Trilochan Mohapatra, Director-General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), at the inauguration of the Women Science Congress.

On the topic of discrimination of women, he said, “Our country is also waking up very late to the [contribution of] women. Girls are not opting for core areas of science,” he said.

He underscored the importance of framing policies to rectify this imbalance. Tessy Thomas, scientist and Director-General of Aeronautical Systems, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), spoke about the achievements of women scientists.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hm3jr6/article30487733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/women-scientists-bat-for-conducive-workplaces/article30487734.ece
109,2020/01/05,Centre bats for science outreach programmes,"Communication and the importance of outreach programmes were on the agenda on the third day of the 107th Indian Science Congress here on Sunday.

Akhilesh Gupta, Adviser and Head, Climate Change Programme, Department of Science and Technology, spoke about the Centre’s policy on implementing scientific social responsibility (SSR).

Under the programme, researchers who are working on a science project funded by any of the Ministries under the Central government will have to undertake activities to popularise science and make it more accessible to the public.

Speaking at the Science Communicators’ Meet, Mr. Gupta said they would draw up a list of activities that could be taken up under the Scientific Social Responsibility programme that was similar to Corporate Social Responsibility.

Mandatory outreach

“This could range from going to colleges delivering lectures, writing an article in a magazine or doing something beyond the curriculum,” he said.

The science outreach would be mandatory and researchers had to include this as part of their outcome report, he added.

Mr. Gupta said the move would not only bridge the gap between research institutes and the civilians, but also help scientists hone their communication skills.

“It will be implemented this year after a consultation meeting with all stakeholders,” Mr. Gupta added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-bats-for-science-outreach-programmes/article30487717.ece
110,2020/01/05,National Population Register order divides Bihar ruling allies,"The Bihar government on December 18 issued the notification to begin the first phase of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise from May 15 to June 28, much before Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi announced it on Saturday.

On Sunday, Janata Dal(U) national general secretary and spokesperson Pawan K. Verma wrote a two-page letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and expressed “surprise” over Mr. Modi’s “unilateral” announcement.

Earlier, on Saturday, Mr. Modi, while making the announcement, said “no government has the courage to stop the NPR exercise in their respective States”.

However, soon after Mr. Modi’s announcement, senior JD(U) leader and his Cabinet colleague Shyam Rajak said he had no information about any such decision and “Mr. Modi may have made such an announcement in his personal capacity.”

‘Principled stand’

In his letter, Mr. Verma asked the Chief Minister to take a “principled stand” against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the NPR.

“Reject the nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence,” wrote Mr. Verma, adding that “the CAA-NRC combine is a direct attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims and to create social instability. You have always stood for a secular India, where there is peace, respect and goodwill among all its communities.”

But, JD(U) leader and party spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan told journalists in Patna, “The Bihar government has categorically said that it will not implement NRC in the State but since Union Home Minister Amit Shah has stated that NPR data won’t be used for the NRC, the JD(U) doesn’t have a problem with the NPR exercise in Bihar.”

Other JD(U) leaders too said the government had taken the decision to begin the NPR process from May 15 and “now there should not be any further discussion on it.”

Meanwhile, State BJP leaders like Mr. Modi and State party president Sanjay Jaiswal on Sunday began the Jan Jagran Abhiyan (awareness campaign) about the CAA in Patna and West Champaran. They visited households in those areas and briefed residents about the Act.

Party sources also told The Hindu that Mr. Shah is likely to visit Vaishali on January 16 to address people about the CAA.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5pexhh/article30487649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THRDPAWAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/npr-order-divides-bihar-ruling-allies/article30487650.ece
111,2020/01/05,"Anti-CAA protests: Our kin framed in riots, says Lucknow residents","A Lucknow court on Saturday granted bail to more than a dozen persons accused in the violence that took place in the city during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 19. However, many like Yasmin Siddiqui still await relief for her son Osama, 20, a third-year B.Com. student. He has been in jail for more than two weeks and his bail plea is expected to come up only on Monday.

Ms. Siddiqui is concerned about her son’s well-being and anxious about his academic future. Osama has his exams on January 7 and 8 and is likely to miss them.

“He is anxious and wants to return home. He is tense about the examination. He didn’t get to study for so many days. They should understand our situation. It’s about his future. He will waste a full year,” she said.

Like the kin of several persons who were arrested for the violence, Osama’s family claims he had nothing to do with the protests. Till 2 p.m. on December 19, he was playing with his friends in the lane outside his house, his family said, adding that they have CCTV footage to prove it.

After that, he was going to a stationery shop, unaware of the violence some distance away, Ms. Siddiqui said.

“Nobody from our locality had gone to the protest. He must have moved further out and encountered the stampede. He ran and took shelter in someone’s house. The protesters also ran into the same compound,” she said, based on what he told her in jail.

“But since they were being chased by the police, many of the protesters escaped climbing over rooftops. But Osama sat quietly in one corner, hoping that the police would not touch him as he didn’t do anything. But it was him the police caught,” she said.

Osama is among more than 500 people in Uttar Pradesh who have been issued notices to pay for damage to public and private property during the arson and vandalism. The police have arrested more than 1,240 people across the State.

Sayyad Waseem, a waiter at a popular Mughlai restaurant a stone’s throw away from the epicentre of the protests, Parivartan Chowk, had gone to work around noon on December 19. But by late afternoon, as violence engulfed the area, the restaurant downed its shutter and Waseem decided to head back home, his family said.

112,2020/01/05,Akali Dal questions Sidhu’s silence,"The Shiromani Akali Dal on Sunday hit out at former Punjab Minister and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu questioning his silence on the alleged hate attack on Sikhs as well as Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan.

Former Minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said Mr. Sidhu should explain his silence on the issues of forced conversion of a minor Sikh girl in Pakistan and the subsequent turn of events which have led to death threats to the victim family, stoning of Gurdwara Nankana Sahib and even threats to rename the holy city of Nankana Sahib.

“No Sikh worldwide could tolerate forced conversions of community members and stoning of its most holy shrines. Similarly they will never forgive those like Mr. Sidhu who continue to dance to the tunes of their friends in Pakistan,” he said.

Mr. Grewal said “Mr. Sidhu must condemn the Pakistan establishment as well as his friend and Prime Minister Imran Khan immediately. Mr. Sidhu should also use his good offices with his buddy General Qamar Javed Bajwa to ensure swift and decisive action against all those who stoned Gurdwara Janan Asthan as well as those responsible for the forced conversion of the minor Sikh girl.”

Mr. Grewal urged the Sikh community to stand up as one to condemn persecution and oppression of Sikhs in Pakistan. “We also appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give a stern message to Pakistan that this dastardly behaviour will not be tolerated at any cost,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y7d11c/article30487515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THSIDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akali-dal-questions-sidhus-silence/article30487516.ece
113,2020/01/05,Nationalist Congress Party net gainer in portfolio allocation,"The portfolio distribution of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra has yet again proven that though the government is led by Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena as Chief Minister, it is the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which has got the lion’s share and will control the government.

The Congress on the other hand will be working on the Ministries more concerned with social sectors, giving the party a chance to expand its base.

Crucial departments

Pocketing the Home, Finance, Housing, Rural Development, Irrigation, State Excise and Cooperation portfolios, the NCP has ensured that a majority of the key departments remain with the party.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar will handle the Finance and Planning Ministries, while the party’s Vidarbha leader Anil Deshmukh will take charge of the Home Department.

NCP leader and former Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde has got the Social Justice Ministry, while party leader Jitendra Awhad has been given Housing.

While a section of the Congress is unhappy over not getting important portfolios, the socially important departments with the party give it a chance to regain the lost ground in the State.

114,2020/01/05,Sahara: U.K. Sinha lauds former Finance Ministers,"Crediting three successive Finance Ministers — Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram and the late Arun Jaitley — for SEBI’s strong action against the Sahara Group, the market regulator’s former chief U.K. Sinha has said the three leaders stood their ground and did not interfere in the matter despite repeated attempts by vested interests.

Mr. Sinha also praised former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his sound advice on how to balance the multiple roles of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and applauded current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being a “very inquisitive” leader and always being firm in his belief that no person big or small should be spared for any wrongdoing.

The SEBI had ordered Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL) in 2011 to refund the money raised from investors through certain bonds known as Optionally Fully Convertible Bonds (OFCDs).

According to their own admissions, the net amount raised by the two companies was more than ₹24,000 crore from over 3 crore investors.

After a long process of appeals and cross-appeals, the Supreme Court on August 31, 2012 upheld the SEBI’s directions asking the two firms to refund the money collected from investors with 15% interest.

In his new book Going Public: My Time at Sebi, Mr. Sinha has said that the Sahara case attracted substantial media attention and political leaders across the party took keen interest in the matter.

The biggest and most expensive legal minds in the country appeared for Sahara at various stages.

During the meetings of the parliamentary standing committee on Finance, and even outside, questions were raised as if one business group had been targeted in a singular manner in trying to amend the SEBI Act, Mr. Sinha added.

The former SEBI Chairman, during whose tenure the case was at its most important juncture, also said that attempts were made in a variety of ways, including threats of raising privilege motions in Parliament and by intimidating SEBI officials.

“However, it goes to the credit of successive Finance Ministers — Mr. Mukherjee, Mr. Chidambaram and Jaitley — that they stood their ground and didn’t interfere in the matter,” he added.

In addition, he said the Ministers and officials of the Finance Ministry also deserve credit for upholding the rule of law and keeping up the morale of SEBI officials.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/4nn96e/article25892775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03UKSINHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sahara-uk-sinha-lauds-former-finance-ministers/article30487458.ece
115,2020/01/05,"In a first, BJP holding meetings for budget inputs","In a first of its kind exercise, the BJP has been holding a series of meetings with 11 groups of stakeholders, on the expectations from, and the suggestions for, the Union budget.

Suggestions that have been conveyed to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also be released as a background paper after the last of the meetings is wound up on January 14.

Gopal Krishna Agarwal, BJP spokesperson and head of the economic cell, started this exercise on December 19, with five sectoral meetings done and six to follow. “We have invited stakeholders from agriculture, trade, the automobile industry and pharmaceuticals, and economists who work with banks for separate meetings and discussed specific issues related to those sectors,” he said.

“For example, in agriculture, the meeting focussed on supply chain issues, input costs, and crop information, with traders and small manufacturers the issues related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the indirect taxes and implementation issues, with the automobile sector, the discussion hovered over industry cycle, electric vehicles and consumer demand,” he said.

Mr. Agarwal said the suggestions of these sectors had already been passed on to the Finance Minister, and a background paper is being prepared for an overview of the entire exercise. “Our last meeting will be with economists of banks on the larger picture of the economy,” he said.

While Ms. Sitharaman has been holding meetings with stakeholders as part of the budget exercise, Mr. Agarwal says this is a first such attempt by the BJP as far as the budget is concerned. “It is a targeted exercise, for specific issues related to various sectors,” he said.

116,2020/01/05,"Take urgent steps to ensure safety of Indians in Gulf, Amarinder urges Centre","Amid the escalating U.S.-Iran tensions, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged the Central government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety and security of the 10 million Indians in the Gulf region.

India could not afford to simply wait and watch or just monitor the situation, given the rising stakes in view of the threats and counter-threats between the U.S. and Iran, he said in the context of the Ministry of External Affairs’ statement that it was keeping a close watch.

The Chief Minister emphasised that the Indian government should immediately direct their embassies in the region to connect with the Indians settled there and provide all possible help to them in this hour of crisis. Pointing out that besides the U.S., countries like Britain were preparing to evacuate their citizens, if needed, Mr. Singh asked the Centre to also prepare and initiate plans to evacuate all Indians seeking to return to India in the current circumstances.

The close proximity of the Gulf region to the Indian border made it imperative for the Centre to intervene without delay and issue directions to its missions in the West Asian countries and the Indian population there, he said. With the conflict showing no signs of easing, the situation was evidently grave and it would be in the interest of the Indians to leave the region immediately, he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/take-urgent-steps-to-ensure-safety-of-indians-in-gulf-amarinder-urges-centre/article30487423.ece
117,2020/01/05,Soleimani death: Indian community in Tehran shares grief of Iranians,"Members of the Indian community based in Iran will attend the funeral procession of Major General Qassem Soleimani that will be held in Tehran on Monday morning, representatives of the group have said. The assassination of Maj. Gen. Soleimani in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad has cast a pall of gloom over Iran and the tense atmosphere has affected the Indian community who are mostly based in Tehran, Qom and Bandar Abbas.

“We are also sharing the grief of the Iranian people as they are in mourning following the murder of General Soleimani. The Iranians consider him a real hero and therefore there will be a very large crowd that will attend his funeral in Tehran tomorrow,” said Dr. N. A Soufi, an Indian commentator based in Tehran.

Mr. Soufi reflected the sentiment of the Iranians in emphasising that there is a strong possibility of Iran deciding the course of retaliation soon after the funeral of the General who led the clandestine Quds Force — a special wing of the Islamic Republic Guard Corps (IRGC) that has been instrumental in defeating the IS fighters in Iraq and Syria. “On Monday morning we are going to walk in the funeral procession which will be addressed by Ayatollah Khamenei. People here are united in grief and political differences have been forgotten in view of the assassination carried out in a third country,” said Dr. Soufi.

A leading Indian businessman based in the Iranian capital emphasised the need to appreciate the public status of Gen. Soleimani.

“He was hugely popular in Iran and there were often discussions that he could one day become a leading political figure. He was not only a military affairs and counter-terror specialist, he also rose to help whenever Iranians faced natural calamities like floods and earthquakes,” said the Indian businessman requesting anonymity.

The mortal remains of Gen. Soleimani reached Ahvaz city in Southwest Iran’s Khouzestan province where a large gathering paid their tributes.

118,2020/01/05,CAA omits Muslim community to humiliate them: Yashwant Sinha,"Ahead of the 22-day yatra in protest against the amended Citizenship Act and the proposed National Population Register, former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha said on Sunday the deliberate exclusion of the Muslim community from the legislation was to ‘humiliate’ them.

The Rashtra Manch, an organisation helmed by Mr. Sinha along with two other groups, is undertaking a 3,000-km “Gandhi Shanti Yatra” that will begin from Mumbai’s Apollo Bunder on January 9 and conclude at the Raj Ghat on January 30.

“Many like me feel that by discriminating on the basis of religion the government has violated the basic structure of the Constitution. And the omission of the Muslim community from the legislation has been done to humiliate them,” Mr. Sinha told The Hindu.

Mr. Sinha said if the government’s intentions were right they would have included the ‘Rohingya’ community who had been forced to flee Myanmar. Pakistan, Bangaldesh and Afghanistan are not the only Islamic countries of the world. There are 54 members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries which have many Hindu residents, so why not include these countries too, he asked. The government had also chosen to ignore the long-standing refugee communities in our country comprising the Tibetans and the Tamil community from Sri Lanka, he said.

“The basic purpose of the government is to keep the nation and the people involved in this communal debate and not talk about the more basic issues of economy.”

The yatra will seek to re-direct the narrative on more pressing and basic problems of the perilous state of economy and the agrarian crisis, he said.

On the NRC, Mr. Sinha said the government was trying to create confusion with its double-speak. “The government has been lying repeatedly. Home Minister Amit Shah has repeatedly said both inside and outside Parliament that it will be implemented and all ghupaitye [infiltrators] will be weeded out. And now the Prime Minister says his government never spoke about the NRC. It’s a blatant lie,” Mr. Sinha said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/rl3ypn/article26946382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BM----shoumojGC9546HP83jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-omits-muslim-community-to-humiliate-them-yashwant-sinha/article30486735.ece
119,2020/01/05,A shock for BJP ally IPFT as top leader joins Cong.,"The Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), an ally of ruling BJP in Tripura, received a shock when one of its top leaders Budhirai Debbarma joined Congress on Sunday. Around 150 IPFT workers also joined the party, Congress tribal front leader Rajeshwar Debbarma claimed.

Acting PCC president Pijush Biswas handed over the Congress flag to Mr. Debbarma, who was the Chairman of the Central Advisory Committee of the IPFT, at the Congress Bhavan. After joining, Mr. Debbarma claimed the IPFT has lost credibility among the indigenous community.

“It has fooled people with separate tribal state [Tipraland] plank. It has lost the trust of the indigenous people,” he opined.

He envisaged a big win for the Congress in the elections to the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) likely to be held in February.

Congress leader Rajeshwar Debbarma said a large number of IPFT leaders and workers would soon desert it to join his party.

The IPFT has announced an indefinite stir to demand withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and implementation of the NRC in Tripura. Party leader Shuklacharan Noatia said they would hold protests at Khumulwng, headquarters of the TTAADC.

The agitation programme was seen as a ploy to pacify a section of leaders who felt the IPFT had failed to raise a strong voice on the contentious CAA.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-shock-for-bjp-ally-ipft-as-top-leader-joins-cong/article30486639.ece
120,2020/01/05,CIC website inaccessible again outside India,"While the website of the Central Information Commission (CIC) has been inaccessible in many countries since the beginning of the year, Chief Information Commissioner Sudhir Bhargava says there has been no policy decision to block the website outside India.

The CIC is the highest appeal body under the Right To Information (RTI) Act. Its website, cic.gov.in, offers facilities to file appeals online, as well as a database of all appeals and decisions. The RTI Act specifies that “all citizens shall have the right to information”, which would include non-resident citizens.

On Sunday, Indian citizens living in the United States, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Vietnam told The Hindu they could not access the site. RTI activist Commodore Lokesh Batra (retd), currently in the U.S., said he had been unable to access the site when trying to file an appeal on New Year’s Day, and had informed CIC officials as well as National Informatics Centre (NIC) officials maintaining the site on January 2.

On Facebook posts over the weekend, social media users noted that the site was also inaccessible in Canada, Australia, Germany, Dubai and Singapore.

However, Mr Bhargava told The Hindu, “It is just a glitch,” adding that no specific decision has been taken to make the website inaccessible outside India.

Commodore Batra says this is not the first time access to the website has been denied outside India. After a similar instance in August 2018, he had filed an RTI request seeking the reasons behind the denial.

The response to his query from the CIC’s public information officer merely said: “Due to some unknown technical error, the access to the CIC website through some of the channels was not available,” adding that once the issue was brought to the notice of the NIC, it had been corrected. It also said no instructions or policy communications had been issued by the government to block the website.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gm2bp0/article30487824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Central-Information-Commission,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cic-website-inaccessible-again-outside-india/article30486520.ece
121,2020/01/05,Army to sign MoU for AK-203 assault rifles in a month,"The Army is likely to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in a month for the procurement of over 7.5 lakh AK-203 assault rifles, which are to be manufactured locally by an India-Russia joint venture (JV), a Defence source said.

“About 1 lakh rifles will come directly from Russia and the remaining will be manufactured by the JV in India. The MoU should be signed in a month,” a Defence official said.

Inter-governmental

The rifles will be manufactured by the Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL) at Korwa in Uttar Pradesh. The facility is being set up between the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) from the Indian side, and Rosoboron Exports and Kalashnikov on the Russian side. The OFB owns 50.5% equity and Russian side holds the remaining 49.5%. The JV was formed following the Inter-governmental Agreement between India and Russia in February 2019.

To have oversight over the process and ensure timely deliveries, the Army has appointed Major General Sanjeev Senger as the Chief Executive Officer of IRRPL. Officials said the JV has obtained all the requisite licences for production and export. The Ministry of Defence has already floated a Request For Proposal (RFP) to the JV for the supply of 6.71 lakh rifles.

Reviewing the operationalisation of the project few months back, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had stressed on the need “for 100% indigenisation of the rifle as per the project understanding, and focusing on the export of the rifles from IRRPL to other friendly countries”.

Other small arms

In addition to the AK-203, the Army recently began inducting the first batch of 10,000 SIG-716 assault rifles. Troops engaged in counter insurgency operations in the Army’s Northern Command have started receiving these rifles, sources said. The rifles are being procured under a contract signed in February 2019 with Sig Sauer of the U.S. for 72,400 SIG-716 assault rifles worth over ₹700 crore.

The initial idea was to equip the entire Army with the SIG-716, one officer said. He added that given the huge cost, it was decided that the rifles would be provided to frontline troops, while the remaining forces can be equipped with AK-203 rifles. “It was decided based on the requirement,” he stated.

Replacing INSAS

The Army has been looking to replace the indigenous INSAS (Indian National Small Arms System) rifles in use with a modern rifle. The MoD had approved the procurement in January 2018 through the Fast Track Procurement route. Of the 72,400 rifles, 66,400 are for the Army, 2,000 for the Navy and 4,000 for the Air Force. The entire quantity is expected to be delivered within 12 months from the date of signing the contract.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/wi4z3d/article30487789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-ak-203-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-to-sign-mou-for-ak-203-assault-rifles-in-a-month/article30486064.ece
122,2020/01/05,Analysis | India faces a year of tough trade negotiations,"After walking out of negotiations on the 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement, the government said it would renegotiate its existing Free Trade Agreements (FTA) and redouble its efforts to conclude other trade negotiations. The task is likely to swamp both the Commerce and Industries Ministry (CIM) and the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) negotiators in 2020.

To begin with, the RCEP walkout isn’t cast in stone yet, as the other 15 countries including 10 ASEAN members (Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos) and their FTA partners China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, will complete legal reviews by June and are only expected to sign the deal in November 2020.

In the interim, many countries, most notably, Japan, Australia and even China, have said they would be keen to work with India to convince the government to rejoin RCEP. The issue was due to come up when Japanese PM Shinzo and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison — both of whom have had to cancel visits to India in the past month — reschedule their trips and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

EU-India summit

While the RCEP is being wrapped up, India’s long-pending negotiations with Australia for a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), as well as Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s plans to reopen existing FTAs with ASEAN, Japan and South Korea will have to take a backseat.

The next big trade focus for the government will be during the EU-India summit expected in March, when Mr. Modi is expected to travel to Brussels, to meet the new European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, and discuss restarting EU-India Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) talks. However, this is easier said than done, given that the talks that began in 2007 and stalled in 2013 over tariff issues, have not been resumed despite several efforts.

A possible new trade deal, with the U.K., will become a possibility when Britain concludes the Brexit process this year, and talks might start when Mr. Modi travels to Glasgow for COP26 in November and meets Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Bridging gap with U.S.

Finally, the CIM and MEA will focus on closing talks with U.S. Trade Representatives. In 2019, President Trump rescinded India’s GSP special status for exporters, which has led to more bitterness over the issue. Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump discussed the trade issues on two occasions when they met in 2019, but negotiators have been unable to forge any kind of deal, despite visits by Mr. Goyal to the U.S.

In the New Year, both sides hope that a package of smaller agreements can be announced soon, but a free trade agreement could be several years away, as it hasn’t even been discussed officially yet.

Dedicated team

Given all the challenges, the government is actively considering a sharper and leaner trade negotiating team that merges the best strengths of CIM officials and MEA diplomats, on the lines of countries with a consolidated Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The team will have to contend with the shift in the global economic climate in the face of slowdowns worldwide, the dilution of the WTO’s arbitration powers and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.

There is also a perceived increase in anti-immigrant sentiments, and India will not be able to drive as hard a bargain as it would like on services exports, in exchange for allowing more market access to goods imports.

With the world being carved up into regional trading blocs like EU, NAFTA (for North America), MERCOSUR (South America), GCC (Gulf Countries) and RCEP (South-East Asia), and India’s only regional Bloc, for SAARC nations (SAFTA) stalled, the odds of concluding more bilateral trading agreements will be that much harder in 2020.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4asw4g/article30486060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30-PM-G20-LEAGGC52CL5T4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-delhi-faces-a-year-of-tough-trade-negotiations/article30486054.ece
123,2020/01/05,"BJP starts door-to-door campaign on CAA in Haryana, Chandigarh","To garner support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday kicked-off the BJP’s “Sampark Abhiyan” campaign here.

The Chief Minister visited the houses of a few people and informed them about the Act.

Addressing a gathering, Mr. Khattar hit out at the Congress and other Opposition parties accusing them of spreading misinformation. “The CAA has been passed by Parliament to provide citizenship to the minorities coming from neighbouring countries that are being oppressed there in the name of religion. But a few Opposition parties are misguiding the people by spreading false information without understanding its provisions,” he said.

He said it was being propagated among the Muslims that it was a law to take away their citizenship, whereas in reality, it was to give citizenship.

Condemning the attack and stone-pelting on Sikh devotees at the historic Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, Mr. Khattar said a protest would be registered, if required, against Pakistan and other countries like Afghanistan and Bangladesh to ensure that the minorities residing there were not oppressed in the name of religion and their rights were protected.

In Chandigarh, Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur started the door-to-door campaign by meeting people in Sector 38 west location of the city.

124,2020/01/05,2019 recorded most number of stone throwing incidents in Jammu and Kashmir,"The year 2019 recorded the maximum number of stone throwing incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, compared to the years 2017 and 2018, according to data provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in response to a Right to Information (RTI) Act application. There was a spike in the numbers post August, the month in which J&K’s special status was revoked, as it witnessed 658 such incidents, the highest in the year. The previous month of July saw 26 such incidents.

J&K has been placed under unprecedented restrictions and a communication lock down since August 5, when Home Minister Amit Shah moved two Bills in the Rajya Sabha to revoke its special status under Article 370 of the Constitution, and bifurcate and downgrade the State into two Union Territories.

2017, 2018

In the years 2017 and 2018, the number of stone pelting incidents stood at 1,412 and 1,458 respectively. Till November 30 last year, as many as 1,996 such incidents had been reported.

On November 19, while responding to a question by Member of Parliament Kanakmal Katara on the number of stone-pelting incidents reported after Article 370 was repealed, the MHA informed the Lok Sabha that from January 1-November 15, 2019, the police had registered 551 cases “relating to stone pelting/ law & order,” of which 190 were registered post August 5.

Terrorist violence

According to the MHA, in response to an RTI filed by Jammu resident Rohit Choudhary, the number of incidents of terrorist violence from January-November 2019 stood at 591, with the most number of incidents — 152 — reported in the month of September.

The MHA had informed the Lok Sabha in a written reply on December 3 that “the incidents of terrorist violence have declined after August 5”.

“During the 115 day period, from August 5 till November 27, there have been 88 such incidents as compared to 106 such incidents from April 12 till August 4,” MHA said in a written reply.

The RTI reply shows that from January-July, the number incidents of terrorist violence stood at 282, while 309 incidents were reported from August-November.

‘Under control’

Union Home Minister Amit Shah told ABP News last week that the situation was “under control” in J&K and routine activities were going on.

The RTI reply also said that 3,086 ceasefire violations or firing from Pakistan’s side had been reported along the Line of Control (LoC), with the most number — 398 — recorded in October.

There had been a drop in the number of militants killed, from 131 killed in January-July to 26 killed in August-November. The number of militants arrested stood at 109, with 47 arrested in the months of August-November.

The government, which usually notifies forms for filing income tax returns by individuals in April every year, on January 3 notified tax return forms for assessment year 2020-21 (income earning year April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020).

Returns in ITR-1 Sahaj can be filed by an ordinarily resident individual whose total income does not exceed ₹50 lakh, while Form ITR-4 Sugam is meant for resident individuals, HUFs and firms (other than LLP) having a total income of up to ₹50 lakh and having presumptive income from business and profession.

According to the notification, two major changes in the ITR forms have been effected. First, an individual taxpayer cannot file return either in ITR-1 or ITR4 if he is a joint-owner in house property.

Secondly, ITR-1 form is not valid for those individuals who have deposited more than ₹1 crore in bank account or have incurred ₹2 lakh or ₹1 lakh on foreign travel or electricity respectively, it said.

Such taxpayers will have to use different forms, which will be notified in due course.

An individual who “owns a house property in joint ownership with two or more persons” is required to furnish a return of income, the notification said.

“Only the forms have been notified without the return filing utility. Thus, a taxpayer, who is required to file the return before the previous year ends, cannot do so until the return filing facility is activated on the e-filing portal,” said Naveen Wadhwa of Taxmann.

Usually, the Income Tax Department notifies the ITR forms in the first week of April of the relevant assessment year. However, in contrast to the old practice, it has notified two ITR forms ITR-1 and ITR-4 for the assessment year 2020-21 in the first week of January.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/yccx7x/article30485596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-income-tax-itr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/simple-itr-1-income-tax-return-form-not-for-those-paying-1-lakh-in-electricity-bill-owning-house-jointly/article30485556.ece

The incident took place around 9.45 a.m. between Khadawali and Titwala stations, located about 60 km from Mumbai, when the train was coming from Rajendra Nagar (in Patna) to the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Mumbai, he said.

As the train’s loco pilot, S. Murugan, noticed a fracture in the rail track, he immediately applied emergency brakes to stop the train and informed the railway authorities about it, he said.

“The track was rectified and later declared safe. The train passed the site at 10.16 a.m. with a restricted speed of 10 kmph,” Central Railway’s chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said, adding that Mr. Murugan will be rewarded for his alertness.

Some suburban and long distance trains on the Central Railway’s main line were delayed because of the incident.

In rail fractures, the track develops a crack and sometimes small portions break into pieces.

According to railway officials, sudden temperature fluctuations is one of the major reasons for this, besides other causes like material quality.

130,2020/01/05,India condemns killing of Sikh youth in Pakistan’s Peshawar,"India on Sunday strongly condemned the murder of a Sikh citizen of Pakistan in Peshawar and urged the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan to stop attacks on religious minorities in the country.

A press statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) pointed out Islamabad’s inaction regarding several cases of violence against Sikhs and urged Pakistan to punish the perpetrators.

“India strongly condemns the targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar that follows the recent despicable vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurudwara Sri Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib. The Government of Pakistan should act in defence of their own minorities instead of preaching sermons about it to other countries,” a press release issued by the MEA said. The statement also highlighted the case of Sikh girl, Jagjit Kaur of Nankana Sahib who was allegedly abducted and forcibly married.

India’s condemnation came soon after Ravinder Singh was killed by miscreants in Peshawar.

In a social media message, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, said: “Shocked and anguished over killing of Sikh youth Ravinder Singh in Pakistan coming on heels of Nankana Sahib attack. Imran Khan government must ensure (a) thorough investigation and strict punishment for the culprits. This is the time to act on what you preach.”

Mr. Yadav, who visited the residence of Mohammad Wakil killed during an anti-CAA protest in the State capital, said, “He [Wakil] was not involved in the agitation. The government should probe as to whose bullet hit him. They [police] have the post-mortem report now.”

“All the deaths during the agitation in the State were caused by police bullets,” he said.

Also Read SP promises pension for citizenship law protesters

Mr. Yadav also demanded compensation, a house and jobs for Wakil’s family, currently living in a rented accommodation.

He said families of those killed during the protests should be given adequate compensation.

The U.P. police initially claimed that none of the deaths were caused by police firing, but subsequently admitted some casualties when cops fired in “self defence”. Officials have put the death toll at 19 in widespread clashes in the State, though opposition parties claim a higher figure.

Mr. Yadav said that if the government wanted to make persons from another country its citizens, then why not give this same “right” to Muslims. “This is because you [BJP] want to divide the society and play politics. Every Indian is against the CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019] and the NRC [National Register of Citizens]. When Aadhaar has all the information, why the NPR [National Population Register]?” he asked.

“In a village, who has papers? From where will I bring the date of birth paper of my mother. The government wants the people to only search for papers and not do daily chores,” he said.

Referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s disobedience movement, Mr. Yadav said they will use a similar strategy of “Satyagraha” by refusing to fill the form.

Noting that people from all castes and religions were coming out against the CAA and the NPR, Mr. Yadav said, “The BJP knows its decision is wrong and against the Constitution.”

Asked to comment on the BJP’s campaign in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said it was to “mislead” people. “The BJP is misleading the people. What will they tell the people now? They could not convince us in Parliament. Now, they have come out to mislead the people,” he said.

“We will talk to youngsters to clear if there is any confusion about the act but not with those who are talking about Azadi and are part of tukde tukde gang,” Mr. Prasad said.

He said the government has repeatedly said this law doesn’t apply on current Indian citizens. Even Congress leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on various occasions have talked about the need for giving citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs and people from other persecuted minorities which came to India from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Mr. Shah said minorities in the country had nothing to fear as the Act did not have any provision to take away anyone’s citizenship. “I want to tell brothers and sisters from the minority communities that none of them can lose their citizenship because the CAA has no provision about taking it away,” Mr. Shah said.

At a meeting of party workers in Delhi, Mr. Shah attacked Pakistan for “terrorising” Sikhs as he referred to the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by a violent mob in Pakistan and asked Opposition leaders to open their eyes to atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.

“This is an answer to all those opposing the CAA. Tell me if these Sikhs who were attacked the other day in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib will not come to India, then where they will go” he asked.

The BJP president directed party workers to reach out to every household in Delhi about the features of the Act, which, he said, was an attempt to give citizenship to Dalit and Sikh refugees who had come from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Opposition leaders were spreading a pack of lies over the CAA, he said.

Mr. Shah attacked Mr. Kejriwal and the Congress leaders, terming them “anti-Dalits” for opposing the Act.

“Prime minister came out with CAA. It was approved by the Cabinet and Parliament passed it. (Arvind) Kejriwal misled people; the Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, instigated riots by misleading people. Do you want a government in Delhi which incites riots for politics,” he asked.

The BJP leader claimed that Ms. Vadra had extended her support to rioters by saying that she would visit the houses of those who carried out riots.

‘Not a Netflix number’

Mr. Shah asked people to give missed calls to a toll free number put out by the BJP to show their support for the CAA. He slammed rumours that the number belonged to Netflix, a streaming service.

The number has run into controversy after it was found that several Twitter accounts were advertising it as a means to get free subscriptions on Netflix and to chat with “lonely women”, among other scams.

Most of the children were returned due to adjustment issues which is seen mainly in case of older children (over 8 years of age), according to a senior Central Adoption Resource Authority official.

According to information accessed by PTI through an RTI, the highest number of children were returned in 2014-15.

A total of 387 out of a total of 4,362 adopted children were returned in 2014-15 while in 2015-16 a total of 236 out of a total of 3,677 adopted children were returned by adoptive parents, the RTI data showed.

In 2016-17, a total of 195 out of 3,788 adopted children were returned while in 2017-18 a total of 153 out of a total of 3,927 adopted children were returned by adoptive parents, the data showed.

In 2018-19, a total of 133 out of 4,027 children were returned by adoptive parents, the data showed.

The CARA official said about half of the older children who are adopted are returned by parents due to “adjustment issues”

He stressed on the need to prepare children for child care institutions.

“At child care institutions, children are groomed in a different way. They have to be prepared and counselled to stay and adjust with families,” he said.

He further said that in many cases it is seen that children have developed a strong bonding with their caretaker at child care institutions due to which it becomes very difficult for them to leave them and move into a family.

The official said that families also need to be prepared for taking care of the children.

“Even the parents have to be counselled and prepared. The parents think that as soon as they bring a child they would put him in an age specific class and the child should start putting in effort due to which the child feels he was better off there at the CCI with his or her friends and he expresses a desire to come back to the institution,” he said.

The official also stressed on the need to build social infrastructure at the ground level.

“Each state is supposed to have state social welfare board but these have become defunct in most of the states, if these infrastructures are energised and put in place then service can be delivered but that is yet to be made operational on ground,” he said.

He said CARA, the nodal body of adoption, is conducting a study to look at ways to prevent it.

Among states, the highest number of children were returned in the last five years from Maharashtra at 273 followed by Madhya Pradesh at 92, Odisha at 88, and Karnataka at 60, the data showed.

Dr. Nimish G Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, said this experience can be “very traumatic” for the adopted children.

“Children living at child care institutions already have a rough experience of rejection early in his or her life and this (returning back to CCIs or shelter homes) will only further add to it,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25f50n/article24454292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-1100-adopted-children-returned-to-child-care-institutions-in-last-five-years/article30483915.ece

Under the Bill, it is aimed at getting medical reports, expediting investigation and completing trial in 21 days after registration of the case and awarding punishment to the convicts.

However, investigation and trial in many cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the sexual assault cases booked under Section 376 of the IPC have been pending for long. Verdict has not been given even in a single case.

“The girl’s mother, who is A-2 (Accused No.2) in the case, allegedly abetted the crime. another woman of Paritala village helped the accused by providing accommodation for committing the crime,” said Krishna Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu.

“Nandigama DSP G.V. Ramana Murthy, who is investigating the Kanchikacharla case, filed the charge-sheet in just 12 days. Trial schedule in the case will begin soon,” the SP said.

Guntur Urban SP P.H.D. Ramakrishna told The Hindu on Sunday that the charge-sheet had been filed in three working days after registering the case, which was a record in the country.

“Trial began in the case on December 27. A sum of ₹9 lakh has been given as compensation to the victim’s family, which included ₹5 lakh from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Seven officers, who included two DSPs, two CIs and three SIs, worked on the case,” Mr. Ramakrishna said.

Disha Bill

DGP D. Gautam Sawang, who conducted a coordination meeting recently with the line departments, said all measures were being taken to enforce the A.P. Disha Bill within the stipulated time-frame.

Disha Special Officer Kritika Shukla said that 13 Disha Courts and as many Disha Mahila Police Stations, and Disha Centres (One-Stop Centres) and Disha Medical Centres would be set up January 31.

The police said that 830 POCSO cases had been registered in 2016, 1,069 in 2017, 1,229 in 2018 and about 1,080 (up to November end) in 2019 in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/probe-trial-in-many-pocso-sexual-assault-cases-pending/article30488171.ece
138,2020/01/05,"Centre too has a stake in Amaravati, says Kanna","Demanding that the Legislative Assembly and Secretariat be retained in Amaravati and plans evolved to transform Visakhapatnam into a financial and IT hub, BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana said on Sunday that the Central government and other institutions/agencies had stakes in the development of the Capital city.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should keep it in mind before taking decisions that would have long-term implications, he said while addressing the media here.

‘Think about consequences’

The Centre had spent ₹2,500 crore on Amaravati and the State government ₹5,500 crore. The farmers had given 33,000 acres of fertile land for constructing Amaravati, he said.

But, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was least bothered about the consequences of shifting the Capital to Visakhapatnam in the name of Executive capital, he said, and added that the Chief Minister was oblivious to the support he had extended to Amaravati in the Assembly.

He was acting as per his whims and fancies to the detriment of the future of five crore people of the State at a time when it was grappling with the impact of bifurcation, he observed.

Mr. Lakshminarayana said the BJP was for decentralisation of development and not scattering of the functions of the Capital. It should be noted that land was acquired in Amaravati for 130 Central government institutions. There were many others who had high stakes in the existing Capital project.

“But the CM is apparently bent on implementing his plans without pondering over the outcome of his ill-advised actions,” he alleged.

‘Blow to farmers’

He should not shift the Capital city from the Vijayawada-Guntur region lest the farmers who gave their lands should suffer a devastating blow. Such a move would also flare up regional feelings, he cautioned.

On the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Mr. Lakshminarayana said the Opposition parties were deliberately creating confusion.

“An awareness campaign on it will be on up to January 12 to dispel the notion that the CAA is harmful to the Muslim community,” he stated, asserting that it was not at all intended to rob them of their rights in any manner.

Earlier, Mr. Lakshminarayana and other leaders distributed pamphlets as part of the campaign at Christurajapuram and LIC Colony areas.

140,2020/01/05,BJP leader lauds Jagan’s ‘Executive’ idea,"After the TDP and the JSP, there is division of opinion in the BJP too over the proposal of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital of the State.

Senior BJP leader and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju on Sunday said he favoured the move to develop Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital.

“The city has everything. From the beginning, I have been saying that the city is the ideal choice,” he told reporters who met him, and blamed former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for committing a blunder by deciding to develop Amaravati.

Earlier, TDP MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao had supported the move to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital. On Saturday, JSP’s lone MLA Rapaka Varaprasad said he was in favour of three capitals.

Mr. Raju, while backing Amaravati as Legislative capital, opposed the move to make Kurnool the Judicial capital. “Just by shifting the High Court one cannot give the capital tag to the city located in Rayalaseema,” Mr. Raju observed.

‘Ready-made infrastructure’

“To create two lakh square feet space with air-conditioning facility and provide other amenities in Visakhapatnam will require just ₹2,000 crore. To start operations, Rushikonda area has a few vacant buildings in the IT Special Economic Zone. The area also has two super-structures of Millennium Tower built by the government,” Mr. Raju pointed out.

Making it clear that it was his personal opinion, Mr. Raju said the graphics shown by Mr. Naidu on Amaravati was a “tactical blunder.”

“I am happy that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is undoing the wrong by floating the idea considering the infrastructure available in Visakhapatnam,” he said.

The Government of India had opined that ₹5,000 crore would be needed to create a Capital in Amaravati, he claimed.

‘Unnecessary hype’

Mr. Naidu had created a hype and envisaged its long-term development under self-finance mode with a massive investment of ₹1 lakh crore knowing well that the coffers were empty, he alleged.

A luxurious capital could be created with ₹5,000 crore, Mr. Raju said, and wondered how a State with resource constraint could think of investing ₹1 lakh crore at a place where the construction cost was high due to loose soil.

On reports submitted by the expert committees led by former IAS officer G.N. Rao and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the BJP leader said, “Even if more committees are constituted, they will certainly back the demand for making Visakhapatnam the Capital.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-leader-lauds-jagans-executive-idea/article30488099.ece

The seized contraband was worth about ₹70 lakh and the vehicles used for transport were valued at ₹62 lakh, Nellore Superintendent of Police Bharat Bhushan told a media conference here on Sunday.

The accused were remanded in custody on Sunday.

The 52-year-old Anji Babu, who had been shuttling between Chennai and Bengaluru and evading arrest for a long time, was nabbed by a special police team at Labour Colony at Nelaturu, near Muthukur on Saturday besides five of the 23 other accused in connection with smuggling of banned tobacco products from Karnataka to various places in Nellore, Prakasam and West Godavari districts for further distribution, the SP said.

In all, 10 kg of ganja and 11.38 lakh packets of guktha and other banned tobacco products of different brands were seized. The others nabbed were T. Mahendra (39), Suman (29), Chinnapareddy Rajendra (50), G. Srinivaslu Reddy (38) and C. Vijayakumar(22), all from Nellore district.

The SP said Mr. Anji Babu had entered the banned gutka, tobacco products and ganja business in 2014. In 2017, he was arrested by Red Hills Police in Tamil Nadu. After this, he shifted his illicit operations to Bengaluru and distributed the contraband initially in SPSR Nellore district and then extended it to Prakasam and West Godavari districts.

The Minister inaugurated a ₹25 lakh safe drinking water plant at Patrapalle village of Gurukuvaripalle panchayat in Tavanampalle mandal and sanctioned ₹1 crore for the development of Gurukuvaripalle panchayat. The plant has been sponsored by Chennai-based industrialist Gurukuvari Prakash Reddy in the village, his native place, in memory of his father Changal Reddy.

Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said that in order to strengthen the rural infrastructure, particularly safe drinking water projects, the State government had allocated ₹50 crore to each Assembly constituency. The Gurukuvari family had been actively engaged in social service and rural development covering the entire mandal for the last four decades. He told Mr. Prakash Reddy to monitor the developmental activities of the government in the mandal and come up with suggestions.

Mr. Prakash Reddy said that he was inspired by the vision of his late father, who remained an advocate of rural development all through his life. He promised to provide more safe drinking water plants in the mandal.

Later, speaking to the media, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy observed that more industrialists should come forward to sponsor developmental activities in their native places.

Venkatesh claimed that the Congress, Left parties and the MIM were lying to the people about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The Opposition parties were inciting communal tensions in the country for political gain, he alleged.

Mr. Venkatesh launched an awareness campaign on CAA in the city on Sunday. Talking to mediapersons, he stressed on the secular fabric of the country and claimed that no Muslim citizen of India would be inconvenienced by the CAA. “The Act only aims to give citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” he said.

“The religious minorities in Muslim-dominated countries are being persecuted,” he said.

The MP later claimed that the Hindu population in Pakistan had come down to 1.6% in 2011 as opposed to 15% in 1947. “On the other hand, Muslims in India have grown from 9% of the population in 1947 to 15% in 2011,” he claimed.

He, however, evaded the questions pertaining to giving refuge and citizenship to persecuted Rohingya Muslims.

Responding to a query about the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), Mr. Venkatesh claimed that there is no link between CAA and NRC and that Indian Muslims could rest easy in this regard.

Mr. Venkatesh later announced that a pro-CAA rally would be held in the city on January 9. He released a brochure made by the BJP in Telugu which claims to ‘debunk’ the ‘myths’ around the CAA.

146,2020/01/05,‘Andhra Pradesh has highest Infant Mortality Rate in South’,"Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in Andhra Pradesh continues to be 34 per 1,000 live births and it is double compared to neighbouring State Tamil Nadu where IMR is only 17 per 1,000 as per Niti Aayog data and studies of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) which is one of the India’s oldest associations established in 1963 in Mumbai. The IMR is 10 in Kerala, 24 in Karnataka and 31 in Telangana. Although Andhra Pradesh has best medical facilities in almost all 13 districts, death of infants could not be controlled due to various reasons.

Death of Infants below one year of age will come under IMR category. Speaking to The Hindu, IAP-AP chapter president D.V. Srikanth said IMR could be reduced to a significant level with the concerted efforts of all paediatricians in association with the government agencies.

“Many paediatricians hesitate to take up critical cases and operations for infants born with multiple complications. Instead of referring the cases to super-specialty hospitals, they should take the responsibility with confidence to save precious lives since golden hour plays a key role in treatment,” he added.

‘Continuing medical education’

“To achieve this, IAP has given top priority for continuing medical education to young paediatricians under Yuva-CME programme. Different chapters were started for sharing knowledge in intensive care, infectious diseases, paediatric cardiology, nephrology and others. The doctors with specialised subjects will meet frequently to exchange ideas and discuss advanced technology in handling critical cases of infant patients,” he added.

He said that malnutrition and anaemia among the mothers and infants were the root causes for many health complications “The mothers are unable to ensure proper breastfeeding to the kids. That is many infants are affected by diseases in the absence of required immunity. Continuous healthcare during pregnancy will lead to delivery of healthy babies. It ensures their survival and reduce IMR in Andhra Pradesh. All the 4,000 paediatricians in 13 districts should vow to reduce IMR in Andhra Pradesh,” said Dr. Srikanth.

Two best branches

IAP-India selected A.P. as one of the two best branches in the country for taking up intensive studies with sub-committees over infant diseases. Dr. Srikanth, who will receive the award on January 8 in Indore of Madhya Pradesh, submit a detailed report to the national body over child health index in Andhra Pradesh.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7uxdih/article30486005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06-VJ-IAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/infant-mortality-rate-highest-in-state-in-south-india-iap/article30486006.ece

CM Jagan Mohan Reddy to it,"The Wikipedia page of Boston, Massachusetts, the US-based global managment consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) had been reportedly defaced by users in an apparent attempt to spread misinformation about the company’s credentials.

This came after BCG India representatives submitted their report ‘Strengthening Andhra Pradesh through balanced and inclusive growth’ to the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on January 3 in line with the State’s idea of splitting capital functions for decentralised development. The edits have now been reverted by Wikipedia volunteers but the edited content is being spread on social media platforms.

A dozen trick

The company’s page which is open for users to ‘update’ and ‘improve’ has been edited at least 12 times on Friday and Saturday.

Initially, an unidentified user changed the name of the company as ‘Boston Buffoon Consulting Group’, and added the names of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and V. Vijayasai Reddy as founders of the 57-year-old company alongside its founder Bruce Henderson.

Makes Jagan 50% shareholder

Also, the text “Jagan Mohan Reddy has 50 per cent share in Boston Consulting Group” has been added to the Company Description part on the page. Though the current version of the page doesn’t show the edits, the older versions available under ‘view history’ section reveal the changes made to the page.

The issue also highlights the vulnerability of Wikipedia which allows any user (including unregistered) to edit the content without verification. However, pages that were locked couldn't be edited.

No information is safe

“Wikipedia seriously needs to protect the community standards. Wikipedia has become a tool for such misinformation. Is any information safe anymore?,” questioned Brahma, a Twitter user who posted the changes made to the BCG page.

On Saturday, Leader of the Opposition and TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu called the BCG India’s report rubbish.

Aagama Sastras the last word

Condemning the alleged reports of proselytisation in strongest terms he said the famous hill shrine has always been governed by Aagama sastras, and will continue to do so even in the future. “No violation of any kind will either be tolerated or ignored.

Rajendra, a resident of Rajiv Colony of Vempalle town, grew suspicious of his second wife Krishida, who delivered a girl child three months back. He had been fighting with her that the baby did not belong to him.

On Friday, on not finding the baby, the mother searched in the vicinity, and finally lodged a complaint with the Vempalle police.

154,2020/01/05,"President may take action against States for non-implementation of CAA, says R.K. Singh","“The President of India could take action against States if they failed to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),” Union Minister of State for Power R.K. Singh said here on Sunday.

He asserted that as citizenship was a Central subject, States were duty-bound to implement it. Mr Singh was speaking to media persons after releasing a brochure at the BJP office here in connection with Jana Jagaran Sampark Abhiyan campaign.

CAA for persecuted minorities

While accusing the Opposition of spreading falsehoods on it, Mr. Singh clarified that CAA was meant to give citizenship to Hindus and other minorities who were being driven out after persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Mr. Singh, a former IAS officer who served as Union Home Secretary, averred the CAA was not meant to take away citizenship of any person.

States bound by the Constitution

On statements by Kerala and West Bengal Governments against the CAA, Mr. Singh said they were bound by the Constitution. “If they don’t implement, the President of India may come to the conclusion that there is break down of constitutional machinery,” he remarked.

He said as part of campaign to educate people against the lies being spread by the Congress and other parties on CAA, they were holding door-to-door campaign across the country and had recently launched a missed call number 8866288662 to garner support for the Act.

Shias and Ahmedias will be considered

When asked whether the government would provide citizenship to Shias and Ahmedias being persecuted in some countries, he said: “If they seek citizenship, we would certainly consider on a case- -to-case basis.”

Mr. Singh pointed out that the number of minorities after Partition in 1947 in Pakistan had come down from a little over 19 per cent to 1.9 per cent due to persecution and coercion. “Do not to go by the fear psychosis being created by the Congress and other Opposition parties,” he appealed to the minorities.

When the TDP announced an all-party meeting at Rayadurg, YSRCP MLA representing the constituency Kapu Ramachandra Reddy expressed his desire to participate in it.

But the police, anticipating clashes between the YSRCP and TDP workers, stopped the MLA from proceeding to the venue and locked the function hall, preventing the TDP from organising the roundtable.

158,2020/01/05,High drama precedes JC bail,"High drama preceded the release of former Anantapur MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy on anticipatory bail on Saturday night, with one person, Prakash, attempting self-immolation and the police arresting TDP leaders B.K. Parthasarathy, Palle Raghunatha Reddy and Eeranna for staging dharna outside the police station. TDP workers and leaders raised slogans outside the police station main gate and the former MLAs sought to meet Mr. Diwakar Reddy, but were not allowed by the police.

Mr. Reddy, who got anticipatory bail from the High Court, had come to the Anantapur Rural Police Station at 11.30 a.m. and was released on conditional bail at 7.30 p.m. Police Inspector D. Muralidhar Reddy said they were following the procedure of getting sureties from five persons and confirming those documents, which took time. “I do not fear police atrocities, you can foist any number of cases on me, but remember that there will be equal and opposite reaction to every action by the police,” Mr. Diwakar Reddy said after his release. “I went to the police station on my own with court orders, but they harassed me by detaining me without any reason,” he said, and thanked the party leaders who showed solidarity with him. “I was not allowed to go home to take medicines and meals,” he alleged.

Mr. Diwakar Reddy termed the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government as one of the worst. He sought dismissal of the government by the PM. “I am happy that they did not beat me.

159,2020/01/05,“Chittoor Gandhi” distributes blankets to the needy,"Distributing blankets to the needy at hospitals, hostels, railway stations and bus stands during harsh winter nights might give one a sense of satisfaction. But, according to Parvathareddi Parthasarathy Naidu, 77, of Chittoor city, a social worker, popularly known as Chittoor Gandhi, “you will only understand the glory and importance of a blanket when you place it on those who are really without one, shivering under tree-shades and away from concrete shelters.”

Since two decades, the septuagenarian has adopted a novel way of reaching out to the underprivileged, mostly elderly and the destitute, carrying for them specially selected and cosy blankets, and he himself covers them with the prized winter gift.

Mr. Naidu took to distributing blankets when it came to his notice that an elderly couple, migrant labourers from Tamil Nadu, had died of cold near Kuppam a couple of decades ago.

The “Chittoor Gandhi” goes on a blanket distribution spree from December 16, with the onset of Dhanurmasam, till the second week of January, when it ends, every year when the winter would be at its peak. Several parts of the western mandals of Chittoor district witness dipping temperatures as low as 170 C.

Mr. Naidu takes the assistance of the youth, who take him around Chittoor city and its outskirts, on a motorbike. The septuagenarian would identify his targets, those without blankets or with ones in tatters. Mostly, his beneficiaries would be the blind, disabled and the elderly who are deserted by their families and roaming aimlessly. Though his annual action plan of blankets’ distribution would cover have-nots at the hospitals and public places, this particular practice of identifying those in dire need of them gives him immense satisfaction, Mr. Naidu says.

“When the winter peaks, our Naidu garu would embark on a long journey in his car, travelling as far as Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu, Mulbagal in Karnataka, Madanapalle, Tirupati, Srikalahasti and Nellore. Strangely, the timings of his ‘humanitarian prowl’ commence at 10 p.m. and go on till 6 a.m, screening the fog-engulfed sides of highways — for those shivering in cold, including children,” says Mani, 60, his personal driver since a decade.

“I have won good friends (blanket merchants) in Erode and Coimbatore since two decades. They always provide me with good stuff that generally last for a year, and at a special rate for me. It just gives me peace when I see those shivering in chill feel the warmth. I shall continue this winter journey till my last breath,” Mr. Naidu says.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/d6asmj/article30483584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/220993950col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chittoor-gandhi-distributes-blankets-to-the-needy/article30483585.ece
160,2020/01/05,"3,636 children rescued in special drive in Andhra Pradesh","In a massive drive, the Special Juvenile Police Units (SJPUs) in association with Labour, Women Development and Child Welfare (WD&CW), Education and other departments rescued 3,636 children during Operation Muskaan in the State on Saturday.

Following the directions of Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang, police formed about 1,000 teams and conducted drive at public places since dawn and rescued the children working in various establishments and in hazardous conditions.

The rescued kids also included runaway children and orphans.

“Of the total rescued, 3,039 were boys and 597 were girls. The victims are from Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other States,” the DGP said.

Instructions have been given to the Police Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to provide shelter and counselling and reunite them with their families.

“In case of children from other States, police will send them to their parents through the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) of the States concerned. We will take the help of Labour, Education, Juvenile Welfare and the WD&CW Department and follow the legal procedure in handing over the rescued children to their parents,” Mr. Sawang said.

Mr. Sawang said that cases would be registered against those who engage children for work. The education officers would admit the children in nearby schools, and the establishment owners would be booked for violating the Right to Education Act (RTE).

In bad shape

Vijayawada Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said a few rescued children in the city were in a very bad shape. They were unhygienic and anaemic.

“Out of 128 children rescued on Saturday, 122 are boys and the rest girls and they hailed from eight States. Police are studying the victims case by case. They will be handed over to their parents through CWC,” Mr. Tirumala Rao said.

The Krishna district police rescued 245 children, of which many were dropouts and some never enrolled in schools. More than 50 teams conducted the drive at bus and railway stations, parks and other public places, said Krishna SP M. Ravindranath Babu.

Counselled

In East Godavari district, 89 children were rescued. About 77 teams conducted the drive in hotels, shops, garages, cinema halls, restaurants and industries, said Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi.

“CWC member B. Padmavathi, District Child Protection Officer Ch. Venkat Rao, Assistant Labour Officer Tummala Nagalakshmi and DSPs of different wings counselled the children and their parents,” Mr. Nayeem said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/q9195n/article30483599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJMUSKAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3636-children-rescued-in-special-drive-in-state/article30481932.ece
161,2020/01/05,Chilly weather draws crowds to 'Andhra Kashmir',"The chilly weather at Lammasingi, in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam district, is drawing tourists in droves. The once nondescript tribal village, popularly known as ‘Lambasingi’, shot into limelight about a decade ago when the mercury level was said to have dropped to zero.

It subsequently earned the sobriquet ‘Andhra Kashmir’ and the rest is history. The temperature at Lambasingi is estimated based on the mercury levels at the Automatic Weather Station (AWS) and the manual observatory at the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Chintapalli. The temperature at Lambasingi is estimated to be about 20 C below that recorded at Chintapalli.

The lowest temperature of 1.50 C was recorded at Chintapalli on January 14, 2012, and again on December 31, 2018. Based on these readings, the temperature at Lambasingi was estimated at 00 C on those days.

Accommodation woes

Though the mercury has not dropped to that level, so far, in this year, tourists are making a beeline to Lambasingi to enjoy the chilly weather. The lack of adequate accommodation has been partly made up this year with a good number of tents coming up in the private sector, and four of them under the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).

However, not everyone would prefer to stay in a tent. Those going with their families and senior citizens would look for a more secure and cozy stay. The tourist rush is seen more during the weekends and holidays. The lack of public toilets is causing inconvenience to women tourists. Non-availability of parking spaces is resulting in haphazard parking on the roads, leading to traffic problems.

View hindered

There is a hillock, a little away from Lambasingi junction, which provides a breathtaking view of the natural landscape and is a photographer’s delight. It does not even have a pathway and only regular trekkers can climb the hillock. After reaching the top, there is no place to relax or take shelter. In the absence of public toilets, tourists are resorting to open defecation, spoiling the beauty of the place.

Many tourists are putting up for the night at Narsipatnam, located in the plain area, about 30 km away, and starting in the early hours to catch the sunrise at Lambasingi or at Tajangi reservoir, a couple of kilometres away.

A major attraction for the tourists is the private strawberry farms. The tourists cannot resist the farm-fresh strawberries being sold at ₹80 for a box of eight to 10. The farmers supply the strawberries to chain marketing stores.

Long way to go

“The temperatures are not very low so far this year. The APTDC has opened bamboo huts and a couple of private resorts have also come up. Though the accommodation has improved this year, it is still inadequate,” says Yesu Babu, president of Chaitanya Organisation.

“Single men and youths are coming to enjoy the chilly weather with a couple of drinks. The drunk drivers are causing road accidents and sometimes, they are indulging in crimes like robbing tourists. There is no police station for a stretch of 100 km from Narsipatnam to Chintapalli. A police outpost should be opened at Lambasingi to check such incidents,” he says.

“The tourist rush peaks during the season (November to January) but for the rest of the year, we hardly have any guests. Maintenance and payment of salaries to staff poses a major challenge during that time,” says Karri Satya Srinivas, proprietor of Saptagiri Resorts, located on the road to Chintapalli, about 4 km from Lambasingi. The 10-room facility has both small and big rooms, with attached baths.

Home-stay

B.S. Padal, a local man, who owns a two-bedroom house, is offering one of his rooms to tourists for ₹1,000 to ₹1,200 a night. “There is a separate toilet for guests and four persons can stay in the room. I charge between ₹1,500 and ₹2,000 for a group of six to eight persons,” he says.

He provides mattresses, blankets and pillows and also arranges food on order and campfire, if required, at an additional cost. “I own 15 acres of land and can utilise up to five acres for construction of a resort to meet the needs of tourists, provided banks extend loans,” says Mr. Padal.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/x9y0s0/article30481919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/220986809col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/out-in-the-cold/article30481921.ece
162,2020/01/05,Tents for the adventurous,"Have the spirit of adventure and wish to enjoy the wintry chill out in the open? Lammasingi, also known as Lambasingi, is the perfect place to be.

The lack of accommodation facilities to the large number of tourists coming during the winter months has made some adventure-lovers to bring their own camping equipment to pitch tents, a few years ago. The innovative idea seems to have caught the fancy of some local people, who started providing tents to make a fast buck during the peak season, while making up for the shortage of tourist accommodation.

One may shudder at the thought of sleeping in a tent in the cold and the possible threat from wild animals and snakes straying from the forests and hill slopes, a little away from the main road. The hikers light a bonfire outside the tents to keep wild animals at bay apart from keeping themselves warm from the biting cold.

What began with a couple of tents has grown into more than 50 such tents, mostly offered by the local people and private players, apart from four high-quality ones being offered by the A.P. Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC). The tents are in good demand, particularly during December and January, when Lambasingi records single-digit temperature.

Affordable tents

The most affordable tents are, however, provided by the villagers of Tajangi, at a nominal cost of ₹300 per person. The villagers, formed into the Tajangi Paryataka Vikas, and pitched 23 tents on government land. They are also contributing a part of the revenue to the village panchyat.

“We offer bed, pillow, bed sheet and blanket to our guests in the tent. The tent can be closed with a zip. We have also arranged six bathrooms apart from water heater for supply of hot water. The tourist rush is more this year compared to last year,” says M. Nagabushanam, a member of the committee.

163,2020/01/05,Amenities in Rampa Agency: still miles to go,"In the Rampa Agency, the drop in temperature is attracting people from across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, and Chattisgarh, but the absence of hygienic food and transportation facilities in the entire stretch of Maredumilli forests remains a hurdle in tapping the tourism potential.

At 1,350 feet above the Mean Sea Level at Volamuru village in the Maredumilli forest, the Forest Department recorded a temperature as low as 40 C in November 2018.

At Volamuru, the Forest Department runs a resort, Jungle Resort. The Horticulture Research Institute, Rampachodavaram, has recorded the season’s lowest temperature of 14.20 C on December 31, 2019.

Jungle Resort co-ordinator Veera Babu said: “Most of the tourists are coming from Hyderabad, Khammam, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari areas.”

However, there is no transport facility to the most sought-after places such as Gudisa grassland, Annato seed fields at Vollangi, and interior parts of the Papikonda National Park in the Rampa Agency.

Extremism

The Agency has potential to become the most sought-after tourist destination, but the existing social tension owing to the presence of Left Wing Extremism and proximity to the Red Corridor are forcing the governments to stop exploring its beauty and improve the tourism infrastructure.

Beginning with Maredumilli to Rampachodavaram, except in resorts, hygienic food is not available in the 20-km stretch of the forest cover via the national highway. The highway in the Agency connects Chhattisgarh and Odisha to Andhra Pradesh in the Chintooru forests.

Night stay

At Vollangi, rows of visitors are seen riding their two-wheelers, carrying water cans, food packets, and blankets to arrive at their destination — Gudisa grassland, a valley surrounded by five hills — to stay for the night.

Many photographers said that reaching and staying in the Gudisa valley was an adventure worth undertaking. What is worrying is that no means

of transportation is available in the 45-km stretch from Maredumilli to the Gudisa valley. However, there are no boarding facilities in the valley either, except to erect tents to stay for the night.

The majority of the 1103.72 square km of Very Dense Forest in the East Godavari district is present in the Rampa Agency, in which Papikonda National Park thrives with wildlife.

Food

Maredumilli, the heartland of Rampa Agency, has 36 bamboo chicken units and the majority of them do not serve the authentic delicacy as prescribed by the Konda Reddi tribe. The non-tribal people who settled in the bamboo chicken trade are offering various food varieties only to exploit the demand for those varieties. Until one exits from the Rampa Agency, access to the mobile phone signals is not guaranteed in any location in the Agency that is affected by Left Wing Extremism.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/amenities-in-agency-still-miles-to-go/article30481798.ece

166,2020/01/05,United Breweries reduces production in Srikakulam,"The Andhra Pradesh Government’s new liquor policy has dealt a blow to United Breweries Holdings Limited, which has drastically cut down on production at its unit located at Bantupalli village in Srikakulam district ever since the new regulations came into force.

Sources said that the Excise Department of the State Government, which has taken over running of liquor shops across the State, has stopped purchase and sale of several popular brands of liquor sold by United Breweries, including beer. The company, which earlier used to produce around 11 lakh bottles per month, is now producing only one lakh bottles. The company is unable to export beverages from Srikakulam district as it has its own units both in neighbouring Telangana and Odisha.

It is learnt that the company has laid off 600 employees due to the huge drop in production at the Bantupalli unit.

Protests erupt

CITU and other trade unions staged protests demanding the continuation of the workers’ services. “The State Government should do justice to all the employees and workers as they have lost their livelihood due to the new liquor policy. The company should also take initiatives to overcome its hurdles as thousands of people are directly and indirectly dependent on the economic activity created by the plant in Bantupalli, Ranasthalam, Kosta and Pydibhimavaram villages,” said D. Govinda Rao, CITU State vice-president.

CITU district president P. Tejeswara Rao alleged that the company has violated labour laws by firing the employees without giving them statutory notice. “The company has been filing false cases against the agitating employees instead of doing justice to them,” he said.

United Breweries Workers’ Union president I. Narayana Rao and general secretary Jaka Ganga Raju alleged that the company had earned crores of rupees in profit through liquor sale in the last 20 years but has failed to do justice to the workers.

167,2020/01/05,Energy Secretary writes to TS-Genco CMD on allocation of employees,"Energy Secretary and AP-Transco Chairman and Managing Director N. Srikant is learnt to have written a letter to his TS-Genco and TS-Transco counterpart D. Prabhakar Rao requesting him not to relieve any employee in pursuance of the Dharmadhikari Committee report dated December 26, 2019, during the pendency of the proceedings with the Supreme Court, saying that such a move would further precipitate the issue of allocation of employees between the A.P. and Telangana State power utilities.

Mr. Srikant stated that the A.P. utilities were not going to admit or give posting to any employee working in T.S. utilities as there were no vacant posts and those would be in addition to the number of employees which the A.P. utilities are obliged to accommodate as per the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014.

The A.P. utilities had requested the Dharmadhikari Committee to keep its report in abeyance and filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking clarification in that regard. Besides, the A.P. utilities filed a petition in the apex court challenging the list of allocation of employees made by the one-man committee.

The A.P. utilities argued that there has been a disagreement over the Dharmadhikari panel report and the list of allocable employees between A.P. and T.S. utilities. Therefore, the T.S. utilities should not relieve employees before the issue is sorted out in the court and without Dharmadhikari Committee following its directions, Mr. Srikant said in the letter.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/energy-secretary-writes-to-ts-genco-cmd-on-allocation-of-employees/article30481687.ece

Whoever contested the byelections as BJP candidates and won would be made Ministers, Mr. Prasad said, claiming that Mr. Yeddiyurappa had already made a commitment to that effect.

Mr. Vishwanath and Mr. Prasad share a close rapport. Recently, Mr. Vishwanath said that he had joined the BJP at the behest of Mr. Prasad and that he would not have taken such a step had anybody else prodded him towards it.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vishwanath-unlikely-to-get-cabinet-berth-srinivas-prasad/article30487927.ece
170,2020/01/05,Karnataka to follow Narmada dam model to save Krishnaraja Sagar,"Even as Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday evening directed the Mines and Geology Department to stop quarrying in the vicinity of Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) in Mandya district in view of the dam’s safety, the State government is set to impose a blanket ban on blasting near the reservoir, on the lines of the measures implemented to save the Sardar Sarovar dam constructed across the Narmada river in Gujarat.

A communiqué from the Chief Minister’s Office said that officials have been directed to file a report after stopping quarrying.

Consequent to loud hollow sounds and vibrations frequently being experienced in the vicinity of the historical reservoir, which is the lifeline of several districts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the Mandya district administration recently recommended to the State government to declare areas around KRS as coming under a “non-blasting zone”.

“The State government will probably publish a gazette notification imposing a blanket ban on blasting and mining in a 10-km radius of the KRS,” Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh said on Sunday.

National importance

According to Mr. Venkatesh, three major points prompted the district administration to seek a ban on all kinds of explosions around KRS. For one, the reservoir was considered a “structure of national importance”. Second was a study by Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) detecting the origin of two quarry blasting signatures (tremors caused by quarrying) which jolted the district near KRS on September 25, 2018. And thirdly, the ban on using explosives in the surroundings of Sardar Sarovar dam.

While the restrictions are in force in a 5-km radius of Sardar Sarovar dam, the Mandya district administration has proposed that the limit for KRS be 10 km.

“There are 30 quarrying units in a 10-km radius of the KRS,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

Subsequent to the two quarry blasting signatures in 2018, the Union Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation was asked to examine the ground vibrations that could potentially damage the reservoir. A technical team visited various places in the reservoir’s vicinity and analysed the data recorded at the VSAT-enabled Permanent Seismic Monitoring Stations at the KRS, established by the KSNDMC in September 2018.

“A team from the National Institute of Rock Mechanics had planned to conduct ‘continuous trial blasts’ to monitor ground vibrations [due to explosions at nearby stone quarries]. Nevertheless, a ‘go back campaign’ was organised against the team,” a senior officer said.

Political connections

A little over 65 stone extraction units function in a radius of 15 km to 20 km of KRS. Of them, many belong to operators closely associated with political leaders. They allegedly violate safety regulations, besides illegally and unscientifically conducting high-density explosions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j0i9ht/article30487893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGBABYHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-to-follow-narmada-dam-model-to-save-krishnaraja-sagar/article30487894.ece
171,2020/01/05,Exception to PM’s ‘reluctance’ to offer aid,"Taking exception to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “reluctance” to offer financial assistance to the State government for taking up relief and rehabilitation works for flood victims, Working President of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) Eshwar Khandre has said that the Prime Minister had insulted the flood victims.

“Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa expressed his discontent in front of the Prime Minister over the Union government’s reluctance to release funds for rehabilitation of flood victims. Yet, the Prime Minister did not say anything about it,” he said.

“When the Chief Minister went to Raj Bhavan to seek Centre’s aid for rehabilitation work, he was not allowed to meet the Prime Minister. It is nothing but an insult to Karnataka and its people. Instead of talking of the issues concerning the State such as rehabilitation of flood victims, joblessness, agrarian crisis and economic slowdown, he talked politics at length. The Prime Minister was so insensitive that he spoke communal politics in front of children,” he said.

Mr. Khandre was addressing a media conference in Kalaburagi on Sunday.

Referring to the BJP MLA Somashekhar Reddy’s controversial public address and issuance of a threat to Muslim community at a recent rally in Ballari supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said that Mr. Reddy had taken oath to impartially function without making any discrimination against caste, creed and religion, but he is doing exactly contrary to his oath.

“Mr. Reddy has issued a life threat to people of a minority community. The police who initially were reluctant to book a case against him filed an FIR only after public pleasure mounted on them. Mr. Reddy should be arrested and stringent legal action should be initiated against him,” Mr. Khandre said.

Talking on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Khandre said that the Act went diagonally opposite to the very foundations of the Constitution.

“When NRC [National Register of Citizens] was conducted in Assam, around 19 lakh people could not prove their citizenship as they did not have the required documents. Of the 19 lakh people, 12 lakh were Hindus. If the same exercise is continued elsewhere, the majority of the people of this country cannot prove their citizenship. It will lead to a huge turmoil in the country. The controversial Act has met with sharp criticisms, condemnation and opposition and protests throughout the country. If the Union government continues to ignore the resistance, it will lead to civil unrest. The Union government should immediately initiate the process for repealing the controversial Act,” he said.

172,2020/01/05,Jesus statue: Christian delegation meets CM,"In light of the controversy surrounding the proposed statute of Jesus Christ at Harobele in Kanakapura taluk, near here, a Christian delegation led by Arch Bishop of Bengaluru Peter Machado met Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday to apprise him of the situation. The Chief Minister, however, sought time before taking a decision as he is awaiting a report from the Revenue Department.

Sources said that the delegation submitted a memorandum along with documents to show that Kapalabetta was being used by the Holy Rosary Church and the devotees for the past 100 years. “The hillock was used as Calvary hill during Easter to commemorate the suffering of Jesus Christ. We have sought recognition of the contribution of Christian community in the State by the way of education, social service and health,” a member of the delegation said.

The community leaders, sources said, appealed to the State government to consider the case as a special one as even in the past, gomala land has been utilised for other purposes.

Meanwhile, the spokesperson of Bengaluru Archdiocese J.A. Kanthraj said that the Harobele Kapala Betta Trust was yet to seek permission necessary for the installation of the statue.

“A small ritual to mark the beginning of the work was held recently. The trust is raising money for the project, and it will apply for all necessary approvals,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jesus-statue-christian-delegation-meets-cm/article30487712.ece
173,2020/01/05,"Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah meeting triggers speculation","Ahead of the anticipated appointment of the new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president and in the light of a greater demand to appoint one person each to the post of Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader and Leader of the Opposition, a lengthy meeting between the CLP leader Siddaramaiah and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Sunday sparked off speculation in political circles.

The changes that followed the resignations of Mr. Siddaramaiah as CLP leader and Leader of the Opposition and Dinesh Gundu Rao as KPCC president has set off a race among many senior Congress leaders now hoping to fill the slot.

Sources said that Mr. Shivakumar, who was among the front runners for the KPCC top post, met Mr. Siddaramaiah to seek his cooperation.

The meeting of the two leaders for nearly two hours revolved around the prevailing political scenario in the State, and the expected change in the party. Sources said that the meeting assumes importance in the light of 18 senior leaders showing solidarity by attending a meeting on Saturday during which unanimity in decisions was discussed.

Mr. Shivakumar, however, said that he had come to discuss political developments with his leader.

“There is nothing special about this meeting. Mr. Siddaramaiah is the Leader of the Opposition and I work under him. Irrespective of whether we have powers or not, Mr. Siddaramaiah is our leader. I’m not asking any post nor am I a competitor,” he told reporters after the meeting.

Meanwhile, according to sources in the party, the high command was looking at different caste combinations to have a balancing factor between the factions of Lingayats, Vokkaligas, and Backward Classes that will also work as optics before the people. If KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre and former Minister M.B. Patil are also trying for the KPCC president’s post, the party has more or less given up on dividing the post of CLP leader and Leader of the Opposition.

Another former Minister H.K. Patil has been looking at one of the two posts as pressure has been mounted on the high command by the Congress old guard to divide the post, which will be seen as weakening the position of Mr. Siddaramaiah.

“In all probability, the suspense could end within the next two weeks as the party leadership is looking at bringing an end to confusions and also filling up posts,” a source said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5ajkky/article30487694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSIDDUDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shivakumar-siddaramaiah-meeting-triggers-speculation/article30487695.ece

“CAA will not affect the interests of minorities. The Opposition parties are unnecessarily undertaking a false propaganda against it. Do not be misled,” the Chief Minister told the residents.

Later, he told reporters that the Opposition should give examples with documents if minorities have been genuinely affected by the CAA.

Claiming that there was no mala fide intent behind the CAA, he said the main intention of the campaign was to create awareness that the CAA would not affect minorities as being alleged by the Opposition parties.

The BJP leaders and party workers would visit three crore houses in the country, including 30 lakh in the State, under the campaign, he said. He distributed pamphlets comprising details about CAA to households during his visit.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan visited the houses of several prominent personalities, including writer Chandrashekar Kambar, and handed over pamphlets related to CAA. He said none of the minorities in India would lose their citizenship because of the Act.

Taking serious exception to the cap on procurement quantity of red gram set by the Union government, Maruti Manpade, KPRS State vice-president, demanded the removal of the cap, which will help growers to sell their crop at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹6,100 a quintal.

Opposing the duty-free import of red gram, he said that it had affected the local market.

He also criticised the government for the reduction of incentive on red gram.

Mr. Manpade demanded that the government revise the incentive to ₹1,000 a quintal.

179,2020/01/05,‘Kothi Raj’ ready to shoot a breathtaking climax to biopic,"Rock climber Jyothi Raj, often called Kothi Raj for his amazing prowess of climbing rock faces, fort walls or tall buildings, is now set to scale new heights.

He plans to climb the rock face along Angel Falls, the world’s highest waterfalls in Venezuela, in one go. This will constitute the climax of the his biopic Incredible Monkey Man, which will be released worldwide this year. The movie is produced and directed by the Sydney-based Stanley Joseph. He is a native of Bengaluru and has four other documentary films to his credit. The shooting for Incredible Monkey Man will take place in Chitradurga, Shivamogga, Bengaluru, and Venezuela.

The climax will be shot on February 26 or 27, and Mr. Raj is undergoing special training from an international climber, Praveen C.M., for it.

Mr. Raj says two persons, as a team, have successfully climbed Agel Falls, and they took three days to do it. “I will make India and Karnataka proud by climbing Angel Falls and hoisting the Indian and Karnataka flags on top of it,” he said.

Mr. Joseph told The Hindu that safety would be of the highest priority and all precautions would be taken for the climb. “I am fulfilling his dream of climbing Angel Falls,” he said. He also expressed an awe for Mr. Raj, saying, “I have not seen a sportsman like him in my life, [someone] who climbs rocks and buildings with bare hands and legs without any safety gear. Hence, I decided to make a biopic.”

As Mr. Raj can speak only Kannada, it will be a Kannada movie with English subtitles.

Hope on tourist front

Mr. Joseph also said that most of the foreigners who come to India go to the forts and historical places in north India and do not know about Chitradurga fort and its history. “This film will definitely help bring more foreign tourists to Chitradurga and make it a popular tourist spot,” he said. Mr. Raj, meanwhile, hopes to use the money from the film for the development of the fort.

Mr. Raj, a native of Theni village in Madurai district of Tamil Nadu, was separated at from his parents a fair at the age of three and was brought up by a couple from Bagalkot. The couple then moved to Chitradurga, where Mr. Raj worked as a construction labourer. He was 18 when he first climbed the Chitradurga fort. He has since climbed some of the steepest rock faces and buildings. He earns ₹3,000 to ₹4,000 on weekends from tourists who want to see him climbing the fort. He also trains children in rock climbing.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pqqvg4/article30486314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGKOTHIRAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kothi-raj-ready-to-shoot-a-breathtaking-climax-to-biopic/article30486315.ece
180,2020/01/05,"MLAs, MLCs from all partiescome together on Mahadayi","Elected representatives from the Mahadayi riparian areas at a meeting here on Sunday resolved to raise their voice cutting across party lines with regard to the Mahadayi river water sharing issue.

Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Large and Medium Scale Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, Janata Dal (Secular) leader and MLC Basavaraj Horatti, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council S.R. Patil and others spoke.

Members of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council from the region participated in the meeting.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah, who represents the Badami Assembly constituency, did not turn up for the meeting but sent a letter pledging his consent to any decision taken.

It was a first such meeting pertaining to the Mahadayi issue and was held at a time when farmers organisations have made a scathing attack on political parties for trying to take mileage out of the issue rather than striving to protect the State’s interest.

The leaders who spoke at the meeting said that henceforth, they would engage in collective efforts on an apolitical basis to take the issue to its logical end. They also felt that it was necessary to seek the opinion of legal experts before finalising the future course of action.

This meeting of elected representatives from all political parties was the first step in this connection and it concluded on a positive note with no room for any dispute. More such meetings would be held to discuss and deliberate on this issue and every elected representative would strive to safeguard the interests of farmers and the State even if it became necessary to compromise with the stand and ideology of his respective political party, they said.

Further, the participants decided not to limit such meetings in the future to the Mahadayi issue alone. Instead, they decided to discuss and deliberate larger issues pertaining to the development of North Karnataka. They said that such meetings in the future would discuss steps to be taken to ensure the development of North Karnataka, steps to be taken at the State government level in finalising schemes suitable for the region, and also on the pressure to be built on the Centre to receive more development projects to achieve the overall development of North Karnataka, they said.

Later, Mr. Joshi, who interacted with a group of farmers, said that resolving an inter-State river water issue was a complex one the country was facing and successive governments have not been able to resolve any such dispute fully. However, the NDA Government at the Centre has taken some bold decisions on this one and it would be announced shortly, he said.

Mahadayi Kalasa Banduri Horata Samiti leader Vikas Soppin, who welcomed the move to hold the meeting, said that it was a positive development that elected representatives from all political parties have made up their mind to join hands for a noble cause, while pledging to engage in efforts on a collective and apolitical basis. This move is expected to consolidate the State’s position and safeguard the interests of the State and its farmers, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mlas-mlcs-from-all-partiescome-together-on-mahadayi/article30486292.ece

184,2020/01/05,‘Vishwesha Tirtha spiritually guided society till the end’,"Rich tributes were paid to Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt, who passed away on December 29, at a condolence meeting held at Rajangana here on Saturday.

Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt said that Vishwesha Tirtha kept spiritually guiding society till the very last. That was clear from the last discourse he delivered at Rajangana here on December 19, before he was admitted to Kasturba Hospital with extensive pneumonia on December 20. He delivered his last discourse despite the fact he had a high fever.

Vishwesha Tirtha Swami had deep concern for environment. He had sat on a fast when land was given for an industrial project at Kuthethur. The Pejawar seer had been at the forefront of the Ayodhya movement for the Ram Temple, the Palimar seer said.

D. Veerendra Heggade, Dharmadhikari of Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala, said Vishewesha Tirtha Swami had contributed a lot to education. The message of his life would contribute to creating spiritual awareness in society, he said. K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said it was difficult to believe that Vishwesha Tirtha Swami was no more. He had purchased land near Rajangana to create an area for parking of vehicles. He had intended to purchase another four acres near here for the development of better facilities for the sake of devotees. A project would have to be drawn up in the memory of the seer, he said.

He was responding to criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, that it links citizenship to religion. Mr. Rao said the partition of colonial India took place on religious lines and millions of Muslims decided to stay in Pakistan. “Now to demand citizenship to those Muslims is illogical and irrational,” he said.

He maintained that Muslims were not persecuted on religious lines there and termed the CAA a “humanitarian” measure to help religious persecuted minorities in these countries.

He launched an outreach campaign with an aim to reach 30 lakh households in the State, where BJP workers will go door to door explaining the party’s stand on the CAA.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-launches-outreach-campaign/article30481768.ece

189,2020/01/05,Threat of stir for hike in ST quota looms while two leaders vie for Deputy Chief Minister’s post,"The demand for increasing the Scheduled Tribe reservation quota — from 3.3% to 7.5% — is back in the limelight in Karnataka at a time when two prominent BJP leaders from the Valmiki (ST) community — Minister for Health and Family Welfare B. Sriramulu and five-time MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi — are clamouring for the posts of Deputy Chief Minister.

Community members have threatened to relaunch their agitation seeking an increase in the quota if the State government does not concede their decade-long demand.

Sulking Sriramulu

Mr. Sriramulu, who was projected as the leader of the Valmiki community by the BJP during the Assembly elections, has been sulking since he has been denied the Deputy Chief Minister’s post in the B.S. Yediyurappa-led government. To get the post during the next round of Cabinet rejig, the Minister has been camping in the national capital for the last two days and making every attempt to meet BJP national president and Home Minister Amit Shah.

Mr. Jarkiholi, who defected from the Congress to the BJP and got re-elected in the byelection, has also been doing all he can to get the Deputy Chief Minister’s post. He has been meeting community seers and lobbying hard. Cabinet expansion is expected to take place this month.

Meanwhile, leaders of the Valmiki community, the fourth largest in the State, have been stepping up pressure on the government to increase the quota. The government has set up a committee headed by retired High Court judge H.N. Nagamohan Das to look into the demand. The panel is expected to submit its report by this month-end.

Meanwhile, Prasannananda Puri Swami of Valmiki Gurupeetha recently threatened that Mr. Yediyurappa’s tenure would be cut short if the demand to increase the ST quota was not fulfilled by February 9, the day when the annual jatra of Maharshi Valmiki is held at Rajanahalli in Harihar, Davangere district. In case the committee recommends an increase in the quota, the BJP government should make an official announcement on the same by February 9, the seer said.

With an increase in the population, the community has been demanding extending the hike in the quantum of reservation, which exists as far as political representation is concerned, to jobs and education sector too. “The State government has increased political representation. Now, we are seeking its extension to jobs and admissions to education institutions too under Article 16 (4A) of the Constitution,” a Congress leader said.

A few months ago, members of the Valmiki community undertook a 16-day padayatra (covering over 280 km) from Rajanahalli to Bengaluru seeking a hike in the reservation for STs in jobs and education sector. In 2005, the Manmohan Singh-led government at the Centre increased the reservation to STs in Central government jobs and educational institutions to 7.5%.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4qqn6t/article30481711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGVALMIKI2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/threat-of-stir-for-hike-in-st-quota-looms-while-two-leaders-vie-for-deputy-chief-ministers-post/article30481713.ece
190,2020/01/05,"Role of money in politics, abusive public discourse matter of concern, says Krishna","The former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader S.M. Krishna had two prescriptions for the socio-political health of the country — fighting the role of money in politics and starting a new chapter of harmonious public discourse with no room for abuse.

He was speaking here on Saturday at an event that saw six books on his life, collectively called ‘Krishna Patha’, released.

On the role of money in public life, he said, “Just because there are elections and people vote, it does not mean there is a genuine, functional democracy. As long as politics is unduly influenced by money, there is no genuine democracy in our country. The youth of this country should give this a thought and try to sort this out.”

Responding to many describing him as a “gentleman politician”, he said he had never tried to seek revenge or vengeance against anybody. He also appealed for a clean public discourse that inculcates mutual respect and harmony and with no room for abuse.

The former Chief Justice of India M.N. Venkatachaliah, who led the ‘Krishna Patha’ committee, said he accepted the job as the exercise was not merely about Mr. Krishna, but an exploration of how leadership was intricately connected with the life of a democracy. Giving several examples of authoritarianism that came through democracy, including Hitler, he said the popular vote was a phantom. “Mr. Krishna is only a metaphor for the kind of leadership, its cultural components, which we should look forward to,” he said.

Commenting on leadership, Mr. Krishna said it was the challenges that make man a leader and that he faced many of them while in power and out of it too. He recalled how he faced forest brigand Veerappan kidnapping matinee idol Rajkumar, and termed it as one of the biggest challenges he had faced.

Ashwath Narayan from the BJP, were part of the event.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/40phny/article30481678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGKRISHNABOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/role-of-money-in-politics-abusive-public-discourse-matter-of-concern-says-krishna/article30481679.ece
191,2020/01/05,What is the Maharashtra-Karnataka tussle over Belagavi all about?,"The story so far: In the first week of December, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray appointed Ministers Chaggan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as coordinators to oversee the government’s efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary issue with Karnataka. On the floor of the Assembly, Mr. Thackeray said Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the PoK issue, but not Maharashtra’s border issue. This triggered a response from Karnataka, with the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike condemning Mr. Thackeray’s statement, and also questioning the silence of leaders from North Karnataka region on the issue. Adding fuel to the fire was blackening of Kannada boards in Kolhapur in Maharashtra and stopping of a Kannada film being screened citing law and order issues. The border areas, including Belagavi (earlier Belgaum), the epicentre of the issue for over six decades, remain tense.

What is the controversy?

In 1957, slighted by the implementation of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, Maharashtra demanded readjustment of its border with Karnataka. It invoked Section 21 (2) (b) of the Act, and submitted a memorandum to the Ministry of Home Affairs stating its objection to Marathi- speaking areas being added to Karnataka. It claimed an area of 2,806 square miles that involved 814 villages, and three urban settlements of Belagavi, Karwar and Nippani with a total population of about 6.7 lakh, all part of the Mumbai Presidency before independence. The villages are spread across Belagavi and Uttar Kannada in north-western Karnataka, and Bidar and Gulbarga districts in north-eastern Karnataka — all bordering Maharashtra.

Later, when a four-member committee was formed by both States, Maharashtra expressed willingness to transfer predominantly Kannada-speaking 260 villages with a population of about 3.25 lakh and total area of 1,160 square miles in lieu of accepting its demand for 814 villages and three urban settlements, which was turned down by Karnataka.

What was the basis of Maharashtra’s claim?

Maharashtra’s claim to seek the readjustment of its border was on the basis of contiguity, relative linguistic majority and wishes of the people. If the claim over Belagavi and surrounding areas was based on Marathi-speaking people and linguistic homogeneity, it laid its claim over Karwar and Supa where Konkani is spoken by citing Konkani as a dialect of Marathi. Its argument was based on the theory of village being the unit for calculation and enumerated linguistic population in each village. Maharashtra also points out the historical fact that the revenue records in these Marathi-speaking areas are also kept in Marathi.

What is Karnataka’s position?

Karnataka has argued that the settlement of boundaries as per the States Reorganisation Act is final. The boundary of the State was neither tentative nor flexible. The State argues that the issue would reopen border issues that have not been contemplated under the Act, and that such a demand should not be permitted. Initially, Karnataka was open to adjusting the border in the 10 mile belt from the drawn boundary. Karnataka also points out that when Congress, which redrew its circles on linguistic basis in 1920, included Belagavi in the Karnataka Provincial Congress Committee. Besides, the States Reorganisation Commission vested Belagavi with Karnataka.

Did the States make an effort to find a solution?

In 1960, both States agreed to set up a four-man committee with two representatives from each State. Except on the issue of contiguity, the committee could not arrive at a unanimous decision, and respective representatives submitted reports to their government. Between the 1960s and 1980s, chief ministers of Karnataka and Maharashtra have met several times to find a solution to the vexed issue but with no avail.

How has the Union government responded?

Under sustained pressure from Maharashtra, in 1966, the Centre announced setting up a one-man commission under former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India Meher Chand Mahajan to look into border issues between Karnataka (then Mysore state) and Maharashtra. The commission was also asked to look into Karnataka’s demand for integration of Kannada-speaking areas in Kasargod in Kerala.

While Maharashtra reiterated its demand, Karnataka sought areas in Kolhapur, Sholapur and Sangli districts from Maharashtra, and Kasargod from Kerala. The commission received more than 2,200 memoranda and met over 7,500 people. It submitted its report to the Union government in 1967. After much delay and debates over the content, the commission’s report was placed in Parliament in 1972. The commission rejected Maharashtra’s claim over Belagavi city while recommending transfer of about 260 villages in the border to Maharashtra and about 250 villages in Maharashtra to Karnataka. Maharashtra said the report was inconsistent and an unfair application of its own principle. It also said the report was not a final word on the issue. Karnataka, however, agreed to the report.

Last week, in response to Mr. Thackeray’s statement, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa also reiterated that the Mahajan Commission report was final and “the question of transferring even an inch of land does not arise.”

Besides the commission, the Centre made several proposals including setting up of a new border commission, conducting opinion poll, bifurcation of Belagavi city, the epicentre of violent protests, and also handing over of Marathi-speaking villages without Belagavi city to Maharashtra, none of which received favorable response from either State.

What has been happening on the ground?

As Maharashtra stepped up pressure for integration of Marathi-speaking areas, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) — launched in 1948 — spearheaded the movement in Karnataka. Since the formation of the State on November 1, 1956, MES observes the foundation day as a “Black Day”. The period between the 1960s and 1980s saw violent protests and frequent lockdown of Belagavi city, and tension on the border. MES, which still holds sway in Belagavi City corporation, has been on the decline over the last two decades. In fact, the MES-led council also adopted a resolution to merge with Maharashtra forcing State Government to dissolve it.

The MES, which in 1994 sent five legislators in the 224-seat Assembly, drew a blank in the 1999, 2008 and 2018 Assembly elections. If the delimitation exercise that redrew the constituency map realigned local politics, changing preferences towards national parties and emergence of English — seen as a gateway to better job prospects — has hit the linguistic movement in recent times. The agrarian politics along the Krishna river bank in Belagavi district has also put the merger issue on the backburner. The MES also did not get political backing in Uttara Kannada and Bidar districts, and is also affected by factionalism. But the MES has kept the Shiv Sena, which often raises the border issue with Karnataka as in the recent case too, and the NCP, both Maharashtra’s regional parties, from dominating the narrative in Karnataka.

On its part, to reiterate its stand on the border issue, Karnataka declared Belagavi its second capital, holds its winter session at the newly constructed Vidhan Soudha, changed the name of Belgaum to Belagavi and also held the World Kannada Summit there — all in the last 15 years. In 2004, Maharashtra approached the Supreme Court for a settlement under Article 131(b) of the Constitution. Karnataka has questioned the suit. With one of the judges recusing, the court has to set up a new bench.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zd0q2f/article30480570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THiStock-1182418308,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/what-is-the-maharashtra-karnataka-tussle-over-belagavi-all-about/article30480571.ece

193,2020/01/05,Norms set for religious studies in schools,"The Directorate of General Education has issued a circular that as per the Kerala Education Rules (KER), government-recognised schools or those receiving grant from the government cannot compel a student to take part in religious studies or rituals in the school or in its vicinity without the permission of the student’s parent or guardian.

The circular comes in the wake of an order of the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The order by commission chairperson P. Suresh and member K. Nazeer followed a complaint from two students in Palakkad that the headmistress of Vadakkanchery Cherupushpam Girls Higher Secondary School had been taking them to churches for prayers. If they refused to take part in the prayers, they were depicted in poor light.

They were also not allowed to wear full sleeves and scarves as per Islamic tradition. The Palakkad district child protection officer in a report submitted to the commission said religious classes were taken for the majority of the students who were Christian, while for others, it was moral education. Children were made to take part in Christian prayers. Muslim students were at present allowed to wear scarves, it said.

Headmistress’ stance

The headmistress in her report denied that anyone was forced to take part in prayers as per Christian tradition.

As moral education was mandatory under KER, the petitioners could not keep away from it. The headmistress said the school had not discriminated against students on the basis of religion.

194,2020/01/05,Survey spots 33 odonates in Vembanad,"A two-day odonate survey, organised by the Social Forestry division of the Kerala Forest and Wildlife Department, in association with Tropical Institute of Ecological Sciences, has spotted 33 species of dragonflies and damselflies in the Vembanad kole wetland.

Assistant Conservator of Forests G. Prasad told The Hindu that the survey showed considerable changes in the diversity of dragonflies and damselflies in tune with the ecological changes in the vicinity of the Vembanad wetlands.

The survey, conducted at 14 places along a stretch of 61 km on the banks of the Vembanad lake, concluded on Sunday.

Of the 33 species spotted, the Brown Dartlets (Kariyila-thumbi) and Coastal Gliders (Pozhi-thumbi) found in Vaikom were rare species, Mr. Prasad said.

However, the Ditch Jewel (Changathi-thumbi) was a common species spotted at all 14 places. Odonates are indicators of fresh or polluted waters. Water contamination can easily be understood from the presence or absence of some odonate species.

Considering the importance of biological indicators and increased discussions in the field of wetland conservation, the odonate fauna needs to be protected in wetland conservation efforts, says Mr. Prasad.

Warning signal

The spotting of Ditch Jewel in almost all places was an indication of the alarming degradation of the wetland system.

The Blue Grass Dart (Naattu-poothali), Common Picture Wing (Salabha-thumbi), Pied Paddy Skimmer (Swami-thumbi), and Ruddy Marsh (Valayal-thumbi), that usually keep marshy land its main habitat too were spotted in large numbers during the survey.

According to Mr. Prasad, the dragonflies and damselflies of Vembanad region need to be observed in a new perspective, especially against the backdrop of the post-flood scenario.

Kuttanad is closely related to the Vembanad lake. Many forest-dwelling odonates of the high ranges of Idukki, Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam districts were washed down with their larvae and eggs during the last two floods to the downstream reaches and ultimately to Kuttanad.

A proper understanding is required about the washing out of large number of odonates from their upland habitats, due to the recurrent heavy floods.

Their population in natural forests of higher elevation leads to their being washed down to the feeder rivers of Vembanad lake. This makes their actual natural population to dwindle due to the repeated wash out processes.

Extinction possible

This may even cause total extinction of some genera including odonates, fishes, and amphibians. A baseline study on this aspect is inevitable for conservative efforts of Wetland micro fauna.

In future, school students may be trained to raise small pools in their schools or home premises or in housing colonies or even in panchayat lands to harbour Odonates, says Mr .Prasad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hwwcfe/article30488036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv06browndartlet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survey-spots-33-odonates-in-vembanad/article30488037.ece
195,2020/01/05,State palm oil industry in jitters,"The Centre slashing the import duty of crude and refined palm oils has brought gloom for the estates run by Oil Palm India Limited and Plantation Corporation of Kerala, with the possibility of an increased inflow looming large.

Under the ASEAN agreement and the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (IMCECA), the government has brought down the import duty on crude palm oil from 40% to 37.5% and that on refined palm oil from 50% to 45%. “The Centre is trying to help corporates who have plantations in other Asian countries. The move will badly hit domestic refiners and farmers. We are already struggling to develop infrastructure and buy machines. This will slow down our progress,” says Vijayan Kunissery, chairman, Oil Palm India Limited.

Established in 1977, Oil Palm India Limited has over 3,500 hectares of plantation in Yeroor, Chithara and Kulathupuzha in Kollam, employing around 1,000 persons. Another unit cultivating oil palms in Kerala is Plantation Corporation of Kerala’s 705-hectare estate in Kalady.

“Business will be affected and all the units in Kerala will find it difficult to market their product. Export earnings will also go down,” says J. Udayabhanu, chairman, Plantation Corporation of Kerala.

Labour unrest

The sector is already in a difficult spot with resentment mounting among the labourers. While all public sector plantations, including tea and rubber, got a wage hike recently, those working in oil palm farms received zero increase. Labour issues may crop up in the sector very soon.

“We were told that our wages were not revised as oil palm plantations are not part of Plantation Labour Committee that decided to hike wages. They say the industry suffered a loss of ₹10 crore due to the fluctuations in palm oil price. If the situation worsens due to the new policy of the Centre we will have to suffer. We are not responsible for the loss and we are planning to start a strike soon,” said a trade union representative.

Coconut farmers’ angst

Though not directly connected to issue, the coconut farmers believe it will be hard for them to survive if cheap palm oil keeps flooding the market.

“This has happened earlier as well. The increase in import volume will hit our livelihood because a lot of people will switch to palm oil and the price for coconut and copra will drop,” says Baburaj P., farmer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-palm-oil-industry-in-jitters/article30488021.ece
196,2020/01/05,Bamboo offers an alternative to plastics,"Bamboo’s versatility as a raw material will be to the fore as it can be an effective alternative to single-use plastics, which have been banned in the State from January 1. Bamboo products can replace plastic products ranging from file-holders to straws, feels Kerala State Bamboo Corporation, a public sector undertaking, that encourages traditional bamboo artisans, mostly belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes.

Bamboo corporation managing director A.M. Abdul Rasheed said the corporation wanted to launch itself into the midst of the drive to replace plastic products.

For a beginning, the corporation has proposed replacing plastic stationery in all government offices and, later, in the offices of public sector companies, with bamboo products.

The corporation has tied up with the Haritha Keralam Mission and Suchitwa Mission to replace plastic stationery with bamboo products.

The mission is based on the belief that whatever can be made of plastic can be produced from bamboo — bamboo baskets, file racks, covers, holders, pen and pencil stands, pens, and file boxes.

Mr. Rasheed said that the corporation would ensure the quality of the products by providing designs to traditional artisans, who were now engaged by the corporation.

The corporation would procure these products and supply to end users.

Bamboo has tremendous scope as Kerala tries to get rid of one-use plastic products in different sectors. The entire country was a big market for bamboo products, the bamboo corporation official pointed out.

Subsidy

The corporation has been catering to traditional artisans by providing substantial subsidy on bamboo reeds harvested from Kerala forests.

Bamboo products of late faced adverse market conditions with products like ply attracting 18% GST whereas it was exempted from tax previously.

Efforts were being made to persuade the government to do away with GST, said the corporation official.

₹25 crore projects

As per the norms notified by the government for construction and reconstruction of structures across navigable waterways other than the National Waterways in the State, a horizontal clearance of 25 m and vertical clearance of 5 m from the high-tide level is needed for the south of the Kollam stretch in the West Coast Canal.

In the south of Kozhikode, the horizontal clearance will be 50 m and vertical clearance, 6 m in rivers as per Class III specifications of the IWAI.

In canals, the horizontal clearance will be 32 to 40 m in normal case. It can be modified as per the site conditions by the Chief Engineer, Inland Navigation and Kuttanad Package (In and Kp), after site inspection. The vertical clearance had been fixed at 6 m.

For feeder canals, the horizontal clearance can be fixed by the CE (In and Kp) and subordinate engineers after site inspection. However, the vertical clearance will be 5 m from the high-tide level.

For low-lying areas

199,2020/01/05,Initiative to encourage organic farming,"Agriculture and Health Departments will jointly launch Jeevani, an initiative to encourage organic farming and ensure safe food in the district.

As part of the State-wide project, a variety of vegetables will be cultivated with the motto ‘Nammude Krishi Nammude Arogyam’ (Our Agriculture, Our Health).

Jeevani will focus on around 100 traditional crops including spinach, okra and chilly, promoting their cultivation in schools, houses and private and public institutions. The project will start rolling in January and continue for the next 470 days till Vishu 2021, said Principal Agricultural Officer V.Tejasibhai.

Free seeds and saplings will be distributed through Krishi Bhavans while Krishi Patasalas (agriculture schools) will be in charge of conducting training sessions and health camps.

Pesticides and equipment will be made available at reasonable prices through panchayat eco shops and other markets. Jeevani will be implemented with the support of LSGs and in order to popularise the project model farms will be developed at different levels from wards.

More micro-irrigation systems will be set up and a 24x7 call centre will be opened as part of the project.

Exclusive portal

Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) will start Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and launch an exclusive portal to support the farmers. Bio pharmacies and units producing value added products will given special attention. Farmer’s inventions will be promoted through startups and seed exchange groups will be formed to swap the seeds of local varieties. Vegetable fairs will be organised in connection with local festivals and markets will be developed. After the commencement of the project, panchayats with more than 50 hectares of vegetable cultivation will be given the title of Jeevani Vegetable Village. Blocks with more than 500 hectares of vegetables will be Jeevani Green Block and corporations with more than 10 hectares of vegetable cultivation will become Jeevani Green City.

Inauguration

The district-level inauguration of the project will be held on January 17 by Agriculture Minister V.S.Sunil Kumar.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/initiative-to-encourage-organic-farming/article30487980.ece
200,2020/01/05,State budget to have modest Plan size,"With a realistic and modest Plan size, the State Budget for 2020-21 will unveil an action plan for mopping up the unrecovered tax revenue, raising tax collection to 20% and further jacking up infrastructure spending to combat the looming recession threat.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac who has started the budget preparation told The Hindu on Sunday that the Centre has already called for 40% Plan cut and initiated a slew of other austerity measures to contain the woes of recession.

The State will not wait for the recession to wane, instead further boost up infrastructure spending and explore other options to rein in revenue expenditure.

Revenue expenditure

The revenue expenditure of the government has been growing from 10 to 14% over the years and the income remains at 10%. The challenge is to contain the 4% gap which would inevitably lead to a ways and means problem.

The Centre’s indifference to the State’s plea to raise the annual borrowing limit is a major challenge.

“The flawed implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), mainly without an effective tax administration mechanism, has rattled the expectations for raising income. An enforcement system to check the revenue leak is still not in place. Unlike manufacturing States like Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is only a consumer State and the revenue leak is high. An all-out bid will be made for mopping up the tax revenue after scrutinising the GST returns filed in December and also Value Added Tax arrears. This will have a cushioning effect on the State’s finances,” Dr. Isaac says.

Redeployment

A cut in posts is not on the anvil, but a thorough redeployment of staff is inevitable.

As many as 1,000 employees of the Local Self-Government Department, including DRDA and Performance Audit, will have to be moved to local bodies.

Staff of defunct projects in various departments, including Irrigation and Education, would be redeployed where there is a manpower paucity. The working arrangement system will be brought to a complete nought.

The Plan size would not be too big, but quite realistic. Rather than fixing a huge Plan and then slashing it in the face of a severe resource crunch it is desirable to fix a size that suits the current financial situation.

KIIFB factor

The reliance on off-budget mechanism Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) would continue.

“It has become so integral to the State’s development and no government in future would be able to relinquish it. The functioning of KIIFB, KSFE, KFC and the Kerala Bank have all won accolades for the government and it will be thrust areas,” Dr. Isaac says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-budget-to-have-modest-plan-size/article30487963.ece
201,2020/01/05,Threats will not deter me from my duties: Governor,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Sunday said threats to impede his free movement would not deter him from executing his Constitutional duties.

Unusual for a Governor, the ruling front and the Opposition had been unanimous in their criticism of Mr. Khan’s attempts to justify the enactment of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA].

Ire of fronts

Mr. Khan had earned the ire of the opposing fronts by asking whether the Kerala Assembly was legally empowered to pass a resolution demanding the repeal of the Central law. He had also repeatedly toed the Centre’s line that the Act was not poised against citizens of the Islamic faith or other minorities.

The Governor had also insisted that Kerala was Constitutionally bound to implement laws passed by the Parliament and the CAA was no exception.

Mr. Khan’s position had triggered a sharp debate whether a State Assembly could deliberate or take a stance on a subject such as citizenship that was exclusively the Constitutional preserve of the Union government.

Soon, Mr. Khan became a magnet for anti-CAA protests. Delegates at the History Congress in Kannur attempted to heckle him when he spoke in defence of the CAA. He also faced a black flag protest by Congress workers in Thrissur on Saturday.

Demonstrations

The Raj Bhavan has witnessed anti-CAA demonstrations against the BJP-led Centre repeatedly.

The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) appeared mainly provoked by Mr. Khan’s purported statement that Congress leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, had batted for a citizenship law on the lines of the CAA.

A galaxy of Congress leaders attacked Mr. Khan for “distorting history and lowering the status of the gubernatorial office”.

K. Muraleedharan, MP, warned that Congress workers would not allow Mr. Khan to travel freely in Kerala. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had accused Mr. Khan of playing the part of the BJP State president.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/threats-will-not-deter-me-from-my-duties-governor/article30487933.ece
202,2020/01/05,BJP begins campaign to douse anti-CAA protests,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday launched a campaign in Kerala to stave off mounting criticism that the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was patently anti-Muslim.

Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Kiren Rijiju had arrived in the State with a mission to assuage the fears of the minorities about the law. Kerala had emerged as a hotbed of anti-CAA protests and the State Legislative Assembly had recently passed a near-unanimous resolution demanding its repeal.

Mr. Rijiju met Thiruvananthapuram Archbishop (Latin rite) Soosa Pakiam M., writer George Onakkoor, leading Muslim businesspersons and other opinion leaders as part of the BJP’s nationwide campaign to dampen the anti-CAA protests.

The jury was still out on whether Mr. Rijiju’s mission met with any measure of success. However, by some accounts, the BJP Minister listened to some “straight talk” from the Archbishop and Mr. Onakkoor.

The Archbishop reportedly told Mr. Rijiju that the Centre was speaking in different voices about the CAA. The legislation had caused a grave sense of insecurity among minorities. The people feared the CAA, when implemented along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would render lakhs Stateless.

By depriving naturalised Muslim refugees and migrants the chance to acquire citizenship, the Centre had introduced a clause that empowered the law to discriminate against persons based on their religion. It had set off a ripple of fear among other minority communities that they could become the target of similar discriminatory Parliamentary legislation in the future, the Archbishop said.

Mr. Onakoor reportedly told Mr. Rijiju that it was incumbent on the Centre to mitigate the fear the CAA had caused in minorities. He could not approve of any law that discriminated citizens based on their religion.

Mr. Rijiju told newspersons later that the law was not anti-Muslim. India had accorded citizenship to Pakistanis, including singer Adnan Sami. He said certain people had reservations about the CAA. They felt the Centre had not been able to convince a section of society. “If they are not convinced yet, then we are here to convince them,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-begins-campaign-to-douse-anti-caa-protests/article30486862.ece
203,2020/01/05,Kondotty MLA stages satyagraha against Union Government,"T.V. Ibrahim, MLA, staged a satyagraha on the road leading to the Calicut airport at Karipur on Saturday, in protest against the Central government’s “attempts to destroy secularism and plurality in the country.”

Nearly 50 organisations of students, youths, workers and political subsidiaries reached the satyagraha pandhal and expressed solidarity with Mr. Ibrahim. The satyagraha started at 9 a.m. and continued till 10 p.m.

Almost all political parties except the Bharatiya Janata Party registered their solidarity with the protest. They said that secularism would be safeguarded at any cost.

Indian Union Muslim League national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MP, inaugurated the satyagraha. He said that Indians were leading a second freedom struggle. “The struggle is against fascists,” he said.

204,2020/01/05,Ananda Ranga Pillai takes us back in time,"The cultural and literary features of the 18th century were projected by Ananda Ranga Pillai in his writings without giving room for aversion, likes or dislikes, said Ananda Ranga Ravichandar, grandson of the legendary diarist.

‘Eternally relevant’

Speaking at the release of the 12 volumes of Ananda Ranga Pillai’s writings by Agani Publishers here on Sunday, Mr. Ravichandar said that the writings of the chronicler, who recorded every day events in the 18th century, have made Tamils proud as they are eternally relevant.

The writings are not easy to comprehend. The language was simplified while retaining the original flavour of Ananda Ranga Pillai’s writings and released as 12 volumes by Agani Publishers. The work was completed by former IAS officer M. Rajendran and poet Vennila.

“The writing style was comprehensible only for researchers and Tamil scholars and not ordinary people,” Mr. Ravichandar said.

Justice David Annousamy, retired Judge of Madras High Court, said that the diary, in which Ananda Ranga Pillai recorded important daily events of Puducherry and France in the 18th century, was a gateway to knowing factual and historical features of Puducherry.

Limited supply

Although the writings were available in Puducherry and France, they were in limited supply and the not the complete, original version, he said.

205,2020/01/05,Tamil Nadu in 2019: Not a dull moment,"When Chennai dried up

Chennai suffered one of its worst droughts summer of 2019. With a deficit in rainfall, groundwater levels sinking, and the dry beds in the major reservoirs showing up, it became one of the first Indian cities to run dry.

Jothi Ramalingam

As taps stopped flowing, tankers ruled the roost and people sometimes waited for a month to get a load of water. Sinking borewells became the city’s top activity. Chennai Metrowater tapped every possible source, including agricultural wells and abandoned quarries, even water from Jolarpet, Vellore, through train. This crisis gained notoriety internationally too with social media mentions by Leonardo DiCaprio and U.S.Senator Bernie Sanders.

Back On Track: Vande Bharat

A high profile railway event in 2019 was the inaugural of Train18, touted as a ‘Make in India' product, by Prime Minister Modi. But the high speed train, manufactured by the Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory ran into controversies soon after its launch. Inter-departmental battles within the Railways soon brought manufacturing to a grinding halt. Amid allegations of procedural flaws, the Vigilance Directorate launched a probe; tenders were withdrawn, and officials transferred out.

The number 9

Tamil Nadu got the nod from the Centre to establish nine new medical colleges under a scheme in which the Centre will bear 60 % of the funding, and the State, 40 %. This is a big step towards the State government’s aim to establish one medical college in every district. The new colleges will coming up in Tiruppur, The Nilgiris, Ramanathapuram, Namakkal, Dindigul, Virudhunagar, Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam and Tiruvallur. With this, the total number of government medical colleges in TN goes up to 33.

The big con-test

The largest state-level controversy in the state last year was the NEET impersonation case. In September 2019, an anonymous email to the dean of Government Theni Medical College flagged that a student had got admission into the college using an impersonator to write the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). Subsequent police investigation revealed that a handful of students had gained admission to MBBS in government and private medical colleges by engaging impersonators. So far, 12 persons, including seven students and their parents, and an intermediary in the case, have been arrested. The CB CID is still investigating the case.

The kolam way of protest

Tamil Nadu kept up the momentum of the anti-CAA protests without violence and, in fact gave it a popular cultural dimension with the kolams.

Following the detention of few women who drew anti-CAA kolams in Chennai, opposition parties followed suit in solidarity. The protests by colleges, and public rallies held across the state attracted huge crowds which, unlike some north Indian states, have managed to remain peaceful.

Look! Xi’s in town

Mamallapuram hosted the most important event in India’s diplomacy during 2019. Chinese president Xi Jinping visited Chennai in October, to take part in the informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The well-planned and meticulously-executed summit in the historic coastal town is arguably a case study as to how states can play their part in the country’s diplomacy. Mr. Modi’s decision to wear the traditional veshti, during the leaders’ tour to the iconic ancient monuments, was naturally among the highlights.

The summit gave a new lease of life to Mamallapuram, which was not maintained adequately, despite housing the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

With the PM’s special interest, and the publicity that the visit received globally, efforts are now on to develop the tourist town even after the summit.

Killer borehole

The festive spirit during this Deepavali was dampened after a toddler fell into an abandoned borewell at Nadukattupatti near Manapparai in Tiruchi district on October 25. The state went into mourning after an 80-hour long effort to rescue two-year-old Sujith Wilson, proved to be in vain.

An array of experts and government agencies made countless rescue attempts using various contraptions and equipment. After all such attempts failed, the State and National Disaster Response Force led a mission to dig an adjacent passage through the rocky using a massive drilling rig to reach the boy. Although this went on for over 36 hours, NDRF and SDRF officials decided to lift the boy up directly from the abandoned borewell at around 1.30 a.m. on October 29, after a foul smell started emanating, indicating he may not be alive. Sujith’s “highly decomposed and dismembered” body was brought out at 2.30 a.m.

Trouble next door

The turf tussle between Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi and Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy played out on the ground, in courtrooms and, even raged on Twitter, through 2019.

Ms. Bedi’s constant “championing of the public cause”, convening parallel meetings with ranking officials and thwarting Cabinet decisions of the Government, such as distributing rice in lieu of cash to ration card-holders or appointment of State Election Commissioner---in both instances the Ministry of Home Affairs endorsed the LG’s stand---have so provoked Mr. Narayanasamy that unusually colourful language has crept into his tirades of late. He has also threatened to sue Ms. Bedi for contempt for interfering in the day-to-day functioning of the Government in spite of an April Madras High Court ruling curtailing the Administrar’s bounds of power. And, he capped off his battles, which had begun with an unprecedented day-night dharna outside the Raj Nivas in February, by submitting a memorandum in December to the visiting President Ram Nath Kovind seeking Ms. Bedi’s recall.

The usually quiet temple town of Kancheepuram witnessed the once-in-40-years Athivaradhar festival in July - August when over a crore devotees visited the Sri Devarajaswamy temple to catch a glimpse of the wooden idol of Athivaradhar brought out from the Ananthasaras tank. The idol was kept in sayana kolam (lying posture) and nindra kolam (standing posture) during the festival when VIPs and VVIPs too flocked to the town. As the number of devotees to the temple kept increasing by the day, the district administration, Hindu Religious Charitable Endowments and police had to make longer queues and create more facilities including toilets and provision of food and water. The crowds were overwhelming and laxity in crowd control measures led to deaths and injuries for devotees. There was also a demand for allowing the idol to be kept for darshan for another 48 days but the High Court struck it down and on the last day the idol was ceremoniously restored to its chamber inside the temple tank.

GIM 2 – an outreach exercise

In 2019, Tamil Nadu government hosted the second edition of the Global Investors Meet (GIM), one of the pet projects of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. Despite initial scepticism about this effort, it turned out more MoUs were signed than during the first edition of GIM in 2015. The government signed 304 MoUs and agreements entailing investments to the tune of Rs. 3,00,431 crore. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said these, in the next few years, will provide job opportunities to over 10 lakh people across the state. A total of 12,360 MoUs were signed in the MSME sector which has attracted over Rs 32,206 crore.

But there were high profile repatriation events too, particularly the Natrajar idol of Kallidaikurichi, stolen in 1982, whichwas brought back in September from Australia. Former Commissioner of the HR & CE M. Veera Shanmuga Moni was arrested in a case related to misappropriation of funds and gold collected towards the renovation of the Kanchipuram temple. Police also arrested an Indian-origin French woman who was allegedly part of a gang that had been illegally running stolen antique idols and artefacts for several years. Mr. Manickavel had to exit from the helm of affairs after his term expired year end, and the High Court directed him to hand over all files pertaining to the Idol Wing to his successors.

Catch ‘em young gone wrong

In an announcement that drew criticism from several quarters, the School Education Department declared that students of classes 5 and 8 will have to write public exams at the end of the academic year in April 2020. While the state announced that no student would be failed for the first three years, students who take up the state board stream in Tamil Nadu now will still have to face the pressure of writing up five public exams - in classes 5, 8, 10,11, and 12.

8- year hitch: Local body polls

The local body polls were held after a gap of 8 years, but only for the rural local bodies, amidst controversy. After a long legal battle and delimitation process, the polls were announced, but only for 27 districts after the DMK approached the courts seeking a stay on conduct of elections in the newly-created districts. With the Supreme Court clearing the decks, the polls were held in two phases for district panchayats, district panchayat unions, and village panchayats. Both the phases saw brisk polling, and the DMK overtook the ruling party. Poll watchers say one cannot ignore what this may portend for the Assembly polls due in 2021.

A matter of justice

On September 6, the then Chief Justice of Madras High Court Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani tendered her resignation after the Supreme Court collegium decided to transfer her to the High Court of Meghalaya. Lawyers from Tamil Nadu as well as her home State Maharashtra protested against the collegium’s decision, claiming the move to transfer her to a relatively smaller High Court, appeared to be “punitive” action. The outrage forced the Supreme Court to take the unprecedented step of issuing a statement explaining that reasons for transfer of judges were not generally disclosed in the interest of the institution but the collegium would not hesitate to disclose them if a need arose.

The big picture

The results of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the first that the State faced without its two towering leaders, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, saw a virtual repeat of the 2004 parliament elections. Then, the AIADMK saw a washout. But, this time, it managed a solitary seat, which was won by P. Raveendranath Kumar, the son of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, in Theni, regarded as the party’s traditional bastion. The anti-Modi narrative, adopted by the Opposition, was the critical factor that tilted the scale in its favour.

Apart from losing very badly, the AIADMK’s vote share had plummeted to around 18%, the lowest since 1996. On the other hand, the DMK’s tally rose to about 32.8%, the highest in the last 40 odd years. There were others in the electoral fray such as T.T.V. Dhinakaran, Kamal Hassan and Seeman. All the three did not make any huge impact, each polling about 4% to 5% of votes.

A badge for governance

For a political establishment that has been yearning for recognition, the publication of findings of the Centre’s good governance index in the last week of December came as a morale booster. Tamil Nadu was ranked first in the composite index and out of nine sectors, it finished on top. Even though the State secured the 14th rank in the sector of commerce and industries and 9th rank in agriculture was widely commented upon, what went apparently unnoticed was that no other State got the first rank in two sectors.

The State has a demand for nearly 20,000 loads of sand daily. But, only 1,000 loads were being provided.

While nearly 87,000 vehicles have registered for purchase of sand online, only a limited number of loads was being provided, causing a delay, they said.

Members also noted that the imported sand from Malaysia was sold at ₹2,500 per tonne and it worked out to nearly ₹35,000 for three units.

This was expensive compared to imported sand sold in neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, where one tonne was priced at ₹1,500 and ₹1,650.

The State government must reduce the price so that the imported sand could be transported to other places such as Coimbatore and Salem.

Imported sand could also be brought from the neighbouring State, they said. Federation president S.Yuvaraj said about 10,000 loads of M-sand were being supplied daily across the State.

There are about 1,400 M-sand units across the State and only a few have been approved for quality by the Public Works Department.

209,2020/01/05,HC orders production of 102 rejected postal votes,"Passing interim orders on an election petition filed by VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan, who lost to N. Murugumaran of the AIADMK by a thin margin of 87 votes in the Kattumannarkovil Assembly constituency in 2016, the Madras HC has ordered the production of the 102 postal votes that were rejected for reasons such as ‘no marking’ or ‘voter unidentified’.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan directed the constituency’s Returning Officer (RO) R. Muthukumaraswamy to be present in court on January 20, along with the 102 rejected postal votes, so that the judge could personally verify the reasons for the rejection and ascertain their validity. The judge issued the direction after reopening the case, in which arguments had been concluded and judgment reserved on December 18.

The prime ground on which Mr. Thirumavalavan — now a Member of Parliament representing the Chidambaram constituency — had filed the election petition in 2016 was that the rejection of the 102 postal votes was wrong. Noting that the RO had rejected one postal vote for the reason ‘no marking’ and the remaining 101 for the reason ‘voter unidentified’, he argued that all the 102 votes should have been taken into account.

When the judge was perusing the documents after reserving the verdict, he found that the petitioner’s counsel had summoned the RO and examined him as a court witness. However, neither the petitioner’s counsel nor the respondent’s (Mr. Murugumaran’s) counsel had taken any steps to call upon the official to produce the 102 postal votes in court so that the judge could peruse them and find out whether their rejection was valid.

“Delivering a judgment on merits without examining the same would not be just and fair, and even though the parties have deliberately, and for reasons only known to them, shirked their responsibility of seeking production of 102 postal ballots, in order to do complete justice, I hold that this court should peruse the same,” Justice Karthikeyan said. This is the second instance in the recent past of the Madras HC passing an order on an election petition related to a dispute over the counting of postal votes.

Passing interim orders on an election petition filed by M. Appavu of the DMK, who had lost to the AIADMK’s I.S. Inbadurai in the Radhapuram Assembly constituency by a slender margin of 47 votes in 2016, Justice G. Jayachandran in October last ordered the recounting of all postal votes. Accordingly, the postal ballots of that constituency were brought to the HC buildings, and the counting was lso completed under the supervision of a Registrar. Nevertheless, the results of the count were not declared, and the HC could not proceed further in the case due to an interim order passed by the Supreme Court on an appeal moved by Mr. Inbadurai, challenging the HC’s direction to recount the postal votes.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fk8vxc/article30482004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-orders-production-of-102-rejected-postal-votes/article30482005.ece
210,2020/01/05,Stalin goes back to school for reunion,"Friday and Saturday proved memorable for DMK president M.K. Stalin who, despite his busy schedule, visited his alma mater, the Madras Christian College School at Chetpet, to take part in a reunion.

“It is an unforgettable day. We reminisced about the classes in which we studied, the teachers who whacked us, the days when we cut classes, the stationery shops from where we bought pencils and the places where we played,” Mr. Stalin said after spending time with batchmates who had come together after 50 years.

Mr. Stalin had joined the school, where his brother M.K. Alagiri and half-brother M.K. Muthu also studied, in Class VI. Trade unionist and former Chennai Mayor R. Kuchelar had secured admission for him.

“I had visited this place even when I was the Mayor of Chennai. Now, I am the leader of the Opposition. I will tell you later about my future visits,” Mr. Stalin said.

On Friday, Mr. Stalin sat in the classrooms where he used to study. He spent time with his teachers and classmates. “The room now hosts kindergarten classes. The headmaster showed as around. Other places remain the same,” he said.

Mr. Stalin’s social studies teacher Lakshmi Narayanan, a nonagenarian who had come all the way from Salem, was seen fondly patting Mr. Stalin.

211,2020/01/05,Florist files case against Raj Bhavan for non-settlement of dues,"A florist has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court alleging that the secretariat in the Raj Bhavan was yet to settle his dues to the tune of ₹1.82 lakh for having supplied flowers between December 2014 and June 2015 when Konijeti Rosaiah was in office as the Governor of the State.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan has granted time till January 28 for government counsel to get instructions from the Deputy Secretary to the Governor and the comptroller of Governor’s household on the issue.

Sterling Flowers, represented by its manager Basheer Ahmed, of Pammal, filed the case.

Regular supplier

In his affidavit, Mr. Ahmed said that he had been a regular supplier of flowers, hybrid flowers and decoration articles to the Raj Bhavan for over 15 years. He reportedly supplied flowers on many occasions on credit despite the accumulation of dues, which ran to a few lakh rupees. According to the petitioner, as many as eight invoices raised by him between December 2014 and June 2015 for a total amount of ₹2.82 lakh remained unsettled for long. Subsequently, the Raj Bhavan paid him ₹1 lakh, but did not settle the rest despite sending several reminders till September 2019, he claimed. “Finally, because of delayed payments from respondent Raj Bhavan and financial difficulties, I was forced to stop the supply of flowers... Because of the delay, I have suffered financial loss and incurred interest for the amount which I had borrowed for supplying flowers to the Raj Bhavan,” his affidavit read.

The petitioner sought a direction to Raj Bhavan officials to settle the outstanding dues with interest at the rate of 10.5% per annum.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/florist-files-case-against-raj-bhavan-for-non-settlement-of-dues/article30481908.ece
212,2020/01/05,"HC asks AICTE, Anna University to work in tandem with each other","The Madras High Court has impressed upon the necessity for the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) as well as Anna University in Chennai to work in tandem with each other on issues such as keeping a check over infrastructural facilities in private engineering colleges, approving courses and fixing student intake.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad made the observation while holding that the university had no legal authority to reduce the student intake fixed by AICTE without taking deficiencies, if any, in a college to the notice of the council with a request to act fast against the college concerned in the interest of the students.

“The AICTE, upon receiving such information (from the university), shall be bound to consider and pass appropriate orders and not shelve the issue by avoiding to take action as it would directly affect the affiliation granted by the university, the running of the courses and also importantly, the fate of the students,” the first Division Bench said.

The judgment was passed on a writ appeal preferred by Infant Jesus College of Engineering in Thoothukudi. The college was aggrieved over the university having substantially reduced the intake of students fixed by the AICTE for aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering and Master of Business Administration courses offered by the institution.

Affiliating authority

Defending its action before the court, the university claimed that it had all the authority to reduce the intake, due to deficiencies identified during personal inspections, since it was the affiliating authority. In the same breath, the university conceded that any increase in intake could be approved only by the AICTE and not by the university.

Not in agreement with such a stand taken by the university, the judges called upon Central Government Standing counsel R. Rabu Manohar to ascertain the stand of AICTE on the issue. He, on instructions, told the court that no other authority but for the AICTE was empowered to increase or decrease the intake of students in an engineering college.

After recording his submission, the Bench said: “The power to do, on general principles, also includes the power to undo... The power to increase the intake also includes the power to decrease the intake. We, therefore, find it difficult to read a parallel exercise of power in the hands of the university in the matter of reduction alone.”

Authoring the verdict, the Chief Justice pointed out that the Supreme Court in Parshvanath Charitable Trust’s case, decided in December 2012, observed that the opinion of the AICTE, being an authority constituted under a Central Act, should take precedence over the opinion of the State governments or the universities concerned.

Role of AICTE

In the same judgment, the apex court stated that the AICTE’s role was only advisory and recommendatory and that it was not a superior authority that could supervise or control the universities. Therefore, it was essential that both the authorities act in “coalition and coordination” to ensure timely action against colleges, the High Court stressed.

Though the AICTE Act of 1987 empowers only the council to fix permitted intake of students in courses offered by engineering colleges, “it goes without saying that the university has the authority either to affiliate or disaffiliate or suspend the affiliation, as per the statutes, in the event of an eventuality,” the Bench concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-asks-aicte-anna-university-to-work-in-tandem-with-each-other/article30481830.ece
213,2020/01/05,Leaders condole Pandian’s death,"Political leaders cutting across party lines have condoled the death of former Assembly Speaker P.H. Pandian.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday expressed his condolences to the family of the AIADMK bigwig, who passed away after a prolonged illness.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin said Mr. Pandian had served in the State Assembly and in the Lok Sabha as the Member of Parliament from Tirunelveli.

“Though P.H. Pandian was politically opposed to the DMK, former DMK president M. Karunanidhi liked him. The reason for that was his belief in Dravidian ethos, viewpoints, self-respect and determination,” he said. Mr. Pandian’s passing was a loss not just to political leaders but also to the legal community, he added.

DMDK president Vijayakant said Mr. Pandian was fair when he held the Speaker’s chair. “I express my condolences to his family, his relatives and his party,” he said.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss said Mr. Pandian was elected to the Assembly before he even turned 40, and performed well. “Though he took certain decisions that were controversial, he was bold in [taking] his decisions. Mr. Pandian, who had been a member of the Assembly four times and a Lok Sabha MP once, was also a formidable lawyer and an educator,” he said.

‘Gone too soon’

MDMK chief Vaiko said the leader had gone too soon. “Political differences aside, Mr. Pandian was someone who was cordial. He was friendly to me and performed well in Parliament,” he said.

Tamil Maanila Congress leader G.K. Vasan said Mr. Pandian’s death was a great loss for the AIADMK. “He was a confidante to MGR, Jayalalithaa and Moopanar,” he said.

214,2020/01/05,Babus beat police in cricket match kicked off by CM,"Saturday saw officers who share the corridors of power sweat it out in a cricket match on the Marina.

It was a showdown between the officers of the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. In the end, the former reigned supreme over the latter.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami not only inaugurated the match, but also tried his hand at batting, hitting a few shots off balls bowled by Minister D. Jayakumar and Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy.

Winning the toss, the IPS team, led by Additional Director General of Police Sunil Kumar, chose to bowl first. The IAS officers, led by Additional Chief Secretary Md. Nasimuddin, scored 164 in 22 overs. Nagercoil Sub Collector Pavan Kumar was the top-scorer with 52 runs, while Tiruppur Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan scored 35.

Faced with a daunting target, the IPS officers managed to score only 102 runs before being bowled out. NIB-CID SP Kalaiselvan scored 28 runs, while Cyber Crime Wing SP G. Shasank Sai hit a well-made 26. Ramanathapuram SP Varun scored 12 runs, while the others got out in single digits.

Dheeraj Kumar, principal secretary, Youth Welfare and Sports Development, told The Hindu, “For the first time, we are organising games like cricket, football and badminton for officers of All India Services and Central Services in Tamil Nadu during weekends. Today, the first cricket match was held. Other matches will be played in the coming weeks. Women officers will play badminton matches.”

“The officers are burdened with routine work. To beat stress, they should show some interest and get involved in sporting activities,” said the CM, clad in cricket uniform, during the inauguration of the event.

216,2020/01/05,"I hope the focus is not just on me in ‘83’, says Kapil Dev","Former India World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev hopes that the focus is not just on him, but on the entire squad in the upcoming film “’83” which narrates the story of the historic 1983 World Cup triumph.

In “’83”, directed by Kabir Khan, features Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev, who led the team to India’s first-ever World Cup win against the mighty West Indies.

Point him out that the focus will be on him in the film, the legendary all-rounder, said, “I hope not.”

“I am the captain, I am a team man. I think everybody should get their performance to look into at. I don’t look at my performance, it is the team’s performance.

“That’s how the game of cricket is. It is not about one person but everybody. Everybody gave 100 per cent and that’s how the team won the World Cup,” Kapil Dev told PTI in an interview.

The movie, also starring Tahir Raj Bhasin, Pankaj Tripathi, Saqib Saleem, Hardy Sandhu, among others, is seen as one of the most anticipated films of 2020.

Kapil Dev said his job was to share as much information as possible with the makers.

“We know what we did. It is difficult to judge what they are going to put in and make. So you sit and give your side of the story and let them do it, they are smart people, they had done enough research,” he said.

The veteran cricketer said he was initially concerned about how the makers will show the historical win on the celluloid.

“When I first heard the story, I was confused, I didn’t know how it will happen. There is so much to talk about it. You are concerned about how it will come out. We are a little bit concerned and worried about how the movie will come out but I do hope everything will be ok,” he added.

Kapil Dev also coached Ranveer for the film and the entire cast was trained by former India players Balwinder Sandhu and Yashpal Sharma, who were part of the World Cup winning team.

Asked how important it is to get the formal training in cricket right, Dev said, “I think it was not easy. You are trying to create something which happened 30 to 40 years back with so many characters. It is not just one Kapil Dev. There is a team of 14 players and to bring them all together, it is quite a tough job.”

“83”, produced by Madhu Mantena, Vishnu Induri and Kabir, and presented by Reliance Entertainment, will release on April 10.

In reality, when asked as a captain how difficult was it then to lead a team that was considered as underdogs, Dev said, “Nothing is difficult when you are enjoying something. When you are passionate about something it is not difficult. I have never taken it as a difficult thing. Never at all. It was enjoyable and fantastic.

“That’s the way I look into life. When you are in love, it is a great time, it is not a difficult time. Similarly, when you are playing for the country it is a good time, it is not a difficult time. If it is difficult time then don’t play.”

Competing with two time World Champions West Indies, which had some of the greatest players of all time -- Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Clive Llyod, Vivian Richards in the finals at Lord’s, didn’t seem easy but Dev said for him and his team-mates the aim was to give their best.

India were all out for just 183. So, what was the discussion at the break and according to Kapil, he motivated the team by saying “they are the best”.

“Basically, we wanted to just enjoy and give our 100 per cent. We had reached here so we must have done something really well, those kinds of chats we had. On the ground, you don’t look other team is bigger than you, you say, you are the best team and then you believe in yourself,” he added.

He further said while playing cricket one shouldn’t look at the result but play the game with a positive mindset.

“You have to keep on doing your best. With sports one has to understand that you are not looking for the result, you are looking to play good cricket. We just went in and start saying our team is good enough, we are ready to win every match. You have to think positive. That is the only message I believe in.”

When team India came on the field to ball, Dev believes right from the beginning, every moment was a game changer for them.

“I think from the first wicket from Balwinder Singh Sandhu bowled that was also a game-changer, why only say, the catch (of Richards) changed the game. At every step, we were changing the game,” he added. Sandhu dismissed Greenidge for 1.

Dev will be turning 61 on January 6 and it is like any other day for him.

“I like to spend the day as simply as possible. Nothing change in that,” he added.

The team of “’83” has recreated Dev’s match-winning innings of 175 runs against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge stadium.

Kabir had earlier said that a video capturing the moment will be unveiled on January 6, which is Dev’s birthday.

“It is nice it is coming out. It is all wonderful,” Dev said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/38ns56/article30484054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAPILDEV,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-hope-the-focus-is-not-just-on-me-in-83-says-kapil-dev/article30484055.ece
217,2020/01/05,CM busy looking after his family welfare: Bhongir MP,"Congress MP from Bhongir, Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, has alleged that instead of thinking about people’s welfare and development, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is spending all his energies on the welfare and development of his family members.

Speaking at the party workers meeting of Ibrahimpatnam municipality on the outskirts of the city on Sunday, he said Mr. Rao is preparing the ground to crown his son K.T. Rama Rao as the Chief Minister, besides trying to send his daughter K. Kavitha, who was defeated in the last Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad, to Rajya Sabha.

The difference between the Congress leadership and the leadership of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), is people, he said. While people are important to the Congress leadership, posts and positions are important to the TRS leadership, he said. Mr. Rao failed to keep any of the promises he made during the two elections, he said.

Commenting on Mr. Rao’s reported warning to his Cabinet colleagues that they would lose ministerial berths in case the party is defeated in the municipal elections in their areas, he sought to know why he had not quit as TRS president and as Chief Minister following the defeat of his daughter Ms. Kavitha at Nizamabad, if the same yardstick is to be applied.

Alleging that the State government had diverted funds released by the Centre to municipalities, the Congress leader demanded that the government issue a white paper on the release of funds during the last six years.

Turning to the local TRS leaders, including the MLA, the Congress leader alleged that instead of sparing some time on the development of Ibrahimpatnam, they are indulging in land grabbing, including encroachment of tanks. The local legislator has no sincerity even to get funds released for the development of Ibrahimpatnam, the Congress MP said and asked the party workers to work for the victory of Congress candidates.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cm-busy-looking-after-his-family-welfare-bhongir-mp/article30488364.ece

219,2020/01/05,Palle Pragati: cleanliness a challenge for several villages,"The second phase of Palle Pragati has already begun, but just four days into the village development programme, the public involvement and enthusiasm in many villages seems to be slightly lower than it was in the first phase.

In the village of Girmapur with a population of less than 1,000, a large number of saplings have been planted on both sides of the road. They have grown to a considerable height, giving hope that the survival rate would be better. But, a few metres away, drains filled with dirty water and some garbage lie by the road side. At a few places they were even overflowing. Reason? No resident of the village has been following up on Palle Pragati phase I works despite repeated appeals by the authorities. The cleanliness programme was confined to 30-day action programme implemented by the government during last year.

At the entry point, garbage is being burnt on the road side, indicating that dumpyard is not yet ready.

On the first day of phase II, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, Sangareddy Collector M. Hanumantha Rao and Medak Collector K. Dharma Reddy visited villages in their respective areas. The common problem that they observed was that the drains were not clean and at some place they were overflowing.

At Konayipally (PT) in Manoharabad mandal, Mr. Harish Rao raised the issue of lack of cleanliness; Mr Dharma Reddy at Khajipally village in Medak mandal pointed to drains being clogged with garbage and instructed officials to impose penalty on litterbugs; and Mr. Hanumantha Raofound garbage on the roads and clogged drains at Shivampet. The three visits highlighted the urgency to focus on community involvement.

“We will take up cleaning in wards from Monday. In some drains, the cement base has eroded making it difficult to clean it,” said an officer participating in the programme in Girmapur.

As honorary guest, she was attending the awards function on the Sri Apurupa Venkateswaralayam premises at Mamidipally on NH-63.

Presiding over the Bala Kavi Sammelanam after the awards presentation, noted Telugu poet and writer V.P. Chandan Rao said that seeing the potential of the 66 child participants in the sammelanam, one could say Sri Sris, Dasarathis and CiNaRes were in the making.

On the occasion, writer Prabhakar Jain, who was the chief guest, released an anthology of poems titled ‘Sarpayagam’ put together by students of Vijaya High Schools in Nizamabad and Armoor, and said each of the 66 poems strongly condemned the rising sexual assaults on women and criticised the social stigma attached to the victims/ survivors.

Noted film director and writer Akkineni Kutumba Rao said children’s poetry was remarkably different from Telugu poetry of today. The expression of feelings on the current issue was sharp and thought provoking, he opined.

Earlier, the Apurupa awards for the year 2019 were presented to Chandra Prakash (stage play); Laxma Reddy (social service); Amballa Janardhan (story writing); Devika Raj (light music); Nirmalananda Swami (classical music); Mallavarapu Chinnaiah (novel writing) and Katragadda Bharati (limbs donation).

223,2020/01/05,UPSC to conduct an exclusive exam for railways,"The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) will be conducting an exclusive examination for recruitment of officers to handle specialised services in the newly created Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) following unification of eight different railway services. It will happen in next recruitment circle of 2021.

Top sources in the Indian Railways stated that the UPSC will be given information about the requirement of the cadre in various wings for the services, engineering or otherwise, and accordingly the number of posts will be notified.

“For instance, we could convey to the UPSC that we need 200 officers with 20 each engineers in civil, electrical, mechanical/stores, electronics and fifth will be for general service for traffic, accounts and personnel wings. Candidates from engineering will have to take the main examination on their specialised domain course and not any other subject,” they explained.

‘Departmentalism’ culture

The objective behind the “historic” massive restructuring of the Indian Railways management is to remove the ‘departmentalism’ culture which has seeped all the way up to the Railway Board and ensure there is “one service and officers from one batch should get promotion in on go” and not as has been happening thus far.

Chairman, Railway Board Vinod Kumar Yadav, having just received a year’s extension, has asserted that the 350-odd officers joining railway service annually will all have an equal opportunity of reaching the top posts of divisional railway managers (DRMs) and above including general managers as well as to the Railway Board.

“Till now, only those chosen to become 34 DRMs each year based on their UPSC marks and date of birth had opportunity to reach higher posts with rest not even evaluated. For IRMS, we will benchmark performance and personal integrity for all those joining service based on their 15-year tenure by a group of three senior officers,” he explained.

Top posts for all

In this fashion, the thinking is that the best of the officers will rise in the ranks to the top management positions. “While specialised engineering will continue to be relevant, for the top posts everyone irrespective of the department will get a chance as at a high level they should be able to tackle any situation,” is the argument.

The CRB has already clarified that existing officers would not be discriminated against in terms of promotions or posts as a Group of Ministers would be looking into it to make necessary adjustments even in creating new posts to accommodate performers.

Another “big” change has been to bring the general managers of various railway zones into the Apex grade of Chief Secretary level or equal to the Railway Board members with full powers over various departments. “We will make the RB leaner and focused with 50 senior officers posts cut in one go and more will be reassigned,” added Mr. Yadav.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qfu30a/article30488237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06CRB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/upsc-to-conduct-an-exclusive-exam-for-railways/article30486328.ece
224,2020/01/05,SBI asks Telangana to pay dues in food credit account,"The stalemate over the apportionment of food credit advances availed from the State Bank of India by civil supplies corporations of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have resulted in the SBI asking the Telangana government to liquidate its outstanding with immediate effect.

The SBI, which hosts the food credit accounts of the two States, has said these accounts are subject to the NPA (non-performing assets) norms of the RBI and liable to be classified as NPA if they remained irregular or overdue for more than 90 days. “While the interest in respect of these accounts is being serviced, it is observed that the position of stocks and outstanding is running almost static for the past few years. The position revealed is not satisfactory as the account is overdue for liquidation now,” the SBI said in a letter addressed to Telangana government.

The Andhra Pradesh government had informed the bank that the apportioned amount due from it has been liquidated. “As the outstanding in this account pertains to the share of Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation as per the internal adjustment between the two corporations, liquidation of this account need to be prioritized,” the letter said.

The food credit accounts are to be liquidated before availing fresh loan for subsequent season.

Credit rating

The issue about the ownership of the food credit account was continuing since Bifurcation of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh without any favourable resolution. The delay in resolution was against the credit discipline and would also affect the State’s future prospect of raising funds through market as the event of default would also be reported to the RBI through Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) database.

“Food credit account is being participated by almost all the banks, including the State cooperative banks, and any default in the conduct of the facility will adversely impact all the participatory banks,” the letter said. It mentioned two accounts (RBI Account VII KMS with current outstanding ₹ 3,453.41 crore and RBI Account VIII KMS with outstanding of ₹ 254.81 crore).

Credit apportionment

Senior officials said there were discrepancies with regard to apportionment of cash credit between the two States post Bifurcation of the erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh Civil Supplies Corporation. The State had repaid ₹ 2,310 crore to the cash credit account of AP Civil Supplies Corporation and only ₹ 452.47 crore was due to AP Civil Supplies Corporation instead of ₹ 865.86 crore as claimed by AP. Moreover, an amount of ₹ 354.08 crore, claimed by AP Civil Supplies Corporation as subsidy from the Central government, was reflected as liability of the Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation. “This is incorrect as subsidy claimed would be released to the AP Corporation and not to Telangana,” an official said.

The issue figured in the recent meetings of the officials to resolve the pending bifurcation issues wherein the State sought permission to service monthly interest of ₹ 1,799.47 crore as communicated by the SBI. “The interest paid by the Telangana Civil Supplies Corporation if found to be excess at a future date will be adjusted against the principal amount due to AP,” according to the minutes of the meeting between the two States held recently.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/yklbw3/article30488375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06PROCUREMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sbi-asks-ts-to-prioritise-closing-of-food-credit-account/article30486211.ece

The AIMIM president also announced that a protest meeting will be held at the historic Charminar here on January 25 against the CAA, adding “We will hoist the tricolour on January 25 midnight and recite the national anthem. The meeting would be to save the Constitution and the country.”

On January 10, a peaceful march will also be taken out in Hyderabad against the CAA, he said.

Talking about the violent protests against CAA in UP, Owaisi said he condemned violence wherever it occurred but would like to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi whether the Prevention of Destruction of Public Property Act, 1984 applied to them (UP incidents) or not.

Owaisi slams Pakistan PM Imran Khan

Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan posting a video, Mr. Owaisi said Khan has posted a wrong Bangladeshi video claiming it to be from India.

“Mr Khan, you worry about your own country. Mr Khan, we would like to tell you, don’t ever remember us. We have rejected the message, the wrong theory of Jinnah. We are proud Indian Muslims and till the day of judgment, Inshallah, we will remain as proud Indian Muslims.”

“No power on earth can take away my Indianness. No power on earth can take away my religious identity. Why because, the Constitution of India guarantees me that,” he said.

The Pakistan Prime Minister should safeguard the Sikhs and stop those who attacked a Sikh gurdwara in Pakistan, Mr. Owaisi said.

According to Owaisi, the CAA was only made towards making India a Hindu Rashtra.

“We are not against granting citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Christians, Sikhs from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh...but why are you doing in the name of religion (by excluding Muslims),” he said.

He challenged the Prime Minister to let the countrymen know if they plan to make (implement) NRC or not by 2024.

231,2020/01/05,Congress faults Chief Minister’s ‘silence’,"Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday demanded Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to convene a special Assembly session to pass a resolution rejecting implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens in Telangana.

“Many Chief Ministers in the country openly declared that their States would not implement the legislation. But why is KCR silent on it?” he wondered.

Mr. Reddy recalled the ‘alliance’ of TRS and the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre, where the former supported decisions, including demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax, election of the President and the Vice-President, among others.

Addressing party workers in a poll-preparatory meeting in Miryalaguda, he said the Urban Local Bodies elections would be an appropriate platform for people to come out, vote against TRS, and teach it a lesson.

He urged the many unemployed youth to “give KCR a shock” by defeating TRS, so that the government would roll out the ₹3,016 unemployment allowance scheme.

Besides unemployment, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the State remained a topper in sale of liquor.

“There are 24 lakh unemployed youth in 2019, compared to the 12-lakh figure in 2014. Revenue earned by the State, from liquor was ₹11, 000 crore then, and ₹23, 000 crore this year,” he said.

Many of the promises -- for instance 12% reservations to Muslims in employment and education, made by TRS during elections remain to be fulfilled. And farmers, of the concluded crop season, are yet to receive Rythu Bandhu incentive in their accounts, he said.

Mr. Reddy also alleged that the State Election Commission is acting in a partisan manner by favouring the Telangana Rashtra Samithi in the upcoming polls.

Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, who was part of meetings in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, alleged that the State government is diverting Central funds.

Addressing a meeting of beedi rollers, packers and other employees here on Saturday, Telangana Bahujan Beedi Workers’ Union convener S. Sidhiramulu said that of the total 60 lakh beedi workers in the country, 8 lakh were in Telangana alone. However, they have hardly 12 days of work in a month.

‘Favouring corporates’

The Central government, being hand in gloves with major corporate companies, has imposed several conditions on the beedi industry resulting in widespread unemployment, he said.

Warning symbols on beedi labels and GST have badly affected the industry and political parties which had come to power with several promises to workers had ultimately betrayed them, he said and added that loans for construction of houses for beedi workers and scholarships for their children were denied. He said that the G.O. No.41 achieved with 32-day strike was not implemented.

At a separate meeting at AITUC office, Left JAC leaders said that the BJP-led government at the Centre and TRS regime in the State were trying to amend Labour Acts to do favour big investors and corporate companies. They were also out to sell public sector undertakings despite them doing well, the leaders added.

A private company has invested ₹ 30 crore under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode by setting up a plant to process 300 tonnes of dry waste through artificial intelligence, Asad Warsi, the Centre’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s adviser for Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), told PTI.

With its robotic technology, the plant, spread over an area of four acres, segregates dry waste items like plastic, glass and metal.

“As per an agreement, the firm has been paying ₹1.51 crore premium from its profit to the IMC,” he said.

The IMC has been producing compost and bio-CNG fuel from the wet waste, Mr. Warsi said.

“Besides, the construction and demolition waste is being turned into bricks, tiles and other stuff, which fetches the civic body ₹2.5 crore annually,” he added.

The IMC has given the task of garbage collection to three NGOs.

In the first phase, these NGOs have started collecting dry waste from 22,000 households by paying ₹2.5 per kg of waste to the house owner, Mr. Warsi said.

Besides, these NGOs have been paying a premium to the IMC as per the terms and conditions on which they have been handed over the work, he said.

Nearly 1,200 tonnes of waste, comprising 550 tonnes of wet waste and 650 tonnes of dry waste, was being disposed off daily in Indore, which has population of about 35 lakh.

While a total of 146 children died in Umaid and MDM hospitals in Jodhpur in December, 102 deaths were reported in the Neo natal intensive care unit.

The figures of infant deaths in Jodhpur were given in a report prepared by the S N Medical College in the light of casualties in Kota’s J K Lon Hospital.

Over 100 infants have died in the government-run hospital in Kota.

Principal of the S N Medical College S S Rathore, however, said the figure is in the range of international standards of infant mortality.

“We [the BJP] put a lot of trust in the Sena and fought the Assembly poll with them…but this proved to be a mistake. Had we gone it alone, today the BJP would have formed the government in Maharashtra,” he claimed.

The Konkan strongman, once an ardent Shiv Sainik but now a bitter foe of his former party, further said that the new Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government under Mr. Thackeray would not last more than two months.

‘Nominal Chief Minister’

“Uddhav Thackeray has no proper knowledge nor has done adequate study of the pressing issues afflicting the State…he is just a nominal Chief Minister,” said Mr. Rane.

Mr. Rane had formally joined the BJP and merged his party — the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha (MSP) — in October last year ahead of the Assembly poll.

In September 2017, Mr. Rane severed his decade plus-long association with the Congress which he had joined following his acrimonious exit from the Sena.

His exit from the Congress, equally laden with acrimony, was with the expectation that the BJP, which is weak in the Konkan belt, would welcome him with open arms.

At the time of his exit, Mr. Rane had vowed to deplete the ranks of his former parties, the Shiv Sena and the Congress.

Since then, he has repeatedly targeted his former party, the Sena, launching vitriolic attacks on Mr. Thackeray.

Ahead of the elections, Mr. Thackeray had warned his then ally, the BJP, that the Sena would exit the saffron coalition if the BJP inducted Mr. Rane.

As a result, the Kankavli Assembly segment, in particular, and the Konkan belt, in general, had turned out to be a major flashpoint between the erstwhile saffron allies where the BJP and the Sena, despite contesting together, had propped up their own candidates.

The BJP fielded Mr. Rane’s youngest son, sitting MLA Nitesh Rane, from the Kankavli Assembly segment — a move that severely irked the Sena which in turn propped up its own nominee, local Sena leader Satish Sawant.

To checkmate the Sena, Mr. Rane also fielded his aides, Rajan Teli and Ranjit Desai, against the Sena’s nominees Deepak Kesarkar and Vaibhav Naik for the Sawantwadi and Kudal seats, respectively.

However, in spite of Mr. Rane leaving no stone unturned to checkmate the Sena in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg belt, the BJP could win only two seats, including the Kankavli seat.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/krta7l/article30484517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05NARAYANRANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-would-have-won-maharashtra-assembly-polls-had-it-not-gone-with-shiv-sena-says-narayan-rane/article30484518.ece
238,2020/01/05,Assam tribal group slams ‘indigenous’ claim by non-tribal communities,"Non-tribal communities living in Assam can never claim to be ‘khilonjia’ or indigenous, said the All-Assam Kochari Samaj that represents the earliest ethnic communities inhabiting the State.

Leaders of the samaj, in a statement on Friday evening, also slammed the Assam government and non-tribal people for destroying tribal history and cultures.

The Assam Sahitya Sabha and All-Assam Students’ Union (AASU) have panned the statement as “immature” and “politically-motivated” to undermine the ongoing movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The samaj’s statement assumes significance ahead of a report to be submitted by a 15-member panel enlisting the communities that qualify to be called ‘khilonjia’ for implementing Clause 6 of the Assam Accord of 1985. This clause prescribes land and constitutional rights only for the indigenous in Assam.

The 1881 census recorded 19 groups within the Kochari classification but some got isolated from the parental stock. Today, it comprises communities such as Bodo, the largest plains tribe in the northeast, Deuri, Dimasa, Rabha, Sonowal Kachari, Thengal Kachari and Tiwa. Large swathes of Assam are under autonomous or development councils specifically for these communities.

“Kochari kings began ruling areas under present-day Assam and beyond 1,500 years before the Mahabharata era. But the non-tribal have pushed the tribal history aside despite the United Nations specifying that only the aborigines can be called indigenous,” said the statement signed by the organisation’s working president Manas Rabha, general secretary Pradip Sonowal and four others representing as may tribes.

The samaj claimed many traits representative of mainstream Assamese culture today were appropriated from the tribes. These include the floral ‘gamosa’, or cloth-towel, that has become a symbol of the anti-CAA protest.

The Kochari group also pointed out that the Ahoms, who came from Thailand some 800 years ago, were non-indigenous. The Ahoms are one of six communities demanding Scheduled Tribe status, which the Kocharis enjoying ST status are opposed to.

‘Baseless claim’

Advising the Assamese to stop making the “baseless claim” of being indigenous or ‘bhumiputra’ (son-of-the-soil), the Kochari Samaj said they would otherwise seek justice from the Supreme Court and approach the U.N. besides the Centre.

“The views of the organisation are utterly immature. I appeal to their leaders to come to our office with facts and discuss for establishing their claims and specify the communities they consider non-tribal. We should refrain from comments that divide the indigenous communities,” said Paramanda Rajbongshi, former president of Assam Sahitya Sabha.

“This seems to be a political move. Such organisations should exercise restraint and refrain from making communally sensitive statements when the Assamese are agitating for their existence,” AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-tribal-group-slams-indigenous-claim-by-non-tribal-communities/article30484433.ece
239,2020/01/05,JD(U) general secretary asks Nitish Kumar to reject ‘divisive CAA-NPR-NRC’ scheme,"JD(U) general secretary Pavan Varma on Sunday asked party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the “divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme”, saying this has “nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence“.

In an open letter to Mr. Kumar, Mr. Varma expressed his surprise at the “unilateral” announcement of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who is from the BJP, that the National Population Register exercise will be carried out in the State between May 15-28 despite Kumar’s stand against the National Register of Citizens.

“... in consonance with your own publicly stated views, and long established secular vision, may I request you now to take a principled stand against the CAA-NPR-NRC scheme, and reject its nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence.

A clear cut public statement by you to this effect would be a major step towards preserving and strengthening the idea of India to which, I know, you yourself are committed. The politics of principle cannot be sacrificed at the altar of short term political gain,” Mr. Varma said in the letter.

The JD(U) leader has been critical of his party’s decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, and it has now become a law following its passage in both Houses.

Protests have occurred in different parts of the country against the law, which seeks to give citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who had arrived in India due to religious persecution by December 31, 2014.

JD(U) vice president Prashant Kishor has also spoken strongly against the CAA and said this, in combination with the NRC, can turn into a “lethal combo in the hands of the government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion.”

In his letter, Mr. Varma said the CAA-NRC combine is a direct attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims, and to create social instability.

The government has categorically stated, he said, that the NPR is the first step to implementing the NRC and since Mr. Kumar has said that Bihar will not have the NRC, it follows that he must say no to the revised NPR as well.

The Narendra Modi government has dismissed the concerns over the NPR as politically motivated, saying it is a routine exercise and adding that it is yet to take a decision on the NRC.

“The central government needs to focus on the real priorities of governance, such as the disastrous state of the economy, the absence of jobs, and agrarian distress, rather than such schemes whose only aim is to destroy the unity and social cohesion of our great country,” Mr. Varma said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article19872882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-PAVANVARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jdu-general-secretary-asks-nitish-kumar-to-reject-divisive-caa-npr-nrc-scheme/article30484393.ece
240,2020/01/05,"350 BJP cadres, including Kailash Vijayvargiya, booked for ‘threatening’ govt officials in Madhya Pradesh","The police have registered a case against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, an MP, and around 350 party workers, after he was purportedly seen in a video threatening to set “entire Indore on fire” while staging a sit-in on Friday.

As the workers protested outside the Indore Divisional Commissioner’s house against the anti-mafia drive of the government, Mr. Vijayvargiya told an official, “We will not tolerate this. There are Sangh [RSS] leaders present here. Otherwise, we would have set the entire Indore on fire.”

Several leaders of the right-wing group, including its chief Mohan Bhagwat, were in the city for an internal meeting.

No arrests yet

The police registered a case, including against Indore MP Shankar Lalwani, on Saturday night, based on complaints of government officials, said Jyoti Umath, City Superintendent of Police, Sanyogitaganj. “Initially, a case for disobedience to order promulgated by public servant was registered. Hours later, four more counts were added. No arrests have been made so far,” she said.

The case was registered under Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 143 (Unlawful assembly), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 153 (Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

BJP protest

The BJP was protesting against the State government’s anti-encroachment drive, which, it alleges, was targeting only structures owned by its workers. On Friday, party leaders had invited senior civic officials to raise the issue with them, but when only junior officials turned up, it riled Mr. Vijayvargiya.

“Have they become so big? The officials should understand that they are public servants,” he purportedly told officials present. “We are requesting government officials in writing that we want to meet them. Will they not even inform us that they are out of town?”

On Saturday, the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee submitted a memorandum to the Director General of Police calling for action against him for obstructing officials from performing duties. “Mr. Vijayvargiya protested against the lawful drive and tried to disrupt peace. Since he is at a top post in the BJP, his one direction will be enough to launch destructive activities in the State,” it said.

‘Political pressure’

Alleging the police had acted under political pressure from the Congress government, State BJP president and MP Rakesh Singh said, “In the name of mafia elimination, only BJP workers are being targeted selectively. Despite having valid documents, their houses are being razed. We will launch a front on this.”

Meanwhile, former chief minister and Congress MP Digvijaya Singh wrote on Twitter, “Whatever he has said, it’s not his mistake. He has been taught by an able Sangh and was just using the language taught by it. After setting fire to society, localities and cities, they have set fire to the country as these are the values the Sangh has given them.”

Months ago, Mr. Vijayvargiya’s son and MLA Akash reportedly thrashed with a cricket bat a civic official in Indore during a demolition drive. A case was registered against him, but he was later released on bail. Without naming him, Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting later said misbehaviour would not be tolerated by him, “whoever they may be”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5y6kg/article30484383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBJPPARLIAMENTARYPARTYMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/350-bjp-cadres-including-kailash-vijayvargiya-booked-for-threatening-govt-officials-in-madhya-pradesh/article30484384.ece

In Rajkot, 134 infants died in December while in Ahmedabad civil hospital there were 85 deaths in the same month but in last three months, 253 infants died in the civil hospital, the State’s largest government hospital.

The numbers were more shocking in Rajkot civil hospital; as many as 1,235 infants deaths were reported in 2019. December saw the highest deaths of new-born babies while with 131 deaths, October saw the second highest in the year.

As soon as the data of deaths surfaced in media and social media, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who is from Rajkot, refused to respond and walked off when presspersons asked him about large number of deaths of new-born babies in government hospitals.

Meanwhile, according to the State government officials, civil hospital in Rajkot caters to several districts so the number is higher and also the number of deliveries go up in November and December.

Among the many factors that have contributed to infant mortality are shortage of medical staff at government hospitals and complete collapse of primary health care services in the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/duz8l6/article30483975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/civiljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/219-infants-deaths-during-december-in-two-of-gujarats-civil-hospitals/article30483974.ece

While paddy fields could not be harvested due to rainwater entering the farms, thousands of quintals of paddy was exposed to rain in absence of proper protection measures in agricultural market yards.

Bhubaneswar Meteorological Centre said 20 of 30 districts received rainfall during 24 hours, ending at 8 a.m. on Saturday. While Balasore received 18 mm of rainfall, Talcher and Angul recorded 15 mm and 11 mm of rainfall, respectively.

Damp crop

“Crop cutting was hit as harvesting machines could not be used due to swampy agricultural fields. In most places, paddy plants were found bending down,” said Prakash Rout, a farmer in Jagatsinghpur.

In several western Odisha districts, lack of adequate protective cover added to the damage. Even though the Special Relief Commissioner had warned farmers about untimely rain, suitable arrangements were not made to save the harvested crop. Paddy stocks have been dampened at market yards resulting in diminish ing of their market value.

“We will conduct detailed survey of crop damage due to untimely rain. After receive damage assessment report, we will be in a position to spell out strategy for compensating farmers,” said Sudam Marndi, Revenue and Disaster Management Minister.

“The total bird population of Chilika lagoon will be around 10.5 lakh-10.7 lakh. This compares favourably with the population of last year. The exact number, along with different species, will be provided by the wildlife wing after a detailed census that is being planned by the Chilika Wildlife Division in the near future,” the CDA, which conducted a surevy of flora and fauna of the lake, said earlier this week.

The migratory bird population in Chilika had crossed the one-million mark for the first time in 2019.

“Due to inclement weather, we could sight 20-30% of birds, which usually flock to the lake during this time. We hope it will cross the one-million mark for the second consecutive year,” said Susanta Nanda, Chief Executive of the CDA.

The Nalabana Bird Sanctuary was notified in 1987.

It has one of the largest congregations with 3,74,752 birds of 114 species, including water fowls.

Most of these water fowls breed outside the subcontinent in the Palearctic region and migrate to Chilika lagoon during the winter for roosting and feeding.

Encroachments removed

Authorities have found birds perching in areas that were recently made encroachment-free.

From an area of about 162 sq. km, enclosures used for prawn culture were uprooted and no new encroachment have been noticed, they added.

“These areas have become the new place of congregation for the birds and the dolphin population. Areas like Gurubai and Parikuda have become Important Bird Areas with presence of large number of migratory ducks and geese,” said Mr. Nanda.

Mr. Sardesai and Mr. Lobo said tourism road shows organised by the Goa government should be stopped as they are a drain on the exchequer and fetching no returns in terms of footfalls.

“First, put your house in order and then invite tourists here. You are participating in road shows but are you ready to welcome quality tourists? We are expecting high quality tourists but why should they come here, to be harassed by touts,” Mr. Lobo asked.

The centres are working on several programmes to improve employability of youngsters to match their qualifications.

The Rajasthan Skill & Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC), which operates the skill development centres, will manage the monitoring unit to control their activities, check negligence and keep a watch on the presence of teachers, trainers and students.

251,2020/01/05,Akali threat to launch agitation a ‘political stunt’: Amarinder,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday hit out at the Akalis, saying their threat of launching an agitation over power tariff hike in the State and their ultimatum in the murder cases of two former sarpanches (village heads) was a “political stunt”.

‘Police doing better job’

The Shiromani Akali Dal has threatened to take to the streets over the two issues. The Chief Minister dubbed it as mere theatrics, aimed at covering up their own “trail of misdeeds and misgovernance of 10 years during their regime”.

Hitting out at the Akali leadership over their threat of agitation if the killers of former Akali sarpanches — Baba Gurdeep Singh and Dalbir Singh Dhilwan — are not arrested within two weeks, Capt. Amarinder said the Punjab police, under the present regime, was doing a much better job at solving crime cases than it ever had under the erstwhile SAD-BJP rule.

“These kind of ultimatums might have worked under the Akali government, when many innocent people were thrown behind bars after being charged in false cases, but under my regime, no innocent person would be victimised for crimes they did not commit,” said the Chief Minister.

Capt. Amarinder also gave data to counter the hue and cry raised by the Akalis on the issue of the power tariff hike.

252,2020/01/05,Dependants of slain soldiers get government jobs in U.P.,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday offered appointment letters to dependants of 11 soldiers from the State killed in action.

All the appointments have been made in Group C and D posts.

State contribution

The State government is contributing three times the amount to be deposited in the ‘Sena Jhanda Diwas Nidhi’ so that there is no dearth of funds for the welfare of brave soldiers, Mr. Adityanath said as he distributed the letters at an event organised at his official residence here.

“It is the responsibility of everyone to honour the families of those who gave up their lives for the country. The government is committed towards providing every possible support to them,” the Chief Minister said.

He said a new ‘Sainik Kalyan’ office is being constructed in Allahabad, Meerut, Kaushambi and Mau to facilitate ex-soldiers.

Quota for ex-servicemen

The State government is providing 5% reservation to ex-servicemen in Group B and C posts and is making efforts to appoint them in all available positions, he said.

The Chief Minister added that for the first time in the State, a Grand Defence Expo is being organised in Lucknow in February where everyone will get a chance to view the state-of-the-art technology and weapons of the defence sector.

254,2020/01/05,File FIR against Vijayvargiya for threatening govt officials: M.P. Congress,"The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday demanded that a criminal case be registered against BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya for allegedly threatening government officials.

Protest video

The Congress demand comes after a video, apparently shot during a protest organised by the BJP here on Friday afternoon, purportedly showed Mr. Vijayvargiya telling officials, “Our Sangh (RSS) leaders are (here), otherwise (we) would have set Indore on fire today.”

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and other senior leaders have been in Indore since Thursday for the organisation’s internal conclave.

The BJP had organised the protest alleging that city officials were biased and taking “politically motivated” action against party workers.

Following the controversy, a delegation of the M.P. Congress Committee on Saturday met the Director General of Police in Bhopal and submitted a memorandum seeking that a case be registered against Mr. Vijayvargiya and legal action be initiated against him, State Congress spokesperson J.P. Dhanopia said.

“When Mr. Vijayvargiya says that he would have set Indore on fire if RSS leaders were not in the city, it would be considered a diktat for his party workers. Therefore, police should file a criminal case against him for threatening the officials,” he said.

The Congress spokesman alleged that Mr. Vijayvargiya wanted to hamper the State government’s ongoing drive against the mafia.

State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal said the Congress government has been acting in a biased manner and taking action against common people on the pretext of a drive against the mafia. “BJP raised the issue of arbitrary and biased action of the administration against the common people. The Congress government has not been taking action against the real mafia and causing trouble to the public,” Mr. Agrawal said.

‘Politically motivated’

The administration has been taking “politically motivated” action against BJP workers during their ongoing drive against the mafia, he added.

During the Friday protest at Indore, Mr. Vijayvargiya lost his temper after none of the top civic and police officials reached the protest site for discussing the issue. In the video, the BJP leader is heard saying, “Have they (top officers) become so big? The officers should understand that they are public servants.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/su15d4/article30481937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05KAILASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/file-fir-against-vijayvargiya-for-threatening-govt-officials/article30481938.ece

256,2020/01/05,Coimbatore expects to get jewellery cluster,"Goldsmiths in Coimbatore, who are into handmade jewellery for decades, are gearing up to set up a common facility centre with machinery that will help them sustain business and cater to more orders.

S.M. Kamalhasan, president of the Coimbatore Goldsmith Association, said that as many as 66 goldsmiths had invested in a special purpose vehicle called Coimbatore Goldsmith Jewellery Private Limited that was incorporated in April 2018. The company had purchased seven cents on Vysial Street and constructed a building too. The plan was to have divisions for melting, casting, filing, testing and quality check and install machinery for various processes.

“The proposal is to have a common facility centre at a total project cost of ₹15.3 crore. We have invested 13 % of the cost in land and building. The State Government will provide 10 % and the Central Government 80 % of the project cost. The project is awaiting State Government approval,” he said. This was similar to the wetgrinder cluster developed in Coimbatore earlier.

Coimbatore earlier had more than one lakh goldsmiths who used to supply handmade jewellery, including chains, necklaces, bangles, and ear rings, to customers and retailers. With corporate companies entering jewellery manufacturing, the goldsmiths were unable to keep pace with competition. Now, Coimbatore has just about 50,000 goldsmiths. With the common facility centre, the goldsmiths can continue to make handmade jewellery and take up large orders that can be done using machinery.

“The 8,000 sq.ft. facility will be a service provider that goldsmiths can use paying a fee. The first year will be for training people to operate the machinery and bringing together members. The centre is expected to start seeing revenue from its second year of operation. We plan to sell jewellery directly to customers once the infrastructure is established and members start using it,” Mr. Kamalhasan said. Most of the machinery would be imported. Directors of the company were visiting several exhibitions to select eqipment for the common facility centre.

B. Karthigaivasan, General Manager of the District Industries Centre, Coimbatore, said the industry submitted the application for cluster project in November and it was now with the State Government. The project was followed up by Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation of India. A steering committee was expected to approve the proposal this month and forward it to the Central Government.

“The committee could not meet earlier because of the local body elections. It is likely to have a meeting this month,” he said.

The final approval from the Central Government was expected by June-July this year, Mr. Karthigaivasan said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-expects-to-get-jewellery-cluster/article30488253.ece

259,2020/01/05,Farmers prefer selling paddy to private traders,"Despite Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation opening up 15 Direct Procurement Centres (DPC) in the district, many farmers prefer selling paddy to private traders as they face practical difficulties in selling their produce at the centres.

Officials at the Department of Agriculture said that paddy is cultivated in about 69,000 acre to 72,000 acre in the district for the current season that was irrigated at Kalingarayan Canal, Thadapalli – Arakankottai Canals, Lower Bhavani Project canals and Mettur East and West Bank canal. Harvesting has commenced in Gobichettipalayam block and Erode that were irrigated by Thadapalli – Arakankottai canals and Kalingarayan canal respectively where 15 centres started functioning from December 19 last year. While Grade A variety of paddy is procured for minimum support price of ₹ 1,905 a quintal, the common variety is purchased for ₹ 1,865 a quintal, officials added.

But farmers prefer selling directly to the traders despite they are getting ₹ 250 to ₹ 300 per quintal less when compared to the procurement price at the centres. Raja alias Krishnan, a farmer from Vairapalayam, said that high cost of transportation and labour cost, waiting time at the centres, officials demanding paddy with 17% moisture content and changing weather conditions prevent them from taking their produce to the centre.

Farmers said that a gunny bag costs ₹ 70 to ₹ 80, while ₹ 10 has to be paid as labour for packing and ₹ 20 per bag for transporting. “We need minimum of 35 bags for packing produce from one acre”, said Mr. Raja, who added that non-availability of labour is a major issue. Another farmer Kuppuswami said that farmers who have tractors, space for drying their produce and workers available with them, are taking their produce to the centre.

Mr. Raja, who sold paddy for ₹ 1,650 a quintal to a trader on Friday, said that trader comes to his field and packs the paddy in gunny bags, weighs it and transports it and pays the money within two days to him. “Hence we prefer selling to private traders”, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vr144l/article30487628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA06PADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farmers-prefer-selling-paddy-to-private-traders/article30487629.ece

265,2020/01/05,Coimbatore Medical College awaits infrastructural boost,"Coimbatore Medical College is expecting to get a shot in the arm in 2020 in terms of infrastructure, academics and patient care as final orders are awaited from the government for the construction of a new hospital at its Peelamedu campus.

Dean B. Asokan told The Hindu that the institution was expecting final orders for the construction of a 500-bedded hospital at the Peelamedu campus, which is currently having teaching facilities like classrooms, lecture halls, library etc.

He said that the new hospital was much-required to expand the infrastructural facilities of the institution as part of increasing the MBBS seats to 250, that is 100 new seats in addition to the existing 150 seats.

“The plan is to construct a four-storeyed building at a cost of ₹120 crore which will primarily offer early clinical experience to MBBS students from first year. The total cost will be borne by the Centre and State governments at 60:40 ratio. The orders are awaited soon and construction will begin this year in all likelihood,” said Dr. Asokan.

While the Peelamedu campus of the institution has around 160 acres of land, Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) situated on Tiruchi Road lacks vacant land.

The proposed new hospital will also be an easily accessible medical facility for patients from the eastern part of Coimbatore and districts like Tiruppur, the Nilgiris and Erode as they do not have to enter the city to reach CMCH.

Once the hospital becomes functional, medical students will not have to travel from Peelamedu to CMCH for clinical experience.

Elevated to a medical college hospital in 1969, CMCH is currently having 2,300 beds though the sanctioned bed strength is 1,182.

The hospital currently handles 6,000 to 7,000 outpatients and around 2,000 inpatients a day.

He invented a wide range of products, researched on a basket of subjects, started skill education programmes, hosted freedom fighters, religious heads, industrialists, and national leaders in Coimbatore, and contributed for the growth of the city.

Giving an insight into the life, thoughts, and achievements of G.D. Naidu (1893 to 1974) are the photographs, collections, and products showcased at the 2,500 sq.ft. GD Naidu Memorial Gallery.

Inaugurating the Gallery here on Saturday, B.K. Krishnaraj Vanavarayar, chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore, said the public, especially students, should visit the Gallery to understand how one man did so much even when conditions were not so favourable.

The aim of opening the Gallery is to inculcate among youth the scientific temper and to encourage them to focus on innovation.

267,2020/01/05,Dom Sibley puts England in control,"A gritty unbeaten 85 from opener Dom Sibley ground down South Africa’s bowlers as England took control on the third day of the second Test against South Africa at Newlands.

Sibley, playing in only his fourth Test, came in during the morning session after James Anderson had picked up the last two South African wickets to finish with five for 40 and give England a first innings lead of 46.

By the close, Sibley was still there and England had reached 218 for four, stretching its overall lead to 264.

Sibley’s 85, his first Test half-century, came off a painstaking 222 balls in just under six hours and included 13 boundaries. It was slow going but it consolidated England’s advantage after Anderson and Ben Stokes combined to secure an important first innings lead.

Anderson completed his 28th Test five-wicket haul — an England record — and Stokes caught last man Anrich Nortje to set an England Test record of five catches by a fielder.

England captain Joe Root made 61 off 98 balls before being caught at slip off Dwaine Pretorius shortly before the close.

Dom Bess, who suffered a golden duck in the first innings, came in as nightwatchman and survived until the last ball of the day when he was adjudged to have gloved a bouncer from Nortje to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, thus collecting a ‘pair’

Stokes held his fifth catch of the innings, all taken at second slip to dismiss last batsman Nortje off Anderson’s bowling.

268,2020/01/05,India-Sri Lanka first T20I abandoned,"The opening match of the India-Sri Lanka three-match T20I series at the ACA Stadium, Barsapara, was abandoned on Sunday without a ball being bowled due to wet patches on the pitch.

The much-anticipated contest, the first match in a T20 World Cup year, had a bizarre end as rain water seeped through the covers and on to the wicket.

Dejected

The abandonment dampened not only the spirit of thousands of enthusiastic fans who had hoped to witness an international match after more than a year, but also for the two teams which were planning to experiment in the run-up to the big event in Australia in October.

It also delayed star Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s comeback following an injury layoff. Things looked bright when India captain Virat Kohli, who left out Manish Pandey, Sanju Samson, Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravindra Jadeja from the playing XI, and elected to field, keeping in mind the dew factor.

Untimely downpour

However, rain lashed the ground 15 minutes before the scheduled 7 p.m. start. The cricket-starved fans, who could not make it to the ground on time, thronged the venue even as it continued to pour for about an hour.

The spectators roared, expecting the match to start when the covers came off, but their wait got longer as the umpires — Anil Choudhary, Nitin Menon and Virender Sharma — were concerned about the wet patches at one end on the pitch. After Kohli had had a look at the damp patches, seemingly due to leakage, the inspection was pushed from 8.15 p.m. to 9 p.m.

The groundstaff, who had worked hard to dry up the outfield using two super soppers, brought out a vacuum cleaner and blew hot air on the wet areas and used a light roller on a piece of cloth spread over the track.

Kohli, along with Rishabh Pant and Shikhar Dhawan, made another visit to the middle when the umpires made their inspection at 9 p.m.

Second inspection

The near-capacity crowd remained hopeful and even danced to popular Bollywood numbers even as the wait continued.

The umpires consulted match referee David Boon and scheduled a second inspection at 9.30 p.m. Around five minutes after the scheduled cutoff time of 9.46 p.m., the match was abandoned.

270,2020/01/05,Ranji Trophy | Vijay Shankar — as tough as they come,"Vijay Shankar has seen freak injuries trouble him regularly, but has battled them all with courage, grit and determination. It probably is this remarkable ability to never give up that has made the selectors hand over the captain's armband to him this Ranji season.

“At times, I have [wondered] why God is so harsh on me. It was probably to test me and make me the stronger person that I am today,” he told The Hindu in an exclusive chat.

Lying on the recovery table at frequent intervals can break hearts and careers, but in Vijay Shankar's case it has made him appreciate the good times and make the most of them.

More than anything, he felt that being out of the game was what hurt him the most. “I must have missed a year or so of First Class cricket through injuries. It’s a long period, but I have always kept that away and made it a point to come back.

“I learnt it all from R. Prasanna (current assistant coach). I have seen him play those important knocks early on in my career and I sought his guidance — though the Tamil Nadu squad had some big names in the list,” said Vijay, whose journey with the State squad began eight years ago.

“The other players did outstanding things, but I must admit that it was Prasanna’s special contribution that had an impact on me,” he added.

Vijay Shankar, who has hit five hundreds and 15 half-centuries and averages 46, said he always put the team ahead of himself. “I could have got more 100s, but in many of those matches, I had to bat with the tailenders and try and steer the team home.

“Even last year, when I came straight from New Zealand, I reached at 3.30 in the morning and played the match against Punjab. Tamil Nadu was on the back foot at 50 for four, if I remember right, and I got a 75. Against New Zealand, I chipped in a 45 when the team was struggling at 18 for four.

“These knocks gave me more satisfaction than a century. They are memorable to me and that’s why I got to play a few more games for India.”

About the way he likes to go about his business, Vijay Shankar said: “I am one who always wants to make my presence felt. I can change a game even with my fielding and I have done that several times,” he said.

He revealed that there were quite a few who had advised him to change his style. “I will not, because it has given me so much happiness. People may come up with lots of ideas, but my muscle memory is tuned to this. But, if my coach (S. Balaji) feels I need to do something, I may think about it,” he said.

Tough times never last but the tough ones do, as Vijay Shankar keeps proving time and again.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/h3anzo/article30487690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06VIJAY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-vijay-shankar-as-tough-as-they-come/article30487691.ece
271,2020/01/05,Aus vs NZ | Lyon takes five as Australia take big lead in Sydney,"Nathan Lyon took 5-68 as a dominant Australia dismissed New Zealand for 251 before the home batsmen took over to extend their lead to 243 by the close of play on the third day of the third and final Test on Sunday.

Already 2-0 down in the series after thumping defeats in Perth and Melbourne, New Zealand have been ravaged by illness and injury and now face a huge battle to avoid a third heavy loss before they head home.

The Sydney Cricket Ground was turned pink for the 12th straight year in aid of cricketing great Glenn McGrath's breast cancer foundation but there was nothing charitable about Australia's approach to the match.

Openers David Warner (23) and Joe Burns (16) steered the hosts to 40 without loss at stumps to add to the first-innings tally of 454 built on the back of Marnus Labuschagne's maiden double-century.

It was the Australian bowling attack, though, that once again set the tone as they took all 10 New Zealand wickets for the fifth time in the series.

Off spinner Lyon carried the ball off the pitch to a huge applause an hour after tea after he had Matt Henry stumped to end New Zealand's innings and secure the 17th five-wicket haul of his career, his first against New Zealand.

“It's always special being part of the Sydney Test match and playing in front of your family and friends, and to perform in the first innnings was pretty special,” Lyon said.

“There's still plenty of work to do in the second dig ... but if you were rocking up today and saying we'd end up with a lead of 240 and 10 wickets in hand, we'll take that every day,” he added.

Henry batted despite breaking the thumb on his non-bowling hand on day one of the match, the latest in a catalogue of misfortune that robbed the tourists of captain Kane Williamson and a string of other top players.

Glenn Phillips, flown over from New Zealand on the eve of the Test to cover for the sick Williamson and Nicholls, offered the most resistance with a 52 on his Test debut.

The 23-year-old enjoyed some luck when he was dropped twice by the normally reliable Lyon and again just before tea when he was caught in the deep off a James Pattinson no ball.

He brought up his maiden half-century with a brilliant pull shot through square but two balls later was clean bowled by paceman Pat Cummins, who took 3-44 to show once again why he is the world's top-ranked Test bowler.

“It was a really enjoyable time out there,” Phillips said. “It's a shame I wasn't able to go on and extend the innings a bit, but that's cricket.”

Lyon tops a few lists of his own these days and it was the unassuming off-spinner who broke New Zealand's early resistance after they had resumed on 63 without loss.

He bowled opener Tom Blundell for 34 and trapped Jeet Raval leg before wicket for 31 in the first session and returned after tea to send back tailenders Will Sommerville and Neil Wagner, both for ducks, in a magnificent two-wicket maiden.

Conditions were much cooler than on Saturday's second day but there was a distinct smell of smoke in the air from the bushfires that have been raging around Sydney for the last couple of months.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ctiz6a/article30484445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LYONK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aus-vs-nz-lyon-takes-five-as-australia-take-big-lead-in-sydney/article30484446.ece
272,2020/01/05,Sri Lanka’s sacked cricket coach Hathurusingha demands $5 million compensation,"Sacked coach Chandika Hathurusingha has demanded $5 million in compensation from Sri Lanka Cricket over the premature termination of his contract, an official said on Sunday.

The former Sri Lankan Test batsman and coach made the claim after the two sides failed to agree to the terms of his termination last summer.

“He has sent a letter of demand asking for $5 million,” board secretary Mohan de Silva told AFP.

Details were not immediately available, but the Sunday Island newspaper said Hathurusingha had sought his full salary for the remaining 18 months of his contract which amounted to just over a million dollars.

He has also claimed that his reputation as an international coach suffered as a result of what he called the wrongful termination.

His claim of $5 million includes damages as well as the wages he says are due to him.

The board had been willing to pay only six months’ salary as compensation, the Island said, adding that the coach was in receipt of a take-home salary of $60,000 a month at the time of termination.

Following Sri Lanka’s disappointing World Cup, where they finished in sixth place, Hathurusingha and his assistants were shown the door.

The then sports minister Harin Fernando insisted that Hathurusingha was overpaid and accused him of failing to produce results.

Fernando said Sri Lanka could have hired a foreign coach at half the price paid to Hathurusingha.

Sri Lanka has since carried out a major revamp of the national team by appointing South African Mickey Arthur as head coach in December.

Former Zimbabwe Test player Grant Flower has been appointed the new national batting coach, Australian David Saker was made bowling coach while Shane McDermott was placed in charge of fielding training.

The board has not discussed the terms of their two-year contracts.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/e0rjcr/article28697765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBANGLADESHTRI-NATIONCRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sri-lankas-sacked-cricket-coach-hathurusingha-demands-5-million-compensation/article30484431.ece

274,2020/01/05,PCB rejects Bangladesh’s proposal of playing just one Test in Pakistan and other in Dhaka,"Bangladesh has agreed to play one Test in Pakistan, provided the second match of the ICC World Test Championship is held in Dhaka, a proposal which was rejected by the PCB.

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said that the board has rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) proposal, making it clear that the two Tests were part of Pakistan’s home series and must be played there.

“It is strange that the BCB wants Pakistan to play a Test in Bangladesh in return,” the official told PTI.

Bangladesh is due to tour Pakistan from January 18 to play two Tests and three T20 Internationals but the tour is still uncertain after BCB officials said that they will just play the T20 series there and not the Tests.

Bangladesh first wants to play three T20s in Pakistan and then decide after assessing the security situation whether to play the Test series or not.

The PCB, however, has ruled out hosting the Test matches at a neutral venue.

“Privately the proposal to have one Test in Pakistan and one in Bangladesh has been floated but has been rejected,” the PCB official said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8kf3u2/article30115673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BCBlogo,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pcb-rejects-bangladeshs-proposal-of-playing-just-one-test-in-pakistan-and-other-in-dhaka/article30483917.ece
275,2020/01/05,"Kohli: Can see a cultural shift in the last two, three years in Indian cricket","India captain Virat Kohli on Saturday spoke like a statesman when he revealed what message he sent across to his team ahead of the year’s first assignment, the T20 series opener against Sri Lanka at the ACA Stadium, Barsapara, here on Sunday.

In his first address to his team mates in the New Year, prior to its practice session, Kohli spoke about five minutes as the whole Indian side stood in a circle.

When asked about the short talk, Kohli, at the pre-match press conference, smiled and said, “I see a cultural shift in the last two, three years in Indian cricket. And it's about playing for the team and not thinking as individuals. From a very young age, we were always focused on what we did as individuals. Even when we came back from a match, we were invariably asked, ‘What did you do?’ rather than ‘Did the team win?’

“I think that's a mindset change. I see that happening at a very big level where they have started to appreciate small performances of guys who might have taken a catch or a great run out and it turned the whole match. So, the chat was to embrace that culture, take it forward, and, you know, just strengthen this mindset through the whole cricketing setup, circuit through the country to all age groups.

“We get involved in the rat race to an extent where we can go into our individual cocoons a lot of times and that can hamper the team at an important stage. Because we played so well as a team, it's important to understand that team is what matters the most. Another team will come in future. Individuals can't stay forever...As sportsman, we can tend to take a lot of pressure in our own performances. Once you focus on the team, the pressure goes away and you do things that you can't imagine otherwise. So, the chat was basically to keep this culture going and eventually change the whole mindset of guys coming in as well.”

Kohli, who liked the competition within the side, hoped to carry forward the good work of 2019 and do well in ICC events, including the upcoming T20 World Cup.

“We want to continue the same things. We have put the team on the right track in terms of being the team that everyone wants to be across formats. That is a very exciting position to be in…It's very important to understand there's a lot of young influence that's coming into the team now. And they need to be able to take the same culture and the same mindset forward.

“Next few series are going to be very exciting to see who stands up in pressure situations, how they react under pressure…We need guys who are ready till six and seven to win you matches. It can’t be dependent on two or three guys in the batting lineup. That's not how you win ICC tournaments,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tepwsw/article30478543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-can-see-a-cultural-shift-in-the-last-two-three-years-in-indian-cricket/article30481823.ece
276,2020/01/05,Masked goons strike terror in JNU,"Scores of students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, and several teachers were beaten up on the JNU campus on Sunday evening.

Masked men and women, armed with sticks and stones, went around the campus, entering hostels, beating up students and teachers and smashing cars.

A video of a bleeding Ms. Ghosh was posted on Twitter while the JNUSU claimed in a statement that a large number of ABVP activists had entered the campuswith iron rods and told to “single out” students’ representatives.

Sources at the AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital said that over 35 students and teachers were treated for injuries sustained during the violence.

“You can judge how scary a situation it was from the videos and photos that are being shared. I was in my hostel room when people with their faces coveredentered and started breaking things with sticks and metal rods. I did not recognize any of them but they were on a mission to spread fear,” a BA student of the university, said.

Ayesha Kidwai, a professor teaching at JNU, told The Hindu that one of her colleagues, Sucharita Sen, had been beaten up and suffered head injuries. “Sheis being treated at the trauma centre,” Dr. Kidwai said.

Joint Commissioner of Police Anand Mohan said two groups of students had clashed on the campus, and the police were called in by the administration. “We conducted a flag march. The situation is under control. The injured have been moved to AIIMS,” Mr. Mohan said.

In a statement, the JNU administration said the police had been called to “maintain order.”

Several teachers said ABVP activists had entered the campus and indulged in violence. “Female students have lockedthemselves up inside the girls’ wing in Sabarmati Hostel. These attackers are roaming the corridors armed with rods and sticks…we are under attack,” the JNUSU said calling for help and sharing videos of the violence on campus.

“Professors who were trying to protect us have been beaten up. These are unknown ABVP goons, not all are students, they have covered their faces, and aremoving towards the…West Gate. Stay alert. Make human chains. Protect each other,” another tweet from the Union added. There were also allegations that policemen were inside the campus and did nothing as the ABVP activists beat up students.

The BJP blamed the Opposition parties for the violence, saying it was they who had politicised the campuses.

Efforts, they said, were “being made to tackle the miscreants”.

Swaraj India President Yogendra Yadav was also roughed up outside the JNU campus by a mob just as he was addressing the media. “You can see what is happeningto me outside, just imagine what must be going on inside the campus,” he was heard saying. The Hindu reporters were able to verify that the crowd, which roughed up Mr. Yadav included BJP workers.

On its part, the ABVP blamed Left groups for the violence in JNU. “Leftist goons of JNU accompained [sic] with their cadre from other universities have crossed every limit. They have proceeded with unimaginable violence on ABVP activists of JNU,” the ABVP’s JNU unit said in tweet.

Separately, the Human Resource Development Ministry tweeted saying that it had come to Ministry's notice that a group of masked people entered the JNU campus today,threw stones, damaged property and attacked students. “This is very unfortunate and highly condemnable, such acts of violence and anarchy will not be tolerated,” the MHRD said.

Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal tweeted, “The violence in JNU against students and teachers is highly condemnable. Directed

Separate protests by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), Indian Youth Congress (IYC), and Delhi BJP Sikh Cell were held throughout the day.

The protest by the DSGMC started at 1 p.m. while the demonstration by the IYC began at 3.30 p.m. at the same place. The BJP protest started later. The protesters raised slogans against Pakistan. One placard read: “Double standard of Imran Khan, Sikhs are being tortured in Pakistan”.

Sikh community members also submitted a memorandum at the Pakistan High Commission asking the Pakistan government to explain the failure of law-enforcement agencies, the DSGMC said. The protest was led by DSGMC chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa. Shiv Charan Singh Lamba, DSGMC member, said the gurdwara was the birth place of Guru Nanak Dev and that the vandalism was highly condemnable.

Mohan Singh, a driver and resident of Kalyanpuri who was at the protest, said: “70% of our places of worship are in Pakistan. PM Imran Khan is vocal about everything and has spoken out against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India as he believes that Muslims are being cornered... Why hasn’t he spoken about what has happened at Nankana Sahib?”.

The protesters said they expect the Indian government to pressure Pakistan into probing the incident.

BJP national secretary R.P. Singh said: “People opposing the amended citizenship law should learn a lesson from this incident... this law is for the minorities who are tortured in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and to protect their religion.”

284,2020/01/05,‘We will not move an inch till citizenship law is rolled back’,"Demonstration at Shaheen Bagh against the amended citizenship law entered the 22nd day on Saturday with scores of people speaking out against the Act, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Mehrun Isha (50), who has been on a hunger strike for the past five days, said: “We demand the revocation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, NRC and NPR. Most of us who are protesting are very poor, we have lost our sources of livelihoods in the aftermath of demonetisation and now the government has come up with a new way of troubling us.”

Yogesh Swami, who has been organising plays against the CAA and NRC in several parts of the city, said: “Cultural resistance is also a form of peaceful protest. So we sing songs and read out poems that embody these values. The government will not succeed in portraying this solely as an issue about Muslims.”

Commenting on Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that “the government would not go back an inch to revoke the legislation”, Shabina, who came to Delhi from Rajasthan to show solidarity with the movement, said: “If the government will not move then even we will not move an inch. This is a crowd of angry mothers that has received support from students, locals and others. We will continue to stand against police brutality, CAA and NRC.”

Amid loud chants of “Inquilab Zindabad” women protesters continued to occupy the stage as more people joined. Refuting rumours pertaining that the protest may be called off, Shahin Kausar (44), a home-maker, said: “People have come here from across the country and will continue to do so till the amended citizenship law is rolled back. Those who spread these rumours are upset that a non-violent protest has continued for so long.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/h1z3w0/article30481583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5DESHAHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/we-will-not-move-an-inch-till-citizenship-law-is-rolled-back/article30481584.ece
285,2020/01/05,Shah to lay foundation stone for Delhi Cycle Walk on Jan. 6,"The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Saturday said Home Minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation stone for the Delhi Cycle Walk, which is proposed to be a ₹550-crore project, at Tughlakabad on January 6.

The project, likely to be completed in four years, will make mobility economical for Delhiites, fight pollution and also transform the city into “the most walkable and cycle-friendly city,” the DDA said.

Under the project, cycling tracks called “On Grade Tracks” will connect business districts, offices, schools, colleges and metro stations, said officials.

“The Delhi Cycle Walk will be a controlled track with defined and secure entrance points near residential areas and exit points near places of work, schools and so on. These points of entry will be called origin-destination plazas and will have facilities like washrooms, cycle parking and repairs points among other facilities,” a senior official said. While the entire network is projected to span over a 200km area, the first phase, including three corridors will cover an area of 36km, the urban body said.

A ride through forests

The project will have universal accessibility, rainwater harvesting chambers, parking spaces and CCTV cameras every 100 metres with a centralised monitoring system. An official said: “The forests which have been cut by roads will now be joined by building acre sunken lawns on both sides of the roads and then create a connection like an under a bridge. Cycle Walk tracks shall move seamlessly from one forest to another.”

“The Cycle Walk has been conceived with the objective to take a few million car rides out of Delhi roads and allow people to walk and cycle safely,” the land-owning agency said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gfyihe/article30481749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-04-at-84013-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shah-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-delhi-cycle-walk-on-jan-6/article30481550.ece
286,2020/01/05,"What if Pak. sends spies as Hindus to India, asks CM at town hall meet","While addressing the fifth town hall meeting, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked the people what guarantee is there that Pakistan would not send spies as Hindus to India under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The meeting, a part of the party’s election campaign, was anchored by ABP News. “What guarantee is there that Pakistan would not send spies as Hindus over here? This can also happen. These are valid questions,” he said.

Full statehood

Mr. Kejriwal said full statehood for Delhi will be part of AAP’s election manifesto. It was the main poll plank of AAP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Delhi.

Speaking about the multiple fire incidents that claimed the lives of many people, he said the government was trying to find solutions. “We have ordered inquiries into all these fire incidents. If we find a trend on the reasons behind these fires and we can solve them by taking a particular action, then we will implement it.” He added that the government has started about 300 Mohalla Clinics in Delhi and 150 such clinics will be opened on Sunday. Talking about beautification, he said: “We are redesigning 40 roads and they will be done by November. We will make Delhi’s roads like that of London, Tokyo, and France. If they are good, then we will redesign all roads like this.”

Speaking about the CAA, he launched an attack on Home Minister Amit Shah, saying: “Aap chronology samjne ki koshish kijiye [please try and understand the chronology]. Each one you will be told to prove citizenship. They will not allow Aadhaar or PAN card. They will only allow government birth certificates. If you can’t produce them, then if you are Muslim, then you will be asked to leave the country. If you are a Hindu, then you will be asked ‘are you from Pakistan’, if you say yes, then you will be given citizenship. If you are Hindu and not from Pakistan, then you will be asked to leave the country.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/what-if-pak-sends-spies-as-hindus-to-india-asks-cm-at-town-hall-meet/article30481542.ece
287,2020/01/05,"Kejriwal addresses Mega PTM, interacts with parents, students","Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed a “Mega Parent-Teacher Meeting” on Saturday during which he interacted with the parents and guardians of those studying in the government schools at the Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Rouse Avenue.

The government said the meeting was aimed at discussing the students’ progress as well as the level of education being provided in the schools.

‘Not just in papers’

“The PTM procedures in the government schools were only on the papers. We now hold regular PTMs. Parents and teachers are satisfied because they get to discuss the progress of the students. This way, parents take a keen interest in the studies of their ward,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He interacted with the parents about whether “reformations” in the schools had improved their wards’ performances. He also spoke to the students about the changes in their school infrastructure and teaching patterns. Launched in 2016, the Mega PTMs open up a communication platform for teachers and the parents of children, said the government. It also provides an opportunity to the parents to open up about issues at home which could possibly be coming in the way of their child’s studies, the statement added.

“Earlier, people had an inferiority complex regarding their children studying in government schools because of lack of financial resources. The teachers and principals have played a significant role in the transformation of government schools in the last five years,” Mr. Kejriwal added.

Meanwhile, Education Minister Manish Sisodiaalso met with parents, teachers and students at Govt. Co-ed Senior Secondary school in Sector 2, Dwarka.

“I am proud to mention that our teachers and principals are learning about best teaching practices adopted by world-class institutions like Cambridge University and IIMs. Don’t be a dishonest doctor, engineer, officer or lawyer, etc. Strive to stick to the ethics,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7bg7gx/article30481527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-addresses-mega-ptm-interacts-with-parents-students/article30481528.ece
288,2020/01/05,"Poster war takes over Delhiroads, barbs reach crescendo","The poster war between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP— aimed at questioning everything from each other’s claim to form the next government in the Capital to the capability of their respective leaderships — went up a notch here on Saturday.

A few days ago, the AAP had installed hoardings, bearing New Year greetings for seven BJP Chief Ministerial candidates. Now, BJP West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma sought to offer New Year’s greetings to the AAP on hoardings, naming 11 of its founding members as potential Delhi Chief Ministers who were “chucked out” from the party.

Sunil Yadav, president of the Delhi BJP’s youth wing — Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BYJM) — installed hoardings, attacking Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, at 25 prominent flyovers in the city. This is a “symbolic protest” seeking to “expose” Kejriwal’s “lies” on several issues, Mr. Yadav said.

Hoarding grabs eyeballs

One of the dozen hoardings across the city, bearing both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Kejriwal’s faces, garnered muchinterest.

The hoarding, supposedly installed by an individual — Deepak Madan — who is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the Bajrang Dal and the BJP, sought to argue that while the “country wants Modi”, the people of the Capital “want Kejriwal.”

A picture of the hoarding was first put out by Abhishek Gupta from AAP’s national social media team on Twitter on Friday evening following which it was shared by the party’s spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj.

AAP takes to Twitter

Mr. Gupta’s postwas captioned as: “When those from the RSS and the BJP’s own workers start saying ‘Dilli Mein to Kejriwal’ you can gauge which way the wind is blowing [sic].”

“Yes, I have put up the hoarding. Thirteen of them have been installed at several locations in Delhi till now and one more will be put up by tomorrow. If one speaks from the heart, there is no denying that Kejriwal has done a lot of good work for the city. However, that may not be the official line of the party one is associated with,” Mr. Madan told The Hindu. He also said: “I have been with the RSS since I childhood and then got associated with the Bajrang Dal of which I am a member. I am now the Paschim Vihar Mandal president of the BJP. But let me clarify, the hoardings say what I feel in a personal capacity.”

Whodunnit

Meanwhile, the BJP claimed Mr. Madan had “nothing to do with it and was certainly not an office-bearer” of its State unit. This, even as an AAP insider said similar hoardings, claiming that outfits associated with the BJP were in support of Mr. Kejriwal, had emerged prior to the Delhi Assembly Elections in 2015.

A BJP source said: “This is clearly an attempt by AAP to try and confuse voters with elections around the corner, to portray that the BJP has no confidence in its leadership. It is a ploy which is both sad and desperate.”

In response to this, an AAP insider said: “The onus of proving whether the person who installed the hoardings belongs to the RSS or the BJP is on them; it is not our prerogative.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/poster-war-takes-over-delhiroads-barbs-reach-crescendo/article30481518.ece

290,2020/01/05,Man held for misbehaving with woman,"A 32-year-old unemployed engineering graduate, who made sexual advances towards a pregnant techie in Ayyappa Society, was arrested by Madhapur police here on Saturday.

According to the police, the offence took place in the late hours of Thursday when the 27-year-old victim, who was on night shift, went to a nearby food joint to have dinner with her husband during a break. She is five months pregnant and her husband also works at a software firm in the area.

“While going back to the office, the accused Chandrakanth intercepted and held her hand. In self-defence, she hit him and informed police over Dial 100,” said Madhapur sub-inspector K Harika, adding that a team reached the spot within eight minutes and nabbed the accused.

Based on her complaint, a case under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) was registered against Chandrakanth, a resident of Ayyappa Society and remanded him to judicial custody.

Ms. Harika said that the accused worked at a software firm in the United States and returned to Hyderabad a few years ago.

Held for harassment

In another case, Madhapur police booked a case against the supervisor of 24/7 Travels company for harassing his former colleague.

Police said that recently a 24-year-old techie approached them alleging that Akhil, a resident of Ghatkesar was harassing her to marry him. Earlier, she lodged a complaint at Trimulgherry police station, following which a case was registered and Akhil was arrested. “She is now working with a software company in Madhapur and again he started harassing her”.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/man-held-for-misbehaving-with-woman/article30488220.ece
291,2020/01/05,Restoration of a Qutb Shahi tomb leads to new discovery,"There is a palpable sense of excitement as the restoration of the Qutb Shahi tombs complex gains pace. “We have discovered that the Abdullah Qutb Shah’s tomb had a ribbed structure that was plastered over during restoration in the 19th and 20th century,” says Ratish Nanda, CEO of Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which is carrying out the conservation work along with the Telangana government.

“All the tombs have some uniqueness. When we began chiselling the outer layer of Abdullah’s tomb, we found originally it was a ribbed dome, not tiled like Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah or flat like Hayat Bakshi Begum’s tomb,” informs Mr. Nanda. “We had hints about it, but once we began peeling away the outer layers, we could confirm it had ribs. We will restore the ribs and the whole effort may take a year,” he says.

The crew working on the Abdullah Qutb Shah’s tomb drive chisels into the dome. At places, the four layers added in the 19th and 20th century, are six inches thick. The rubble is sent down a makeshift chute from a height. The 49-metre mausoleum of the seventh Golconda king is one of the biggest in the funerary complex. At the pinnacle of the dome is a 25-foot high copper finial. “The finial looks small but it is very tall. Its pieces also required a bit of mending and welding,” says Prashant Banerjee of AKTC. The conservators turned to the expertise of coppersmith Muhammad Saleem who plies his trade near the Chowk Masjid to restore the finial to ensure there is no seepage of water.

Ingress of water and seepage has been one of the main challenges encountered during the conservation effort of the structures which were built in the 17th century using limestone mortar and stone. “We removed vegetation from the tombs. On Abdullah’s tomb, the roots of a plant went down to 15 feet,” says Mr. Nanda. As it is a double dome with the flatter inner ceiling, the delicate stucco and paintwork has remained nearly intact.

The height of the work site means it is a harness and hard-hat zone. The wind that comes down the Golconda fort is like a roar and not for the faint-hearted. “We are used to working like this. We just have to follow the instructions,” says Mehbub, a worker, who deftly moves from one scaffolding to another as if it was flat ground.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/k07voa/article30488157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy05-tomb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/restoration-of-a-qutb-shahi-tomb-leads-to-new-discovery/article30488148.ece
292,2020/01/05,Southern discom directed to restore electricity connection,"After the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) rejected a woman’s application for a new electricity connection, a consumer forum noted that the disconnection cannot be done on representation of a third party. The forum directed that the connection be restored.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Hyderabad – III was dealing with a complaint filed by Meharunnisa (44), a resident of SRT Colony in Yakutpura. She stated that on September 11, 2017, she applied for a new connection after paying charges of ₹1,425. While a meter was installed, on October 30 the same year, officials removed it, allegedly without informing her of the grounds. She later approached the local police station with a complaint.

In a letter dated November 4, she requested TSSPDCL to reconsider providing her a new connection, and also sent a legal notice. She also claimed that one Ismail Khan, her relative, by means of a letter informed the TSSPDCL that there is a legal dispute over the property.

For its part, TSSPDCL stated that the connection was given after verification by the Madannapet Section Office. Later through a letter, the discom was apprised of the legal tangle after which the new connection was disconnected and the meter taken away. It also stated that the property enjoys an electricity connection since 1982 and that the complainant has not been inconvenienced.

After hearing both parties, the forum noted that disconnecting a new connection on account of a pending court case is ‘unfair and not justified’. It also stated that providing a power connection in one’s name will not give rights to the person over title of a property. The forum directed the TSSPDCL to restore the connection and that it cannot take action merely on a third party making a representation to it.

It also directed the respondents to pay ₹4,000 compensation and ₹1,000 as costs.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/southern-discom-directed-to-restore-electricity-connection/article30488126.ece
293,2020/01/05,Waving the tricolour to declare their patriotism,"The pro and anti CAA-NRC campaign has become that biggest and rare peace-time event when many people feel the urge or necessity to declare their patriotism to the world at large, waving of national flags in rallies and during protests being a forceful way of doing it. This phenomenon has resulted in an increase in demand for the national tricolour everywhere in the country including the most backward places like old undivided Adilabad district.

“We sold 230 flags of 2 x 3 ft size to the pro CAA-NRC BJP rallyists on a single day, January 4, alone. This is quite uncommon as we sell only 60 or 70 of those, that too at the time of Republic Day or Independence Day,” disclosed Bharochiya Manoj Patel of the Manoj Patel general stores in Devichand chowk in town, as he tried to assess the quantum of increase in demand for the tricolours in his outlet alone.

“We can supply any number of flags on an order given at least one day in advance. We get our supplies from wholesellers of Osmangunj in Hyderabad who have the capacity to despatch them in required numbers,” Mr. Patel pointed out as he shed light on the gamut of handling such demand and the preparedness of wholesalers in the State’s capital to supply the order.

There are two other shops in the town which sell the national flags which are also assumed to have done business in equal measure. “There were at least 1,000 flags being held aloft by our people during the rally,” claimed Sona Sudhakar, a participant in the BJP rally two days back who purchased a flag for himself for ₹ 100.

The sale of the tricolour actually started on December 26 last year when an anti CAA-NRC rally was taken out in town by a Joint Action Committee. A few thousand protesters had participated in it and many of them were waving national flags.

That event also brought to light some of the dynamics involved which usually get hidden from public view. For example, the display of a giant 700-foot-long and 8-foot wide ‘flag’ in that protest march.

The flag was got made over two years back by the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, Jagdish Agarwal, who, being a former district general secretary of BJP, is a sworn right winger. This fact, nevertheless, has not come in the way of protesters belonging to the left wing and other anti-BJP stream outfits when it came to borrowing the flag from him.

“It was carried by the anti CAA-NRC protesters in Adilabad on December 26 and in Khanapur mandal headquarter on January 3,” the former BJP leader revealed. “I do not mind giving it to those opposed to the CAA-NRC-NPR because they are displaying their patriotism,” he observed.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/khrkyg/article30486399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06TRICOLOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/waving-the-tricolour-to-declare-their-patriotism/article30486400.ece

The agitators raised slogans against the Pakistan government and condemned the ‘silence’ of Prime Minister Imran Khan over inaction on his part against the attackers.

Sikhs took out processions from gurudwaras at Gowliguda, Ameerpet and Secunderabad and Sikh Chawni at Attapur, and returned to the gurudwaras after the march. They also staged protests in Nizamabad, Karimnagar and elsewhere in the State.

During the protest near Keyes High School at Secunderabad, president of Gurudwara Sahib Guru Singh Sabha S. Gurucharan Singh Bagga condemned the attack.

President of Gurudwara Sahib Ameerpet S. Bhagender Singh said during the rally at Ameerpet that this was not an isolated incident. “This has not happened for the first time. They abduct our children and convert them.”

“A mob attacked Nankana Sahib Gurudwara due to which our Sikh brothers and sisters are in terror.
