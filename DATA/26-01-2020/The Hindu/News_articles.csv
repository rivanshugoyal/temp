0,2020/01/26,Deriving authority from ‘we the people’,"India’s streets are agog today with clamour, calling for a return to constitutional imaginary. The Preamble to the Constitution, little invoked till the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case, and given a new lease of life by this epochal judgment, is being read to large protest audiences across the country, and even beyond. It has turned out to be more than merely a salutary invocation at the start of a protest — artists are busy weaving it in song and dance, and calligraphy and paintings are flourishing around the few mantras it is composed of. The emphasis is on the Preamble’s character as the Constitution’s very soul. While there seems to be no doubt across the protest spaces that the Constitution is the ‘authoritative horizon’ of India’s public life, the Preamble is held aloft as our lens to it.

But it is important here to also draw attention to the fact that small parties such as Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, and even Adivasi autonomy assertions, often around the slogans of ‘jal, jameen, jangal’ (water, land, forests), have been mobilising for years their respective social constituencies in defence of the Constitution. Besides, a crop of young, bright constitutional scholars are pushing the boundaries of the document’s interpretation to encompass and reach out to the complexities of Indian polity little explored before.

Reclaiming the idea of India

However, the current euphoria surrounding the Constitution in general and the Preamble in particular is understandable, considering the situation we are in. As a specific idea of the nation brags triumphalism, the republican turn to the constitutional imagery, expressed in vibrant citizen activism and initiative, seems to be reorienting the idea of nation in a different direction.

There is a close relation between India’s distinctive struggle for national independence against colonial rule that brought the large masses to the fore in a non-violent movement and the way India went about constituting itself as a sovereign, democratic republic. At the same time, they were two very distinct moments and now, more than ever, it is important to recognise this distinction. In the Constituent Assembly debates, we find that several voices wished to reduce the latter to the former while many others prevaricated. Today, this tendency probably threatens to become our common sense.

It is important to recall that Jawaharlal Nehru, while moving the ‘Aims and Objects’ resolution in the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946, proposed that the task before the Assembly was to cast India as an “independent, sovereign, republic”, and spelt it out in a few memorable phrases, terming them as “the fundamentals” which were “commonly held” by Indians. He also suggested that the resolution be regarded as “higher than the law” and nothing should be “added to or subtracted from” it. But this resolution, as the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, underwent a metamorphosis in the Drafting Committee and one can read B.R. Ambedkar’s stamp etched on it. When Ambedkar moved the draft Constitution in the Assembly on November 4, 1948, it turned out to be “we the people” who had resolved to constitute India into a “sovereign, democratic, republic”, and the Constituent Assembly became only its representative. There was also the additional clause on “fraternity” that upheld “dignity of the individual” and “integrity of the nation”. Many of the immediate concerns of welding the nation together that crowded Nehru’s draft resolution were either shed or packed off to other parts of the Constitution. This shift did not go unnoticed and several speakers charged Ambedkar of hijacking the resolution and repacking it with fundamentals of his choice. Nehru did not intervene in defence of his characterisation of India. Ambedkar’s response was short, rounding off the debate: “This preamble embodies that this Constitution has its root, its authority, its sovereignty from the people” (October 17, 1949).

The making of a republic

The usage of the idea of ‘republic’ in the nationalist discourse of India was relatively feeble and even Nehru, when he used the term in his speech, seemed uncomfortable with it, contrasting it merely with monarchical regimes. One of his defences for not bringing in ‘democracy’ upfront to characterise India’s constitutional regime was that the word ‘republic’ already contained it. A few speakers in the House later pointed out that a republic need not necessarily be a democracy. The Drafting Committee, however — and Ambedkar played a major role in it — brought in the idea of ‘republic’ alongside ‘democracy’ as attributes of India’s sovereign polity, giving it a twist markedly different from what the term had connoted in Nehru’s usage as an anti-monarchical regime. As a disciple of the Jotirao Phule school of thought, Ambedkar was the inheritor of an idea of republicanism with stress on the citizen, citizen agency and public spiritedness arising therefrom, and citizens bonding themselves into a community of equals, and enabling it in turn. Phule had argued, and Ambedkar was in agreement with it, that the spirit of republicanism vanished from India with the rise of monarchy and its entwinement with Brahminism, and resurrected itself in the West. He thought the masses could rediscover their initiative as citizens only through the overthrow of servility that the caste order, revamped by colonialism, subjected them to.

Constitutionalism and swaraj

Ambedkar remained deeply suspicious that an ‘independent’ India would be able to move much further as a political community of free and equal citizens reproducing itself overtime. However, at the same time, if India was to move in that direction, constitutional democracy was a sine qua non. His final speech in the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949 argued that if constitutional democracy did not make way for social and economic democracy, there was little hope of political democracy surviving in India. He saw in republicanism a hope that it would rally critical energy/social capital to subserve the latter. But the spirit of republicanism could only be enabled through what he called constitutional morality, i.e. a citizen acting by taking on board constitutional principles and norms.

There was no doubt that by substituting the idea of ‘independent, sovereign, republic’, with ‘sovereign, democratic, republic’, Ambedkar was trying to redirect India into a very different trajectory. However, as the decades passed, the vision behind such an idea of India became ever more elusive. The invocation of the Preamble, in the citizen-activism of the present, is undoubtedly a call to action. But the onus it bears seems far heavier.

1,2020/01/26,"A Republic is born: The Hindu Editorial on January 26, 1950","The inauguration of the Republic of India is an act of high faith in the people of this country, a gesture of dedication of all the nation’s talent and resources to the realisation of worthy purposes. It amounts to an implicit pledge on the part of every Indian that he will to the extent of his strength and capacity uphold the honour of his country, augment her strength for good and persuasively convey to a distracted world her immemorial message of abhaya. A democratic Republic, which is what our Constitution aims to build, is one in which the worth of the individual is not submerged in the collective will but sustains it. In such a polity no man may walk on crutches or regard public business as no concern of his. Every citizen must remember that if matters go wrong with the State it is he that is ultimately responsible. He must, therefore, not only acquire by study enough familiarity with the working of the machinery of Government through which democracy functions. He must understand the basic problems which have to be tackled if the good life is to be realised here and now. He must have the strength of character which alone is a nation’s true capital. And above all he must have the will to put his shoulder to the wheel and push and pull, never getting out of step with his fellows, never seeking short cuts, never succumbing to the temptation to find scapegoats.

The special Supplement which we are issuing to-day is intended to give our readers an idea of the onerousness as well as the grandeur of the great adventure on which the people of India are setting out. Nearly a hundred and seventy contributors, drawn not only from every part of India and from every walk of life, but also from other countries, notably Britain and America, have with ready courtesy responded to our invitation to write. (Unfortunately some of the contributions were received too late to be included in the Supplement; but we are printing most of them in to-day’s issue). Each is an acknowledged expert in his field and offers not only a synoptic survey of such achievements as we may legitimately claim but also an indication of the leeway that must be made up and of the methods which are likely to lead us swiftly to the goal. The poverty as well as the potentialities of our economy, the urgent need for tapping our inexhaustible human wealth, the power of education for unfreezing the spirit after its age-long sleep, the lessons as well as the warnings that we must draw from the successes and failures of other self-reliant peoples — all these matters, as set out in these hundred odd pages, will, it is hoped, provide the reader with a coherent picture of the social and cultural pattern which is in the making on the loom of time.

The predominant note, as any discerning reader will observe, is one of cautious optimism for the future. The first fine careless rapture of August 1947 has sobered down with the exercise of responsibility in conditions, to have survived which is itself triumph. We have had too many things to do. And we have tried to do too many things at a time. Trained capacity has not matched with ambition. Power went to the head of too many who had done little to generate it but who swarmed to it as flies to sugar. The sharing of responsibility is a spiritual process for which men must devoutly prepare themselves. The greatest lack that Swaraj has revealed is that behind the brilliant band of patriots who under the Mahatma’s lead won freedom there has been built up practically no second line of defence, no phalanx of younger statesmen to whom the torch could be handed without a flicker and in whose hands it might be trusted to burn as bright as ever. For Republican India it is as necessary, as it was for India struggling to be free, to keep the crusading spirit alive. Only, the crusade must be turned against the enemy within. The Constitution has provided us with the shell of democracy. It is up to us to invoke life into it. The Puranic legends of Creation speak of the Virat lying prone on the face of the waters, unresponsive to any of the lesser powers that entered, until at last the Supreme Spirit entered and forthwith the Virat moved. We may regard that as a parable of our present political situation. The Republic of Weimar drew up an admirable Constitution which became waste paper because the Republic had no fire in its belly. It is that fire, that energy of life, that must be roused in the dormant consciousness of the people if India is to build up a fair, equitable and viable polity and a full life for her millions.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mdyz9u/article30655342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Hindu-Editorial-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-republic-is-born-the-hindu-editorial-on-january-26-1950/article30653896.ece
2,2020/01/26,SyndicateBank staff booked for cheating Karnataka farm board,"The general manager and staff of SyndicateBank have been booked for cheating and forgery after they were allegedly found misappropriating ₹48 crore belonging to the Karnataka State Agricultural Marketing Board.

Based on a complaint filed by Kari Gowda, MD of the board, the Commercial Street police filed an FIR against the accused last week. In his complaint, Mr. Gowda stated that the board had asked quotation from various banks to keep ₹100 crore in fixed deposits, looking for the bank offering the highest interest. SyndicateBank’s Uttarahalli branch was picked, following which the board transferred the money in November 2019 with a request to split it into two FDs of ₹50 crore each.

The cheating came to light when the board sought details of the FD in January. The assistant manager, Jayaram, informed that his bank had only ₹52 crore as FD from the board. He also issued certificates on the same and said the remaining amount had been transferred to various accounts.

When the board showed the certificate issued by the bank on the remaining amount, Mr. Jayaram confirmed that the certificate issued for ₹48 crore was fake.

Further enquiries by the board revealed that the Uttarahalli branch manager and staff had misused the funds and misappropriated it. Subsequently, Mr. Gowda approached the police to initiate criminal action. The police have sought detailed records from the board to further investigation.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/syndicatebank-staff-booked-for-cheating-karnataka-farm-board/article30660306.ece

4,2020/01/26,Delay in NICE land acquisition won’t affect our deadline: BMRCL,"Though delay in acquisition of NICE land for Phase II of Namma Metro has hit construction work, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is confident of commissioning the extended metro lines on Kanakapura Road and Mysuru Road within the stipulated deadline.

At Kanakapura Road, the BMRCL needs 856 square metres of NICE land to build a viaduct to the upcoming Anjanapura depot. On Mysuru Road, it requires 403 square metres of land to build an elevated line towards Challaghatta depot and metro station.

Delay in acquiring land has now forced the BMRCL to use the depot at Peenya (on Green Line) to commission the extended line on Kanakapura Road, and the depot at Baiyappanahlli (on Purple Line) to open the extended line on Mysuru Road.

Ajay Seth, MD, BMRCL, told The Hindu, “Delay in acquisition of land will have an impact on construction work, but not commissioning of the line per se. On Mysuru Road, we will be in a position to operate the metro till Kengeri. On Kanakapura Road, the entire line will be made operational.”

Eagerly awaited

Opening of these lines will help people in a big way. The Green Line will cover 6.290 km more in addition to the existing 24.20 km (from Nagasandra to Yelachenalli), and 6.465 km of metro network will be added to the Purple Line. The existing operational length of the Purple Line from Mysuru Road station to Baiyappanahalli is 18.10 km.

At present, the daily ridership of Namma Metro is over 4 lakh. The BMRCL is confident of getting more patronage for its services as it will be in a position to operate six coaches on the extended lines as well.

After enduring traffic snarls and dust for years because of metro work, the general public has demanded that BMRCL deliver on its promise of opening the lines on time.

Udaya Kumar, a metro passenger, said, “Travel time for passengers will come down drastically once the metro starts operations on the extended lines. During peak time, it take a long time to cover even short distances on Mysuru Road. People travelling towards Majestic and Whitefield will benefit once these lines become operational.”

Cloud over R.V. Road to Bommasandra line

The BMRCL needs around 4,000 square metres of NICE land to build an elevated metro corridor to Hebbagodi depot on the R.V. Road to Bommasandra section. Officials said that delay in acquisition of NICE land will have a far-reaching impact as the line cannot be made operational.

“The R.V. Road to Bommasandra is a new line under Phase II, and building a depot at Hebbagodi is crucial to servicing trains without which, we cannot operate the line,” said an official.

The BMRCL has set November 2021 as the deadline to operate this line, which is likely to benefit lakhs of people working in Electronics City. The line goes via Jayadeva junction and Silk Board.

On Tumakuru Road, the BMRCL needs around 6,000 square metres of land to build a metro station at Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) and a viaduct.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9fipn7/article30659733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGNICEROIAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/delay-in-nice-land-acquisition-wont-affect-our-deadline-bmrcl/article30659735.ece
5,2020/01/26,Republic Day celebrations: Governor lauds ‘swift’ response to floods in north Karnataka,"A special demonstration of counter-terrorism tactics by ‘Garuda’, a striking motorcycle stunt display by the Tornadoes of Army Service Corps (ASC), and cultural programmes by over 2,000 schoolchildren were some of the key highlights of the 71st Republic Day celebrations at the Field Marshall Manekshaw Parade Ground on Sunday.

Contingents of the Indian Air Force, Indian Army, Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, National Cadet Corps, among others, took part in the march past, with the Goa State Police participating as the guest contingent.

Students from the Shree Ramana Maharishi Academy for the Blind, differently-abled students from Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled, and a group of BBMP pourakarmikas, who were also a part of the parade, drew special attention and cheer from the audience.

Appu Raj, Assistant Executive Engineer, BBMP, who was in charge of the pourakarmika contingent, said that such initiatives will not only help in creating awareness about cleanliness but also in enhancing dignity of labour.

“The 31 pourakarmikas from seven wards who participated will be an inspiration to others. Today, they marched along with the likes of the Army, BSF, CRPF. It was a huge morale booster for them,” he said.

He requested citizens to cooperate with pourakarmikas in keeping the city clean.

Achievements of the State

Governor Vajubhai Vala, who unfurled the tricolour, outlined the achievements of the State. He lauded the State government’s ‘swift and well-coordinated’ response and ‘timely relief efforts’ during the floods in north Karnataka in August 2019.

“Timely relief of ₹10,000 each has been paid to 2.7 lakh affected families. Financial assistance ₹5 lakh for severe house damage and ₹50,000 for partially damaged houses has been sanctioned to facilitate re-construction and repair,” he said.

The Governor expressed happiness over the fact that Karnataka stood first among major States in increasing its forest cover, according to the 2019 edition of India State of Forest Report. He said that a new scheme, ‘Watershed Development to Prevent Drought’, was being implemented in 100 drought-hit and low groundwater-level taluks.

Mr. Vala said that the e-office initiative was implemented in all the major departments and district offices from January 1, 2020, and that the State government had launched the publication of an e-gazette.

He said that Karnataka stood second in the country as an investment destination attracting over ₹59,000 crore investment in 2019. “To attract investment in north Karnataka, the Invest Karnataka Conference will be organised in Hubballi in February this year,” he said.

Safety of women

Speaking about safety of women, he said, “Our men and boys must be educated in such a way that they learn to treat women and girls with respect. I hope Karnataka, which stood third in the recently released Good Governance Index rankings, will set a stellar example for the rest of the country.”

He said that during the current financial year, about 16 lakh pre-matriculation students and about 9 lakh post-matriculation students will be given scholarships through ‘Integrated State Scholarship Portal’.

Motorcycle stunts

The motorcycle stunts display team of Army Service Corps (ASC) performed various stunts, including fire jump, tubelight jump, path of fire, brick wall jump and scissors crossing winning a standing ovation from the audience.

‘Bus intervention’, a special demonstration of counter-terrorism tactics by ‘Garuda’, a special squad of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism (CCT), was the highlight of the event. ‘Bus intervention’ was the demonstration of their capability in handling a situation where terrorists take control of a public bus. The commandos demonstrated various counter-terrorism techniques, including countering enemies and handling hostage situations.

Trained Belgia Malinois Shepherds took part in the demonstration winning huge applause.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, DGP Neelamani Raju, City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar were present.

Problem of dust

While the Governor was hoisting the flag, an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter flew low over the main podium showering flower petals. This resulted in a massive dust cloud. Dignitaries on the podium, including the Governor and the CM, were affected. People were seen covering their faces.

BBMP Commissioner B.H.

8,2020/01/26,Tunnelling work for metroto start in February,"Tunnelling work for Phase II of Namma Metro is expected to start in February. The vertical shaft at Shivajinagar is being made ready to accommodate two tunnel boring machines (TBMs).

The two machines will start their journey from Shivajinagar and move towards Vellara Junction.

B.L. Yashwanth Chavan, Chief PRO of BMRCL, said, “The machines have already been dispatched from China and are likely to reach Chennai by the first week of February. Then they will be transported to Bengaluru.”

They will then be assembled at Shivajinagar. “The contractor, who bagged the tender, is procuring the machines as per the specifications of the project. Each machine may cost up to ₹75 crore,” he added.

The two TBMs will build a tunnel network of 2.76 km between Vellara Junction and Shivajinagar. The contractor will be deploying an additional two machines to tunnel a stretch of 2.884 km from Shivajinagar metro station to Tannery Road metro station.

These machines are expected to arrive from China later.

The official said, “Going by our experience of Phase I and geo-technical studies of the alignment, a TBM can tunnel up to 5 metres a day. However, this will depend on the geological conditions.”

During Phase I, the TBMs faced hard rocks due to which the project was delayed by many years.

The BMRCL had taken more than four years to complete the entire underground tunnel network of 8.8 km.

According to officials, when it encounters hard rock, the machine can drill up to only three metres per day instead of a stretch of up to 11 metres of soil.

The BMRCL has estimated that it would take 30 months to complete the tunnel work between Vellara Junction and Pottery Town.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9hhfyh/article30656806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGNAMMAMETROTUNNEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tunnelling-work-for-metroto-start-in-february/article30656807.ece

However, the prime accused, Habibullah Shariff, who runs the trading service, which has offices in Jayanagar 9th Block, is absconding. “He fled to Dubai and we have got an LOC issued against him,” said Isha Pant, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East).

The other accused, Manjunath Balraj, 31, and Masiulla Shariff, 32, are partners at the firm. They have allegedly been scamming investors since 2017 by promising them 10% returns on investment.

Based on a complaint filed by one of the investors, Zubair N., the Tilak Nagar police registered an FIR. According to the complainant, he and his relatives had deposited ₹20 lakh with the firm in December 2017. “However, the accused neither paid the promised interest nor returned the principal amount.

11,2020/01/26,Tamil Nadu CM hands over Anna Medal for Gallantry,"Five friends, whose daring act saved a woman from being abducted in December last year in Tiruvallur district, were among those who were awarded the Anna Medal for Gallantry, 2020, on the Republic Day in Chennai. As one of the five friends died after being hit by an autorickshaw in which the accused escaped, his father received the medal.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami handed over the medals at the Republic Day celebrations at the Marina beach front in Chennai on Sunday morning. The award carries a cheque of ₹1 lakh, a medal worth ₹5,000 and a certificate.

On December 25 last year, five friends – T. Akesh, I. Fristan Franklin, S. Vinith, D. Charliepan and D. Easter Premkumar heard the cries of a woman from a speeding autorickshaw near Mappedu junction in Tiruvallur district.

After they chased the autorickshaw on their two-wheelers to save the woman, the autorickshaw hit Akesh. Meanwhile, the woman jumped off the vehicle, sustaining injuries. While Akesh succumbed to injuries, Mr. Franklin is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.

While Akesh’s father Thiagarajan received the medal, Franklin's mother Ashokakumari received it for her son.

Tamil Nadu government conferred the Anna Medal for Gallantry (General Public) on the five friends, “in recognition of the timely help in saving the woman without caring for their life and their courageous act in catching the culprit.”

The other winners of the Anna Medal for Gallantry (General Public) are: Dhanalakshmi of Kattupakkam, J. Vinodhini of Konimedu, Indiragandhi and Palaniappan. The Anna Medal for Gallantry (Government Servant) went to R. Raja of the Fire and Rescue Services Department in Nagapattinam.

Ms. Indiragandhi and Mr. Palaniappan – a couple from Muthambalpuram in Thanjavur district — while returning to their home in the small hours of August 20 last year, found a thief inside their home. When the thief pushed Mr. Palaniappan and attempted to flee, Ms. Indiragandhi punched the culprit on his face. He was eventually caught by the couple.

Ms. Dhanalakshmi of Kattupakkam in Tiruvallur district was on her way home on July 27, 2019 when a person attempted to snatch her gold chain. Despite being attacked by a knife, she caught hold of his shirt and he was eventually nabbed by the public.

In a similar incident, Ms. Vinodhini of Konimedu in Tiruvallur district too nabbed the shirt of one of the culprits, who attempted to snatch her chain and mobile phone on August 2 last year. The culprits were eventually nabbed.

13,2020/01/26,"NGT slams Kamarajar Port, North Chennai Thermal Power Station for polluting Ennore Creek","The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slammed the Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL) and the North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS) for failing to clear the pollution caused by them in the Ennore Creek.

The Bench in particular came down heavily on the NCTPS, observing if State-owned industries themselves don’t comply with norms, it will send a wrong message to other industries.

The Bench also imposed an interim penalty of ₹8.34 crore on KPL as environmental compensation and ordered the port to deposit the amount with the Central Pollution Control Board within two months.

Based on a report submitted by a joint committee, the bench observed that “the violation still continues. Till the entire dump has been removed and damage caused to the environment is restored to its original position, M/s. Kamarajar Port Ltd., is liable to pay compensation”.

The Bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta also directed the committee to look at measures to remediate the Creek and the cost required for it.

The Central Pollution Control Board which submitted its findings before the Tribunal found through satellite images, and site visits in late 2019 that the dredged material dumped in the nine dumping sites falling under CRZ notified area have not yet been fully removed.

“The mangroves in the area may be lost due to dumping in the nine sites. Currently, the mangroves in the area are very thin. The port authority has not adopted any scientific methods to remediate the soil or to restore the soil / mangroves to regional conditions. Though efforts were made to remove the dump falling with CRZ area, it is observed that it is not fully removed and dredged material is still lying in the CRZ area,” the report said.

The report also found high concentration levels of elements such as magnesium, aluminium, iron, potassium, chromium, lead and calcium in the soil in all the dumpsites used by KPL. The committee found that the high concentrations were found at a depth of 100 cm below the ground “indicating that the metals have leached from the dredged material dump sites”.

While the Committee pointed to improper handling of raw material, coal, iron ore, and other products by KPL and fly ash handling by NCTPS as primary reasons, it also held that the Ennore Creek is a recipient of domestic waste water from small scale industries, garages from Chennai city and marine outfall from industries are located in the Manali Industrial Estate near the port.

“Due to these reasons the soil near to the shore may be contaminated with chemical elements and heavy metals.""

With regard to the NCTPS, the Bench criticised the Committee for not making any attempt to consider the remediation measure to be undertaken and for relying only on the timeline provided by NCTPS to remove the fly ash.

Buckingham Canal

It was submitted before the Tribunal that the PWD had already commenced dredging of the Buckingham Canal and deposited the dredged ash and silt on the banks of the Canal. A timeline extending till 2022 was submitted to clear the Creek and the Canal of fly ash.

“As per the Fly Ash Disposal Notification 2017, the time line provided for 100% disposal is already over and no further extension has been given by the MoEF in this regard. So non-disposal of fly ash within the stipulated time will amount to serious violation,” the Bench said and slammed the CPCB for not even mentioning whether the direction issued by the Principal Bench over compensation has been complied with or not by the NCTPS.

The Bench held that the CPCB will have to fix the timeline for remediation than relying on the timeline provided by the NCTPS.

“If the State owned industries itself are not complying with the directions and if they are violating the norms under the hope that they will not be proceeded against and only directions will be issued to rectify the deficiencies then it will give a wrong message to other industries as well who may be tempted to violate the norms,” the Bench said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y5demy/article30602948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngt-slams-kamarajar-port-north-chennai-thermal-power-station-for-polluting-ennore-creek/article30657087.ece
14,2020/01/26,Judges outplay lawyers at Chepauk,"It is always lawyers versus lawyers in the court halls where judges end up playing the role of umpires. For a change, on Saturday, judges of the Madras High Court jumped into the field at the famous M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk, challenged the lawyers to a game of cricket and lifted the trophy in style.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi’s team made him proud by breaking the winning streak of the lawyers’ team. The CJ’s XI succeeded in snatching the trophy from Advocate General Vijay Narayan’s XI for the first time in the last three years since the match became an annual event between the Bar and the Bench.

Led by on-field captain Justice M.M. Sundresh, who won the best bowler award for his performance, the CJ’s XI defeated AG’s XI, led by on-field captain V. Ramesh, by six wickets.

After lawyers scored 103 runs for seven wickets in 20 overs, the judges managed to score 104 in 19.3 overs after losing just four wickets.

While Justice M. Govindaraj was adjudged the man of match as well as the best batsman among the judges, Justice N. Sathish Kumar bagged the best fielder award.

Among the lawyers, senior counsel P.S. Raman, Venkatesh and Sreeraman got awards for best batsman, bowler and fielder, respectively.

Ace cricketer L.S. Sivaramakrishnan handed over the awards and the trophy. The match began after observing a minute’s silence to mark the deaths of former judges P.R. Gokulakrishnan, S. Mohan, N.V. Balasubramanian and A. Raman. Thereafter, Chief Justice Sahi tossed a coin with the A-G calling out for heads. Though Mr. Narayan won the toss, he left it to the judges to take a call and they chose to bowl first.

The strategy worked and the judges succeeded in shifting the trophy from the AG’s chamber on the second floor of the 126-year-old heritage building of the Madras High Court to the CJ’s chamber on the first floor.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6b4vvd/article30655267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/judges-outplay-lawyers-at-chepauk/article30655268.ece
15,2020/01/26,SNJ Distilleries’ bid for Empee gets NCLT nod,"SNJ Distilleries Private Limited is set to take over Empee Distilleries Ltd after its ₹475-crore resolution plan was approved by a Division Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai.

The Bench admitted insolvency proceedings against Empee Distilleries on November 1, 2018 in a case filed by Union Bank of India.

In the first round of expression of interest, two companies — SNJ Distilleries and Mondovi Distilleries and Breweries Private Limited — were the bidders. The committee of lenders asked to increase the plan value. However, it did not come through. As a result, a second expression of interest was called where the lenders found the resolution plan values of SNJ Distilleries and Kals Distilleries Limited higher than others. Later, the committee of lenders unanimously selected SNJ Distilleries.

As per the plan, SNJ will pay ₹302 crore to settle the dues of financial creditors in four phases and also pay VAT dues of ₹126.77 crore. The financial creditors claimed about ₹335 crore, while the amount admitted was ₹302.73 crore. The admitted claims of financial creditors were ₹148.45 crore from Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company (unsecured financial creditor), ₹78.05 crore from Andhra Bank, ₹54.46 crore from IDBI Trusteeship Services and ₹11.34 crore from the Union Bank of India, according to the information provided to stock exchanges. Further, it will pay workmen of Empee their dues. Its request for delisting of Empee has been approved.

The committee of lenders had rejected a settlement plan offered by Shaji Purushothaman, director of Empee Distilleries. NCLT also rejected the plea by Mr. Purushothaman against the lenders.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/snj-distilleries-bid-for-empee-gets-nclt-nod/article30655259.ece
16,2020/01/26,"Finally, process to build a bridge across Pulicat begins","After a long wait, the tender for the construction of a bridge across the Pulicat lake to connect a small island with five hamlets, including Pasiyavaram, with the mainland has been floated. The 1,032-m bridge will have 20 spans, be two lanes wide and cost ₹18.2 crore to construct.

“The tenders will be opened in February and, hopefully, we expect the contractor to commence work in March. Residents of Sathankuppam, Edamanikuppam, Vairavankuppam, Edamani Colony and Pasiyavaram have been waiting for this bridge for a long time and since the island is located in the middle of a reserved forest, the processesinvolved were innumerable. But we managed to obtain all required permissions,” said an official in the Highways Department.

The facility will take off some 800 m ahead of Pulicat town on the Thachur Kootu Road-Pulicat Road and land at Pasiyavaram.

Residents have been taking boats or walking for over a kilometre across the lake due to lack of connectivity. Pulicat panchayat president Malathi Saravanan said that every year children lose attendance during the monsoon. “There have been instances of boats capsizing. Since the residents are primarily fishers, they have to come to the Pulicat market to sell their catch. And it is a difficult for women to wade through the waters carrying their baskets,” she said.

Durai Mahendran, who welcomed the construction of the bridge, said that it would come in very handy in case of emergencies. “There have been occasions when residents have had to carry women for deliveries and reach Pulicat town and then take a vehicle to Ponneri, which is 18 km away or to Chennai GH, which is 55 km away. Several people have died due to the delay in treatment. We hope the government also appoints a doctor at the Pulicat hospital, round the clock. We don’t even have a private clinic that provides treatment,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y1yr5k/article30655232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/finally-process-to-build-a-bridge-across-pulicat-begins/article30655233.ece
17,2020/01/26,Devoting Saturday mornings for clean-up,"Residents of Avadi have added one more activity to their Saturday morning routines. Elders and students alike are seen plogging at various places during the morning hours.

To create awareness about a clean neighbourhood, the Avadi Corporation started a plogging drive a few weeks ago, in its 48 wards.

Avadi Corporation officials said participants are given tools and gloves to collect trash from road corners and vacant spaces during the two-and-a-half-hour-long programme in the morning. The aim is to spread awareness about discarding waste in bins and avoiding littering in public spaces.

“We want to involve people in the cleanliness drive and avoid littering as a habit in the long run. Such activities will help maintain garbage-free neighbourhoods,” said an official.

On Saturday, college students joined residents in the plogging event, and collected trash at 24 locations, including Ashok Niranjan Nagar, Paruthipattu and Kannigapuram. Residents of Saraswathy Nagar, Thirumullaivoyal, said several elderly persons who go for morning walks also joined the event.

Residents learn about the event through residents’ welfare associations and sanitary inspectors.

On an average, the Avadi Corporation generates 90 tonnes of garbage every day. It has achieved 85-90% source segregation so far, said officials.

Avadi Corporation Commissioner N. Ravichandran said one official is deputed for two wards. A minimum of three tonnes of garbage is collected through the initiative every week. Small plastic materials contribute to a majority of the trash collected.

Garbage collected is taken to 17 micro-compost centres, and 50% recyclable waste is sold and revenue shared among the workers. “The remaining non-saleable plastic will be transported to cement industries. This exercise has also helped in the elimination of dengue-breeding sources. We spend ₹40 lakh a month on dengue-prevention activities,” he said.

In Chennai, over 3,000 people took out a procession from Parry’s Corner, highlighting demands that included the withdrawal of the controversial citizenship law by the Union government. They also urged the State government not to press ahead with work on the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens.

Even children and the elderly took part in the procession, which passed through the Second Line Beach Road to reach the Collectorate. The protesters raised slogans against the Narendra Modi government for enacting the CAA which, according to them, discriminated against Muslims.

Memo presented

Office-bearers of the TNTJ presented a memorandum to the District Collector, urging the government to accede to their demands. M. Shamsullah Rahmani, president of the TNTJ, said, “People spontaneously participated in the protests, which were held across the State.

I. Ansari, State secretary, TNTJ, said, “Muslims were killed in Uttar Pradesh and the houses of Muslims in Bengaluru were demolished following a series of protests. Considering the plight of Muslims, we demand that the State government passes a resolution against the CAA in the Assembly and undertake not to implement the CAA, the NPR and the NRC.”

20,2020/01/26,‘More students must take up nephrology’,"More medical students should join the stream of nephrology, as there are only 1,200 nephrologists for several lakhs of patients, said Vasundhara Raghavan, founder of Kidney Warriors Foundation.

Delivering ‘The Mrs. Malathi Venkatesan TANKER (Tamilnad Kidney Research) Foundation Memorial Lecture’ on Saturday, she said the country should be made the leader in nephrology, to bring in zero infections in dialysis, by at least 2030.

Noting that there were very few kidney transplants in a year, she highlighted the need to save patients and change organ transplant laws that were strict and restrictive. “We are writing to the government for GST waiver on medicines, for economical dialysis, for improving the quality of dialysis and getting reverse osmosis plants subsidised across all dialysis centres,” she said.

M.M. Murugappan, chairman of Murugappa Group, suggested that the TANKER Foundation work with the corporate sector. “We are not quite aware that kidney diseases can be treated and need to be caught early. The corporates can assist you in the form of consortium research. This could be a consortium of corporates, experts, foundations and institutions of learning, such as medical colleges. We can get together and make affordable care even more affordable,” he said.

Screening guidelines

Georgi Abraham, founder-trustee of the TANKER Foundation, said they were putting out guidelines to screen people for kidney diseases. “This should be targeted screening. Diabetics, persons with high blood pressure, persons with a family history of kidney diseases and those taking alternative medicines should be screened for kidney function,” he said.

Latha A. Kumaraswami, managing trustee of the foundation, said it does 5,000 dialysis procedures per month, of which 4,700 are free.

At the 27th Annual Charity and Awards Nite of the foundation, a ramp walk by dialysis patients was organised. The foundation also presented awards on the occasion.

22,2020/01/26,Vidyodaya School alumni institute awards,"It was an afternoon of catching up with former classmates and reminiscing for the alumni of Vidyodaya Schools, who got together on campus on Saturday.

To mark the golden jubilee of their passing out, students from the 1970 batch of the Vidyodaya School, endowed two awards, worth ₹2 lakh.

In honour of the school’s founder, Mrs. E.S. Appasamy, the Swarnam Appasamy Memorial Award for Service and Sacrifice was announced. It will carry a cash prize of ₹5,000.

The Vimala Appasamy Memorial Award for Service and Sacrifice, in the name of Vimala Appasamy, who was the headmistress when the batch of 1970 was in school, was also announced, with a cash prize of ₹5,000.

The awards will recognise students of Class XII from Vidyodaya Schools, who reflect the spirit of volunteerism, one of the school’s undying principles; display consistent academic merit; and show respect to teachers.

The endowment cheques were handed over to Nandita Krishnan, the correspondent of the school.

Dedicated alumni

“The institution has evolved over several decades, but our spirit remains the same. The alumni of the school have always been interested in the growth and improvement of the school, and work closely with us,” said Ms. Krishnan.

The 1970 batch planted a mango sapling on campus. A memory book created by Amita Shenoi, a student of the 1970 batch, was also released on the occasion. “The book has 31 students sharing their memorable experiences in school, nostalgia and their journeys through life. We hope that it will help us get to know our classmates better and bring us closer as alumni,” she said.

Bhavani Raghunandan, an alumnus of the school from the same batch, said that Mrs. Vimala Appasamy had guided them immensely through their time in school. “The school had a ten-minute morning talk during school assembly, where students and teachers would speak about a wide range of subjects, beyond the curriculum.

23,2020/01/26,College principal held in ‘law degree scam’,"The Central Crime Branch (CCB) has claimed that it has unearthed a major scam, where degrees were bought and sold with forged attendance records.

“The principal of a private law college in Kadapa was arrested on Wednesday. He created records stating that the students had necessary attendance, even though they didn’t attend regular classes. He also issued bona fide certificates to several, with the intention to cheat the Bar Council, investigation has revealed,” said sources.

Following a complaint from the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP), the Esplanade police, two months ago, arrested B. Vipin, a railway guard who obtained a bona fide certificate from a private law college principal, showing that he had 80% attendance, although he did not attend classes at all.

The application of Vipin, 59, of Villivakkam, to enrol in the Bar was rejected by the council, since he had studied law between 2015-2018 in Andhra Pradesh, while serving in the Southern Railway as a guard. The case was transferred to the CCB later.

On investigation, the CCB arrested Himavantha Kumar, 54, principal of Smt. Basava Rama Tarakam Memorial Law College, Kadapa. The arrest is seen as the tip of the iceberg.

“We have credible evidence that over 20 persons were given certificates by the principal, showing that they had over 70% attendance, even without attending regular classes. Many from Tamil Nadu joined law courses in private colleges in Andhra Pradesh. They obtained degrees without attending regular classes, simply by making a payment ₹40,000-60,000. We are collecting details about persons who obtained law degrees in a fraudulent manner from other States,” police sources said.

Over 1,000 advocates who obtained their degrees from Andhra Pradesh and other States, have, in a similar manner, enrolled with the Bar Council.

P.S. Amalraj, chairman of the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Bar Council, said preliminary reports suggested that advocates serving with the State and Central governments, or private firms, had obtained degrees in a fradulent manner. “We are deterimined to take action against those who have enrolled with the Bar Council with fake records. However, we have given them a chance — such persons have been advised to come forward, on their own, to withdraw their enrolment and surrender their identity cards.”

He said criminal action would be initiated against those who continued with their enrolment, with degrees and certificates obtained in a fraudulent manner. The Bar Council has also written to authorities in other States to warn them of the scam, to prevent such a fraud from recurring.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/college-principal-held-in-law-degree-scam/article30655084.ece
24,2020/01/26,At the heart of the Republic,"January 26, 1950. The date is 70 years old. And seems to belong not just to a distant age but to another planet.

A statesman stepped down from the office of Head of State that day and another, no less distinguished, stepped into his place. Hours before his departure from the nation’s first residence in the national capital for his bare-bones home in Madras, India’s last Governor General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari spoke with restrained emotion of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel in his parting speech: “The Prime Minister and his first colleague the Deputy Prime Minister together make a possession which makes India rich in every sense of the term,” he said. And added: “The former commands universal love, the latter universal confidence. Not a tear need be shed for anyone going as long as these two stand foursquare against the hard winds to which our country may be exposed.”

Moving that day from a life career of startling austerity to that high domed mansion of great expectations, India’s first President Rajendra Prasad said with unrestrained optimism: “Our Constitution is a democratic instrument seeking to ensure to individual citizens the freedoms which are so invaluable. India has never prescribed or prosecuted opinion or faith and our philosophy has room as much for a devotee of a personal god as for an agnostic or atheist. We shall, therefore, be only implementing in practice under our Constitution what we have inherited from our traditions, namely freedom of opinion and expression. Under the new set-up which we are inaugurating today we hope to live up to the teachings of our Master....”

Seventy years on we are entitled to ask if we have someone or anyone who commands universal love and someone or anyone who commands universal confidence among us, the people of India. The frank answer is, there is none. I say this not to make anyone look smaller than his right size or to diminish anyone’s stature below his own natural height. And I also say this with the knowledge that it is quite standard and regular for persons to have non-overpowering attributes. But the fact is that we have today no one in our public life, be it in the ruling dispensation or in the ranks of the Opposition who may be said to command that purest of sentiments — love, or that truest of offerings — confidence. True, we have loyalists and followers. But loyalty and following come from sources and for reasons, unrelated to the heart of feeling.

Qualities that are missed

The ruling dispensation and its supporters would, as they should, point to our Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister as an ideal combination though, out of caution, they would refrain from calling this power structure a duumvirate. Those in the Congress and its orbit would, likewise, point to the Congress President, her son and her daughter and find strength in that threesome without calling it a triumvirate. We may not begrudge them their loyalty or their devotion. That is how politics and party politics work. But we must point to them the difference between a leader whom leadership is seeking and a leader with whom leadership is playing hide and seek.

Our Prime Minister is seen by the faithful as possessing an “immaculacy” and our Home Minister as endowed with an immediacy. The two doubtless make for a persuasive mutuality in power that can be the envy of any Number One and Number Two team anywhere. A Prime Minister should have sheen, a Home Minister should look tough. India needs those qualities in these two offices. But immaculacy, in the essential sense of that term or concept is not the prerogative of human flesh, much less of political tissue. It may be claimed only by mythology and folklore, by super-naturals, not in real life.

As for immediacy, it is an admirable trait in one who is responsible for the nation’s safety and security. But it is as a trait, the smart cousin of decisiveness and can turn into a power at the service of the nation, yes, but also at the call of power politics. Nehru was honest, he was fallible. Patel was tough, he was human. And so one commanded love, the other confidence.

If the two attributes in our first Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister that Rajagopalachari mentioned are missed today, the invaluable freedoms that Rajendra Prasad spoke of are also under challenge.

A Constitution hewn out of the aspirations of the freedom struggle under Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership, crafted by men and women of insight, commitment and reformative zeal, enriched by the experience of the world’s great democratic republics, was brought to life by the people of India on that, our first Republic Day. The famous photograph of Jawaharlal Nehru signing the freshly-bound and illuminated copy of the Constitution of India is a mural. The one of Sardar Patel signing it along with John Mathai, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Jairamdas Daulatram is a mosaic.

For some three years prior to that day, members of the Constituent Assembly, numbering about 300, had met, debated, argued, differed, expressed and overcome doubts, and heard Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, as Chairman of the Drafting Committee describe the intent and effect of each draft Article. Then, with a great sense of purpose they finally put their seal of approval on the document they had cradled. Their work brought our Republic into being, our people — us — into an ownership of our destinies and positioned leaders of outstanding agitational ability in offices of challenging administrative responsibility.

Strong spirit

The still centre of that document is the Preamble to the Constitution. And of that Preamble, to use a phrase associated with Ramana Maharshi, its heart-cave (hridaya-kuhara-madhya) is the line that says we are giving to ourselves ‘Liberty — of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship’. On this the 70th anniversary of our Republic, we cannot but ask how that pre-ambular, that is, before-you-even-start, attribute of our Republican life, fares.

And what is the answer we hear in that heart-cave?

Contrary to what readers of this column may think, I am going to say it fares well.

Well? Well? A deeply disturbed dissenter may ask: ‘With three former Chief Ministers of Jammu & Kashmir imprisoned, the media wary, the bureaucracy timid, the judiciary cautious, how can you say liberty fares well in India ?’

I will accept the earnestness of the question and yet maintain it fares well because, for one, The Hindu is publishing this article of mine, and for another that the young in India, students and youth, by their almost entirely peaceful protests over the last few weeks, have vivified youth’s hearkening to J.P.’s call in 1974 and to Anna Hazare’s in our recent memory. Did those movements not peter out? Yes and no. Those two leaders did not come to hold office but the nefarious 42nd Amendment to the Constitution was to a large extent sanitised and the fact is that a movement became a party and that party has won a huge mandate.

The democratic spirit of the people of India is strong and if it stays non-violent and refuses to be co-opted by vested interests, it will make a difference that neither the protesting young and not-so-young nor the state can quite visualise.

Meanwhile we have Rajagopalachari’s and Rajendra Prasad’s sagacious words telling us that India is traditionally, instinctively and irreversibly about love, confidence and — liberty.

25,2020/01/26,The four phases of constitutional interpretation,"The Constitution of India came into force 70 years ago, on January 26, 1950. The enactment of the Constitution was an ambitious political experiment — with universal adult franchise, federalism in a region consisting of over 550 princely States, and social revolution in a deeply unequal society. However, it was equally a unique achievement in terms of constitutional design. Republic Day, especially this year, therefore provides us an opportunity to take a step back from political contestations about the Constitution and consider how the text has been interpreted by the courts over the last seven decades.

Text as phase one

In its early years, the Supreme Court adopted a textualist approach, focusing on the plain meaning of the words used in the Constitution. A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950) was one of the early decisions in which the Court was called upon to interpret the fundamental rights under Part III. The leader of the Communist Party of India claimed that preventive detention legislation under which he was detained was inconsistent with Articles 19 (the right to freedom), 21 (the right to life) and 22 (the protection against arbitrary arrest and detention). The Supreme Court decided that each of those articles covered entirely different subject matter, and were to be read as separate codes rather than being read together.

Amongst the most controversial questions in Indian constitutional law has been whether there are any limitations on Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution, especially fundamental rights. In its early years, the Court read the Constitution literally, concluding that there were no such limitations.

Phase two, the structure

In the second phase, the Supreme Court began exploring other methods of interpretation. Appeals to the text of the Constitution were gradually overtaken by appeals to the Constitution’s overall structure and coherence. In the leading case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Court concluded that Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution did not extend to altering its “basic structure” — an open-ended catalogue of features that lies within the exclusive control of the Court. When Parliament attempted to overturn this decision by amending the Constitution yet again, the Court, relying on structuralist justifications, decisively rejected that attempt.

In this phase, the Court also categorically rejected the Gopalan approach in favour of a structuralist one in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978). Through this decision, the Court conceived of the fundamental rights as a cohesive bill of rights rather than a miscellaneous grouping of constitutional guarantees. The right to life was incrementally interpreted to include a wide range of rights such as clean air, speedy trial, and free legal aid. This paved the way for the Supreme Court to play an unprecedented role in the governance of the nation.

What was common between the first two phases of the interpretive story was that significant decisions involving the interpretation of the Constitution were entrusted to Constitution Benches (comprising five or more judges of court) and were carefully (even if incorrectly) reasoned. There was limited scope for precedential confusion, since matters which had been decided by Constitution Benches and which demanded reconsideration were referred to larger Constitution Benches.

Eclecticism as phase three

In the third phase, the Supreme Court’s interpretive philosophy turned far more result-oriented than it had ever been. The Court often surrendered its responsibility of engaging in a thorough rights reasoning of the issues before it. Two factors underpinned this institutional failure. First, the changing structure of the Court, which at its inception began with eight judges, grew to a sanctioned strength of 31; it is currently 34. It began to sit in panels of two or three judges, effectively transforming it into a “polyvocal” group of about a dozen sub-Supreme Courts. Second, the Court began deciding cases based on a certain conception of its own role — whether as sentinel of democracy or protector of the market economy. This unique decision-making process sidelined reason-giving in preference to arriving at outcomes that match the Court’s perception.

The failure to give reasons contributed not only to methodological incoherence but also to serious doctrinal incoherence and inconsistency across the law. This can be best described as panchayati eclecticism, with different Benches adopting inconsistent interpretive approaches based on their conception of the Court’s role, and arriving at conclusions that were often in tension with one another. The imagery that panchayati eclecticism is meant to invoke is that of a group of wise men and women (applying the analogy, sub-Supreme Courts), taking decisions based on notions of fairness that are detached from precedent, doctrine and established interpretive methods.

Phase four, purpose

We are currently in the midst of transitioning from the third phase of constitutional interpretation to the fourth. In the fourth phase, the Court has acknowledged as critical to its interpretive exercise the purpose for which the Constitution has been enacted. Many Constitutions attempt the task of entrenching a political compromise between the incumbents and challengers of the day. India’s Constitution, at its very inception, was different. In enacting the Constitution, the founders of our Republic expressed a sense of unease with the status quo and raised expectations of root-and-branch social revolution and transformation. The Court is now beginning to interpret the Constitution in accordance with its revolutionary and transformative potential.

With about a dozen significant Constitution Bench decisions from the Supreme Court since September 2018, there has been a renaissance in decision-making by Constitution Benches. This includes the Court’s decisions striking down Section 377 and the criminal offence of adultery, and including the office of the Chief Justice of India within the scope of the Right to Information Act.

However, facets of phase 3 continue to linger on in the courts. Cases that involve substantial questions of interpretation of the Constitution — such as the cases concerning the National Register of Citizens and the electoral bonds scheme — are still being adjudicated upon by benches of two or three judges. There remains a latent risk, therefore, that the gains made in the early days of phase four could be lost, and we could slide back to panchayati adjudication once again.

26,2020/01/26,Premier Badminton League | Hunters finally register a win,"Three Indian stars shone brightly to hand Hyderabad Hunters its first win in the Premier Badminton League here on Sunday.

Sourabh Verma, P. V. Sindhu and N. Sikki Reddy — in mixed doubles, alongside Vladimir Ivanov — won their respective matches to down Awadhe Warriors.

All eyes were on World No. 6 Sindhu, who came on to the court with her team waving an India flag to mark the Republic Day in front a sizeable crowd at the Babu Banarasi Das Badminton Academy.

Sindhu, thanks to her sharp play, wore down Tanvi Lad 15-8, 15-8 as the Hunters took an unassailable four-point lead.

In the Trump match that preceded the women’s singles, doubles specialist N. Sikki Reddy combined well with Ivanov to script a 15-12, 15-14 win over Shin Baek Cheol and Christinna Pederson.

The Hunters duo took time to gain momentum in both games. It was a nip-and-tuck affairs where the two seized the initiative at decisive moments. Cheol and Pederson led 4-0 in the second game and seemed to be riding the crest of a wave, but couldn’t sustain it.

The contest was closer between Sourabh Verma and Shubhankar Dey, who knew each other’s game well. Eventually, Sourabh prevailed with his stated strategy of “mixing it up” as the determined Shubhankar was able to retrieve nearly everything that was thrown at him. Shubhankar was potent with his smashesand for much of the time, it seemed there was nothing to choose between the two.

Sourabh was enterprising and solid at the net and repeatedly played the drop-shot from the back-court, choosing not to employ his smash. Despite Shubhankar’s efforts — he fell on the floor a few times to retrieve — Sourabh came through 14-15, 15-12, 15-10.

Later, commenting on his win, Shubhankar told Sportstar “I was just trying to mix everything up. At one point, my smashes were picked comfortably by him. So I thought, ‘let me mix it up’ and I’m happy that it worked.”

Warriors brought down the deficit in the other trump match, the men’s singles battle between Wong Wing Ki Vincent and Daren Liew. It was a consolation win as Vincent brushed aside his opponent 15-14, 15-9.

The result: Awadhe Warriors lost to Hyderabad Rockets (Shubhankar Dey lost to Sourabh Verma 15-14, 12-15, 10-15; Christinna Pederson & Shin Baek Cheol lost to Vladimir Ivanov & N. Sikki Reddy 12-15, 14-15; Tanvi Lad lost to P.V.

27,2020/01/26,Divyansh’s golden run continues,"Divyansh Singh Panwar bounced back from a below-par effort to shoot the gold in men’s air rifle with a score of 252.8, pipping qualification topper Ding Jiawei of China by 1.4 point, in the second match of the H&N Cup international shooting competition on Saturday.

Shooting with his regular pellets, Divyansh was able to get back on track after being placed third in qualification with 632.3.

Coach Deepak Dubey revealed that Divyansh had used a new set of pellets selected in Europe, and the score had dipped to 628.4 as he needed to get used to them. Once he returned to the regular pellets for the second competition, Divyansh was back to his best form. He had won two gold medals earlier in Austria.

The Asian Games silver medallist, Deepak Kumar, however, was not able to step it up and was 28th with a score of 628.5.

Apurvi skips event

In women’s air rifle, Shriyanka Sadangi shot 627.7 and was placed 33rd as the cut-off for the final was an intimidatingly high 631.3. Apurvi Chandela, who had won the earlier competition, opted to skip the second in consultation with coach Rakesh Manpat. Apurvi had also bagged two gold in Austria.

In women’s air pistol, Shweta Singh shot 578 and missed the final by one point. In men’s air pistol, Shahzar Rizvi shot 574 for the 48th spot (cut-off for final: 581).

Both Divyansh and Deepak had nominated their European performances as their scores for the selection process for the National team, and opted to skip the ongoing National selection trials in Thiruvananthapuram, in consultation with the National federation apart from the Sports Authority of India (SAI).

The results:

Men: Air rifle: 1. Divyansh Singh Panwar 252.8 (632.3); 2. Ding Jiawei (Chn) 251.4 (633.1); 3. Peter Sidi 230.1 (631.5); 28.

28,2020/01/26,Tiger back in the hunt for record US PGA win,"Tiger Woods charged into contention for a record-setting 83rd all-time US PGA title on Saturday, shooting a three-under-par 69 as he chases a ninth career victory at Torrey Pines.

Woods began the third round of the Farmers Insurance Open six strokes adrift of leader Ryan Palmer, but stood on seven-under 209 after 54 holes, five back of leader Jon Rahm with the third-ranked Spaniard having two holes yet to finish.

“I’m going to have to shoot a pretty good round tomorrow,” Woods said. “I’ll have my work cut out for me. I’ll have go out there and post a number and hopefully it will be good enough.”

McIlroy in third place

Second-ranked Rory McIlroy, needing a victory to return to World No. 1, moved into third with a stellar 67 to stand three adrift on 207, but the bid for history by Woods stole the spotlight.

The 44-year-old reigning Masters champion had matched Sam Snead for the US PGA record of 82 triumphs with an October victory in Japan.

Fog delayed the start by two hours but Woods, a 15-time Major winner, shone brightly once he began. Woods blasted from a fairway bunker to 13 feet and sank the putt to open with a birdie, conquering the same first hole where he four-putted to a double bogey on Friday.

Woods curled in a seven-foot birdie putt on the par-3 third and rolled in a 17-foot chip to rescue par at the fourth.

After blasting out of the rough, Woods holed a 13-foot birdie putt at the par-5 sixth and dropped his approach three feet from the cup on the way to making birdie at the par-5 ninth to reach 8-under, only two off the lead.

“Most of my putts I made were all uphill,” Woods said. “It’s important to leave the ball in the correct spots, and when I did I poured them in there.” Woods made bogey at the par-3 11th, coming up six-feet short on a 62-foot birdie bid and missing his par putt.

From there, Woods grinded out seven concluding pars, the most crucial on a 15-foot putt — his longest putt of the day — at the par-5 18th after he found bunkers off the tee and with his third shot.

“It was important to save the round after I made a bogey back there,” Woods said. “It was important to make that putt to salvage the round a little bit and get some momentum going for the round tomorrow.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/76ycp5/article30659571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tiger-back-in-the-hunt-for-record-us-pga-win/article30659572.ece
29,2020/01/26,Tata Steel Masters Chess | Caruana ensures title with a round to spare,"Viswanathan Anand (six points) drew with Vladislav Kovalev to share the sixth spot after the 12th and penultimate round of Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Saturday.

USA’s second seed Fabiano Caruana took an unsurpassable 1.5-point lead over Magnus Carlsen and ensured the title with a round to spare.

Caruana (9) defeated Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda to reach nine points. Carlsen (7.5) drew with Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev.

In the Challengers category, Surya Shekhar Ganguly (6.5) lost to Pavel Eljanov (7.5) and Nihal Sarin (6) drew with Vincent Keymer. Spain’s David Anton Guijarro (8) continued to lead despite losing to Max Warmerdam.

World Champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway played out a draw with Vladislav Artemiev of Russia to remain on second spot on 7.5 points, 1.5 points less than Caruana’s impressive nine points from 12 games.

The Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja, who is likely to play for another country soon , finally put an end to his losing streak of three games and drew with Nikita Vituigov of Russia.

Wesley So of United States drew with Jorden Van Foreest of Holland to remain in third spot.

In the challengers’ section, Indian aspirations ended as Surya Shekhar Ganguly suffered a defeat at the hands of erstwhile sole leader Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine.

David Anton Guijarro of Spain suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Max Warmerdam of Holland but still retained his sole lead by a half point over nearest rivals Erwin L’Ami of Holland and Eljanov.

The results:

12th round: Viswanathan Anand (6) drew with Vladislav Kovalev (Blr, 3.5); Fabiano Caruana (USA, 9) bt Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 6); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 7.5) drew with Vladislav Artemiev (Rus, 6); Jorden van Foreest (Ned, 6.5) drew with Wesley So (USA, 7); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 6.5) bt Yu Yangyi (Chn, 4); Jeffery Xiong (USA, 5.5) drew with Anish Giri (Ned, 6); Nikita Vitiugov (Rus, 4.5) drew with Alireza Fiouzja (FIDE, 6).

The loss significantly reduced India’s chances of qualifying for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo.

The Indian team will now hope to make the cut during the Asian Olympic qualification tournament to be held in Bangkok, Thailand from April 6 to 12.

The world number nine Indian team comprising G. Sathiyan (world rank 30) and veteran Sharath Kamal (WR 33) was expected to get the better of the lower-ranked Czech Republic on January 25.

32,2020/01/26,"After Padma Vibhushan, Mary Kom dreams of winning Bharat Ratna","The first woman sportsperson to be decorated with the Padma Vibhushan, celebrated boxer M.C. Mary Kom on Sunday said she hopes to win the Bharat Ratna by winning a gold at the Tokyo Olympics.

“It is a dream to win the Bharat Ratna. With this award (Padma Vibhushan) I will now be inspired to do even better with the thought that I can win the Bharat Ratna,” said Mary Kom, 2012 Olympics bronze medallist and a six-time world champion, told reporters in New Delhi.

“Sachin Tendulkar is the only sportsperson to have won it and I hope to become the second one and the first woman. I want to emulate Tendulkar and I get inspiration from him.”

The 36-year-old Mary Kom, however, said her immediate target is to first qualify for the Olympics and then she would think about the “colour of the medal“.

“My immediate target is to first qualify for Olympics and then I will think about the colour of the medal. If I qualify and win a gold in Tokyo I hope to get the Bharat Ratna. To be honoured with Bharat Ratna will be the pinnacle of achievement and recognition for not only a sportsperson but also for any Indian,” she said.

Bharat Ratna is the country’s highest civilian award.

An emotional Mary Kom, who was named for Padma Vibhushan, the country’s second highest civilian award on Saturday, thanked God for making her an Indian and being able to bring laurels to the country.

“I am proud to be an Indian and I thank God for making me an Indian. Each time I go out to fight for the country, I feel something inside me and that motivates me to bring glory to the country. The kind of love the people of this country have given me, I want to give back with my performance,” said the 2012 London Bronze medallist.

“It is an emotional and touching moment for me to have won the country’s second highest award. And that came when the country is celebrating the Republic Day. I will never forget this day. I thank sports minister for recommending me and also thank the Prime Minister for his support.”

The Manipuri boxer, who was conferred with the Padma Bhushan in 2013 and Padma Shri in 2006, is the first woman and only the fourth sportsperson to be given the Padma Vibhushan after chess wizard Viswanathan Anand, mountaineer Edmund Hillary and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar who all got the coveted award in 2008.

Tendulkar was later conferred with the Bharat Ratna in 2014.

Asked how she felt to be the greatest Indian woman sportsperson ever, Mary Kom said, “I think I have brought so many laurels for the country and the only thing remaining is a gold medal in the Olympics.

“I want to shine for the country. Tokyo is likely to be my last Olympics. I don’t know whether they (BFI) will allow me to participate in next Olympics (2024) at 40 years of age so this one is really important. I want to win a gold medal for my country in the Olympics,” she said.

She dedicated the Padma Vibhushan to the people of India and advised the likes of PV Sindhu and Rani Rampal, who have won the Padma Awards, to keep doing the good work and win higher honours by bringing glory to the country.

“I dedicate this award to the people of this country and my advice to other Padma Award winners like Sindhu or Rani Rampal is: they should inspire from these awards and dream of winning even higher honours.”

Due to the outbreak of coronavirus, the Olympic boxing qualifying tournament, which was earlier to be held in the Chinese city of Wuhan from February 3-14, has been shifted to Amman in Jordan from March 3-11.

Mary Kom said the country’s boxers will have to do some minor adjustment in training schedule.

“I don’t see any advantage or disadvantage on our part by the change in the venue and schedule by one month. Only thing is that it would have been better had India hosted it since the BFI had offered to host it,” she said.

“We had trained to reach our peak during February (according to Wuhan tournament schedule) but now we have to do some small adjustments. We have to rejig our training schedule. Now we have to slow down a bit so that we can peak in March (in Jordan).”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/e3vkkx/article30657464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARYKOM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/after-padma-vibhushan-mary-kom-dreams-of-winning-bharat-ratna/article30657465.ece
33,2020/01/26,Saving children from cyberbullying,"Do you find your child to be crankier off late or too addicted to the smartphone or desktop? Has he or she become more insular, refusing to socialise? As parents, it can be quite concerning to notice these sudden, unnatural changes in a child’s behaviour. Beware! Your child may be experiencing one of the different types of cyberbullying.

Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. Online threats and mean, aggressive or rude texts, tweets, posts, or messages all count. So does posting personal information, pictures, or videos designed to hurt or embarrass someone else. Cyberbullying also includes photos, messages, or pages that do not get taken down, even after the person has been asked to do so.

In other words, it’s anything that gets posted online and is meant to hurt, harass or upset someone else. Intimidation or mean comments that focus on things such as gender, religion, sexual orientation, race, or physical differences count as discrimination, which is against the law in many States. That means the police could get involved, and bullies may face serious penalties.

Sometimes, online bullying, like other kinds of bullying, can lead to serious long-lasting problems. The stress of being in a constant state of distress or fear can lead to problems with mood, energy level, sleep and appetite. It also can make someone feel jumpy, anxious or sad. If someone is already depressed or anxious, cyberbullying can make things much worse.

It’s not just the person being bullied who gets hurt. The punishment for cyberbullies can be serious. More and more schools and after-school programmes are creating systems to respond to cyberbullying. Schools may dismiss bullies from sports teams or suspend them from school. Some types of cyberbullying may violate school codes or even break anti-discrimination or sexual harassment laws. So a bully may face serious legal trouble. Why would someone be a cyberbully? There are probably as many reasons as there are bullies themselves. Sometimes, what seems like online harassment may be accidental. The impersonal nature of text messages, posts and other ways of communicating online means it can be hard to figure out if someone is joking or not.

Most people know when they are being bullied, though, because bullying involves repeated insults or threats. The people doing the bullying know they have crossed a line, too. It’s not a one-off joke or insult — it’s constant harassment and threats that go beyond typical fun teasing or a nasty comment made in anger. Sometimes, people are afraid or not sure if they are being bullied or not. So they don’t do anything about it. If you are being bullied, harassed or teased in a hurtful way — or know someone who is — you don’t have to suffer in silence. In fact, you absolutely should report any upsetting texts, messages, posts or e-mails.

The first thing to do is tell an adult you trust. This is often easier said than done. People who are cyberbullied may feel embarrassed or reluctant to report a bully. Some may hesitate because they are not 100% sure who is doing the bullying. But bullying can get worse, so speak up until you find someone to help. Sometimes the police can track down an anonymous online bully, so it’s often worthwhile to report it.

If you are being bullied and worry about losing your phone or computer privileges, explain your fears to your parents. Let them know how important it is to stay connected, and work with them to figure out a solution that does not leave you feeling punished as well as picked on. You may have to do some negotiating on safe phone or computer use — the most important thing is to first get the bullying under control. You also can talk to your school counsellor or a trusted teacher or family member. If the bullying feels like it’s really getting you down (if it’s affecting your sleep or concentration), therapy can help. If you are not ready for that, you can still benefit from the support of a trusted adult.

What you have heard about walking away from a real-life bully works in the virtual world too. Ignoring bullies is the best way to take away their power, but it is not always easy to do — in the real world or online. If you see something upsetting, try to step away from the computer or turn off your phone for a while. Don't respond, and never forward the message to someone else. Find something to distract yourself from what is going on. Do something you love that does not give you time to think about what is happening, like playing the guitar, going for a run, or losing yourself in a book or movie. You can also just chat with a parent or sibling or play with a pet.

Taking a break like this allows you to keep things in perspective and focus on the good things in your life. It also gives you time to figure out how you want to handle things. Resist the urge to retaliate or respond. Walking away or taking a break when you are faced with online bullying gives you some space so you won't be tempted to fire back a response or engage with the bully or bullies. Responding when we are upset can make things worse. (Standing up to a bully can be effective sometimes, but it’s more likely to provoke the person and escalate the situation.) Taking a break gives the power back to you.

Though it is not a good idea to respond to a bully, it is a good idea to save evidence of the bullying if you can. It can help you prove your case, if needed. You don’t have to keep mean e-mails, texts or other communications where you see them all the time — you can ask parents to make a copy or save them to a flash drive. Social media sites take it seriously when people post cruel or mean stuff or set up fake accounts. If users report abuse, the site administrator may block the bully from using the site in the future. If someone sends you mean texts or emails, report it to phone service or e-mail providers.

Block the bully. Most devices have settings that let you electronically block bullies from sending notes. If you don’t know how to do this, ask a friend or adult who does. Password protect your smartphone and your online sites, and change your passwords often. Be sure to share your passwords only with your parent or guardian.

It’s also wise to think twice before sharing personal information or photos/videos that you don’t want the world to see. Once you have posted a photo or message, it can be difficult or impossible to delete. So remind yourself to be cautious when posting photos or responding to someone’s upsetting message.

If you know of a friend who is acting as a cyberbully, take him or her aside and talk about it. Without putting your friend down, stand up for your own principles: Let the bully know it’s not okay. Explain to your friend that bullying can have serious consequences: for the bully, for those being bullied, and even for bystanders like you and your friends.

34,2020/01/26,A fable for tomorrow,"Nostalgia is the underlying thread of my life. I am nostalgic about the paddy fields that were plenty in my village; I am nostalgic about the indigenous flora and fauna that were everywhere around my village; I am nostalgic about the ponds and creeks in which we used to bathe and play; and I am nostalgic about the village life which has been irrecoverably shattered by the so-called development that snaps the symbiotic connection between Nature and living beings.

In my childhood, we used to hear the hooting of owls, screeching of bats and howling of foxes at night, fearful but exciting. The croaking of the water hens, chirping of the lapwings, cooing of the spotted doves and the sounds of myriad other birds were heard always in daytime. Our villages were rich in biodiversity at a time when the subject was not discussed in conferences or seminars.

Till some years ago, when there were no tarred roads in and around my village, we have had no water shortage. The endless tracts of paddy fields conserved rainwater and our wells never depleted. But now the wells in my village deplete even before the summer arrives and in the hot months, we face drought-like situations. This is the result of converting paddy fields into real estate and rubber plantations.

There was a little creek near the endless paddy fields in my village. One of its banks was a steep embankment. The other one is a footpath. Often I used to walk along this footpath watching the waters rolling down. The crystal-clear pebbles under the gurgling water; the long, twisted and entangled roots of the trees and creepers which clung to the steep embankment; the sound of the running water, everything enchanted my little soul. There were plenty of screwpine bushes alongside the creek and they were the habitats of water hens.

In summer, the little twine-like streams of water would be visible coming down from underneath the steep embankment. To this creek, we would bring our cattle to be washed. We would also jump into the water and play by splashing water into each other’s face, by catching little fish using our towels as nets, and climbing onto the wallowing buffaloes. Where the creek was the widest, there was a big rock and the creek created even a little waterfall while crossing over the rock.

Recently my nostalgic mind forced me to go and see the present state of the creek and the paddy fields. Alas what terrible sights I witnessed! The endless paddy fields stretched to the horizon are no more. The place of the rock is usurped by a tar road and the creek is confined to a ditch. There is no screwpine bush, no water hen, no little fish, and no water snake. What development it is! It is really ‘breathtaking’ and it reminds me of what Rachel Carson says in the first chapter, “A fable for Tomorrow”, of her pioneering work on environment, Silent Spring.

“There was once a town where all life seemed to live in harmony with its surroundings. …In autumn, oak and maple and birch set up a blaze of colour …foxes barked in the hills and deer silently crossed the fields… The countryside was famous for the abundance and variety of its bird life. …Then a strange blight crept over the area and everything began to change … There was a strange stillness. The birds, for example — where had they gone? It was a spring without voices. On the mornings, that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins, catbirds, doves, jays, wrens, and scores of other bird voices, there was now no sound; only silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh. …No witchcraft, no enemy action had silenced the rebirth of life in this stricken world. The people had done it themselves.”

35,2020/01/26,Family dynamics in career planning,"Career development is a lifelong process of acquiring knowledge, skills and abilities to achieve personal goals and build a future. The family plays an important role in a student’s career development. Making a career choice is a private affair, but the family plays the most important role in a student’s career development; thus, the choice emerges out of parent-child interactions.

The career decision-making process is intertwined with the other developmental tasks of youngsters — identity formation and psychological separation from the family.

However, arriving at a career decision is a difficult and anxious task for many students. A good percentage of students enter colleges and universities without having decided on a career or spoken to a career counsellor. Research indicates that every student undergoes stages of career indecision in their life. Initially, career indecision was regarded as a routine developmental delay. But it renders the student ‘helpless’ to decide on, and implement, career plans and draws parents into greater involvement with them. The student who is indecisive about a career is afraid of disappointing one or both parents by making a particular career choice. Career coaches often hear the students making comments such as, “My father is always after me for pursuing a career in sciences” or “My mother wants me to become a doctor.” These perceptions require an appropriate exploration and consideration of conventional and new-age career choices.

The young adult’s career choice or indecision can be alternatively conceptualised not as an individual achievement or personality trait but rather as the outcome of a larger set of transactions between the person and the family because parents affect their child’s choices of career by acting as mentors, role models and job information providers or by exposing them to the developmental environment. These transactions represent either a successful or unsuccessful transformation in family dynamics collectively. Certain family interactions enhance this transformation, whereas others inhibit it, thereby creating a climate that promotes and maintains indecision. During this phase, the adolescent is attempting to establish an adult identity, separate psychologically from parents, and form clear educational and vocational plans. The interrelatedness of all three tasks — identity formation, psychological separation, and career decision-making — removes career indecisiveness.

To promote independent decision-making, parents may need to alter the nature of their contributions in their child’s career decision-making. This change may involve maintaining sufficient distance from their child’s developmental work instead of offering direct assistance (brainstorming career possibilities, doing course research or job responsibilities). In other words, as the adolescent becomes more actively involved in career decision making, parents must correspondingly assume a more peripheral role. They should offer encouragement but, at the same time, indicate clearly that independent action is both accepted and expected. Through the coordinated responses of both the adolescent and the parents, a family context emerges that is supportive of career decision-making.

With regard to career decision-making, such family processes may be manifested in several ways. For instance, both parents can support vocational exploration instead of encouraging a particular career choice. They can accept the tentativeness of their child’s decision-making rather than challenging it or demanding greater decisiveness. Appropriate family processes would also demonstrate that both parents can avoid emotional entanglements with their son or daughter over career-related matters in terms of pursuing study abroad options.

36,2020/01/26,In search of the secret sauce,"A trip to Malleswaram in Bengaluru, with its tiny masala shops tucked away in every nook and corner, is bound to awaken memories of a time long gone by — when my aunts would ready a whole array of spices and condiments for the brats who descended on the ancestral house from all corners of the country every summer vacation.

Dressed gracefully in their madisaru, the traditional sari, these ladies were the heart and soul of the kitchen.

Way back in the 1970s and 1980s, when television did not have cookery shows, cooking in our homes was more than just the prerogative of our maamis, as they were affectionately called. It was their sole, absolute area of expertise. How they lorded over the kitchen!

Yes, how many memories revolve around the kitchen, where we cousins would congregate, clamouring for murukku and seedai and piping hot dosai, our demands changing with the hour.

Our maamis were adept at dishing out delectable fare out of virtually nothing (accompanied by astonishing yarns conjured up from their brilliant memories) in quick time.

Back then, life was simpler, and we children spent time playing hopscotch, or just climbed nearby trees and jumped down from them with glee.

“Break time” meant rushing to our maamis, who were ready with kola vadai or vattal, those fried delectables, made “finger-licking good” with a secret mix of spices passed down from generation to generation.

In adulthood, when I once went back to our ancestral home, and asked my maami what went into the making of that vadai or sambaar that I had swooned over, I was a bit bemused to hear the reply, “Love… that’s the secret formula… for the rest, it all comes with experience, and you know what they say, ‘Experience is a hard taskmaster; it gives the test first, and lessons later…’’’

37,2020/01/26,The thin line of healing,"Have you heard of the Matabele ants which live in sub-Saharan Africa? No? You should know about them for they can teach us something wonderful about life. These ants are ferocious warrior ants which attack termite colonies and feed on them.

In doing so, some of them get bitten by termite “soldier” ants whose job is to defend their colony from attacks. A fascinating study by Erik T. Frank has revealed something amazing about these ants. After a battle-style attack, they don’t leave their wounded companions behind. They carry them back home to care for them until they are able to look after themselves.

Once they are back in their own ant nest, they “take turns caring for their injured comrades, gently holding the hurt limb in place with their mandibles and front legs while intensely ‘licking’ the wound for up to four minutes at a time”. In a paper published by Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr. Frank and his colleagues say how “their study marks the first time non-human animals have been observed systematically nursing their wounded back to health.”

In his book Fearfully and Wonderfully Made, Paul Brand, a pioneering surgeon in reconstructive surgery for leprosy patients, recounts how he had once found a box of skeletons in a monastery. His findings reminded him of the anthropologist Margaret Mead who once asked her audience what they thought was the earliest signs of civilisation. Much to the surprise of the audience, Dr. Mead said that it was a healed leg bone! Apparently healed leg bones were not found in the remains of savage, competitive societies. The healed femur showed that someone must have cared for this injured person — hunted on his behalf, brought him food and helped him with other personal activities. Savage societies could not afford such compassion — for theirs was the survival of the fittest; every person for himself/herself.

The skeletons that Dr. Brand found showed “thin lines of healing” — evidence that someone had helped these victims — perhaps they were wounded soldiers far from home. There had been a group of monks who had lived in the area 500 years earlier who had tended to them. The “thin lines of healing” show us what kind of community lived here — caring, compassionate, interactive with one another.

Many of us live in gated communities, blocks of flats with every kind of facility. But what kind of communities do we live in?

The whole idea of living in community is that we connect with each other, and are responsible for each other’s welfare, but today we live in more isolation than ever. How can we know what is going on in each other’s lives if we don’t talk to each other? How can we show that we are a part of each other’s lives? How do we recognise the wounded who walk among us so that we can reach out and tend to them?

So 500 years from now, what evidence of the “thin line of healing” will there be to show that we lived here ?

38,2020/01/26,If I were a book… all is fair,"Stepping into the massive makeshift pavilion of the Chennai Book Fair last week, I wondered where I was. No train station, mela, temple or exhibition I visited in recent times was so packed.

A huge number of stalls with ever newer publishers was confidently vying for the attention of readers.

The people selling entry tickets were peeling off slips and handing them out without even looking up. Such a rush! For books! What was thrilling to watch was small children looking about excitedly and asking for this or that book. Calls of “See? This is what I want!”, “Get me that!”, “There is a discount here!” filled the air.

I thought of a beautiful painting by Jose Jorge Letria. A book-lion. The tail and paws of a lion (no head — who needs one when it is under the covers of a book?) with a book for its body. The inscription reads, “If I were a book, I’d like to have my own magical place in every child’s imagination.”

I thought of all those wonderful quotes about books and book collectors. How John Ruskin said to someone whom he noticed coming in every day to a bookshop to read a portion of a particular volume, “If a book is worth reading, it is worth buying”; how Rob Kaplan was once so engrossed in browsing through the shelves of a second-hand book shop in New York that it took him a few moments to recognise that the man standing in front of him was his father; how Thomas Jefferson said, “I cannot live without books”; and how Desiderius Erasmus wrote, “When I have a little money, I buy books. If any is left, I buy food and clothing.”

Book rebellion

Some time ago, my translator sent me an article about the book smugglers of Lithuania. They were the first “soldiers” of the rebellion against Tsarist Russia in the 19th century when Russian scholars suggested a “Russification” of the conquered population by banning Latin primers, transliterating the Lithuanian language into Russia’s Cyrillic alphabet and forcing it on Lithuanian children.

Though their tiny population (one million) was no match for the might of Russia, Lithuanian intelligentsia thought of a plan. They continued to print books in Latin outside Lithuania and smuggled them back into their country. “Book carriers”, or Knygnesiai, would conceal their forbidden goods in covered wagons and deliver them to safe houses. People from all walks of life participated. It was a hidden national movement. Women hid books in food baskets under cheese, bread and potatoes, and “fat” working class men stuffed books down their shirts and waddled about. For a hundred years, the language and culture of tiny Lithuania was kept alive by its book smugglers.

Words and books have tamed technology, shaped the forces of change and confronted the power of princes. A most unusual work on books is Jonathan Swift’s Battle of the Books (1694) in which the books themselves (ideas and writers, ancient vs modern) lead the attack.

If you were to line up five books from the pre-Independence era to face five from post-Independence India, which ones would they be? Would you have to visit a book fair to decide?

39,2020/01/26,The commander’s canon,"A slim, ramrod-straight man in immaculate Army uniform, along with a boy not yet in his teens and a sprightly little girl, were perhaps the first visitors at the Gandhi Samadhi on January 15, 1949. Paying floral homage to the Father of the Nation was the paramount act in the personal conduct of the first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General K.M. Cariappa (“Kipper” to his friends and peers).

There were no ceremonial trappings or guard of honour even when he simply walked into the appointed high office, after dropping his children home.

The Government of India had not been lacking in grace as evidenced in Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s letter, “...your record of achievements inspire our confidence in your ability to lead your men at such a critical period of the country’s history, and I can assure you that we, on our part, will extend to you all goodwill and cooperation in the discharge of your responsibilities...”

When in October 1947, Pakistan ignited the J&K War, Major General Cariappa was neck-deep in the Army Reorganisation Committee, but in January 1948, he was promoted to command the newly created Western Command and conduct the war, at a time when the fall of Ladakh seemed imminent.

The next day, he was at Srinagar providing inspiring leadership to senior commanders and staff with forceful resolve. “We will not allow General Tariq to capture Leh. We have got to stop this and we will stop it... we have decided to take tanks up the Zoji Pass... a kind of operation which has never been done before... we will have a good shot at it,” goes a rare voice recording preserved in the archives. The rest is history.

The full measure of General Cariappa as man and Army chief perhaps best emerges from an hour-long conversation with P.U. Oza, a journalist who published the report “Meet India’s new Commander-in-Chief” on January 15, 1949.

Asked what he thought of the Indian soldier, General Cariappa’s instant response was “Magnificent! Second to none! ...in Kashmir, southerners and northerners alike were running up and down the snow-covered heights of 16,000-17,000 ft, unfazed... At home, the soldier is simple, almost like a child. In the battlefield, he is a veritable tiger, inspiring awe and fear. As a victor, he is restrained, unassuming, kind to his foe, devoid of any feeling of undue arrogance towards his captive...”

‘Dangerous canker’

Oza’s enquiry of the desirability of soldiers having political leanings obtained the following: “The C-in-C would like the public to understand that the Army must remain aloof from, and be above, politics... he would like to give the forces every opportunity to keep themselves informed on political affairs. But they must not go beyond as any participation in politics becomes a dangerous canker...” Oza concludes with the nugget that “Cariappa would like the Indian Army to be the best in the world based on ‘highest standards of loyalty, supreme sense of duty and selflessness in the service of the country, subordinating all interests, personal and sectarian...’”

And the boy who was with the C-in-C at the Gandhi Samadhi is a chip off the old block, a battle-hardened, distinguished fighter pilot of the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars, a veteran Air Marshal, and author of a charming biography, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, which provided me all the insights narrated above.

42,2020/01/26,"Group of women launches Shaheen Bagh-like protest in Mumbai against Citizenship Amendment Act, NRC","A group of women began a flash protest in Mumbai Central late on January 26 against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Called “Mumbai Bagh”, the protest was organised by the Joint Action Committee on the lines of the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi. Holding placards and raising slogans against the two laws, the women sat down on the road outside the Arabia Hotel near Nagpada.

“We have around 75 protesters right now, and more are on the way. We will not back down in this fight,” activist Firoze Mithiborwala of the JAC said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yi19sf/article30660100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gautammengle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/group-of-women-launches-shaheen-bagh-like-protest-in-mumbai-against-citizenship-amendment-act-nrc/article30660101.ece
43,2020/01/26,Giles Shield: SVIS ends 16-year trophy drought,"The fate of the Giles Shield (under-14) inter-school cricket tournament final was all but sealed on Wednesday, the second of the three-day match, when Swami Vivekanand International School (SVIS), Borivali, secured the first innings lead. But the SVIS camp contained its emotions till the last ball was bowled at Brabourne Stadium on Thursday.

As the umpires took off the bails, the budding cricketers rushed onto the field to celebrate with their teammates. The final against Al Barkaat MMI English Medium School may have ended in a draw, but it signified something much more to the young cricketers. After all, it took SVIS — a school that has emerged as the breeding ground for elite cricketers over the last decade — 16 long years to win its second Giles Shield title. And the youngsters were excited to be a part of history, after receiving the coveted shield from legendary cricketer Dilip Vengsarkar.

“I don’t know how to describe it, but this has been an amazing journey for all of us. We did not crumble under pressure and backed each other. That was the key to success,” Pranay Kapadia, who led the side in the final, said. Even though his team clinched the title by virtue of its first innings lead over Al Barkaat, it wasn’t a smooth ride for the team. Ahead of the final, SVIS missed out on the services of its captain and offspinner Rudra Tank — who scalped 28 wickets and was adjudged the best bowler of the tournament — as he was picked for Mumbai in the U-14 West Zone League in Pune. “We missed out on a genuine all-rounder in Rudra. It was challenging for sure, but the idea was to ensure that the kids don’t fumble under pressure,” said coach Mahesh Lotlikar.

With Tank missing out, the team elevated Kapadia, who joined the school this year after his family moved to Mumbai from Atlanta. “Pranay was new to the set-up, so was Krish Kanawde [who scored 60 in the second innings] and Aayush Vaity [who scored 95 in the first innings]. I was not sure how they would perform under pressure, but whenever they got an opportunity, they excelled. The plan was to stay in the game, even if things did not go in our favour,” Mr. Lotlikar said.

Strength of character

Taking on Al Barkaat, the defending champion for two seasons in a row, wasn’t easy, but the SVIS players showed the strength of their character. “All of them are just 13 or 14, so you need to give them that confidence. As coaches, that’s what we did and the boys delivered,” Mr. Lotlikar said.

When SVIS won the title the last time in 2004, the team had Siddhesh Lad and Harmeet Singh — both first class cricketers — in its ranks. Dinesh Lad, who has been mentoring the team for two decades now, said, “In junior cricket, that’s what matters. Too much focus on strategies doesn’t really work. You just need to give confidence to the kids and make sure they keep their cool. That was the whole plan.”

Years ago, India’s limited-overs team vice-captain Rohit Sharma was a part of the SVIS team. Following in his footsteps was Shardul Thakur, who moved from Palghar to SVIS in quest of his cricketing ambitions. As the school has ended its trophy drought, the coaches hope this marks a new beginning.

Breeding ground for international players

SVIS boasts alumni like Rohit Sharma

If Dadar’s Shardashram Vidya Mandir enjoys the tag of being ‘Sachin Tendulkar’s school’, the Swami Vivekananda International School (SVIS), Borivali, is equally well-known for its alumnus: India’s cricketing superstar Rohit Sharma.

During his student days, Rohit featured in the Giles Shield and Harris Shield and was one of the most consistent performers, which eventually paved his way to the Mumbai U-17 team and later to the senior national team. But Rohit is just one feather in the cap of this school that has produced cricketers such as Shardul Thakur and Siddhesh Lad — who went on to play cricket at the national and international levels.

Over the years, Lad has played 58 first class games for Mumbai and has also led the team in a couple of Ranji Trophy fixtures. He also played a lone match for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League in 2019. Harmeet has played 28 first class matches for Mumbai and Tripura.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kie0a8/article30655362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMGILESSHIELDFINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/giles-shield-svis-ends-16-year-trophy-drought/article30655363.ece
44,2020/01/26,HC refuses to interfere with SBI order penalising two officers,"The Bombay High Court recently refused to interfere with an order issued by the State Bank of India (SBI) initiating disciplinary inquiry against two officers in 2012 for organising a silent protest during the lunch hour.

On August 28, 2012, the SBI chairman had said all branches would remain open on all days of the week. To oppose the move, The Federation, a recognised body of officers from the trade union and the management, organised a peaceful protest during the lunch hour for 15 to 20 minutes.

R.H. Chandanshive, the then president of the Mumbai circle of SBI officers, and Keshav Dajiba Thaokar, the then joint secretary of the circle, had informed the management and the police about the protest. However, a memo was issued ordering an inquiry against them.

‘Disturbed peace’

The memo stated, “The instigated officers of the bank held demonstrations within the bank’s premises/compound at Mumbai LHO [local head office] in Bandra Kurla Complex. They participated in these demonstrations and also shouted slogans. This behaviour on their behalf has disturbed the peace within the bank’s premises. There was hindrance in the bank’s working and disturbance in regular business activity.”

Following the inquiry, the inquiry officer said all allegations against the duo had been proved. The disciplinary authority then ruled that they should be demoted. Mr. Chandanshive and Mr. Thaokar then filed an appeal challenging the decision. The appellate authority considered the matter and concluded that the duo had to produce any fresh submission to negate the charges levelled against them. However, the appellate authority was of the view that justice would be delivered by modifying the penalty to “censure”.

Meanwhile, the SBI filed a defamation suit of ₹100 crore against the officers, claiming that their actions had tarnished the bank’s image. Advocate Anubha Rastogi, who appeared for the duo in the High Court, said, “Their acts were legitimate trade union activities and they are protected under the Trade Union Act. They have a right to protest.”

‘Allegations proved’

However, the court said the appellate and disciplinary authorities had found that the allegations against them were true. The court also said the authorities found that they had instigated the other officers to shout slogans with the intention of tarnishing the bank’s image.

The Bench said, “It was also concurrently held that there was no justification for holding the demonstration which disturbed peace, discouraged officers from discharging their lawful duties and such unjustified activities are bound to lower the bank’s image in the eyes of the customers and public.”

The Bench held that “we do not find any error apparent on the face of the record to interfere in the order” and disposed of the petition.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6dst5p/article30655346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMSBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-sbi-order-penalising-two-officers/article30655347.ece
45,2020/01/26,Blazing a trail for young athletes,"Tracknights, a State-level athletics competition that kicked off at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre in Kandivali on Saturday, has given age-group athletics in the suburbs a shot in the arm.

For the first time, an athletics meet is being staged under floodlights on a 400-metre synthetic track. Prize money will be offered to the first three finishers along with medals and certificates. Electronic equipment will be used to display timing and measure distances. The two-day event is scheduled to end by 10 p.m. on Sunday.

The brains behind the event are Chirag Patel and Firoz Ustad, co-founders of the Trackblazers Sports Academy. Mr. Patel, a high jumper, and Mr. Ustad, a sprinter, have been coached by noted coach V. Balagovind, whose dream is to give back to the sport.

Mr. Patel said, “We wondered how it would feel to participate in a stadium under floodlights, running or hurdling on a synthetic track. It did not happen in our time. So this is an attempt to give that experience to the juniors.” Mr. Balagovind, a familiar face in athletic circles, who is now based in Nashik, said, “Young athletes giving back to the sport needs to be encouraged.”

All round support

Mumbai Suburban District Athletics Association (MSDAA), the controlling body for the sport in the suburbs, has backed Tracknights by booking the SAI stadium at discounted rates and arranging qualified race officials to conduct the competition.

MSDAA secretary Arthur Fernandes said, “Trackblazers will be arranging the floodlights, a major portion of the cost when conducting a State-level competition.” Entries for the event have come from Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Satara, Latur, Nashik, Nagpur and Kolhapur.

Parents attracted to track and field have closed their ranks behind the duo. “Mr. Patel and Mr. Ustad train our children. When they do something positive for a wider group of kids, support from us is natural,” said a parent. Mr. Balagovind said there are cases of parents resuming their link with athletics after accompanying kids to coaching. The competition is for children between eight and 18 years. Special events like the 60-metre hurdles will assess the athletic ability of children.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qaj44m/article30655337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMTrackblazeers-Sports-Academy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/blazing-a-trail-for-young-athletes/article30655338.ece
46,2020/01/26,Flies on wet floor help police crack murder case,"Flies hovering over a wet floor helped the Turbhe MIDC police crack the murder case of Santosh Kasbe, a 30-year-old resident of Indira Nagar in Turbhe.

The body was found in a plastic sack 25 metres away from his house on Wednesday morning. Kasbe’s elder brother Dinesh (33) identified the body and filed a complaint with the police. He claimed Kasbe had not returned home since he left for work on Monday.

Police inspector (crime) Sunil Shinde said, “We noticed water on the floor when we visited the house. The floor looked like it had been mopped recently and there were flies sitting on certain spots. When we looked closely and smelled the spots, we felt that blood had been washed off the floor. We called for a forensic team from Kalina and they confirmed our observation. The samples have been sent to the lab.”

The police found that Dinesh had a criminal record and got into fights with his brother after getting drunk. Mr. Shinde said, “On Tuesday midnight, Dinesh struck his brother with a hammer during an argument at the house. With the help of his friend Mallesh Kamble (35), he wrapped the body in a plastic sack and dumped it outside the house. Later, the duo cleaned the house of all traces of blood.”

The police said Kasbe’s family was aware of the murder and were trying to protect the accused. On Thursday, Dinesh was nabbed and a day later Mr. Kamble was arrested. “More people might be arrested in the case,” Mr. Shinde said.

Kasbe, who got married in 2011, lost his wife to tuberculosis in 2015. He stayed with his three kids — aged eight, six and five — his mother Sitabai (60), visually challenged elder brother Ganesh (35), his wife Anju (19) and brother Dinesh.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flies-on-wet-floor-help-police-crack-murder-case/article30655318.ece
47,2020/01/26,PAP call off 9-day hunger strike; protest continues,"Twelve residents of 10 villages affected by the Navi Mumbai International Airport project ended their nine-day-long hunger strike after Pravin Darekar, the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, met them on Friday.

Over 200 project affected persons (PAP) have been protesting outside the CIDCO office since December 2019 to press for their demands. Ramchandra Mhatre of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha from Raigad, who has been leading the protest, said, “Mr. Darekar offered water to the protesters on hunger strike. As a sign of respect, they obliged. Though the hunger strike has been called off, the protest will continue till CIDCO meets our demands.”

Mr. Darekar, who also met CIDCO officials and requested them to consider the protesters’ demands, said, “Issues that matter to the powerful are looked into, but no one bothers about the poor. Even after a month, the demands have not been met. It shows the apathy of the government. If the situation stays the same, the Kisan Sabha will ramp up the protest and we will give our full support.”

Meanwhile, CIDCO has decided to form a committee to look into the demands. A CIDCO officer said, “The committee will be headed by retired IAS officer Subodh Kumar. Representatives from the villages, the additional chief land and survey officer, and the heads of CIDCO’s anti-encroachment, and rehabilitation and resettlement departments will be part of it.” The committee will examine the documents and video evidence of the constructions and its decision will be final.

48,2020/01/26,Kurla fire: 28 houses burnt to the ground,"The fire at Mehtab Cooperative Housing Society in Kurla on Friday night damaged 28 flats before it was officially declared under control in the wee hours of Saturday.

The blaze broke out at 9.53 p.m. and escalated to a Level III emergency by 10.21 p.m., with 15 fire tenders and water tankers being pressed into service.

“The fire damaged a large part of the electrical wiring and appliances, and household appliances but nobody was reported injured or missing. The flames had to be fought from outside, as cracks had developed in the building’s walls due to LPG cylinders exploding,” chief fire officer Prabhat Rahangdale said.

He said the fire was declared under control at 1.30 a.m. on Saturday, and a team was placed on standby at the spot as a safety measure.

Later in the day, residents of the building were seen milling about, trying to collect whatever belongings they could salvage and work out alternative accommodation arrangements. Many of them told police officers, who were making inquiries at the scene, that they lost almost all their belongings.

Yogesh Gaikwad, a resident, said the building was over 80 years old and had already received a warning from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. “We need to find whatever we can of our belongings as soon as possible. We were told that the building will be demolished in two days. We did our best last night to ensure that everyone was evacuated before the fire could engulf the building completely and the rest of the night was spent in arranging food and water. Residents of nearby societies were very helpful,” he said.

The Kurla police are conducting inquiries and waiting for the fire brigade’s report on the cause of the fire.

“We have found evidence of at least three LPG cylinders exploding inside the building so far. Whether the fire was triggered by one such explosion, or whether it started due to some other reason and caused the cylinders to burst is still being investigated,” senior police inspector Dattatray Shinde, Kurla police station, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o43red/article30655289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMCYLINDERBLAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kurla-fire-28-houses-burnt-to-the-ground/article30655290.ece
49,2020/01/26,One held for sexually assaulting Matunga girl,"The Matunga police have arrested a Dharavi resident for sexually assaulting and attacking a five-year-old girl earlier this week. The victim had gone missing in the early hours of Wednesday and was found injured near King’s Circle four hours later.

A medical examination at Sion hospital had confirmed sexual assault.

“Based on what the victim could tell us, we scanned CCTV camera footage and found a suspect. We tracked him using CCTV network till we found a frame where his face was visible,” an officer with the Matunga police said.

Using a still of the frame, they made inquiries with local informants. The case was being worked upon by several teams when police sub-inspector Ramdas Kadam, Shahu Nagar police station, received a tip-off that the suspect was a Dharavi resident named Aatiq Naushad Sheikh (31). Mr. Sheikh was picked up for questioning and arrested after his role in the offence was established.

“Mr. Sheikh is a waste picker and wanders around the Dharavi-Sion-Matunga belt. He was on a similar round when he saw the victim and kidnapped her. We will produce him in court on Sunday, and seek his custody for further inquiries,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/one-held-for-sexually-assaulting-matunga-girl/article30655262.ece
50,2020/01/26,Seven-year-old bitten by snake on school premises,"A Class II boy of Delhi Public School in Nerul was allegedly bitten by a snake on the school premises on Friday. Ishayu Sen (7) who was admitted to Apollo Hospital in a deep coma, was saved in the nick of time.

When Ishayu complained that his left hand was bleeding, the teacher sent him to the school nurse. The nurse cleaned the wound and sent him back to the auditorium, where the class was rehearsing for annual day. “When he reached, he vomited and fainted. The school authorities suspected something serious and rushed him to the hospital,” sub-inspector Yogesh Pardeshi, NRI Coastal police station, said.

“Snake venom affects either the brain or heart. In this case, it affected the boy’s brain and he was in deep coma when he was brought here. We had to first revive him, so we put him on ventilator and life support. After this, we proceeded to determine the cause for his condition and treat it. The wound on his hand confirmed that it was a snake bite and we immediately started an antivenin treatment. He is still under observation in the intensive care unit but responded well to the medication and all his vitals had stabilised within an hour,” Dr. Nitin Jagasia, head, emergency medicine, Apollo Hospitals, said.

Since Ishayu was brought to the hospital around noon, doctors suspect the snake may have bitten him around 10.30 a.m. “In snake bite cases, the area should be immobilised by tying a scale or rigid object so the venom doesn’t spread and the victim should immediately be taken to an emergency room,” Dr. Jagasia said.

Mr. Pardeshi said the parents were happy the school took Ishayu to the hospital as soon as they sensed something serious, thereby saving his life. After the boy regained consciousness, his mother asked him about the snake and he said he had seen one near the stairs. “We have recorded the mother’s statement but the boy is not in a condition to speak. No FIR has been registered as the parents have not filed a complaint,” the officer said. He said the school is surrounded by mangroves, due to which there are chances of such reptiles crawling in. “We have asked the school authorities to find out ways to avoid such situation in future,” Mr. Pardeshi said.

Ishayu is a resident of NRI Complex. While his father works in private sector, his mother is a teacher at a school in Nerul.

Meanwhile, members of the school’s parent-teacher association have decided to not send students to school on Monday and meet the principal to find a solution to this problem. “Though the child was saved due to the school’s quick action, a snake should not have been on the premises at the first place,” a parent, who did not wished to be named, said.

“We have already started a deep cleaning and sanitisation of the school premises. The incident was unfortunate and came as a shock to all of us The staff was prompt and took child to the hospital immediately without waiting to see me or take permission,” J. Mohanty, the school’s principal, said.

He said the bigger challenge was to understand what actually happened since the child was accompanied by 30 classmates and some ayahs while going to the auditorium but no one else saw the snake.

“We checked the CCTV footage too, but could not find anything. We accept that the incident occurred and the child was serious but do not know how. Our staff is keeping a check on the boy and visiting him periodically. More than anyone, I want to know how this happened as a snake was never seen or heard of in our school before this,” Mr. Mohanty said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/idpvcf/article30655227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26bm-snake-bite,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/seven-year-old-bitten-by-snake-on-school-premises/article30655228.ece
51,2020/01/26,Mumbai 24x7 gets tepid response,"The trial run of Mumbai 24x7, the pet project of Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, got off to an unenthusiastic start on Day 1. Though commercial establishments in several malls remained open till the early hours of Friday, they failed to draw many customers.

The Hindu found that the trial run was only mildly successful when it visited malls such as Phoenix Market City in Kurla, High Street Phoenix in Lower Parel, and Inifiniti and Fun Republic in Andheri. The project allows restaurants, cafés and theatres in non-residential areas to remain open for 24 hours. Pubs and bars, however, have to adhere to the existing 1.30 a.m. deadline.

Though Phoenix Market City in Kurla was open till 5 a.m. on Saturday, most of the people found hanging out in the mall were those who had come to catch a late-night show. The movie-goers welcomed the move as they were able to grab a bite on their way out. However, several employees of outlets in the mall expressed disappointment at the poor footfall. They were expecting a higher turnout as the trial run was introduced at the start of a weekend.

Imran Khan, who works at the Vero Moda store, said, “From my experience of working at this mall for the last few years, I know that people do turn up in good numbers when such projects are introduced. Mumbai 24x7 was also supposed to be a big event, but it turns out that it was just a hype.”

Pawan Soni, manager at Rainforest, said the restobar had announced special discounts for customers who stayed after 1 a.m., but the offer failed to attract people. “Customers present in the restaurant for dinner stayed back till 1.30 a.m., but started to leave when the permissible time limit for serving alcohol ended,” he said. Shailendra Rawat, who works at Home Center, a home furnishing retail store, said footfall is determined by the locality in which a mall is situated.

Few takers: Phoenix Market City in Kurla (top) and Fun Republic in Andheri wear a deserted look on Friday midnight, when the trial run of the project kicked off.

While a few customers welcomed the move, many were not even aware of the project. Vaishnavi Anapuzha (20), who visited the mall at 1.30 a.m., said, “Malls being functional for the entire day is a dream come true. Today’s generation is insomniac and it is better that we can visit malls instead of surfing social media till odd hours of the morning.”

However, Devesh Bhatt, who was leaving after watching the last show of a movie with his friends, said he was unaware about the move and surprised to see stores and cafés open after midnight.

At Infiniti and Fun Republic malls in Andheri, several outlets shut shop between 2.30 a.m. and 4 a.m. Many employees admitted that they did not know that the project had started. An employee at the Pizza Hut outlet at Fun Republic said they closed for business at the usual time. He said, “We have no information about the project. In any case, we don’t get any customers at this time and there is no use keeping the outlet open.”

At High Street Phoenix, restaurants and cafés were open till 3 a.m. as the last show at PVR ended at 2.30 a.m. By 3.30 a.m., the mall wore a deserted look.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/skkzoj/article30655221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMFun-Republic-Mall,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-24x7-gets-tepid-response/article30655223.ece
52,2020/01/26,Six fire officers to get President’s medal,"Six Mumbai Fire Brigade officers, including chief fire officer (CFO) P.S. Rahangdale, will be conferred with the President’s Medal for Gallantry for their services in the July 2019 fire at the MTNL building in Bandra. Eighty-six civilians were rescued in one of the biggest fire operations the city has witnessed.

The fire, which broke out on July 23, had escalated to a Level IV emergency. The heavy smoke, debris and trees around the building hampered access, and made the operation a very challenging one.

The fire brigade had rescued the employees from the terrace of the building using ladders and cranes. The entire operation lasted around 22 hours, at the end of which no civilian casualty was reported and one fireman sustained minor injuries.

The President’s Medals, which are awarded to police and fire officers on Republic Day, will be awarded to Mr. Rahangdale, deputy chief officer (technical) Rajendra Chaudhary, divisional fire officer Ravindra Ambulgekar, assistant divisional fire officer Milind Donde, station officer Abhijeet Sawant and operator Sudhir Vartak.

“It was one of the biggest fires ever reported and our officers excelled in their performance while rescuing those trapped inside,” Mr. Rahangdale said.

Three others, deputy CFO Vithalrao Hiwrale, deputy CFO Vijaykumar Panigrahi and deputy CFO Yeshwant Jadhav, will be receive the President’s Medal for Meritorious Service, which is awarded to those with the best track record and takes their entire career’s service into account.

Meanwhile, 19 Maharashtra Police personnel will also be awarded the President’s Medal for Meritorious Service. The list includes Deputy Commissioner of Police Dhananjay Kulkarni, who is currently in Singapore on deputation to Interpol as coordinator, counterterrorism. Mr. Kulkarni has previously worked with the Mumbai Police Crime Branch and the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad.

Those honoured from the Mumbai Police commissionerate include Additional Commissioner of Police (Motor Transport) Atul Patil, senior police inspector Mukund Pawar with the Special Branch and senior police inspector Gajanan Kabdule, Khar police station.

“Receiving the medal is a great honour as well as a humbling experience. We owe this to the support we have received from our seniors and our juniors,” Mr. Kabdule said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a263es/article30655123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMMTNLFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/six-fire-officers-to-get-presidents-medal/article30655125.ece
53,2020/01/26,Chatting apps boost networking among flesh trade racket operators,"The advent of online mobile chatting apps has helped operators of flesh trade rackets network with their counterparts, with pimps from all over the country now being part of common WhatsApp groups, police officers said on Saturday.

Since January 3, the Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the Mumbai Police has busted five flesh trade rackets in the city with links to at least three other cities. “In most of these rackets, those arrested in Mumbai are only the footsoldiers who deliver the women to the client and collect the money. The main accused in at least three of the five rackets are based in New Delhi, while two other cases were linked to Pune and Ahmedabad,” an AHTU officer said.

In its most recent operation, conducted on Thursday, the AHTU arrested Aditya Chawda (20), an Ahmedabad native who would allegedly accept orders from clients in Mumbai and relay them to two women pimps in Kandivali.

‘No risk of arrest’

“All communication would happen on a WhatsApp group, where pictures and details of the victims would be shared. Once the client had taken his pick from the profiles sent to him, a price would be finalised. Mr. Chawda would take care of everything without being exposed to any risk of being arrested, as he would not be in the city,” the officer said.

In a racket busted in Andheri on January 22, the unit had rescued two women from Turkmenistan who were brought from Pune for a client — a dummy customer working at the behest of the police.

Further investigation into the five cases has indicated that a large network of pimps in the country is in touch with each other through mobile chatting apps, sources said.

“Not just for internal communication between their own syndicate, pimps also use chatting apps to stay in touch with their counterparts based in other locations. This is for various purposes, like putting a regular client in touch with another pimp, exchanging information about latest developments in their line of work, and precautions based on latest methods employed by law enforcement agencies,” another officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chatting-apps-boost-networking-among-flesh-trade-racket-operators/article30655116.ece

The two men have had a running feud since the outspoken Australian called Nadal “super salty” and his “polar opposite” last year after the Spaniard complained he “lacks respect”.

“I don’t really dislike him. I don’t know him at all. Hell of a tennis player. Don't know him as a person. I'm sure he’s okay,” said Kyrgios, adding that there was “a layer of respect” between them. “I'm super-excited, honestly. Playing one of the greatest tennis players on centre court at your own Slam, it’s pretty damn cool.

“Obviously, it’s going to be another physical battle. Nothing comes easy with him. He had a relatively routine (third round) match, so he’s going to be feeling good. I'm looking forward to it. That’s why you play, I guess.”

Nadal earlier gave a cool response when asked whether he liked Kyrgios.

“When he does stuff that in my opinion is not good, I don't like,” said the 19-time Grand Slam winner. “When he plays good tennis and he shows passion for this game, he is a positive player for our tour.” The pair have faced each other seven times before, with Nadal holding a 4-3 advantage.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/29l9td/article30659713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27NICK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-kyrgios-super-excited-to-face-nadal/article30659714.ece

56,2020/01/26,"Australian Open | Defending champion Djokovic, Raonic enter quarter-finals","Novak Djokovic continued his imperious progress through the Australian Open draw on Sunday, negotiating a potentially tricky encounter with Diego Schwartzman 6-3 6-4 6-4 to reach the last eight at Melbourne Park for the 11th time.

The seven-time champion only added to a strong feeling around the tournament that the Serbian is again the man to beat at the year's first Grand Slam as he ousted the Argentine in just over two hours at Rod Laver Arena.

The defending champion broke for 5-3 and served out for the opening set before grabbing early breaks in the next two stanzas and successfully resisting Schwartzman's attempts to get back on terms.

The 32-year-old second seed wrapped up the contest by serving out to love and moves on to a quarter-final meeting with in-form Canadian Milos Raonic, who he has beaten in all nine of their previous meetings.

Raonic beats Cilic

Raonic pounded down 35 aces and 55 winners to overcome Croatian Marin Cilic 6-4 6-3 7-5 on Sunday and become the first man to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Open.

The 29-year-old, a former world number three, is seeded a lowly 32nd at Melbourne Park but has been in impressive form over the first week and reached the last eight without losing a set.

Cilic, the 2014 U.S. Open champion, may have been feeling the effects of two five-set matches against seeded opponents earlier in the tournament and needed a lengthy medical timeout for treatment on his back at 3-0 down in the second set.

Also a former world number three, the 31-year-old still had enough game to test Raonic, especially when he was able to engage the Canadian in lengthier rallies.

Raonic was consistently sending down serves well in excess of 200 kilometres per hour (124 mph), however, and it was appropriate that he finished the match on Margaret Court Arena with one final booming ace.

“I'm just happy to be playing well, to be playing in this kind of atmosphere and this kind of support,” said Raonic, a semi-finalist in Melbourne in 2016.

“It feels pretty damn good I've gotta say, I can't complain about it.

The 15-year-old Gauff, who had beaten defending champion Naomi Osaka in her previous match and seven-times Grand Slam winner Venus Williams in her opener, rallied from a break down to win the opening set in a tiebreaker.

While Gauff enjoyed most of the support at the packed Melbourne Arena, Kenin, the 14th seed, fought her way back into the match and got the crucial break in the second set when Gauff served three double faults in the fourth game.

59,2020/01/26,App aims to academically empower visually impaired students,"An Android-based application (App) built on the basis of a technology innovation promises to academically empower visually impaired students by freeing them of their dependence on scribes while writing exams.

The Swalekhan (self-writing) app is a tech offering conceptualised by the city-based Niwant Andh Mukta Vikasalaya, an NGO that works for the betterment of the visually impaired individuals, and developed by Josh Software, a Pune-based IT services company specialising in providing global tech solutions, in conjunction with Tekvision, a leading accessibility service provider whose workforce comprises a significant number of visually impaired technocrats.

The Android text-to-speech app (typing tutor), which is aimed at helping visually impaired students reduce their reliance on scribes and took three years to create, has been embraced by more than 20 schools across Maharashtra since its launch in mid-2019. As many as 600 students from Pune, Shrirampur, Nanded, Nashik, Aurangabad and Buldhana districts have been taking lessons to type with the help of this application. From helping master the keys by using an innovative braille paper overlay, to aiding students in listening and grasping 78 innovative and interactive lessons, Swalekhan uses a combination of human voices as well as Text-to-Speech guided assistance.

“Our institute has been working with visually impaired students for more than two decades,” said Uma Badve, trustee, Niwant Andh Mukta Vikasalaya. “In all this time, the most frequent complaint from students is of not having the independence to write their own exams and their frustration at their overt dependence on scribes, who are normally hard to find and are generally inefficient. Hence, we decided to come up with a technology to empower these children that would help them write their own exams,” she added. Ms. Badve said all lessons were designed in Marathi to enable students to write in the vernacular.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/oodvp/article30655445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMSwalekhan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/app-aims-to-academically-empower-visually-impaired-students/article30654036.ece
60,2020/01/26,Should the Jeff Bezos ‘phone hack’ be cause for alarm?,"The story so far: Earlier this week, The Guardian published a report on the alleged hacking of the personal phone of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (in 2018). Cyber-forensics firm FTI Consulting, which has been investigating the issue, has attributed this attack to the Saudi regime. Parts of this alleged incident are eerily similar to the infamous Pegasus case. Though the report released by FTI has been criticised by many in the information security industry — for falling short of investigative standards and technical rigour — the mere possibility of such an incident having occurred does raise several important questions on application and device security.

What has been the global impact of the vulnerabilities discovered?

Multiple security vulnerabilities affecting WhatsApp were discovered, disclosed, and patched in 2019. Out of these, one vulnerability in particular, disclosed in May 2019, garnered significant media attention — primarily due to its role in aiding the delivery of spyware known as ‘Pegasus’. The company behind Pegasus, Israel’s NSO Group, claims to equip “authorised governments” with “technology that helps combat terror and crime”. According to WhatsApp, the spyware was deployed on at least 1,400 targets, including lawyers, activists, dissidents and diplomats. The Pegasus spyware is also known to have been used against several Indian journalists and activists.

In recent memory, the Pegasus incident remains perhaps the most stark example of how security vulnerabilities in popular software can compromise the security of users, though it is far from the only such case. In 2019 itself, at least two other security vulnerabilities — which could have allowed attackers to remotely execute malicious code on victim’s devices — were discovered and patched by WhatsApp. Attackers could have exploited these flaws by sending specifically crafted GIF files or MP4 videos, requiring little to no interaction on the part of the victim.

What is a buffer overflow? How does it affect WhatsApp?

Buffer overflows allow attackers to read or write data outside of the defined memory boundaries of a particular programme. Though mitigative measures exist, buffer overflow vulnerabilities in general are complex, and are considered to be harder to detect and exploit than other, more frequently occurring security flaws. In some cases, buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be leveraged for executing malicious code on the target machine. A buffer overflow vulnerability in an application such as WhatsApp would allow an attacker to take advantage of the context under which the application is running on the system. Though a vulnerability in WhatsApp alone would not suffice for total compromise of the device, here, the protections offered by end-to-end encryption on the platform would be rendered ineffective — since end-to-end encryption only refers to message contents being encrypted while they are in transit — and since, with a buffer overflow, an attacker would be able to get access to the buffer where data (including received messages) is stored. By exploiting such a flaw, permissions that have been granted to the app, which may include permission to access the device’s microphone, camera, location, gallery and more — also stand to be exploited, though protections baked into mobile operating systems may make this harder to achieve.

Can a buffer overflow in WhatsApp result in the phone on which it is being run being compromised?

Modern computing devices, including smartphones, implement a number of security measures to effectively contain the extent of a program’s ability to interact with machine it is running on. One such measure is known as a “sandbox”, which limits the ability a program or process has to interact with operating system code. However, it is possible to bypass such protections, too. It is possible to “chain” a vulnerability in software such as WhatsApp — with a vulnerability in the device’s operating system — escaping the sandbox within which it is run, to ultimately gain “root” privileges on the affected system. Exploitation of sandbox and kernel vulnerabilities is also what allows “jailbreaking” to be performed on devices. Root access on a device grants the attacker with the highest level of privilege that can be held on the system. This would allow the attacker to circumvent most (if not all) software restrictions imposed on the device. This level of access is also essential for deploying tools that can freely access or modify data on the device, alter core functionality, and more.

How is data extracted from a device?

Traditionally, upon infection, infected devices communicate back to a “command and control” server. Since a lot of the files on a device may be junk, or of meagre value, an operator would choose what kind of data they wish to retrieve. To thwart the possibility of detection via unusual spikes in bandwidth usage, an operator may choose to extract only information of vital importance. Further, since stealth is ideal, outbound data may be transmitted through alternative channels, make use of obfuscation or encryption, among other techniques, to prevent detection. Alternatively, an attacker with access to a device may choose not to extract information at all, instead choosing just to “view,” this information by accessing it through an SSH tunnel.

How can users protect themselves?

A matter of relief is that vulnerabilities such as the ones that have been discussed above are not easy to come by. They are discovered as a result of continuous, concentrated efforts and arduous testing. Similarly, the people who discover these flaws have an active natural interest in retaining knowledge of just how the flaw works. Facilitators such as the NSO Group do not just relay information about their “proprietary” vulnerabilities to customers. They instead opt to perform the exploitation themselves, and thereby ensure that customers are not able to infect devices without having them in the loop.

For most users, following basic security hygiene, such as not visiting untrusted websites, installing untrusted third party applications or certificates, keeping device and application software updated, should be enough. People must remember that WhatsApp is not the only method of delivery for complex attacks. Vulnerabilities exist which can allow for escaping the sandbox of mobile browsers to execute code on the system. Though, it should be noted that highly specialised attacks, such as Pegasus, have not been known to “indiscriminately” target users. This is primarily because of the risk of detection that widespread exploitation would invite.

Further, though no software update can eliminate entirely the prospect of future vulnerabilities being discovered, frequent updation may incapacitate certain exploits, that is due to the fact one vulnerability may not always work in conjunction with another.

For those with an elevated threat profile, simply keeping your phone updated may not always be a definitive way of preventing attacks. Devices can be compromised in a variety of ways, especially given that the adversary has enough time and resources. Device security must be extended to include monitoring — not only superficial monitoring, which relies on known signatures and vulnerabilities — and not only that which occurs after an indicator of compromise has been spotted.

61,2020/01/26,How is facial recognition used in today’s world? When is it problematic?,"The story so far: Last week, European media network EURACTIV and Politico published a story that said the European Commission is mulling a temporary ban (of up to five years) on the use of facial recognition technologies in public spaces. The story is based on a leaked draft paper being prepared by the Commission for publication in February. Two big tech companies — Alphabet and Microsoft — have taken completely different positions on the idea. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is backing it while Microsoft President Brad Smith is not. This comes even as facial recognition technologies are being increasingly adopted by individuals, organisations, and governments.

Why does the European Commission want a temporary ban on facial recognition technologies in public spaces?

The reasons from the report referred to above are not fully known as the report is not out yet. But from earlier media reports, it can be inferred that the European Commission believes that indiscriminate use of facial recognition technologies is a privacy threat, and some regulations are needed so that this does not easily give way to surveillance. During the temporary ban period, “a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed,” says the leaked Commission paper, as reported by EURACTIV.

What exactly have been the reactions of Alphabet and Microsoft?

Mr. Pichai has been cited by Reuters as saying he thinks “it is important that governments and regulations tackle it sooner rather than later and give a framework for it.” A moratorium, according to him, is needed because this technology can be used for nefarious purposes. Mr. Smith, has been quoted as saying: “I’m really reluctant to say let’s stop people from using technology in a way that will reunite families when it can help them do it.” He also said: “The second thing I would say is you don’t ban it if you actually believe there is a reasonable alternative that will enable us to, say, address this problem with a scalpel instead of a meat cleaver.”

How is facial recognition used in today’s world? When is it problematic?

It is increasingly being used for everything: from unlocking your phone to validating your identity, from auto-tagging digital photos to finding missing persons, and from targeted advertising to law enforcement. China’s reported use of facial recognition technologies for surveillance in Xinjiang is an example of when this becomes problematic. It also becomes problematic in the absence of privacy and data security laws.

So, is it easy to isolate problematic use cases from beneficial ones?

Actually, it is based on a lot of factors. A blog post by tech major IBM categorises facial recognition systems into three. One, face detection, which could help count the number of people in traffic. Two, facial authentication, which could help you unlock your phone. Three, facial matching, which could help investigators quickly zero in on suspects. The use cases mentioned are in no way exhaustive.

IBM says in the post: “Each of these technologies and their uses can raise specific questions and possible concerns, ranging from privacy and civil liberties to user security and safety. In considering whether and how best to regulate any technology — from nuclear power to the Internet — it is imperative to consider both the use and the ultimate end-user. Facial recognition systems are no different.” So, it says, “Instead of simply banning an entire category of technologies with so many possible applications, including many that are helpful and benign, policymakers should employ precision regulation that applies restrictions and oversight to particular use-cases and end-users where there is greater risk of societal harm.”

Is the current debate on facial recognition part of a larger debate?

Yes, it flows from conversations all over the world and more specifically on both sides of the Atlantic on regulating artificial intelligence systems (advanced tech whose actions mimic those of humans). Such systems can write stories based on a database, drive cars (still being tested out), and automatically spot suspects in a crowd or for that matter spot anyone. The leaked report of the European Commission is not dealing with just facial recognition. Its mandate is to provide a framework for artificial intelligence. The U.S., on the other hand, has recently released guidelines regarding artificial intelligence, and they reportedly point to a light touch when it comes to regulation. Historically, Europe and the U.S. have had completely opposite approaches to regulation.

Meanwhile, what is the world doing with facial recognition technologies?

In a few U.S. cities, including San Francisco, there is now a ban on the government’s use of facial recognition technologies. But the list of adopters seem to be growing bigger by the day. London has joined the bandwagon, and will use real time facial recognition systems to police the city. Closer home, Telangana has recently tested this technology to verify voters in local elections.

What will now happen to the European Commission report?

It is likely to be published by the end of February. And the whole of the remaining part of the year will be spent in getting feedback.

The service can only be used to access 301 websites approved by the administration, the officials said. “Mobile internet has been restored across the Valley. Only 2G services have been restored and only white-listed websites, excluding social media sites, can be accessed,” an official had said earlier in the day.

64,2020/01/26,"Three rockets hit U.S. embassy in Baghdad, one injured","Three rockets slammed into the U.S. Embassy in Iraq's capital on Sunday in the first direct hit reported after months of close calls, as thousands kept up anti-government sit-ins across the country.

The attack marked a dangerous escalation in the spree of rocket attacks in recent months that have targeted the embassy or Iraqi military bases where American troops are deployed.

None of the attacks has been claimed but Washington has repeatedly blamed Iran-backed military factions in Iraq. On Sunday, one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, a security source told AFP. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but a statement by Iraqi security forces earlier in the evening said there were no casualties. However, at least one person has been wounded in the attack, a senior Iraqi official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The attack took place earlier in the day than usual, with AFP reporters hearing the booms on the western bank of the river Tigris at precisely 7:30 pm (1630 GMT). Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Speaker of Parliament Mohammed Halbusi both condemned the incident, saying it risked dragging their homeland into war.

The United States called on Iraq to protect American diplomatic facilities after the US embassy in Baghdad was hit by three rockets.

'Fulfill obligations'

""We call on the Government of Iraq to fulfill its obligations to protect our diplomatic facilities,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.

The attack marked a dangerous escalation in a spree of rocket attacks in recent months that have targeted the embassy or Iraqi military bases where American troops are deployed.

None of the attacks has been claimed, but Washington has repeatedly blamed Iran-backed military factions in Iraq.

On Sunday, one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, a security source told AFP. ""Since September there have been over 14 attacks by Iran and Iranian-supported militias on US personnel in Iraq,"" the State Department spokesperson said.

Iraq has already been dragged into a worrying tit-for-tat between the United States and Iran over the last month. A similar attack on a northern Iraqi base killed an American contractor, and the U.S. retaliated with a strike on an Iran-backed faction known as Kataeb Hezbollah.

Less than a week later, a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside the Baghdad airport -- prompting Iran to fire ballistic missiles at an Iraqi base where US troops are stationed.

'Only for you, Iraq!'

Some 5,200 Americans are stationed in Iraq to lead the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, but the US strike on Baghdad has rallied top Iraqi figures around a joint call to order them out.

Vehemently anti-American cleric Moqtada Sadr organised a mass rally in Baghdad on Friday, where thousands of his supporters called for American troops to leave.

Sadr had previously backed separate anti-regime protests sweeping Iraq's capital and south, even though he controls the largest bloc in parliament and top ministerial posts.

Bolstered by his own protest on Friday, Sadr announced he was dropping support for the youth-dominated reform campaign rocking the country since October.

His followers, widely regarded as the best-organised and well-stocked of the anti-government demonstrators, immediately began dismantling their tents and heading home.

Activists feared that without his political cover, authorities would move to crush their movement -- and indeed, within hours, riot police tried to storm protest camps across the capital and south.

Those efforts continued into Sunday, with security forces using live rounds and tear gas to try to flush protesters out of squares and streets they had occupied for months.

One protester was shot dead in Baghdad and another in the flashpoint southern city of Nasiriyah, medical sources said, and dozens more were wounded across the country.

Despite the renewed violence, thousands of students flooded the streets in the capital and across the south in a bid to keep national attention focused on their demands.

“Only for you, Iraq!” read a sign held by a young protester in the shrine city of Karbala, hinting at the movement's insistence on not being affiliated with any political party or outside backer.

U.N. hails 'Iraqi hopes'

In Basra, hundreds of students gathered to condemn the riot police's dismantling of their main protest camp the previous day, according to an AFP correspondent.

In Baghdad, university students marched from a campus in the city centre to the main rally area of Tahrir Square.

Riot police fired live rounds and tear gas at clusters of young protesters in the nearby Khallani and Wathba squares, but protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails to keep them back.

Security forces have stopped short of entering Tahrir Square, where some protesters stood their ground even after many tents were dismantled.

In Nasiriyah, security forces fired live rounds to disperse demonstrators angered by authorities pushing them out of roads around their main protest camp in Habbubi Square.

The youth-led protests erupted on October 1 in outrage over lack of jobs, poor services and rampant corruption before spiralling into calls for a government overhaul after they were met with violence.

More than 470 people have died, a vast majority of them demonstrators, since the rallies erupted.

Protesters are now demanding snap elections, the appointment of an independent premier and the prosecution of anyone implicated in corruption or recent bloodshed.

Their voices have been heard by top UN envoy in Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert who has said: “Unaccountability and indecisiveness are unworthy of Iraqi hopes, courageously expressed for four months now.”

65,2020/01/26,UN says ‘blatant’ violations of Libya arms embargo continue,"The United Nations decried “continued blatant violations” by several countries of an arms embargo on war-torn Libya, flying in the face of recent pledges made last week at an international conference in Berlin.

The UN support mission in Libya didn’t name any specific nations, but said they included “several who participated in the Berlin Conference.” Saturday’s statement said these countries were supplying advanced weapons, armoured vehicles and foreign fighters.

Libya sits on Africa’s Mediterranean coast, and is divided between rival governments, each supported by various armed militias and foreign backers. It has the ninth largest known oil reserves in the world and the biggest oil reserves in Africa.

The weak but UN-recognised government in the capital Tripoli is backed by Turkey, and to a lesser degree Qatar and Italy. Rival forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter receive support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia.

""Over the last ten days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters,” the UN statement said.

The UN warned that continuing to funnel arms into the conflict threatens the “fragile truce” in Tripoli. Mr. Hifter’s forces have laid siege to the capital since last April. A cease-fire was brokered earlier this month by Russia and Turkey.

At the Berlin summit, world powers with an interest in Libya pledged to halt foreign interference and honor the UN arms embargo.

Among those who attended the Berlin conference were Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The peace push followed a surge in Hifter’s offensive against Tripoli, which threatened to plunge Libya into chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Earlier this month, powerful tribal groups loyal to Hifter also seized several large oil export terminals along the eastern coast as well as southern oil fields. The closure of Libya’s major oil fields and production facilities has resulted in losses of more than $255 million in the six-day period ending Jan. 23, the country’s national oil company said Saturday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nmktnv/article30659557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Libyans,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-says-blatant-violations-of-libya-arms-embargo-continue/article30659558.ece
66,2020/01/26,"U.S. won’t lift curbs on Iran for talks, says Trump","The United States will not lift sanctions on Iran in order to negotiate, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted late on Saturday, seemingly in response to a Der Spiegel interview with Iran’s Foreign Minister.

“Iranian Foreign Minister says Iran wants to negotiate with The United States, but wants sanctions removed. @FoxNews @OANN No Thanks!” Mr. Trump tweeted in English on Saturday and later in Farsi.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Sunday by tweeting an excerpt from the interview with German magazine Der Spiegel published on Friday, where he said Iran is still open to negotiations with U.S. if sanctions are lifted.

Raised tensions

“@realdonaldtrump is better advised to base his foreign policy comments & decisions on facts, rather than @FoxNews headlines or his Farsi translators,” Mr. Zarif said in the tweet with the interview excerpt.

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have reached the highest levels in decades after the U.S. killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on January 3, prompting Iran to fire missiles days later at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed.

67,2020/01/26,Trump says ‘get rid’ of Ukraine envoy on tape,"Donald Trump demanded the dismissal of Marie Yovanovitch, the Ambassador to Ukraine and a key figure in the President’s impeachment trial, according to a video recording released to U.S. media on Saturday.

The footage was reportedly taken during an April 2018 donor dinner at a hotel and released to news outlets by an attorney for Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Mr. Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

Mr. Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman are key players in Mr. Trump’s alleged campaign to pressure the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a potential election opponent for the President.

The issue is central to Mr. Trump’s ongoing impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.

His order to fire the Ambassador came after Mr. Parnas told him that Ms. Yovanovich was an impediment, and claiming that she had privately disparaged the President. “Get rid of her!” Mr. Trump says on the tape, reportedly addressing a White House aide at the dining table. “Get her out tomorrow. I don’t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.”

Images taken at an awkward angle appear at the start of the one hour, 23-minute long video. The rest of the recording shows a tan background, as if the camera were covered, but Mr. Trump’s distinctive voice is clear.

In TV interview with MSNBC News last week, Mr. Parnas said Mr. Trump “knew exactly what was going on” with his and Mr. Fruman’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian authorities to investigate Mr. Biden.

His appearance came after Democrats released documents that showed Mr. Giuliani worked with Mr. Parnas to pressure Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden.

Both Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were charged with violating U.S. campaign finance laws in October.

The documents also showed the pair, working with Ukrainian officials, trying to force out Ms. Yovanovitch, who Mr. Trump eventually removed in May 2019.

Saturday’s recording corroborates much of what Mr. Parnas said in his TV interview, including that he knew Mr. Trump — something the President has denied.

Increased pressure

In October, Ms. Yovanovitch testified to Congress that she was recalled due to “unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.”

Joseph Bondy, an attorney for Mr. Parnas, said that he submitted the evidence to investigators in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

He also told CNN that Mr. Parnas has more recordings and photographs that may be released to the public.

The release of the tape increases pressure on U.S. senators to subpoena witnesses for the impeachment trial, a move several polls show has strong support among the US public.

White House lawyers began Mr. Trump’s defence in the impeachment trial on Saturday.

They have argued that the president did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and that US voters—not Congress—should decide his fate.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers will resume his defense on Monday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/48y6vu/article30659520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Yovanovitch,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-get-rid-of-ukraine-envoy-on-tape/article30659521.ece
68,2020/01/26,Palestinians threaten to quit Oslo peace accord,"Palestinian officials threatened on Sunday to withdraw from key provisions of the Oslo Accords, which define relations with Israel, if U.S. President Donald Trump announces his Middle East peace plan next week.

Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told AFP that the Palestine Liberation Organisation reserved the right “to withdraw from the interim agreement” if Mr. Trump unveils his plan.

Mr. Trump’s initiative will turn Israel’s “temporary occupation (of Palestinian territory) into a permanent occupation”, Mr. Erekat said.

The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement, signed in Washington in 1995, sought to put into practice the first Oslo peace deal agreed two years earlier.

Sometimes called Oslo II, the interim agreement set out the scope of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza.

The interim pact was only supposed to last five years while a permanent agreement was finalised but it has tacitly been rolled over for more than two decades.

Mr. Erekat’s comment came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was headed to Washington, where he will meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the project.

“It's a great plan. It's a plan that really would work,” Mr. Trump had said.

The Palestinian leadership was not invited and has already rejected Mr. Trump’s initiative amid tense relations with the U.S. President over his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital.

Jerusalem’s fate

The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state and believe Mr. Trump’s plan buries the two-state solution that has been for decades the cornerstone of international Middle East diplomacy.

World powers have long agreed that Jerusalem’s fate should be settled through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

69,2020/01/26,"Two Sri Lankan women receive Padma awards for contribution to arts, language teaching","Two prominent Sri Lankan women have been named as recipients of the Padma Shri awards for their respective contribution to the arts and language teaching, and strengthening ties with India, the High Commission here said.

Veteran Kandyan dance exponent and guru Vajira Chitrasena, and linguist Indra Dassanayake, a well-known professor of Hindi who passed away last year, will receive one of the highest civilian honours in India, for their “pioneering contributions in their individual fields of work and for strengthening India-Sri Lanka ties”, a statement from the mission here said.

Ms. Vajira, 87, is the first Sri Lankan woman to take up Kandyan dance — traditionally performed by men — as her full-time profession. In addition to performing world over with her late husband Chitrasena, her teacher and a pioneer in the field, she has choreographed several acclaimed productions and has been teaching scores of students over the past six decades, emphasising the rigour and distinct aesthetic that the Chitrasena Dance Company is known for.

The Chitrasena couple have a special bond with India, where they travelled often from 1959 to 1998 and collaborated with artistes from different genres. “It was a dream for my husband Chitrasena to receive this honour, as he studied at Tagore’s Shantiniketan and with Guru Gopinath at Kalamandalam in Kerala. He was greatly inspired by Tagore and Udaya Shankar Ji. India is like home to us,” Ms. Vajira said, responding to the recognition. The longstanding friendship they forged decades ago with fellow artistes across the Palk Strait culminated in ‘Samhara’, when the Colomb-based dance company collaborated with Bangalore-based Odissi school Nrityagram.

Guru Chitrasena — whose 99th birth anniversary was observed on Sunday — ‘polished’ Kandyan dance techniques, bringing it to the modern stage from the village ritual, Ms. Vajira noted, adding that it was “good fortune” to have been his partner and to create a professional path for female dancers.

Indra Dassanayake was a renowned Professor of Hindi at the Kelaniya University, near Colombo. An alumnus of the University of Lucknow, Prof. Dassanayake is considered a pioneer in teaching the language in Sri Lanka, especially for her efforts in re-establishing the Department at the university in 1995 that is the largest centre of Hindi studies in the island. Thanks to her initiative, the language is taught in over 80 Sri Lankan institutions and schools and six universities. Her contribution to promoting the language also won her the ‘Dr. George Grierson Hindi Sevi Samman for 2005’ at the World Hindi Conference in New Delhi, the Indian mission said in a media release.

The last time that the government of India honoured a Sri Lankan national with the honour was in 2002, recognising musician and Magsaysay award winner W.D. Amaradeva with the Padma Shri.

70,2020/01/26,Coronavirus: China bans wild animal trade,"China on January 26 ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals as the country struggles to contain a deadly virus believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild animals as food.

Raising, transporting or selling all wild animal species is forbidden ""from the date of the announcement until the national epidemic situation is over"", said a government directive. The ban was issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.

The lethal virus, which has caused 56 confirmed deaths and nearly 2,000 total infections in China, and spread to about a dozen countries, is believed to have originated in a market in the central city of Wuhan, where a range of wildlife was reportedly sold.

Conservationists have long accused China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines, including highly endangered species such as the pangolin or tiger. Health experts say the trade poses a significant and growing public health risk as potentially dangerous animal-borne pathogens that people would normal not be exposed to make the jump to humans.

The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.

Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed on an exhaustive price list for one of the animal-trading businesses at the Wuhan market that emerged online last week. Other items included various rats, snakes, giant salamanders and even live wolf pups.

Sunday's announcement said all businesses, markets, food and beverage outlets and e-commerce platforms are ""strictly prohibited from trading in wild animals in any form"". It added that ""consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, avoid wild game, and eat healthy"".

The so-called bushmeat trade, along with broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing humans into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in today's connected world, scientists say. A study by the Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, estimated that there are nearly 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in the animal kingdom, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Peter Daszak, a virology expert with the project, told AFP its research also indicated that we can expect around five new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year.

China has launched previous crackdowns on the wildlife trade, including after SARS, but conservationists say the trade typically resumes over time.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rwia3p/article30657089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHSOUTHKOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-china-bans-wild-animal-trade/article30657090.ece

China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday that started on Friday, a period when the amusement parks would be usually packed with tourists.

China has confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of January 25, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56.

72,2020/01/26,Protesters march against CAA on London streets,"Thousands of students, activists and representatives from several Indian diaspora and human rights organisations gathered opposite Downing Street in London to protest against India’s new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The rally, organised by student groups and Indian outfits in the UK, marched around a mile down the streets to gather outside the Indian High Commission in London.

The protesters carried placards reading Protect the Constitution, Stop Dividing India, United Against Racism in India and No Citizenship on the Basis of Religion.

The CAA came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world.

The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship.

The protesters, from around the UK and describing themselves as representative of diverse and multi-faith Indian communities across the UK, demanded that the CAA be repealed because it undermines India’s secular Constitution .

They also called for the abolition of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), which they said in conjunction with the CAA, open the way for selective mass disenfranchisement of India’s Muslim population.

UK Opposition Labour Party MP Sam Tarry addressed the demonstrators with the message that human rights in any country is an international issue.

“We are not here as any anti-India demonstration, we are here as a pro-India demonstration. It is incredibly important that our voices are heard against laws that are not good for the future of the country,” said the east London MP.

Messages of support from Labour MPs Stephen Timms, Clive Lewis and newly-elected Indian-origin parliamentarian Nadia Whittome were also read out, calling on the UK government to take up the issue with Indian counterparts.

“On the eve of Republic Day, we are reminded of our core values of freedom, equality and diversity. We stand in solidarity with all the people in India and around the world in their fight against injustice and racism,” said Harsev Bains, of the Indian Workers Association (GB).

“The protest in front of the Brazilian embassy, which preceded the march to the Indian High Commission, seeks to highlight the fact that fascism today is a truly global problem,” said a spokesperson for the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) India Society.

Some of the other groups backing Saturday’s march included CasteWatch UK, Tamil People in the UK, Indian Muslim Federation(UK), Federation of Redbridge Muslim Organisations (FORMO), Kashmir Solidarity Movement, South Asian Students Against Fascism among others.

Saturday’s demonstration, to mark the eve of India’s Republic Day, will be followed by another protest outside India House in London on Sunday, when pro-Pakistani and separatist groups led by Tehreek-e-Kashmir UK plan to observe a ‘Black Day’ against the Indian government.

The Indian High Commission in London has raised serious concerns for the safety of the mission and its staff and Indian High Commissioner Ruchi Ghanashyam had even taken up the matter with UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre said it is “caring for a patient who has a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.”

Officials said the man is his 50s and recently flew from Wuhan, China to Guangzhou, China and then on to Toronto on January 23. “He really wasn’t in Toronto very long. He wasn’t feeling well. I think he was at home and the people that live with him are in self isolation,” said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s Associated Chief Medical Officer.

The outbreak of the new virus originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,200 people and killed 41, and has spread worldwide. Australia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday - four each -and Japan, its third. France confirmed three cases Friday, the first in Europe, and the U.S. identified its second, a woman in Chicago who had returned from China.

In Canada, while the case has been confirmed by a test in Toronto, officials said it has yet to complete separate testing by the federal government’s National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg. The illness will officially be fully confirmed once it completes that testing.

Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, said they are 95% sure it is the virus. “This is the first presumptive confirmed case,” said Williams. “While we are convinced our tests do demonstrate positivity there is confirmation at the national medical laboratory in Winnipeg and once that is done is is a fully confirmed case.”

The man is now in stable condition in isolation. He was admitted to hospital a day after his flight to Toronto. Mayor John Tory said health officials say the risk to the public is low.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-canada-hospital-confirms-first-case-of-virus/article30656727.ece
75,2020/01/26,China scrambles to contain spread of virus,"The ability of the new coronavirus to spread is strengthening and infections could continue to rise, China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday, with more than 2,000 people in China infected and 56 killed by the disease.

Health officials around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic after a handful of cases of infection were reported outside China, including in Thailand, Australia, the U.S. and France.

The Mayor of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, said he expected 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals.

The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Virus gains strength

SARS was a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.

“According to recent clinical information, the virus’ ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,” Mr. Ma told reporters.

The Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese travelling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.

Mr. Ma said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events.

The country may extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a meeting hosted by Chinese premier Li Keqiang.

The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases.

The World Health Organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.

Chinese President Xi Jinping described the situation as ”grave” on Saturday.

China confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT) on January 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

Health officials in Orange County, California, reported that a third case had been registered in the United States in a traveller from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.

On Saturday, Canada declared a first “presumptive” confirmed case in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. Australia confirmed its first four cases.

No fatalities have been reported outside China.

On Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.

Snakes, peacocks, crocodiles and other species can also be found for sale via Taobao, an e-commerce website run by Alibaba.

The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.

U.S. plans evacuation

The U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan.

The outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.

Health authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.

Beijing also postponed the reopening of the city’s schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to February 17.

China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the SARS virus eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak.

“People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,” said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.

Illustrating the extend of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said.

Many cinemas across China were closed with major film premieres postponed.

Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Costa Cruises said they had cancelled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before February 2.

Hong Kong Disneyland and the city’s Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the holiday period, has already closed.

Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.

77,2020/01/26,Israeli aircrafts strike Gaza sites after Hamas allegedly launches incendiary balloons,"Israeli aircrafts struck several sites for Gaza militants late Saturday in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave.

The Israeli military said the sites belonged to Hamas, the Islamic group ruling the territory, and included weapons manufacturing and intelligence-gathering facilities. There were no reports of injuries from the airstrikes in southern Gaza Strip.

Blaming Hamas, the military said it considers “any kind of terror activity with great severity and will continue operating as necessary against attempts to harm its civilians.” Palestinian groups resumed launching flammable balloons on Israel recently and Hamas said it’s encouraging the shootings, charging Israel of not honouring an unofficial truce meant to improve the economy of the narrow enclave.

Protests halted at fence

In trying to bolster the Egyptian and U.N.-mediated truce, Hamas halted the regular weekly protests along Gaza-Israel fence last month.

Earlier this week, a senior Hamas official said the balloons were a signal to Israel to accelerate the informal “understandings” meant to ease the crippling blockade on Gaza. The official, Khalil Al-Hayya, said the balloons were being launched by disgruntled individuals, not Hamas. But he said his group was “satisfied” with the launches and is ready to send more “if the occupation doesn’t pick up the message.”

Mr. Al-Hayya said Hamas expects Israel to allow in more medical supplies, unlimited trade between Gaza and the world, help create more jobs and extend Qatari payments for electricity and poor families. Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade when Hamas, viewed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and most of the West, rose to power in a violent takeover in 2007.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/7sckil/article30656693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th26gazaincendiaryjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-aircraft-strike-gaza-sites-after-hamas-allegedly-launches-incendiary-balloons/article30656685.ece
78,2020/01/26,Trump’s team begin impeachment defence in rare Saturday session of the Senate,"President Donald Trump’s lawyers on Saturday argued a robust version of one of his favourite phrases to tweet- “Read the transcript!”

It was the first day of defence arguments in President Trump’s impeachment trial as the Senate gathered for two quick hours in a rare Saturday session. The White House lawyers had said it would be a “sneak preview” of their defence, continuing Monday, and they spent the morning rebutting the House impeachment managers’ arguments by charging that they were politically motivated.

To begin, they read parts of a rough transcript of a July call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the heart of the House impeachment case. While Democrats point to the conversation as a prime reason to remove the President, the White House lawyers say it points to his innocence. Mr. Trump often tweets, sometimes in all caps, that people should read the transcript in an effort to clear himself.

The call transcript

The House is charging that Mr. Trump abused power in a broad campaign to push Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. They point to the July call, in which Mr. Trump asked Zelenskiy to probe Biden. At the time, the President had ordered the U.S. to withhold military aid from Ukraine.

The defence argued that there’s no evidence that the military aid was a “quid pro quo” for the investigations. They said Mr. Trump was concerned about general corruption in the country and noted he eventually released the aid. Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura argued that everyone knows that when the President asked Mr. Zelenskiy to “do us a favour,” he meant the U.S., not himself. Democrats have disagreed and said he didn’t release the aid until he “got caught.”

The defence lawyers said the House managers didn’t know what Mr. Trump’s motivations were.

Different styles, substance

The President’s defense team used just two hours of the senators’ time on and promised not to run out the 24-hour clock allotted for the days ahead the way House Democrats nearly did prosecuting the case.

The White House team also displayed quick-cut video presentations on the Senate’s overhead screens, turning soundbites from key players in the impeachment case into fast-snapping clips. It all seemed to command the attention of senators, likely a welcome change of pace for those who had grown tired of the prosecution’s long and often repetitive presentations.

Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow gave his word to the senators, “We’re not going to play the same clips seven times.” That prompted smiles from some senators. The President’s team arrayed in the well of the chamber also looked different than the House managers — defending Mr. Trump were four white men. One woman, attorney Pam Bondi, is also on the team. The seven-person House manager team reflected a cross section of America that included women and people of color.

On Saturday the counsel’s table was without its TV-famous lawyers, Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr, who have yet to appear before the Senate but are expected on Monday.

Focus on Schiff

In arguing that the Democrats’ case is politically motivated, the White House lawyers focused on the person who has been at the head of the inquiry — lead impeachment manager and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

As part of their presentation, they played video of one of Mr. Schiff’s opening statements during a hearing early in the impeachment probe. In the statement, he parodied Mr. Trump’s push for the investigations, comparing it to a mafia shakedown. Republicans, and Mr. Trump in particular, have focused on the monologue and said Mr. Schiff made up a conversation that didn’t exist.

Mr. Schiff, in the chamber as as a prosecutor in the impeachment trial, looked straight ahead as they played the video, sitting just feet from the lawyers. The lawyers also played video of Mr. Schiff saying early in the investigation that the Intelligence Committee hadn’t had any contact with the whistleblower who first revealed the call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian President. In fact, the whistleblower had talked to committee staff. Mr. Schiff later said he should have been clearer in his comments.

After the session adjourned , Mr. Schiff said the defence was employing an old courtroom trick. “When your client is guilty, when your client is dead to rights, you don’t want to talk about your client, you want to attack the prosecution,” he said.

Not quite high fives, but handshakes

As the Senate adjourned, several Republican senators, some closely allied with the President, made their way to the defence counsel’s table to shake their hands. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Barrasso of Wyoming and Mike Lee of Utah stopped by.

Mr. Sekulow and Mr. Purpura walked through an aisle greeting more senators as the cameras shut off, including John Thune of South Dakota. Sekulow also checked in with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jim Risch of Idaho.

One GOP senator mentioned in the impeachment inquiry Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, engaged for several minutes in conversation with the counsel team. Last year, Johnson attended Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s inauguration with other U.S. officials and was cited in the House proceedings as having discussed the Ukraine situation with Trump.

The Trump team’s outreach did have some bipartisan moments. At one point, White House counsel Pat Cipollone chatted extensively with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and later appeared to be lingering to say hello to Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic presidential candidate.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/2zw0lk/article30656341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OC80Ejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-team-of-lawyers-begin-impeachment-defence-in-rare-saturday-session-of-the-senate/article30656269.ece
79,2020/01/26,Trump’s Middle East peace plan will be historic: Netanyahu,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said he expected U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the Middle East to be “historic” ahead of a trip to Washington.

“An opportunity such as this comes once in history and cannot be missed...I am full of hope that we are on the verge of a historic moment in the annals of our state,” Mr. Netanyahu, who has been invited to meet Mr. Trump at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the plan, said in a statement.

President Trump on Thursday said he will release his long-delayed plan before meeting Mr. Netanyahu in Washington. “It’s a great plan. It’s a plan that really would work,” he said. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s political rival Benny Gantz has also received an invitation to attend the White House talks. Mr. Gantz told a news conference in Tel Aviv on Saturday that the “peace plan devised by President Trump will go down in history as a meaningful landmark”.

He expected the initiative to allow “different players in the Middle East to finally move ahead towards an historic regional agreement”. The Palestinian leadership was not invited and has already rejected Mr. Trump’s plan amid tense relations with the U.S. President over his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital.

“This step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the U.S. Administration has done so far, particularly the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,” Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas’ spokesman said in a statement earlier this week. The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future State and believe that President Trump’s plan buries the two-State solution that has been for decades the cornerstone of international Middle East diplomacy.

World powers have long agreed that Jerusalem’s fate should be settled through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

Israel’s ‘greatest friend’

Israel has occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War. More than 600,000 Israelis now live there in settlements considered illegal under international law.

President Trump’s peace plan has been in the works since 2017. An economic part of the initiative was unveiled in June and calls for $50 billion in international investment in the Palestinian territories and neighbouring Arab countries over 10 years. Mr. Trump came to power in 2017 promising to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, which he labelled the “ultimate deal”.

The U.S. President has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. Mr. Netanyahu on Saturday again called him “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had”.

“For three years, I have spoken with President Trump and his staff about our most vital national and security needs, which must be included in any diplomatic arrangement. I have found an attentive ear in the White House to these needs,” the Prime Minister said in his statement.

All-round praise

Mr. Gantz also showered Trump with praise during his news conference. “The United States is Israel’s closest ally and friend and under President Trump’s leadership, the alliance between Israel and the United States has grown stronger, deeper and more significant than ever,” he said.

“I wish to thank President Trump for his dedication and determination in defending the security interests that both Israel and the U.S. share,” he said, adding that he will meet the U.S. president on Monday.

Mr. Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu and Gantz comes a little more than a month before new Israeli elections, with polls showing Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party neck-and-neck.

Israeli media speculated that Trump had chosen to announce the event in support of Netanyahu's election bid -- the third in a year.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n7oy98/article30655465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANSUSA-26jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-middle-east-peace-plan-will-be-historic-netanyahu/article30655386.ece
80,2020/01/26,Boeing’s new long-haul 777X airliner undergoes first test flight,"Boeing’s new long-haul 777X airliner made its first flight on Saturday, a step forward for the company whose broader prospects remain clouded by the 737 MAX crisis.

The plane took off from a rain-slicked runway a few minutes after 10:00 am local time (1800 GMT), at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, home to Boeing’s manufacturing site in the northwestern United States. Weather conditions had already twice delayed the inaugural take-off of the plane, which sports blue and white company colours and is emblazoned with the Boeing name.

High winds led to its postponement on Friday, and the company blamed weather for an earlier delay on Thursday, which was rainy.

“Yes!” shouted Boeing spokesman Josh Green as the plane’s wheels finally lifted off the tarmac as its two powerful engines sent up huge clouds of mist. Minutes earlier, the pilots had deployed the plane’s winglets — folding wing tips — designed to improve the craft’s fuel efficiency and make it possible for the plane, with the widest wing span ever from Boeing, to be accommodated at more airports.

The 777X quickly disappeared into the clouds; after a flight lasting several hours, it was to land later at Boeing Field in a Seattle suburb, some 30 miles (50km) to the south. The 777X was originally to take to the skies for the first time in mid-2019, but that was postponed due to problems with the new engine, manufactured by General Electric, and difficulties with the wings and software.

Saturday’s flight was to be the first of a series of in-flight tests. If they go well, Boeing will officially file for approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

With Boeing facing a crisis over its top-selling 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, the 777X is supposed to compete in the long-haul aircraft market with the A350 made by rival European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Major airlines including Emirates, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways have placed some 340 orders for the 777X.

The first deliveries of the new model, with maximum capacities of 384 to 426 passengers depending on the configuration, are not expected before early 2021, instead of mid-2020 as initially planned. The aircraft encountered significant problems during pressurization tests in September.

Business down

Boeing’s business has also been weakened by a lack of firm orders from Chinese airlines for its 787 Dreamliner, which is expected to see production cuts. The 777X has a range of 16,200 to 13,500 km depending on its configuration and the number of passengers aboard, according to the Boeing website. It is also extremely fuel-efficient, an important consideration at a time when passengers are increasingly concerned about carbon emissions.

Its list price is between $410 million to $442 million, though customers often negotiate discounts. U.S. Air Safety Regulators could clear the 737 MAX to return to service before mid-year, a person close to the process said Friday. The plane has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes, in Ethiopia and Indonesia. On Tuesday, Boeing announced that it did not expect to win regulatory approval until mid-2020.

Boeing suspended production of the MAX this month but Chief Executive David Calhoun said this week the company plans to begin ramping up production of the model in anticipation of winning regulatory approval to restart service. He began as CEO earlier in January following the ouster of Dennis Muilenburg, who tenure was rocked by the MAX crisis which led to deteriorating relations between the company and the FAA.

Mr. Calhoun aims to turn the company around, and has highlighted restoring Boeing’s reputation with regulators, customers and other stakeholders as an imperative.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/kqs6ye/article30655532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26janth777xjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/boeings-new-long-haul-777x-airliner-undergoes-first-test-flight/article30655530.ece
81,2020/01/26,U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?,"The story so far: The first set of elections in the Democratic Party contest in the United States to decide the Opposition party’s presidential nomination is all set to take off in Iowa on February 3. What began as a crowded set of contestants has whittled down to close to half-a-dozen realistic hopefuls. Former Vice-President Joe Biden leads in nation-wide opinion polls, but rivals Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Mayor (of South Bend) Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and insurgent candidate and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are in contention. On the Republican side, U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-nomination is a foregone conclusion as several States have already cancelled their primaries and caucuses, with the lack of a credible contestant. Other smaller parties in the U.S., the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, also hold primaries for their presidential nominees, but the party system is dominated by the Big Two: the Democrats and the Grand Old Party. A look at how the primaries work and what the process is to nominate the presidential candidate.

What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

The Democratic presidential primaries (including caucuses) are a series of electoral contests to decide the party’s nominee for President. These are held over four months, beginning February 3 and ending on June 6, 2020. The contests are held in each State among the 50 in the United States, besides five U.S. held territories and Democrats Abroad (expatriate U.S. citizens), and conclude with the nomination of delegates from these constituencies for the candidates. These delegates will then represent the candidate in the Democratic National Convention (DNC) scheduled to be held at Milwaukee, Wisconsin between July 13-16, 2020. The delegates would, by pledged votes, elect the Democratic Presidential nominee. The candidate who wins a majority of the approximately 3,979 delegates overall, is declared as the nominee. Apart from these nominated delegates from the election process, the Democratic Party, through its leadership (elected members of the Democratic National Committee among others) and elected officials (Congressional representatives, Governors and distinguished party leaders), also appoints 771 superdelegates. This has been part of the Democratic nomination process since 1984 . These unattached superdelegates, prior to the ongoing primaries, were allowed to freely vote for any candidate in the first ballot at the DNC.

Following complaints about the undue influence of these unelected delegates from the State primaries, the Democratic National Committee changed the rules in August 2018 and limited the influence of superdelegates. They are now prevented to vote on the first ballot and could vote only in a contested nomination, i.e. in a situation where no candidate enjoys a clear majority after the first ballot. Superdelegates are, however, allowed to publicly endorse a candidate of their choice before or during the convention.

When and where do the primaries began?

Traditionally, the first electoral contest in the presidential primaries for both the Republican and the Democratic parties have been held at Iowa, situated in the American mid-west region. This time the Iowa caucus for the Democratic party is set to be conducted on February 3. Despite a relatively low population and an electorate that is not entirely representative of the Democrats’ countrywide base, the strong media attention and the kick-off factor catapult the Iowa caucus into a measuring stick for the candidates in the fray.

Iowa contributes 41 pledged delegates overall and is followed by the New Hampshire primary that is to be held on February 11. The important day to look out for during the primaries is March 3 (Super Tuesday) when 14 States and one Territory and Democrats Abroad (for a total of 1,357 delegates) go to the polls. Normally by Super Tuesday, the fringe candidates would be out of the fray. The other key day of contests is April 28, featuring primary elections to six States and for a total of 663 delegates. The clear front-runner leading up to the convention could already be decided by the end of these primaries.

What is the difference between a primary and a caucus?

Primary elections are conducted by State/local governments, while caucuses are get-togethers/events that are run by the political parties themselves. Primary elections feature a secret ballot, where registered voters (affiliated to the parties) register their ballot and leave. Caucuses on the other hand involve the physical presence of voters who conduct debates and discussions among themselves and then divide themselves on the basis of their support to candidates. The allocation of delegates is done based on the relative support for the candidates.

Primary elections and caucuses can be “open” wherein any registered voter, irrespective of party affiliation can vote in the contest, while in closed primaries only voters registered and affiliated with a particular party are allowed to vote. Among the Democratic candidates, Senator Sanders is expected to do better in the more discursive caucuses due to a stronger and more dedicated activist base. This advantage is relatively nullified in closed primaries where candidates are required only for voters to turn out and register their votes.

How are delegates awarded?

In the Democratic elections, delegates are awarded in proportion to the votes garnered by the candidates in primary elections and relative strengths of presence/support registered in caucuses. Among Republicans, however, some States have a “winner-takes-all” proviso that allows for candidates to reap in all the delegates if they win a majority of the votes.

What differentiates the candidates who are in the Democratic fray?

The Democratic Party, ever since Senator Sanders’ candidacy in 2016, has had a clear left pole in contestation with its dominant and party elites’ supported centrist wing. Mr. Biden is seen as a liberal Democrat cut from the centrist strains of the Barack Obama presidency. Senators Sanders and Warren have similar leftist positions on redistribution, welfare, taxation and labour. However Mr. Sanders identifies himself as a “democratic socialist”, while Ms. Warren has a Keynesian economic outlook who believes in a regulated and a humane form of capitalism. The openly gay ex-Mayor Buttigieg has sought to appeal to working class voters through liberal positions and his persona as a young go-getter while Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Bloomberg have sought to take on the leftists with a more free-market oriented ideological approach. All the candidates generally agree on social issues (abortion rights, gender equity, same sex marriage among others) and other topics such as climate change. This distinguishes them sharply with the Republican Party which is today, dominated by a socially conservative and populist base that has crystallised into support for Mr. Trump.

How are the candidates judged?

U.S. voters tend to evaluate presidential candidates over a number of qualities: ideological positions on various issues, persona, experience or freshness and other leadership traits. The widely televised presidential primary debates (followed by the presidential debates after nominations are secured) allow voters to slice and dice information on candidates on these qualities. The Democratic National Committee has provided for a total of 12 primary debates, seven of which have already been held so far. Candidates who win a substantive number of delegates in the early polls, and have a strong war chest due to donations (in the case of the Democrats, much of the fund raising is through grassroots crowdfunding) or in the case of Mr. Bloomberg, his personal wealth; are expected to stay longer in the fray.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pxvxmy/article30654818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NP865,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-2020-what-are-the-democratic-presidential-primaries-all-about/article30654822.ece
82,2020/01/26,"Save AFT Mill, ex-MP urges Amit Shah","Former MP M. Ramadass has sought the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to avert close down of AFT Mills and instead revive the legacy enterprise.

In a letter, Mr. Ramadass said the Anglo French Textile Mill (AFT), a 135 year old prominent public sector textile mill which has been a pillar and pride of Puducherry, was in doldrums because of multiple factors of maladministration and technical and financial mismanagement over the years.

It appears that both the Administrator and the Cabinet of Puducherry were unanimous in ending rather than mending the ways of the mill, their only difference of opinion pertaining to the modus operandi of closure — the Cabinet through voluntary retirement scheme and the Administrator through direct closure and paying the compensation to workers as stipulated under sub section (1) of Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. This necessitated a reference to the Home Ministry for a final decision on this matter, Mr. Ramadass said.

The closure of the mill would affect the State Domestic Product, productivity, employment, purchasing power and demand for goods and services and ultimately generate a cycle of stagnation.

“At a time when Puducherry’s economy is tottering by the closure of some more private industrial units, GST, stagnant trade and commerce, massive unemployment of the educated and lack of purchasing power, closure of AFT would only add insult to injury and the public welfare would be greatly at stake,” the former MP said. It was easy for any government to close but impossible to create a magnificent structure like this by any government in future. The duty of an elected government was not to organise closing ceremonies but to augment the productive potential of the State, he said.

Mr. Ramadass appealed to the Home Minister to allow the continuance of the mill with a package of well conceived short and long term measures This decision would be in conformity with the Make in India and Skill India Schemes of the Prime Minister and produce a cycle of prosperity replacing the cycle of stagnation.

Mr. Ramadass said the decision to close down this mill was based on the recommendation of Vijayan Committee Report which was flawed in certain respects, he contended. The report had mostly concentrated on the weaknesses of the mill relegating its vital strengths to the backyard and failed to make SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats ) analysis of the mill to arrive at its recommendation and conclusion.

‘A great opportunity’

Another opportunity of great economic significance would emerge if the five textile related mills in the government/ cooperative sector of Puducherry (Jayaprakash Narayana mills in Karaikal, Spinco, Swadeshi, Bharathi and AFT in Puducherry) were integrated under one corporation along with the associated cotton farm at Karaikal under the supervision of Agricultural College.

86,2020/01/26,Republic Day address: Kerala Governor says India has always sheltered persecuted people of the world,"At a time when the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) has drawn fire from all sides, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on January 26 said India had always sheltered persecuted people of the world.

In his Republic Day speech at the Central Stadium here, the Governor said the concept of Indianness was rooted in diversity which implied both respect and acceptance of variety. “It is in this acceptance of diversity that India has always sheltered the persecuted people of the world,’’ he said.

All citizens, the Governor said, were duty-bound to respect and strictly follow the Constitution with faith in the Gandhian thought that the true source of rights was duty. “The founding fathers of our nation considered democracy a sacred trust and so they adopted a Constitution that fully reflects the eternal Indian ethos, values and traditions,’’ he said.

Lauds govt. initiatives

In his speech, the Governor also lauded the development initiatives undertaken by the Pinarayi Vijayan government.

Kerala had achieved the promise of significant investments at the recently-organised Loka Kerala Sabha. The State’s top position in the Sustainable Development Goal index and its achievements in the health sector needed special mention. Kerala also offered the most liberal terms to entrepreneurs which had energised its start-up ecosystem, he said.

The real sweetness of Kerala’s achievements, however, lies in the gravity of the adversities that it faced in the past two years, he said. “With a rare spirit of oneness we overcame those hurdles with a courage and grace that reflected the trust character of Kerala society,” Mr. Khan said.

On his arrival, the Governor unfurled the national flag and inspected the parade commanded by Squadron Leader Bikram Singha of the Indian Air Force. Major Rishav Jamwal of the 13th Battalion, the Garhwal Rifles, Indian Army, was second-in-command.

Armed and unarmed units, mounted police and Army and police bands took part in the parade.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, senior officials of the State government, the Southern Air Command and Military Station, Pangode, were present.

90,2020/01/26,Regularisation of illegal buildings gets unearthed,"In surprise checks conducted at various locations in the city on Saturday, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) found that officials in the revenue and town planning sections of the city Corporation had allowed regularisation of constructions without following the norms.

The Vishwaroopa auditorium, occupying an area of 3,250 sq ft in Attukal was found to be built on land marked as wetland. The permit was obtained initially for a residential construction. During construction, the area of the building went beyond the area shown in the submitted plan. The revised plan was later cleared by the Assistant Executive Engineer.

The S.P Super market at Thaliyil in Karamana was similarly provided a permit for construction of a 1,200 square feet building. However, the 3,500 sq ft building which was constructed was later regularised without considering distance from the road or without adequate parking facilities.

The Vinayaka Store in Kalady was found to be violating norms regarding minimum distance from the road. The file regarding this construction was found to be missing from the city Corporation. The Vijayalekshmi textiles in East Fort was built without permit in a land marked as paddy land in the basic tax register.

Jutting to road

The top floors of the Anjali apartments at Maruthoorkadavu were found to be jutting into the road, against the building norms. The Vigilance is currently looking into the files to check whether the building, located near the Karamana river, is violating the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/regularisation-of-illegalbuildings-gets-unearthed/article30654942.ece
91,2020/01/26,Euro League | Inter Milan held again,"Second-placed Inter Milan was held to a third successive 1-1 draw after Radja Nainggolan, a player it loaned to Cagliari for this season, scored a second-half equaliser for the Sardinian side in their Serie A match on Sunday.

The Belgian, who was told by Inter coach Antonio Conte that there was no place for him this season, drove in a low shot from outside the area which took a deflection off a defender to stun the San Siro in the 78th minute.

Lautaro Martinez had headed Inter in front in the 29th minute from a cross by debutant Ashley Young, amid furious protests from Cagliari, which said the Argentine forward had pushed his marker. There was a two-minute delay before VAR officials confirmed the goal.

Furious reaction

Martinez was sent off in stoppage time for his furious reaction after being given a yellow card for a foul and had to be ushered away by team mates as he continued to remonstrate with the referee.

Inter has 48 points from 21 games.

Josip Ilicic hit a hat-trick, including a sensational strike from the halfway line, as Atalanta crushed Torino 7-0 in Serie A on Saturday, inflicting the worst home defeat ever on its northern rivals which finished the match with nine men.

Dismal

Atletico Madrid missed the chance to close the gap on La Liga pacesetters Real Madrid and Barcelona on Sunday with a dismal goalless draw at home against 19th-placed struggler Leganes.

Atleti went into the game on the back of a chastening league defeat to Eibar and a Copa del Rey loss to third division Cultural Leonesa, but the home crowd still showed loud support for coach Diego Simeone at the start of Sunday’s game.

There was little to cheer about as the match progressed, however, as the side struggled to create any real chances and had to rely on two impressive saves from goalkeeper Jan Oblak to prevent Leganes from taking the lead.

Deficit slashed

Robert Lewandowski hit his 21st league goal of the season as Bayern Munich thrashed Schalke 5-0 to cut RB Leipzig’s lead at the top of the Bundesliga to one point on Saturday.

After Leipzig had crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern seized the chance to trim the advantage with an emphatic win over David Wagner’s young Schalke side.

Stability

“The Leipzig match beforehand didn’t interest me, the main thing is we took three points and had a stability in our game which is very important,” said Bayern coach Hansi Flick.

Lewandowski and Thomas Muller scored first-half goals, then both had efforts disallowed for offside by VAR.

However, Leon Goretzka, Thiago Alcantara and Serge Gnabry netted second-half strikes as Bayern dominated at the Allianz Arena.

The results: La Liga: Atletico Madrid 0 drew with Leganes 0.

Serie A: Inter Milan 1 (Martinez 29) drew with Cagliari 1 (Nainggolan 78).

Saturday: Serie A: Fiorentina 0 drew with Genoa 0; Torino 0 lost to Atalanta 7 (Ilicic 17, 53, 54, Gosens 29, Zapata 45+1-pen, Muriel 86-pen, 88); SPAL 1 (Petagna 23-pen) lost to Bologna 3 (Vicari 24-og, Barrow 59, Poli 63).

92,2020/01/26,Sabitra strikes Gokulam’s winner,"Sabitra Bhandari’s 67th minute strike proved the difference as Gokulam Kerala FC opened its Hero Indian Women’s League campaign on a winning note with a 1-0 defeat of Sreebhumi FC at the Football Stadium here on Sunday. Sreebhumi goalie Rumpa Malik’s failure to collect the ball cleanly cost her team dear as Sabitra slotted in the stray ball from close range.

The scoreline, though, didn’t reflect Gokulam’s dominance adequately. Sreebhumi players had their backs to the wall almost for the entirety of the match as Gokulam poured forward almost at will. Gokulam even rattled the woodwork on multiple occasions, but the forward players’ profligacy meant that it had just one goal to show.

In the day’s other match, Satyabati Khadia’s brace helped Bangalore United FC register a 2-1 win over Bidesh XI SC. The opening goal in the 22nd minute was a deft chip over the Bidesh goalie Astrid Savia before Satyabati doubled the lead on the hour mark when Savia fumbled a long ball and the forward made no mistake in bundling it into the empty net.

The results: Gokulam Kerala FC 1 (Sabitra Bhandari 67) bt Sreebhumi FC 0; Bangalore United FC 2 (Satyabati Khadia 22, 59) bt Bidesh XI SC 1 (Susmita Jadhav 86).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/nejhv1/article30658812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27women,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sabitra-strikes-gokulams-winner/article30658813.ece
93,2020/01/26,Indian Overseas Bank seeks to focus on MSMEs,"Indian Overseas Bank would step up advances to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), said Karnam Sekar, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, here on Saturday.

Till last year, IOB had sanctioned loans for 7,423 MSMEs, and with the outreach programme, it would only increase. Nearly 400 IOB employees had undergone special training to understand the needs of MSMEs and would be posted at branches to facilitate the process, he said, speaking at the MSME Support and Outreach Programme organised here on Saturday.

“Thirty-two branches in Tamil Nadu, in areas identified as MSME-intensive, will process applications and sanction loans within two hours,” he said. The bank also offered loans to individuals and MSMEs within an hour through psbloansin59minutes.com, a fully-online initiative to ease access to credit by public sector banks, he added. Mr. Sekar urged the MSMEs to avail themselves of the schemes offered by the State and Central governments.

Collector S. Sivarasu handed over loans amounting to ₹26 crore to 259 MSMEs on the occasion. “There are 444 bank branches in the district. IOB has 63 branches. In the year 2018-19, the loans advanced by IOB in Tiruchi district was ₹102 crore. This year, the amount has already crossed ₹25 crore. Applicants can approach a bank branch with the required documents and have loans sanctioned easily,” he said. The District Industries Centre at the Tiruchi Collectorate could be approached for guidance, he added.

Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Mr. Sekar said, “It is our duty to support the MSMEs so that they can contribute to the economy of our country,” he said.

IOB was able to restructure nearly 30,000 loan accounts, with approval from the Reserve Bank of India. “We will now identify customers with potential non-performing assets, discuss with them on a case-by-case basis. The period of the loan and the interest rate can be extended,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/icorv/article30655556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TYCITY-IOB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/iob-seeks-to-focus-on-msmes/article30655557.ece

Over 5,000 people took part in the march from Uzhavar Sandhai to Tiruchi Collectorate where a public meeting was held. Speaking at the meeting, TNTJ general secretary E. Mohammed strongly condemned the CAA.

“There are people protesting at West Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya, New Delhi and even in Chennai. We are here to show our support with our brothers and sisters across the country and demand the discriminatory Act’s withdrawal,” he said.

Thanjavur

Members of TNTJ staged demonstrations in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur on Saturday demanding the withdrawal of CAA and not to implement NRC and NPR.

The demonstrators led by the local leaders of the TNTJ at the respective places raised slogans condemning the Union government and claimed that the implementation of NRC and NPR would divide the people on the lines of religion.

At the end of the demonstration, a team of TNTJ leaders were allowed to proceed to the Collectorates at Thanjavur and Tiruvarur for submitting a memorandum.

The TNTJ organised a rally in Nagapattinam to demand the revocation of the CAA in which thousands of members and supporters took part.

The DMK, he said, would not allow implementation of the hydrocarbon project in the Cauvery delta as it threatened the livelihood of farmers.

He criticised the Centre's decision to do away with the environmental clearance for offshore and onshore exploratory drilling and flayed the State government for failing to protect the interests of farmers.

At Anna Nagar Link Road located alongside District Magistrate Court, the median will be reconstructed and raised to a height of 2.5 feet, a Corporation official said.

Important arterial roads

“The road is an important arterial road which connects Lawsons Road, Collectors Office Road and Cantonment. With the Uyyakondan Canal on one side and the court on the other, it offers a picturesque drive.

However, the median does not add to the aesthetics. We have planned to reconstruct it on the lines of the median on Bharathidasan Salai near Corporation office,” the official said.

₹38 lakh allotted

A sum of ₹38 lakh had been allotted for the work which includes reconstruction of the median and basic amenities. The plan for beautification and planting of flowering and non-flowering saplings along the median will be done after the construction is completed, the official said. “Small medians are dangerous for vehicles, especially at night. This road witnesses movement of several private and government long-distance buses at night,” he said. “Another reason for the increase in height is to avoid cattle from eating the plants and to avoid pedestrians and two-wheelers from crossing,” he added.

The work on planting saplings along the previously reconstructed median on Pudukottai Road has also begun.

Flowering plants and saplings of ornamental trees are being planted at a cost of ₹35 lakh along the stretch which connects the city with Tiruchi airport and neighbouring Pudukottai district.

104,2020/01/26,Ask Us,"Q. My daughter is 22, single and has just started earning ₹60,000 per month. She is currently saving ₹5,000 a month via a recurring deposit and ₹12,500 a month in provident fund. Her expenses are about ₹9,500 a month and variable expenses, a maximum of ₹5,500 a month. She neither has any other savings, nor does she have any financial commitments. She has a surplus of ₹25,000 a month. Please advise as to how and where to invest, to maximise her returns and minimise her tax commitments. She is covered under her company’s group health insurance as well as the family health insurance I have. She does not have any life/accident insurance cover. She plans to get married after three years.

Pattabiraman

A. Since your daughter appears to have exhausted the Section 80C tax-saving limit, there is no need for any other tax-saving options at this juncture. Instead of focussing on taxes, let her optimise on returns. Given that she is starting young, it is good to get exposed to mutual funds early on. Let the recurring deposit and the provident fund investments be treated as her debt options. She can consider investing ₹10,000 in an equity index fund, ₹5,000 in a multi-cap fund, ₹5,000 in a quality mid-cap fund and ₹5,000 in a U.S.-based international fund. This portfolio is for long-term investing and needs at least a 7-year time frame of holding. Hence avoid redeeming this for wedding-related expense as much as possible. Set up a separate portfolio, if needed, by reducing the amount invested in this long-term portfolio and increase her savings in the recurring deposit if the purpose is to save for her wedding.

Please make sure she gets involved in her finances and manages it. If she has further surplus, she can invest in liquid funds and keep it as an emergency fund for any of her expenses or even for her wedding expenses. She can consider a term plan when her family is dependent on her income.

Q. I am 20 years old. I have a small surplus of ₹500 per month. How and where can I invest this money for some good returns?

Vivek Singh

A. It is good to know that you wish to invest early on. Please do look at these investments as long-term wealth creators and not for short-term quick gains. Consider starting an SIP in a consistent multi-cap fund. Ask your adviser (or do it yourself) for steady performers and not just top performers. As your savings increase, add two-three funds with different strategies.

Q. I am 52 years of age and work in an insurance company. My savings under Sec. 80C is more than ₹2.15 lakh, which is about ₹65,000 over the exemption limit of ₹1.50 lakh. So, each month it is more than ₹5,000. Can I invest this excess amount in a mutual fund or SIP so that I get a decent amount on my retirement? I have enough exemption under other tax-saving sections. I have a son who is studying in sixth semester BE. Except for education and marriage expenses, I have no other obligations. Please guide me.

T.P.N. MURTHY

A. If you decide to earmark this amount for retirement, consider a 60:40, equity:debt approach. I am suggesting debt despite your exposure to provident fund just to provide some cushion to the equity component in your portfolio. Start SIPs in the above proportion in a consistent multi-cap fund (40%), a slightly aggressive large and mid-cap fund (20%) a high-quality, low credit risk, short-duration fund (20%) and a corporate bond fund (20%). Please give this portfolio at least 5-6 years and gradually move to low-risk options such as senior citizens’ scheme and deposits once you hit retirement and need regular income. Set aside other surplus for any other corpus or surplus for your son’s education or marriage and avoid digging into your retirement corpus.

106,2020/01/26,"Padma Bhushan to Jamir, Baig reveals govt. thinking","The process of selection of Padma awardees has been rejigged in the past six years to make it less Delhi-centric and more inclusive of the silent, below-the-radar social workers and activists; but within this list, there is always a political messaging that cannot be missed.

If last year, former President Pranab Mukherjee was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, this year, another Congress stalwart, former Nagaland Chief Minister S.C. Jamir, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Muzaffar Baig have found their way to the Padma Bhushan list.

Mr. Jamir had been the Governor of Maharashtra and Odisha and had held the additional charge of Goa and Gujarat. He was one of the few Governors appointed during the United Progressive Alliance era to continue after the first Narendra Modi government came to power.

His Raj Bhavan stint, government sources say, brought him close to the then Gujarat Chief Minister, Mr. Modi, who appreciated his grasp of statecraft.

“In 2015, during the Naga Accord talks, there was some consultation with Mr. Jamir,” a source said. During the BJP’s national executive in Bhubhaneswar in April 2017, Mr. Modi, after calling on Mr. Jamir, who was then the Governor of Odisha, instructed party office-bearers dealing with the northeastern States to meet him.

“Jamir saab handed over a tonne of books on Naga history and asked the BJP functionary to meet him when he travelled next to Delhi,” a source said. The exchange underlined Mr. Modi’s deep appreciation of Mr. Jamir’s administrative skills.

Baig and the PDP

Amid the six-month lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir, since the revoking of its special status under Article 370 and the continued imprisonment of three former Chief Ministers, Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, Mr. Baig’s inclusion in the honours list begs a closer look.

Mr. Baig has, for the past month or so, been talking of the need for a new political front in the State, an aim that finds favour with New Delhi. Despite being one of the PDP founders, he went public with this move.

In the long arc of Mr. Baig’s political career, from defending Maqbool Bhat (ideologue of the extremist Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front) to forming a new political front after the dilution of Article 370, the Padma Bhushan signals more about what the government wants to achieve in Jammu and Kashmir — the restart of some political activity but by a cannibalised version of the PDP and the National Conference that will be more interested in “moving on” than lingering on the many vicissitudes of the Kashmir issue.

In an interview to The Hindu, Mr. Baig said the timing of the award should not be related to the current crisis in Jammu and Kashmir, after the revocation of its special status on August 5, 2019. “The Government of India follows a calendar. There is a committee and a process to check the credentials. The award got nothing to do with the timing of the current crisis,” Mr. Baig said.

‘Release leaders’

Terming the Centre’s decision to honour him with the Padma Bhushan “an award in reality for the people of J&K than me,” the former Deputy Chief Minister called for the immediate release of regional leaders, including PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and NC president Farooq Abdullah and vice-president Omar Abdullah, detained since August 5, 2019.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5fdab4/article29825943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Baig,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pdp-patron-muzaffar-hussian-baig-hails-padma-bhushan-says-its-an-award-for-people/article30659954.ece

109,2020/01/26,"European Parliament to vote on Kashmir, Citizenship Amendment Act","Close on the heels of a number of critical international statements and parliamentary resolutions, the government is bracing for six scathing resolutions on both Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, that have been filed by an overwhelming majority of members in the European Parliament.

These will be taken up for discussion and voting this week.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) declined an official comment on the resolutions, which could have a deep impact on ties between India and the European Union.

“We are informed that some members of the EU Parliament intend to move a draft resolution on the CAA. The CAA is a matter that is entirely internal to India. Moreover, this legislation has been adopted by due process and through democratic means after a public debate in both Houses of Parliament,” sources in the government said.

They added that the government hoped that the sponsors of the draft would engage with New Delhi for an “accurate assessment of the facts before they proceed”.

The draft resolutions (numbering from B9-0077/2020 to B9-0082/2020) are due to be taken up during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Brussels on January 29 for discussion (around 6 p.m. local time) and January 30 for a vote.

The European Commission Vice-President/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP) Josep Borell will first deliver a statement on “India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019”, the published plenary agenda says. The EU parliament had discussed developments in Jammu and Kashmir in September 2019, but had not ended in a vote. In October 2019 the government had even facilitated a visit by 22 EU MEPs to Delhi and Srinagar, but the effort doesn’t appear to have had the desired effect on the European Parliament.

The current resolutions, each of which is worded slightly differently and focuses mainly on the CAA, will be introduced by six different political groups representing a total of 626 of the total 751 members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

The resolutions list more than a dozen different counts of actions by the government that are allegedly in violation of international norms and India’s international commitments on Human Rights and at the UN Security Council, including actions in Jammu and Kashmir after the dilution of Article 370, police firing on protestors against the CAA in Uttar Pradesh, reports of “torture during detention” and the potential for creating what it calls the “largest statelessness crisis in the world and cause immense human suffering” through the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Sources said the issues had been discussed when Mr. Borrell met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue conference earlier this month. The sources indicated that a visit by European Union envoys to Jammu and Kashmir, that has been discussed for several weeks, has now been put off until March this year, after the EU-India summit is held on March 13, but didn’t specify reasons for the delay.

In their recommendations to the European Council and to Mr. Borell, the MEP groups have condemned state actions that have resulted in the loss of life of anti-CAA protesters, and called on the government to lift restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir, reconsider the Citizenship Act, “in the spirit of equality and non-discrimination and in the light of its international obligations”, and to “engage with the protestors”.

At present, the CAA grants a fast track for naturalising only persecuted Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, to the exclusion of Muslims, Jews and other minority sects.

“As fellow democracies, the EU Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures in other regions of the world. Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation, contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination. In fact, European societies have followed the same approach,” government sources said in response to the resolutions.

The groups filing the resolutions include the largest group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE) with 182 members, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) with 154 members, the Renew Group with 108 members, as well as slightly smaller groups like the Greens/European Free Alliance (74), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) (66), and the European United Left-Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) (41).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v5csm8/article30659926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JOSEPBORELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/european-parliament-to-vote-on-kashmir-citizenship-amendment-act/article30659927.ece
110,2020/01/26,71st Republic Day: Religious themes dominate State tableaux,"Religious themes dominated State tableaux showcased in the Republic Day parade on Sunday with at least 10 out of the 15 State tableaux carrying such symbolism.

Crowds were kept engaged through the course of the parade, especially with the military showcase, including a debut presentation by an all-women motorcycle stunt team from the CRPF. Aircraft and helicopters cut through a clear sky, keeping necks craned and the audience entertained on a sunny winter morning.

While Punjab based its tableau around the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and his principles, Karnataka based its display on the philosophy of Basaveshwara and his “Anubhava Mantapa”, an ancient socio-religious centre. Uttar Pradesh’s tableau was centered around cultural and religious tourism with a replica of the Dewa Sharif Sufi shrine to represent the composite culture of the State.

Step well

The tableau presented by Gujarat focussed on “Rani ki Vav” a step well with a unique architectural style, said to be the only step well declared a world heritage site by UNESCO, according to a booklet on the Republic Day shared by the government, but also had various images of deities such as Vishnu, Buddha, Kalki and Devi. Odisha’s tableau was themed around Lord Lingaraja’s “Rukuna Ratha Yatara,” Goa’s float carried a replica of the famous Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji, but also had a statue of a large frog holding a guitar as a symbol for its campaign to “save the frogs.”

Himachal Pradesh showcased its version of the Dasara festival or the Kullu Dasara; Telangana showcased a flower festival celebrated in the honour of a patron Goddess of womanhood as well as represented one of the largest tribal religious congregations in the world.

Tamil Nadu highlighted certain folk culture but also presented the statue of Ayyanar a guardian folk deity. Chhattisgarh focused on crafts and ornaments and carried a statue of Nandi, Lord Shiva’s vehicle made of bell metal.

Architecture, crafts

Among States that did not put up any explicitly religious symbolism in their tableaux, included Rajasthan, which displayed its architecture and crafts, Assam which displayed its tradition of bamboo and cane craftsmanship; Madhya Pradesh, which themed its tableau around the Tribal Museum in Bhopal; Meghalaya which showcased its rich environment and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which showcased the “Back to Village” programme started last year.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z5k7hl/article30659905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27ASSAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/71st-republic-day-religious-themes-dominate-state-tableaux/article30659906.ece
111,2020/01/26,Davinder Singh helped Hizb militant for money: official,"Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh provided a safe haven to Hizbul Mujahideen militant Naveed Mushtaq Shah for a “monetary consideration” as the latter wanted to “live longer and escape the police net”, a senior government official told The Hindu.

It was not the first time, however, that Singh had helped Naveed bypass security checks.

In January 2019, Singh drove Naveed in his own vehicle, an SUV, to Jammu. On reaching Jammu, he stayed overnight with the militant.

Also Read Suspended DSP Davinder Singh sent to 15-day NIA custody

“Singh did not want to drive back to Srinagar, so he asked Naveed’s brother to book him an air ticket. His brother (arrested later) booked the ticket online and paid from his own account. This is one of the clinching evidence we have against Singh,” the official said. Later, one of Naveed’s associates drove Singh’s SUV back to Srinagar.

Singh was arrested with Naveed, Rafi Ahmed Rather, another Hizbul terrorist, and Irfan Shafi, a lawyer, on January 11 in South Kashmir's Kulgam. The accused were on their way to Jammu where Naveed's younger brother Syed Irfan Ahmad waited for them. A Ph.D. scholar, Irfan was arrested on January 24 by the J&K police. The case was subsequently transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last week. The five suspects are in the NIA’s custody and are being interrogated in Jammu.

Singh's arrest created a sensation as he was found in the company of Naveed, a former police constable and one of the ‘most wanted terrorists’ in J&K. The police say that Naveed was behind the killing of 11 truck drivers, non-local labourers and apple traders in south Kashmir post the August 5 dilution of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories.

Security cover

“Naveed recruited many young men into Hizbul’s ranks in the past two years. He wanted to replace Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin but he also knew that security forces were on his trail and he could be killed any day in a police encounter. He wanted to survive and this is where Singh helped him in exchange for money,” the official said.

The official said it was Shafi, the lawyer. who was the link between Singh and Naveed. A resident of Shopian, Shafi acted as an “informer” for multiple security agencies in J&K. It was Shafi’s brand new car in which the four suspects were travelling when they were caught.

“Shafi doubled as an agent for both security forces and the terrorists. In the particular case, he was helping Naveed,” said the official.

Singh, who had earlier worked with the Special Operations Group (SOG). was recently transferred to the airport unit where the avenues for corruption were less, the official said.

“To compensate for the lost opportunities at the airport, he agreed to help Naveed. He helped him cover short distances on multiple occasions earlier. He was used to corruption,” said the official.

Naveed, a resident of Shopian’s Nazneenpora deserted the J&K police in 2017. He fled with four rifles from the guard room at a Food Corporation of India facility in Budgam before joining the terrorist rank.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n2h27v/article30659809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27DAVINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/davinder-singh-helped-hizbul-militant-for-money-official/article30659810.ece
112,2020/01/26,AnSI explores ‘the Anthropologist’ Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary,"As part of the commemoration of Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) has dedicated an entire issue of its journal, published last month, on what it calls “Gandhian insights into applied anthropology”.

“There was something for Gandhi to approve of in each ritual posture of the Bengali village,” well known anthropologist and an authority on beliefs and practices of rural Bengal, Ralph W. Nicholas, writes in his essay titlted M K Gandhi N K Bose & Bengali Village Society. Professor Nicholas, also known for his work on Gajan (a rural festival of Bengal), added that the “equality and human community of the Gajan, which had so much in common with a Gandhian yatra, embodied the equality of citizens in the democratic India for which he sacrificed his life”. He goes on to suggest that Gandhi would ‘doubtless have been put off by the spectacle of a modern Durga Puja and the occasional rowdiness of its organisers’ but adds in the same paragraph that the “participation of the entire community in differentiated roles, appropriate to their castes, spelled out in ritual” resembled the healthy society that Gandhi visualised.

“So far, Gamdhi’s writings, teaching and life has been the subject of interest of historians and political scientists but a closer look will point out that Gandhi and his life has been centred in anthropology ,” said V. K. Srivastava, director of AnSI and the editor of the journal.

Dr. Srivastava added that the journal had 10 essays dedicated to Gandhian thoughts from the perspective of anthropology. Besides Professor Nichlolas’s essay, there are essays by David R. Syiemlieh, historian and former Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission of India, titled Mahatma Gandhi and North East India, Gandhi and the Nagas by G. Kanato Chophy, Nisargopchar Ashram: Gandhi’s Legacy and Public Health in Contemporary India by Joseph S. Alter, Tribe and Tribal Welfare in Gandhian Thoughts by Kakali Chakrabarty and On Gandhi and Sanitation by P. C. Joshi and Prashant Khattri among others.

In his essay, Prof. Syiemlieh points out, “Gandhi was not the only national figure during this phase who visited the North East, but his direction and call was stirring and had a lasting effect more so in the impact his messages had on the Gandhian way of life practised by many in the region”. The essay also highlights the advice Gandhi gave to Angami Zapu Phizo and other Naga leaders who called on him in Delhi on 19 July 1947. “I believe in the brotherhood of man but I do not believe in force and forced union. If you do not want to join the Union of India, nobody will force you to that,” Prof Syiemlieh quotes the Mahatma as having said.

Similarly, cultural anthropologist Kakali Chakrabarty in her essay describes that Gandhi’s idea was that “the tribes should be approached on the basis of non-violence, accepting the principles of a democratic society and the fundamental equality and unity of man.” Ms. Chakrabarty argues that Gandhi had trusted followers like Thakkar Bapa, Jugatram Dave, Indulal Yagnik and Kakasaheb Kalelkar who devoted their life to the cause of tribal welfare. “Gandhians motivated the tribal people to adopt satyagraha as means of protest against their exploitation instead of armed protest.,” she added.

Admitting that anthropologists had so far ignored Gandhi’s writings, his teachings and life, Dr. Srivastava said that the opportunity to explore Gandhi’s contributions came during the sesquicentenary celebration of his birth anniversary. “While working on the journal we realized that the AnSI had already conducted seminars on Gandhi, in our different regional centres in north east, east and south and north,” the AnSI director said.

“Not only that, Gandhi was extraordinarily inquisitive. He would ask umpteen number of questions to have a ringside view of the situation,” Dr. Srivastava wrote in the journal’s editorial. He pointed out that this was similar to what anthropologists do during their fieldwork. “They adopt what is called the ‘dialogic approach’. They ask questions respectfully, listen patiently to the replies, from the latter, they formulate more questions… Gandhi did exactly the same,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2zv7r1/article30659717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THLTGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ansi-explores-the-anthropologist-gandhi-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/article30659718.ece

Manipur has 16 districts, five in the central Imphal Valley and the rest in the hills around. Each district is known for growing a specific variety of fruit or herb.

“Such plants give each district a unique identity. Our government is weighing the option of naming the districts after fruits and other special plants for granting recognition to the growers for such varieties,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu on Sunday.

He had floated the idea during a food processing technology exhibition under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Imphal West district on Friday.

The Chief Minister cited the examples of oranges in Tamenglong district, believed to be among the juiciest and sweetest in the northeast, the indigenous kachai lemon in Ukhrul district and ginger in Pherzawl district.

115,2020/01/26,"Cases of diabetes, cancer rise in rural areas of Madhya Pradesh","Non-communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes and cancerare posing a bigger challenge in the non-tribal rural areas of Madhya Pradesh than in the urban areas owing to a rapidly growing rate of incidence and the lack of awareness, according to the National Health Mission (NHM).

Screening of 30 lakh persons above the age of 30 across the State in December has revealed that Raisen, Hoshangabad and Seoni districts face the highest burden of the diseases.

“We anticipated urban districts like Bhopal, Gwalior or Indore to fare the worst,” said Saloni Sidana, Additional Mission Director, State unit of the National Health Mission. “More awareness, as in the case of urban areas, translates into patients undergoing treatment despite a high incidence. As a result, the burden is moderate in urban areas, but due to low awareness in rural areas, it is increasing there,” said Dr. Sidana.

During the screening drive, taken up under the Centre’s Non Communicable Disease Control Programme, what surprised officials was the low incidence in the 89 tribal blocks in the State, which has largest tribal population in the country, despite the low awareness levels.

“Trans fatty acids when consumed in hydrogenated forms is a major cause of hypertension or high blood pressure levels,” said Dr. Sidana. “Still, cooking oil is reused for the purpose in several rural areas.”

The programme, which was launched recently and under which 86% of those screened have been put under treatment, focusses on identifying non-communicable diseases at the primary health-centre (PHC) level itself, and ensuring treatment up to the district-level and follow-ups with patients to continue medication.

In the first phase, 1,200 PHCs were roped in. In contrast to patients visiting a health centre, ASHA workers now go door-to-door to draft family profiles and screen them for the non-communicable diseases, added Dr. Sidana.

Meanwhile, the India Hypertension Control Initiative, supported by the World Health Organisation, is catering to patients above 18 suffering from the diseases in Bhopal, Sehore, Chhindwara, Seoni, Ujjain and Ratlam districts, said Ashish Saxena, Deputy Director, State Health Department, at a seminar on hypertension organised by Consumer Voice in Bhopal.

Of the screened persons, 2,55,420 were diagnosed for hypertension, he said. “We ensure follow-ups through the SMS service and contact by ASHA workers. The patient is approached, not the other way round,” he said.

Of the country’s 100 districts with the highest prevalence of hypertension, 15 were in Madhya Pradesh. Nearly 22% of the State’s residents fell in the above average category (140 mm of Hg/90 mm of Hg), according to the Annual Health Survey, 2014.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/sjnjng/article30660130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-doctor-disease-bp-pressure-20200126,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/non-communicable-diseases-rising-in-non-tribal-rural-regions-of-madhya-pradesh/article30659643.ece
116,2020/01/26,Incomplete schemes in J&K are being completed now: Prahlad Singh Patel,"Union Culture and Tourism Minister of State (independent charge) Prahlad Singh Patel, who visited Ramnagar, Udhampur and Jammu last week as a part of the outreach by Central ministers after the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, says the government plans to boost culture and tourism in Jammu and Ladakh, which had been discriminated against.

Having visited Jammu last week, what was your experience and what according to you is the impact of such a visit?

The most common refrain I heard from people was that this had never happened before. They said no Union Minister had an overnight stay at Ramnagar before. In terms of reactions to the removal of Article 370 and 35A, particularly women were very positive and honest. They said the biggest advantages were that their daughters’ property rights won’t get taken away after marriage to outsiders, stone pelting had stopped and now they have the assurance that after investing in property, they won’t have to flee their homes due to insecurity.

The impact of the removal of Article 370 is being felt by people now. The incomplete schemes that had been pending for 10-15 years, are now being completed. The central government’s social security schemes are now being implemented. For instance, in Ramnagar alone, 230 people have now enrolled into Ayushman Bharat.

You may call it discrimination or lack of transparency, the biggest example of which is a potential tourist hub called Basantgarh, which is a rival of Gulmarg, that had been neglected so far.

The construction of the road from Ramnagar till Basantgarh had been approved years ago, but it was pending till now. [Mr. Patel laid the foundation stone for this and other pending projects during his visit.]

How do you plan on addressing this feeling of neglect, as you have described?

The Tourism Ministry is recommending 100 roads to the National Highways Authority of India to develop keeping in mind the tourism potential. So we have decided that we will include roads in Ramnagar, Basantgarh and Udhampur to link tourist sites like Krimchi temples and other Archaeological Survey of India-protected sites linked to Raja Gulab Singh.

We are also working on developing new circuits, including from Chamba to Bhaderwah, where there is potential for trekking and cycling routes. It is a beautiful place, but it did not get any boost due to partiality.

Then we plan to develop a circuit from Katra till Akhnoor, where there is a historic fort, a Buddhism site, a riverfront that can be a landing ground for rafting as well a National Highway.

For Ladakh, the Prime Minister has already announced an increase in the capacity of the Leh airport and work on Kargil airport will be done. Kargil has 100 historic rock art sites in the span of less than a kilometre; we will develop this as rock art park. On the highway from Leh till Kargil, we are planning on creating tourist rest stops every 15-20 km. These will have medical facility, including oxygen, cafes and garbage recycling. These would be operated on PPP model with the help of the local hill council.

While you are planning to boost tourism, communication lines have remained cut in the region for months. Hasn’t that impacted tourism and business in general?

I met the business community and representatives of the chamber of commerce during my visit. They are happy now. There is a feel good factor. They feel that they will not have to flee from there. They told me that they used to invest their money in buying a house in some other State like Punjab in case they have to leave in an emergency.

When it comes to tourists, after removal of Article 370 and then passage of Citizenship Amendment Act, despite the protests and travel advisories from nine countries, there has been a growth of 43% in e-visas in the past four to five months.

In fact, in Mahabalipuram, there has been a 35% increase in footfall since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit. ASI had to put up six new counters. Overall, we have seen an increase in foreign tourists from 10.21 lakh in November 2018 to 10.91 lakh in November 2019.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sf57mr/article30659617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRAHLADSINGHPATEL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/incomplete-schemes-in-jk-are-now-being-completed-now-prahlad-patel/article30659618.ece
117,2020/01/26,Shipping Ministry’s Kolkata Port tableau irks Trinamool,"West Bengal’s tableau failed to make it to the Republic Day celebration in Delhi, but the State was not altogether absent in the mega-show on the Rajpath on Sunday. Kolkata Port Trust’s tableau, hosted by the Ministry of Shipping, showcased a bit of Bengal and a giant Howrah bridge, under the theme, “Glorious past and vibrant future — the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT).” The showcasing of Bengal, after rejecting its official tableau proposal, irked ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).

Party leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien asked “is anyone surprised?

“What else can one expect from this Mo-Sh (Modi-Shah) government, who know nothing about Bengal. Remember, the Home Minister once said Rabindranath Tagore was born in Shantiniketan and the BJP State president thought Vidyasagar wrote Sahaj Path,” Mr. O’Brien told The Hindu.

The Kolkata Port, recently renamed as Syama Prasad Mukherjee Port by the Prime Minister, was the theme of the Ministry’s tableau. Besides the Howrah Bridge, the coloured containers usually found in the port area were also displayed in the tableau on wheels with a lighthouse.

RSS workers’ body Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh’s general secretary [for port] Pradip Bijoli, formerly a trade union leader of the CPI(M), said he is ‘proud’.

“This is the port’s 150th year when, for the first time, [a port] is featured in the Republic Day tableau and that too Kolkata, among so many ports. We are proud,” Mr. Bijoli said.

For the Republic Day celebrations of 2020, the West Bengal government had proposed to design its tableau based on three flagship welfare programmes — the Kanyashree Scheme (a conditional cash transfer scheme for girl students), Sabujshree (a sapling to every newborn), and Jal Dharo Jal Bharo (on water conservation).

The proposals were rejected, second time in a row, and BJP’s State president Dilip Ghosh said the Centre was “following a laid down procedure where a committee takes a final decision on whether a tableau will make it or not”. The TMC argued “since the State government is opposing the anti-people policies of the BJP government, a step-motherly treatment is meted out.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/n7mw7z/article30659056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-shipping-ministry-MOStwitterjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shipping-ministrys-kolkata-port-tableau-irks-tmc/article30659028.ece

Pointing out that the resolution passed by the Assembly on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was there for all to see, he said the State would not allow the secular fabric to be destroyed at any cost.

In his speech on the 71st Republic Day, Capt. Amarinder said the secular foundations of the Constitution would continue to stand firm as he unfurled the tricolour, and also took the salute at a colourful parade in Mohali.

Emphasising on quality and more relevant education, he announced that 19 new IITs would be established in the State, along with medical colleges in Mohali, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur.

The Chief Minister reiterated his government’s commitment for farmer welfare. “Farmers have earned ₹44,000 crore more in the last six seasons of our government as compared to the corresponding period of the previous government, as a result of the steps to ensure smooth procurement, check on exploitation of farmers and streamlining of transport and labour operations,” he said.

Terming the drug menace as an issue of grave concern, Capt. Amarinder said his government remained committed to the elimination of the problem. “The STF set up to tackle the menace had shown excellent results with 34,373 cases registered so far under the NDPS Act and 42,571 persons having been arrested with recovery of 974 kg heroin,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3px9t5/article30658758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-AMARINDERSINGH-AKHILESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/will-not-allow-secular-fabric-to-be-destroyed-at-any-cost-says-amarinder/article30658713.ece

“The mobile telephone services were restored at 4.00 p.m. across Kashmir,” one of the officials said.

However, the mobile Internet services remain suspended, they said.

Suspension of mobile phone and internet services on Republic Day and Independence Day have been part of the security drill in the Valley since 2005 when militants used a mobile phone to trigger an IED blast near the venue of Independence day celebrations.

On January 25, hours after low-speed mobile internet was restored in Kashmir, authorities again snapped services, citing security reasons in view of Republic Day.

120,2020/01/26,"Mann Ki Baat: Insurgency in Northeast down, says PM Modi","In his first Mann ki Baat radio address in 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi listed the recent signing of the Bru-Reang agreement as one of the biggest achievements of his government in the past few months. He said insurgency in the northeastern region had come down significantly.

Mr. Modi said that in the festive atmosphere of Bihu, Pongal, Lohri and Uttarayan, many might not have noticed that Delhi witnessed an historic event in which an agreement was signed to end the Bru-Reang refugee crisis. “With it, the close-to-25-year-old Bru-Reang refugee crisis, a painful chapter, was closed for ever and ever.”

In the radio address, he spoke in detail about the crisis. The problem dated back to 1997 when the Bru community fled from Mizoram owing to ethnic tensions. They lived in camps at Kanchanpur in north Tirpura.

“For 23 years, no home, no land, no medical treatment for their families, no education facilities for their children. Just imagine, how difficult it must have been for them to live 23 long years in trying circumstances in camps. How painful it would have been to spend every moment, every day of their lives hurtling towards an uncertain future,” the Prime Minister said.

Mr. Modi blamed successive governments for ignoring the issue.

‘Ray of hope’

“Finally, the new decade of 2020 has brought a new ray of hope in the life of the Bru-Reang community.” The agreement was an example of cooperative federalism, he said, thanking the Chief Ministers of Tripura and Mizoram for helping to conclude it. He said insurgency in the northeastern region had significantly come down, citing the recent surrender in Assam of 644 militants of eight groups. Last year, he said, more than 80 insurgents returned to the mainstream in Tirpura. Tripura was the first State in the region to lift the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.

Mr. Modi utilised the occasion to appeal for peace. “On the solemn occasion of the Republic Day, I would appeal to anyone in any part of the country, who’s still seeking solutions to problems through violence and weapons, to return to the mainstream,” he said.

121,2020/01/26,"People who struggled for ensuring poll victory must be made to feel valuable part of govt, says Sachin Pilot","Hailing the setting up of a coordination panel by the Congress in Rajasthan as a “good move”, Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot on January 26 said people who struggled for ensuring victory in polls must be made to feel a valuable part of the ruling dispensation as sometimes one tends to take the party organisation for granted after governments are formed.

Mr. Pilot also asserted that the seven crore people of Rajasthan had reposed their faith in and voted for the Congress party, and it was only after that the party decided who will be Chief Minister, Deputy CM and Ministers.

His remarks come following criticism of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s handling of the Kota infant deaths issue and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi forming coordination and manifesto implementation committees in Rajasthan and other Congress-ruled States to ensure smooth working of the party and government in tandem.

In an interview to PTI, Mr. Pilot, who last week completed six years as president of the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (RPCC) and is the longest serving chief of the State unit, said as part of the government and the RPCC head, it is his responsibility to ensure that the hard labour of party workers is recognised and they are rewarded for their efforts in bringing the party back to power.

“My years of struggle in Opposition as party president helped form a special bond with people across the State — it’s my life’s biggest asset,” he said.

The Deputy Chief Minister, who has consistently emphasised that the government must reach out to people, also asserted that accountability needs to be fixed and corrective measures taken in the cases such as the one in which more than 100 infants died in a government hospital at Kota, so that such tragic incidents are not repeated.

“We should not politicise these issues. Good governance comes from ensuring responsibility and fixing accountability, doing that will at least ensure that there is no repetition of such tragedies and corrective measures are taken immediately,” Mr. Pilot said.

Such issues must be dealt with a lot of compassion and empathy and people must feel confident that there are measures in place that such tragedies don’t happen again, he said.

Mr. Pilot had earlier said the government could have shown more compassion in the matter and he also met parents of some of the deceased children in Kota.

Asked about the setting up of the coordination and manifesto implementation committees, he said, “I think it is a good move. The Congress workers, the party cadre, the people who have really struggled and won the elections, their stakeholdership, their contribution [must be acknowledged], and they must feel that they are a valuable part of the government.”

The move will certainly give a lot of confidence to grassroots workers, the 42-year-old leader said.

On whether it will enhance the voice of the organisation in the government, he said, “When you are in Opposition, the party is of paramount importance. When you are part of the government, sometimes we tend to take the party for granted which shouldn’t be the case.”

All those who worked to put the party in power need appreciation and respect, said Mr. Pilot, who is widely credited for the turnaround of the party and its return to power after having been reduced to just 21 seats in the previous assembly following five years of the previous Gehlot government.

“I think the objective [of the committees] is to have a more smoothened process so that people discuss things thoroughly and the government also works in line with what the party wants and what the manifesto States. So there are two committees. I think both will have positive results in delivering governance on the ground,” he said.

Avinash Pandey, party in-charge for Rajasthan Congress, will head the coordination committee which has Chief Minister Gehlot, Mr. Pilot, Ministers Master Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, Harish Chaudhary, former speaker Deepender Singh Shekhawat, along with former Ministers Hema Ram Chaudhary and Mahendrajit Malviya.

Chhattisgarh Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu has been made the chairman of the manifesto implementation panel for Rajasthan

Asked whether he was ready for another term as the State party chief, Mr. Pilot said he is always ready for any responsibility given to him and to discharge it with utmost sincerity and honesty.

On maintaining a balance between his role in the government and as the RPCC chief, he said, “Once I set a goal for myself, I go all out to achieve it. I am looking after rural development, panchayati raj and they mostly impact rural population and agrarian communities and so we’ve ensured that budgets are enhanced, schemes reach the remotest parts and strict oversight is maintained.”

Talking about the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests and the Rajasthan Assembly passing a resolution against the law, Mr. Pilot said it is everyone’s right to uphold whatever they feel is wrong.

“Parliament has passed a law because the government of India has a majority in Parliament, but that does not mean that it will necessarily meet legal sanction from the Supreme Court,” he said.

Ultimate decision stands with the Supreme Court on the legality of the Act but every individual has the right to oppose and the government can alter, withdraw or change the law as it deems fit, the Congress leader said.

On the way forward for the Congress in Rajasthan, Mr. Pilot said the party has a greater responsibility now that it is in government and must be more robust in its interactions with the people.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d7prgq/article30658234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SACHINPILOT-KMURALIKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/people-who-struggled-for-ensuring-poll-victory-must-be-made-to-feel-valuable-part-of-govt-says-sachin-pilot/article30658210.ece

Congress social media in-charge Rohan Gupta said that the party would also send copies of the Constitution to the BJP Chief Ministers. The party posted several tweets on its official Twitter handle, alleging that the government was subverting the Constitution.

“Dear PM, The Constitution is reaching you soon. When you get time off from dividing the country, please do read it. Regards, Congress,” read a tweet with the snapshot of an Amazon receipt, according to which the copy was being dispatched.

Mr. Gupta said the party took the decision because Mr. Modi’s actions showed he had not read the Constitution yet. “We are convinced that he could not have brought in laws like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, had he read the Constitution. Our Constitution is the basic difference between India and Pakistan. And as the main Opposition party, it is our responsibility to ensure that the Constitution is not violated,” he told The Hindu.

124,2020/01/26,AMU Vice Chancellor heckled at Republic Day function,"Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor was on Sunday heckled by a group of students during his Republic Day speech here soon after he termed as “unfortunate” the recent happenings on the campus and said peaceful protests will be allowed on any issue within the ambit of law.

The incident occurred when the VC was addressing the Republic Day function held amid tight security at the Aligarh Muslim University, which has been rocked by protests by students and teachers against the amended citizenship law.

The Vice Chancellor was giving his concluding remarks when a group of students raised slogans demanding his removal and a minor tussle ensued between two groups of students in the audience before the security staff stepped in, according to eyewitnesses.

Four of the hecklers were whisked away by the security staff and taken to the Proctor’s office but were later released, they said.

There was no response from police or AMU to queries on the incident.

However, the spokesman of the Students’ Coordination Committee, Ansab Amir, told reporters that a few students who were protesting during the Vice Chancellor’s speech were picked up by the University’s security staff and reportedly taken to the police station.

According to available information they have now been released. He identified the students as Tahir Azmi, Rafiuddin, Sudhir Gulati and AM Faraz.

Mr. Amir said the agitating students held a separate programme celebrating Republic Day at their dharna site.

Delivering his speech, the Vice Chancellor pledged to protect the minority character of the university.

“The recent happenings in the campus have been unfortunate. I have always stood and will always stand by my students, teachers and AMU fraternity,” Prof. Mansoor said.

“AMU is committed to allow peaceful protest on any issue within the ambit of law,” he said.

“We are committed to the protection and preservation of the minority character and the historical legacy of the university,” he said.

Mr. Mansoor said, “Tolerance of all religions has always been the cornerstone of Indian culture and our Constitution seeks to build an equitable society where all citizens enjoy equal rights.”

Addressing the function, the former president of AMU Students’ Union, Faizul Hasan said, “This is the day to honour our freedom and our Constitution. We are however continuing our peaceful protest to safeguard our Constitution and the foundational values of our Republic.”

Mr. Hasan, however, cautioned the students against doing anything during the protest which would provide “an excuse to the authorities to take action against them and thus bring a premature end to the dharna“.

Asked about the protests, Secretary of AMU Teachers’ Association Najmul Islam said, “Today is a day to celebrate the foundational values of our republic and I would not like to say anything beyond this.”

“Our peaceful agitation against the CAA will continue. However, I would once again urge the students to end their boycott of classes and exams even while they are continuing with their protest,” he said.

Meanwhile, there was some commotion in the campus on Saturday night as police raided the residence of a senior university faculty member, Prof. Tariq Usmani. They were apparently searching for his son Sharjeel Usmani, a prominent student leader.

According to Prof. Usmani, his son was not present but the police “misbehaved” with him and asked him to report at the police station on Monday. Mr. Usmani said that the police had no written orders seeking his presence at the police station.

A large number of senior members of the University staff reached the site and the situation was soon defused.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yi1dog/article30657524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THTARIQMANSOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amu-vice-chancellor-heckled-at-republic-day-function/article30657525.ece

These 22 projects comprising 7,500 km of greenfield expressways and corridors are planned to be completed by FY25 at a cost of ₹3.10 lakh crore.

“We will complete the flagship Delhi-Mumbai Express Highway in the next three years. The work will be done in 51 packages and work has already been started on 18. This will be India’s longest expressway at 1,320 km and will reduce travel time between Delhi and Mumbai from 24 hours to 13 hours,” the road transport and highways minister said.

Of the projects, six are 2,250 km expressways to be built at a cost of ₹1.45 lakh crore.

The remaining 16 are greenfield corridors, including 5,250 km projects to be constructed at a cost of ₹1.65 lakh crore.

Besides Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, the minister said the trans-Rajasthan and trans-Haryana projects will be completed within the next three years.

About Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he said greenfield alignment has been selected to avoid habitation and optimise cost of land acquisition.

“We have saved about ₹16,000 crore on land acquisition front alone as land could be acquired at a cost of ₹80 lakh per hectare for the project,” he said, adding that the expressway will unlock new economic opportunities in hinterland districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

The expressway has been taken from concept to award in a record time-frame of less than a year.

He said the new projects will provide alternate routes to diversify traffic, improve geometry/alignment and provide connectivity for major towns, thereby reducing distance and travel times.

Besides, these will mitigate issues like land acquisition, utility shifting and other clearances related to brown-field expansion of existing alignment and provide thrust to the economy of backward regions by improving infrastructure, the minister said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m5vitm/article30548239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMGADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/three-expresswaysgreen-corridors-to-be-completed-in-3-years-22-to-be-built-at-3-lakh-crore-gadkari/article30657454.ece

A DRDO marching contingent displayed the ASAT missile along with a second equipment, the Air Defence Tactical Control Radar (ADTCR), as President and Supreme Commander of the armed forces Ram Nath Kovind reviewed the parade with Chief Guest Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro in attendance.

There were 16 marching contingents this year including six from the Army and 22 tableaux from various States and departments in the 90-minute parade. The flypast consisted of 41 aircraft of the IAF and four helicopters of the Army Aviation. These include 16 fighters, 10 transport aircraft and 19 helicopters flying between 60-300 metres above ground level.

Pin point accuracy

On March 27, 2019 the DRDO shot down a live satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) of 300 km using a modified interceptor of the Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system in ‘hit to kill’ mode with 10-cm accuracy. The Defence Ministry in a statement last week termed the test a major breakthrough in demonstrating the ASAT technology and that the ASAT weapons “play a critical role in providing the necessary strategic deterrence”.

“The covert technology of ‘hit to kill’ developed for the first time in India for such applications enables it to destroy an enemy satellite by directly colliding with it with pin-point accuracy,” a brochure issued by the Defence Ministry at the parade said.

The ADTCR is used for volumetric surveillance, detection, tracking and friend/foe identification of aerial targets of different types and transmission of prioritised target data to multiple command posts and weapon systems.

Three CH-47F(I) Chinook helicopters flew in a ‘vic’ formation followed by five AH-64E Apache helicopters which flew in ‘arrowhead’ formation. Both these helicopters were inducted into service last year. India has contracted 22 Apache helicopters and 15 Chinook helicopters from Boeing through the Foreign Military Sales programme of the U.S. government in September 2015 under a $3-billion deal.

Guard of honour

In a change of tradition, before commencement of the parade, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid homage to fallen soldiers by laying a wreath at the flame of the immortal warrior at the National War Memorial (NWM), instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti (AJJ) at the India Gate.

The NWM, inaugurated in February last year, is located at the ‘C’ Hexagon near the India Gate and was built in memory of about 22,500 Indian soldiers who laid down their lives for the country in the post-independence period. The AJJ will now be used only for regimental events and visiting dignitaries.

Among the Army’s marching contingents, marching for the first time on the Republic Day was a contingent from the Corps of Army Air Defence. The Army’s Signal Corps contingent was led by Capt. Tanya Shergill, a fourth generation officer.

127,2020/01/26,"Republic Day: Air India distributes 30,000 national flags among its passengers","The national carrier Air India celebrated the 71st Republic Day by distributing 30,000 Indian flags made of eco-friendly seed paper among its passengers at airports in metro cities and Srinagar on Sunday.

The airline also put up a big hoarding at the historic Lal Chowk in the heart of Srinagar to congratulate the people on Republic Day.

It was the first Republic Day celebration in Srinagar after the abrogation of Article 370 provisions that gave special status to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The handmade flags prepared by Sahariya tribals of Madhya Pradesh were distributed at the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Srinagar, said Air India spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar.

“We distributed more than 800 flags at Srinagar airport to the passengers, specially those of Air India to share our national pride on the occasion. In another initiative, we also congratulated valley people on Republic Day by putting up a big hoarding at Lal Chowk,” Mr. Kumar said.

More than 30,000 flags made of special seed paper were distributed at different airports, he said.

The flags contain seeds of marigold and fenugreek which would germinate and develop into saplings after soaking in water and planted in soil.

Srinagar-resident Mohammad Yusuf Gojri accompanied by other passengers accepted the tricolour.

A young tourist from Haryana, Lakshya Dangi said he was in the valley for the past few days and was impressed by hospitality and warmth of the people.

“Although tourist turnout is low due to cold and unavailability of internet, people here are very warm and welcoming,” he said when asked about his experience.

Air India connects the valley to the rest of India and Republic Day is the occasion to congratulate people and strengthen their ties with the airline, said Nazneen Ahmad Chisti, Srinagar-based senior manager (commercial) of Air India.

A tricolour was unfurled at the Srinagar airport in a programme organised by the Airports Authority of India.

Senior police and paramilitary officers and personnel attended the function.

129,2020/01/26,Well-being of Indians in Wuhan being monitored: New Delhi,"“India is all clear so far,” a senior Health Ministry official said on Sunday on the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCov) 2019.

“While China is on high alert, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called it a moderate level threat globally as of now,” said the official.

Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar tweeted that the Indian Embassy in Beijing is “constantly checking on health and well-being of the Indians in China”.

The Health Ministry maintained that no Indian citizen in Wuhan has been affected by the virus and that food and water supplies were available to them.

It added that the Indian Embassy has opened three hotlines and is continuing to respond to concerns based on available information.

“Total of 29,707 passengers from 137 flights screened. 4,359 passengers of 22 flights screened today. No case of coronavirus found till date,” said the Health Ministry.

The Ministry added that India has stepped up vigil in districts bordering Nepal. Health teams have been deployed at border posts with Nepal at Jhulaghat and Jauljibi, in Pithoragarh district.

Apart from Wuhan, 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading.

In a rare move, the Indian Embassy in Beijing cancelled the Republic Day ceremony, over rising concerns of the virus which has spread to all provinces except Tibet.

Closely monitored

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is closely monitoring the situation, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

“In view of the large number of calls received in the two hotline numbers set up by @EOIBeijing in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus infection, @EOIBeijing has decided to open a third hotline number +8618610952903,” the Embassy said in a tweet.

The other two hotline numbers are 8618612083629 and 8618612083617, the Embassy said.

GoI and @EOIBeijing are also examining all options, including through consultations with the Chinese authorities, to provide relief to our affected citizens,” another tweet by the Embassy said.

131,2020/01/26,24x7 helpline set up for coronavirus,"As the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) rise across the world, the government on Saturday set up a round-the-clock National Centre for Disease Control Call Centre ( +91-11-23978046) to attend to public queries.

“The call centre will monitor the list of contacts furnished by the Ministry of External Affairs; provide details of district and State surveillance officers to callers and in case of any clinical query, direct the concerned to the relevant Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer,” officials in the Health Ministry said.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan urged passengers who have a travel history to China since January 1, 2020 to come forward for self-reporting if they experience any symptoms such as fever, cough, respiratory distress, etc. and also inform their treating doctor.

“We are in touch with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for technical support and guidance,” the Minister said after a review of preparedness.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said he spoke with the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and assured all support for screening at the border with Nepal, where a confirmed nCoV case had been reported. “We are also writing to the Chief Ministers requesting for personal intervention to review the preparedness,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w4h3xt/article30656745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/24x7-helpline-set-up-for-coronavirus/article30656728.ece
132,2020/01/26,"Ensure filters on devices to curb children’s access to porn, says RS committee","There should be mandatory applications on all devices sold in India that monitors children’s access to pornographic content, a code of conduct for social media platforms to ensure that no child pornographic material is relayed and a nodal agency to combat child pornography in social media — these are the few recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha committee on “pornography on social media and its effect on children”.

The ad hoc committee headed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh that was constituted following a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the issue by its Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, submitted its report on Saturday.

The committee’s basic mandate was to look at “access of children to pornographic material on social media” and “circulation of pornographic material on social media in which children are abused”.

Overall, the committee, which was given a month’s time, has made 40 recommendations after consulting with all stakeholders, including the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and social media platforms such as Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, Twitter and Sharechat.

The report says that definition of child pornography needs to broadened with additional clause to be inserted in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act), 2012 under which advocating or counselling sexual activities with a person under the age of 18 through any written material, visual representation or audio recording or any characterisation is made an offence under the Act.

It has recommended that the POCSO Act should have a provision on “cyber-grooming” which was defined in June 2016 by International Labour Organisation as “the process of establishing/building a relationship with a child either in person or through the use of the internet or other digital technologies to facilitate either online or offline sexual contact with that person.”

Safeguards for minors

At the same time, the committee has recommended safeguards for minors engaging in “sexting and selfies”. The minors exchanging sexually explicit pictures of oneself and exchanging them with other minors should not be prosecuted under the law, the committee has noted.

Check on social media

The committee has felt that there is a need for a code of conduct for the social media platforms. Explaining further, the report says that such a code should lay down “ the general principles and practical guidelines for maintaining child safety online, ensuring age appropriate content and curbing use of children for pornographic purposes”.

The existing National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) should also be appointed as the nodal agency to check child pornography. But to do so, the committee has recommended that the NCPCR be equipped with cyber policing expertise and powers to prosecute.

Monitoring apps

The committee has asked MeitY to mandate existing screen monitoring apps or encourage industry to develop one that will monitor children’s access to pornographic content. This should be freely available to Internet service providers, companies, schools and parents.

There is a need to build a “political alliance” to combat the menace, the committee has noted and has recommended that Prime Minister Narendra Modi take up the subject of child pornography during one of the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcasts.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pnvu6f/article30653882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-JAIRAMRAMESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ensure-filters-on-devices-to-curb-childrens-access-to-porn-says-rs-committee/article30653881.ece
133,2020/01/26,"Bengal Governor raises issue of political violence, corruption in Republic Day message","Taking an swipe at the Trinamool Congress government West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday in his message to people on the eve of Republic day raised concerns over violence misuse of public funds.

“Violence is antithetical to Democracy. Let us resolve that in 2020 to have our State known for peaceful environment. The last few years on this count have been worrisome,” Governor message read.

In his message he also raised issues of non-implementation of Central government schemes Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi and said that ₹4000 crore has not been made available to them. “I urge all concerned to take proactive steps so that they are not denied their due. We must end this injustice to farmers,” the Governor said.

The relations between Raj Bhawan and the Trinamool Congress government have been rocky since Mr. Dhankhar was appointed as Governor of the State. Trinamool Congress leadership including Chief Minister herself had targeted the Governor for his remarks directed at the functioning of the State. In his statement during the day, the Governor pointed out at “unwholesome instances” as far as public funds are concerted.

“Public funds are meant only for governmental purposes, and should not be conducted for furthering political objectives. We have seen unwholesome instances.

134,2020/01/26,Manipur-Myanmar border sealed for 48 hours to ensure an ‘incident-free’ Republic Day ceremony,"The international border with Myanmar has been sealed for 48 hours beginning Saturday morning to ensure an incident-free Republic Day ceremony in Manipur, officials said here.

An order issued by M. Rajkumar, district magistrate of Tengoupal, said the sealing of the border that began at 11 a.m. would remain in force till 11 a.m. on January 27. International gates I and II shall remain closed during this period and border trade will be closed, the order said.

Speculation among the government circles is that undesirable elements may slip into Manipur to create law and order problems. All major underground organisations in the Northeastern region had called for a boycott of the national function.

About 43 Assam Rifles has been deputed to guard the 350-km-long Manipur-Myanmar border during the 48-hour shutdown. Manipur has been affected by bomb blasts ahead of the Republic day function. In the latest bomb explosion this week, over 30 houses and shops at the RIMS crossing were damaged.

135,2020/01/26,"Constitution, democracy under threat, says Brinda","The people of the country should come together to defend the constitution, democracy and economy that are under threat not from external forces but from the Modi-Shah government, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat said here on Saturday.

Ms. Karat was here to attend an Adivasi conference on land rights at Eturunagaram in Mulugu district on Saturday.

She said the people of the country were vexed with the lies and abuse being manufactured by the government. The country was now witnessing the highest unemployment rate; inequality had grown exponentially. The 1% rich owned what belonged to 70% of the country’s population and that had happened only during the past six years. The economy was in a crisis but to conceal these failures, the Modi-Shah government had started a factory that manufactured lies and abuses against whoever questioned these failures. “Whoever questions the government is branded as a Pakistani agent or anti-national. The people are fed up with this Modi-Shah government and its lies,” Ms. Karat said.

‘Stand united’

The CPI(M) leader wanted the people to take a pledge on January 26 that they would stand united to defend the constitution, democracy and economy of the country. “One happy thing is that youngsters of the country now realised the fake patriotism of the Modi-Shah duo and now are fighting against these divisive forces. The students at the JNU succeeded in gaining an upper hand over the autocratic forces,” she said.

On Telangana, Ms. Karat said the ruling TRS government which voted against the CAA had suppressed the people from protesting against the Act. She said the TRS was adopting double standards and going the way of the BJP in depriving the poor of their rights. “The BJP and the TRS are snatching away lands from poor tribals and giving them away to the rich. Both the parties are same,” she said adding that the rights ton land and forest belonged to tribal people.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bi48r4/article30653591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26Carrot,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/constitution-democracy-under-threat-says-brinda/article30653592.ece

137,2020/01/26,Brazil agrees to talks on subsidies for sugarcane farmers,"Brazil has agreed to bilateral talks with India on the thorny issue of sugarcane subsidies and pricing policies, according to an official spokesperson.

However, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi raising the issue with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during their discussions on Saturday, diplomatic sources say that Brazil — the world’s largest sugar exporter — is not willing to withdraw its complaint against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Last July, Brazil, Australia and Guatemala initiated dispute proceedings, saying that India's policies to support sugarcane farmers do not comply with WTO rules and distort global trade. Thereafter, in August, the WTO set up a dispute settlement panel to review Indian subsidies.

Several Indian farmers groups have demanded that Mr. Modi use Mr. Bolsonaro’s visit to push for withdrawal of the complaint, saying that the livelihoods of five crore small farmers was at stake. They pointed out that by setting a fair price for sugar, the Indian government does not actually procure from or subsidise farmers, but simply protects them from exploitation by sugar mills.

An official spokesperson from the Ministry of External Affairs confirmed that the two sides had agreed to address the issue through bilateral consultations.

According to a source at the Ministry, the decision on talks represents a major change since Brazil had earlier refused to discuss the issue. The source said when Mr. Modi took up the matter with Mr. Bolsonaro, Brazil agreed to bilateral talks “as a gesture of our close friendship and given the importance India attaches to the matter”.

However, a Brazilian diplomatic source said this does not mean they will withdraw their case at the WTO.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2rjdzw/article30653468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Sugarcane,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/brazil-agrees-to-talks-on-subsidies-for-sugarcane-farmers/article30653467.ece
138,2020/01/26,Sonia Gandhi flags vicious attack on Constitution,"Alleging that the Constitution is “being attacked by way of a vicious conspiracy”, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday said India’s 71st Republic Day should be an occasion for every citizen to reaffirm their commitment to the values enshrined in the statute.

“Seventy years ago, our great Constitution was drafted and adopted as per the aspirations and desires of all countrymen and women. The cardinal principles of justice, equality, freedom, secularism and fraternity run through the veins of our Constitution. Every letter of the Constitution is not a mere a printed word but a living philosophy for every citizen,” Ms. Gandhi said in a statement on the eve of Republic Day.

She said the path to the Constitution was laid by the sacrifices of millions of Indians and freedom fighters led by Mahatma Gandhi.

“Today, the Constitution and its values are being attacked by way of a concerted and vicious conspiracy. Constitutional principles are being systematically encroached upon... independence of constitutional institutions is being scuttled... at the whims of autocratic authoritarianism. It is the duty of every citizen to stand united in defence of the Constitution,” the Congress chief said.

Ms. Gandhi said amidst a gloomy economic scenario where farmers are in distress, youth are facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, factories and small businesses are closing down, the State has come down hard on any form dissent.

“A deep rooted conspiracy has been hatched to set a discourse to divide the countrymen based on religion, regionalism and language as also to subvert and undermine the Constitution. An unprecedented atmosphere of disturbance, fear and insecurity has been foisted upon the country. The common citizen is convinced that the constitutional values are no longer safe in the hands of the present dispensation,” she said.

Today, the onus of protecting the Constitution is on the shoulders of every Indian, Ms. Gandhi said.

Urging citizens to leave aside personal prejudices, she said, “Every countryman and woman must reaffirm and assimilate one’s duty towards guarding the Constitution and defending India’s unity. This is the litmus test for our commitment to the Constitution and our patriotism.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7wdmz6/article30616055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SONIAGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sonia-gandhi-flags-vicious-attack-on-constitution/article30655380.ece

After unfurling the national flag at IGMC Stadium here on Sunday, Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan spoke at length on the Nava Ratnalu, top priority welfare schemes, and the recently passed Disha Bill.

The Governor said the Cabinet took a historic decision to distribute and decentralise capital functions for the State - Executive at Visakhapatnam, Legislative at Amaravati, and Judiciary at Kurnool.

No mention of Decentralisation Bill

The Governor, however, did not make any mention of the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of all Regions Bill 2020, which was passed by the Assembly recently. The Bill was referred to a select committee by the Legislative Council.

Mr. Harichandan said the government was implementing YSR Rythu Bharosa, YSR Jalayagnam, Jagananna Amma Vodi, and prohibition in a phased manner. Further, he mentioned about the housing scheme, Village Secretariats, introduction of English medium in government schools, and other schemes and programmes of the State government.

Polavaram to be ready by 2021

The Governor said the Polavaram Project will be completed by 2021 and 7.2 lakh-acre ayacut will be created. “The government will distribute house sites pattas to 25 lakh families in the State, which will be registered in the name of women. Merger of RTC employees in newly formed Public Transport Department, Kadapa Steel Plant, New Sand Policy, 75 per cent reservations to locals in employment, etc., were the measures taken by the government,” he said.

“I reiterate that the State of Andhra Pradesh is poised to march ahead in the path of inclusive growth and integrated development enhancing satisfaction level of all sections of people,” Mr. Harichandan added.

He urged the people to use tricolours made of khadi and said, “People should start to reuse and recycle the flags instead of buying one-time plastic flags that harm the environment.”

An oustee

Mr. Maheswarappa was a victim of the Srisailam dam. The village where he was originally from got submerged after the dam was constructed.

150,2020/01/26,Rock art discovered in Andhra Pradesh caves,"A team of five researchers from Yogi Vemana University (YVU), Kadapa, have discovered caves rich in rock art. The caves are located about four km from the Bhogeswaram temple complex in the Kundu River valley in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh.

According to V. Ramabrahmam, who led the team, the rock art belongs to the period between 6000 BC and 6th century AD. “We have rock art of Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Megalithic periods, as well as paintings from the historic period.”

About the Mesolithic art, he says four or five hand impressions of a single person with red ochre have been noticed. Similar impressions have also been found at different rock art sites in Rayalaseema.

“The handprints were made by dipping the palm in colour and slapping it on the wall of the rock shelter,” says the researcher. Mesolithic tools have also been found, indicating that people of the prehistoric period lived at the place.

“While there are no animal or cattle paintings of the Neolithic age, we noticed stone tools which were of the Neolithic period,” he says.

On the Megalithic age, he says there is a human figure in white pigment. “The painting depicted a human in combat with a wild animal that resembles a tiger. We also noticed a painting of two humans standing with tridents in their left hands. This shows the usage of iron weapons, the basic feature of the Megalithic communities.”

Besides the prehistoric rock art, there are others depicting Rama, Hanuman and Ravana. “Rama holds a bow in his left hand with his face painted with yellow ochre. Ravana painting is also in yellow ochre, and he is seen kneeling. Hanuman is seen lifting a mountain while standing,” says Dr. Ramabharhmam.

The team concludes that the shelter was occupied by different stone age people from the late Mesolithic to historic period. “The red ochre, white pigment, and yellow ochre signify different stone age periods,” says Dr. Ramabrahmam.

The research team also found five burials nearby. “Out of the five, three are intact,” he says.

Others in the team are assistant professor Y. Raghu and Ph.D scholars C. Shiva Kumar, J. Narayana, and P. Nagesh. The team has appealed to the Archaeological Survey of India to preserve the rock art for future generations.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ctar01/article30655526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26ONGHANUMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rock-art-discovered-in-andhra-pradesh-caves/article30655527.ece

Since afternoon all the residents of Nimmalakunta in Anantapur district, from where Mr. Chalapathi Rao hails, have been celebrating the achievement in their own way.

Nimmalakunta is synonymous with leather puppetry and Mr. Chalapathi Rao, who has been selected for the Padma Shri, is a popular face of the village and a brand ambassador for staging puppet shows and laboriously making them even today.

Mr. Chalapathi Rao, who has shifted to Dharmavaram town, 12 km away to be closer to his family members in his old age, says winning accolades and getting rewards was nothing new for him, but Padma Shri was very special and cannot be compared with any of his other awards.

After a countless number of shows in India and abroad, he had won national award in 1988 and several others later. When contacted, Mr. Chalapathi Rao said “kalamma Thalli karuninchindi” (the goddess of art has showered blessings) and his grandson Prakash was busy handling hundreds of congratulatory phone calls coming for his grandfather.

Puppet making

Mr. Chalapathi Rao began his journey as a teacher and guide to his community youngsters after excelling in the art of making leather puppets. Mr. Chalapathi Rao with his seven brothers and relatives began training the craftsmen in making leather paintings, lamp shades room partitions, after leather puppets saw no takers and the new trend touched the public imagination.

Born in 1936, he began his journey in puppet-making at the age of 13 as this art is mostly a family affair. He had learnt the art from his father Khade Rao and for 40 years gave several shows, mostly on mythological themes. Later he underwent a formal training in the craft.

The most popular acts performed by him along with his troupe of eight artists are adaptation of six khandas (scenes) from Ranganatha Ramayana-Sundarakanda, Lanka Dhanam, Sugriva Pattabhishekham, Sati Sulochana, YudhaKandam (Kumbhakarna & Ravana) and two paravalas from Bharatham: Virata Paravam and Draupathi Vastra Bharanam.

152,2020/01/26,Abolishing Council not easy: Yanamala,"While insisting that the abolition of the Legislative Council was not an easy process and the present circumstances would not permit it, Leader of the Opposition in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the State government could not threaten the Council and its members by invoking Article 169 of the Constitution.

If the situation warranted, the Union government could issue directions to the State under Article 257 by exercising its executive powers and impose President’s rule if such directions were violated, he said, stating that the TDP was not demanding it, but the intention was to warn the State government of the consequences of being stubborn in its actions.

Addressing mediapersons at the TDP office at Atmakur in Guntur district on Saturday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said the Council had not rejected the Bills for separate SC and ST Commissions and English medium education in government schools, but returned them to the Assembly proposing certain amendments, which were expectedly turned down.

In respect of the Bills for decentralisation and inclusive development of all regions and repeal of CRDA, the Council chairman referred them to a select committee by using his discretionary powers for eliciting public opinion.

Even if the rule book was silent about certain things, the Chairman could take decisions as per the residuary powers vested in him by the Constitution, he said.

Mr. Ramakrishnudu said the High Court had clearly directed the State government not to shift any departments till February 26 and it apparently pulled up the government for being in undue hurry to move the Bill related to ‘three capitals’ which was an ordinary Bill, whereas if introduced as a money Bill, it ought to have a recommendation by the Governor.

About 128 runners who started the marathon at the Rural Development Trust (RDT) office in the city on Friday reached the finishing line on Saturday at Bathalapalli RDT hospital, concluding the fifth edition of the event.

The runners, in 32 teams with four members each, had to run 170 km in the relay event through the villages of Anantapur district all through the night. “As goes the motto of AUM which is ‘One KM, One Life’, I have joined the run because running is one of my passions and through this initiative, I can bring a change in the lives of some people,” said Gowthami Bai, a local trained athlete.

Peter, who came from Ireland to join the AUM for the second time, said, “I have been a part of many marathons and it is always a great challenge. But the AUM is unique because here I do not run for myself but to help others to access a dignified life.”

Runners from Spain, Ireland, Australia, Iran and Colombia participated in the event.

155,2020/01/26,VPT to issue order for EIA studyfor global cruise terminal project,"In sync with the Centre’s focus on making the major ports more viable through diversification, Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) is all set to issue the work order for undertaking an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study on developing an international cruise terminal.

The project, if materialises, will be the first-of-its-kind facility in Andhra Pradesh, the VPT officials claimed.

“We are in advance stage of finalising the agency which will undertake the EIA study. The study will take three months. It will be followed by the tendering process and obtaining clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change,” VPT Deputy Chairman P.L. Haranadh told The Hindu.

₹77-crore project

The estimated project cost has been put at ₹77 crore, of which 50% is likely to be released by the Ministry of Tourism and the rest will be met from the internal accruals of the VPT. “The VPT is planning issue the work order for the international cruise terminal by June-end,” said Mr. Harnadh.

The terminal, with the proposed length of 300 metre, can handle cruise vessels with the capacity of accommodating around 2,000 passengers. The project, once materialises, will be a shot in the arm of Visakhapatnam which aspires to be a global tourist hub. The city has already a good air connectivity to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Dubai. Efforts are on to revive the operations of low-cost foreign carriers to Colombo and Bangkok, he said.

“The VPT has already got the terminal design done by Delhi-based Creative Group. Coastal, offshore and other studies were carried out by IIT, Chennai and Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune. Both the institutes have given favourable reports,” said Mr. Harnadh.

Day-long halt proposed

There are plans to make the project operational by introducing day-long visits by cruise terminals. During the halt, the tourists can be taken around the major tourist destinations in the city, including Beach Road, 17th Century Dutch township in Bhimili, Buddhist heritage sites at Thotlakonda and Bojjanakonda and the Kailasagiri park.

“Once the demand picks up, the terminal can be converted into a hub terminal in the second phase. Cruise terminals are now under operation in Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi, Goa and New Mangalore,” said the VPT deputy Chairman.

A team from the VPT went to Goa and Mumbai to study the business models sometime ago. The proposed cruise terminal may come up between the Vedanta General Cargo Berth and Channel Berth, where enough draft is available for anchoring bigger vessels.

156,2020/01/26,GTD lavishes praise on Yediyurappa,"JD(S) MLA representing Chamundeshwari segment in Mysuru G.T. Deve Gowda, who has maintained a distance from his party and its leaders, has once again lavished praise on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

Addressing a gathering at the valedictory of Krishi Mela organised as part of Suttur Jatra near here on Sunday, Mr. Gowda, former Minister, complimented Mr. Yediyurappa for providing a stable administration after painstakingly building the party in the State.

He said Mr. Yediyurappa had surmounted multiple challenges and hurdles posed to him in his path to the Chief Minister’s post. Before assuming the post, Mr. Yediyurappa had fallen short of numbers, after both 2008 and 2018 Assembly polls, he said. Mr. Gowda said Mr. Yediyurappa would now complete the remainder of the three-and-a-half years of the present Assembly’s term as Chief Minister.

“The implementation of the Act will pit one community against another, and it is to make India a Hindu Rashtra,” he said at the 71st Republic Day celebration organised at the JD(S) office here.

The CAA was a dangerous development and the nation was observing the Republic Day in tough times, he said, and added that it could lead to violence and affect the sovereignty of the nation.

He said it was not appropriate for the BJP to go against the aspirations of the Constitution, and that the party was going against the aspirations within nine months of being re-elected.

“Employment opportunities have become a mirage for youngsters while farmers are in crisis. An atmosphere has been created wherein women and members of minority communities are living in fear,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said during the 71st Republic Day celebrations at the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office here.

159,2020/01/26,Yediyurappa awaiting leadership’s nod to expand Cabinet on Jan. 29,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is keen on expanding his Cabinet on January 29 and is awaiting the green signal from the BJP central leadership after having communicated it to them, sources close to him said. If no clearance comes through, however, Cabinet expansion may be taken up after the Delhi Assembly elections scheduled for February 8, sources said.

B.L. Santhosh, national general secretary (Organisation) of the BJP, met the Chief Minister on Saturday here and they deliberated on the issue. Mr. Yediyurappa reportedly communicated the names of persons he wants to induct into the Cabinet and those he wants to drop and also expressed his wish to expand his ministry on January 29, sources close to him claimed.

The Chief Minister reportedly conveyed to the party leadership that he was keen on inducting at least eight MLAs who had won the Assembly bypolls and four from the party cadre. He also reportedly sought clearance to drop two Ministers, taking the total vacant berths to six.

Other sources in the party, however, claimed that there was still confusion on the list of inclusions and exclusions from the Cabinet, which was delaying the exercise. This comes days after Mr. Yediyurappa met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on January 18 when he was in the State.

The Chief Minister is feeling hemmed in from all sides as pressure from the newly elected MLAs, whom he had promised to make Ministers within 24 hours of their victory in the December 5 bypoll, is only increasing and the party central leadership has not given its nod for the expansion exercise. “I hope the high command clears the decks for the exercise soon, otherwise the confusion will continue, which may eventually end up destabilising the government,” said a Minister close to the Chief Minister.

J.P. Nadda

A party strategist, however, said since J.P. Nadda took over as the BJP national president recently, it was unlikely that Mr. Yediyurappa would be allowed to expand his Cabinet without having met him. “It will send out a wrong message about the new party chief if he is bypassed,” the strategist said, and added that the expansion was likely to happen only after the Delhi Assembly polls.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/f0ajkk/article30660254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGYEDIYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-awaiting-leaderships-nod-to-expand-cabinet-on-jan-29/article30660256.ece
160,2020/01/26,‘Life on wheels’ to the rescue of the needy in Malnad areas,"Amid pouring rain, a patient with complaints of chest pain was brought to a hospital in the small Malnad town of Kalasa during a night in August 2019. After diagnosing the condition as myocardial infarction (heart attack) the patient, from Balehole village, was sent in an ambulance to Mangaluru for advanced treatment. But a fallen tree at Kudremukh left the ambulance stranded on the road for more than an hour. As the ambulance did not have a ventilator and life support system, the patient could not be saved.

This incident made Padmanabha Kamath K., head of the Department of Cardiology at Kasturba Medical College, determined to make some difference to this situation as the patient had been referred to him. The doctors from Kaveri Memorial Charitable Hospital at Kalasa who had referred the patient also joined in the effort as they had been looking for an ambulance with advanced life support system since some years to save the lives of such patients. Dr. Kamath and Vikram Prabhu, doctor from Kaveri hospital, have now succeeded in procuring “life on wheels” with donations from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL), Mangaluru-based Karnataka Bank, doctors from Cardiology at Doorstep Foundation, Mangaluru, and others.

The ambulance with a ventilator and life support system is ready in Kalasa for commissioning by mid-February. It will be stationed in the Kaveri hospital and maintained by it. Dr. Prabhu told The Hindu that a corpus of ₹5 lakh had been collected from donors for its maintenance. “We will collect ₹500 to be payable to the driver and only the diesel cost from poor patients,” Dr. Prabhu said, and added that the ambulance would be exclusively reserved for transporting patients with complications related to the heart and lungs as it will take two hours from Kalasa to reach any hospital with advanced treatment facilities and experts. “Health care does not mean only diagnosis and treatment. It includes safe transportation of patients too,” said Dr. Kamath, who manages four WhatsApp groups of doctors spread across India for mutual consultation and guidance. In addition, he manages a helpline with a WhatsApp number to offer guidance to medical professionals on cardiac cases. Doctors from those groups have also contributed for purchase the hi-tech ambulance.

164,2020/01/26,"Agriculture will get priority in State Budget, says Yediyurappa","Vowing to stand by the State’s farmers, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday said that the next State Budget will accord priority to agriculture.

Speaking at the valedictory function of a krishi mela, organised as part of the annual Suttur Jathra near here, the Chief Minister regretted that the farmers of the country have not been able to lead a life of financial security and respect, even seven decades after Independence.

“If need be, I will even take loans to stand by the farmers. I will do whatever it takes to remove their tears,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

Recalling the floods that ravaged parts of the State when he was Chief Minister in 2008, forcing his Ministerial colleagues to take up relief works at affect villages, Mr. Yediyurappa said that a similar situation had arisen soon after he took over as Chief Minister last July.

Though the State was staring at a severe drought before he became the Chief Minister, the situation changed dramatically within a week of his assuming charge, he claimed. Heavy rains lashed the State, causing floods and filling up parched reservoirs, which in turn helped provide water to agricultural fields.

He promised the paddy farmers that the State government will procure their produce by providing support price.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who participated in the World Economic Forum at Davos earlier this month, claimed that crucial agreements had been signed with industrialists for bringing fresh investment to the State.

Describing his visit to Davos as “fruitful”, Mr. Yediyurappa said he would closely pursue the agreements and ensure that fresh investments come to Karnataka

165,2020/01/26,"Agriculture Dept. wants farmers to get smartphone to receive benefits of support price for ragi, paddy","Farmers may have to get a smartphone and have access to the Internet to get the benefit of the support price announced for select agriculture produce.

Officers of the Agriculture Department are insisting that the farmers get a smartphone and install the ‘Bele Darshak’ application to keep a tab on the crop survey conducted by the government to avoid losing the benefit.

Recently, the government opened centres to procure paddy and ragi at support price. The support price has been fixed at ₹1,815 and ₹3,150 per quintal of paddy and ragi respectively.

Small growers, who want to sell their produce, have to register their names in advance at the centres with relevant documents.

Only those farmers, who grow paddy or ragi, as per the data recorded through the crop survey conducted by the department, are eligible to get the benefit.

But, many farmers could not register because the crop survey data, already with the procurement centres, did not match their claims.

This led to arguments between the farmers and the officers. The officers asked such farmers to install a mobile app and raise an objection to the crop survey data.

Rangaswamy, a farmer Koravangala, said he hardly uses his phone. “I don’t know how to install the application and get Internet. The government is making our life miserable,” he said.

The officers maintained that the application could be useful.

K. Madhusudan, Joint Director of Agriculture Department, said the discrepancies could be there in the survey data because of many factors. When the surveyor visited the plot, he could have wrongly registered the crop.

“However, the farmers can easily get it corrected with the help of the app. A supervisor will revisit the plot and verify the information and revise the data,” he said. When it was brought to his notice that many would not get access to mobile phones, the officer said the farmers also had an option to submit their objections at Raitha Samparka Kendra or the offices of Agriculture Assistants.

“The last day to register for selling at support price is February 28. So far, about 3,000 farmers have registered. They have sufficient time to raise objections,” he said.

H.R. Naveen Kumar, Hassan district president of Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, alleged this was a trick by the government to minimise the number of beneficiaries.

“How can you expect farmers, who are already facing many problems, to purchase a smartphone, and install an app. This is inhuman. By minimising the number of beneficiaries through these tricks, it may well do away with the concept of support price itself soon,” he claimed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/agriculture-dept-wants-farmers-to-get-smartphone-to-receive-benefits-of-support-price-for-ragi-paddy/article30659997.ece

170,2020/01/26,Mongolian geese find a new home in Davangere,"While the Kundavada lake on the outskirts of Davangere city, which was the winter abode for many bar-headed geese from Mongolia, has failed to attract these winged visitors this time, the Kondajji lake located nearby has emerged as their new home.

The bar-headed geese, known for their ability to fly in extreme altitude and weather conditions, used to arrive at Kundavada lake in the third week of November.

As the temperature declines in Mongolia in the last week of October, these birds migrate to comparatively warmer places in India.

They used to stay at Kundavada lake till the first week of March. The lake is spread over 260 acres and is also a source of drinking water for Davangere city.

The bird enthusiasts have recorded the presence of bar-headed geese in Kundavada lake from 2012.

Shishupala S., professor of microbiology at Davangere University and a bird photographer, told The Hindu that, he had photographed a bar-headed goose with a tag that read ‘X90’ in November, 2015.

Further enquiries revealed that the bird was tagged by an ornithologist in Mongolia, he said.

Large tracts of agricultural land in the vicinity of Kundavada have been converted into residential layouts in recent times. The Department of Horticulture has established a glasshouse on the bank of the lake on a three-acre area in 2018.

In November 2018, only 10 bar-headed geese came to Kundavada. Last November, not a single goose visited the lake.

The geese used to feed on the grass, corn, and the grain in the agricultural fields near Kundavada.

Mr. Shishupala said that the change in the land use in Kundavada has prevented these birds from coming here. The conversion of agricultural land into residential layouts has resulted in a shortage of food for them.

He said that an increase in human movement near Kundavada lake and unabated construction works here have annoyed these sensitive birds. The reflection of light from the glasshouse has also disturbed their flight and movements, he said.

Another reason suspected for geese abandoning Kundavada is the indiscriminate usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by the farmers in the vicinity. In wake of birds staying away from Kundavada lake, it is necessary to test the water samples here, he said.

Interestingly, following the loss of habitat in Kundavada, the bar-headed geese have made the Kondajji lake, located in a forest 14 kilometre from Davangere, their new abode. The geese were sighted in Kondajji for the first time in January, 2019, and in the second week of January this year,

As many as 430 geese have been counted here. The onus is on the Department of Forest and Wildlife now to ensure minimum human interference near Kondajji lake to ensure comfortable stay for the birds, Mr. Shishupala added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mongolian-geese-find-a-new-home-in-davangere/article30658651.ece
171,2020/01/26,‘Impart primary education in mother tongue’,"Poet H.S. Venkateshamurthy, who will preside over the 85th Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Kalaburagi, has stressed upon the need to impart primary education in children’s mother tongue.

Interacting with presspersons at a programme organised by Shivamogga district unit of Karnataka State Working Journalists’ Association here on Saturday, he said children will be able to understand the socio-cultural environment in a better manner if they were educated in the mother tongue.

He said that academic research has proved that children who pursue education in their mother tongue at the primary level have better comprehension skills, learning competence and articulation abilities. Education in Kannada will help students to get a better understanding of social realities, cultural and biodiversity, crop varieties of the land, etc.

Expressing regret that a major chunk of Kannadigas who had pursued education in English from the primary level have remained ignorant of the rich cultural traditions of the land, he said that such persons have failed to acquire the sensibilities and orientation necessary to enjoy the vibrant folk art forms and diverse foods of Karnataka. Imparting education in English at the primary level has paved the way for a cultural crisis, he said, adding that at the sammelan, he would demand that the State government make Kannada the medium of instruction at the primary level.

He said that politicians should display determination to implement resolutions passed at the sammelan on issues related to protecting the interests of Kannada language and culture.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/impart-primary-education-in-mother-tongue/article30656744.ece

New voters were given Electors Photo Identity Cards (EPIC), centenarians who voted in every election and newly-weds who cast their votes soon after their wedding were felicitated. Polling officials too who had done a good job during the Assembly and parliamentary elections were also felicitated.

Inaugurating the National Voters’ Day programme at JSS College in Dharwad on Saturday, Principal District and Sessions Judge Eshappa Bhute said that every citizen who had completed 18 years of age should compulsorily enrol in the voters’ list and also exercise their franchise without fail. “Refraining from participating in the electoral process amounts to abstaining for rights and duties guaranteed by the Constitution. It is only through active participation in the electoral process that a strong and democratic government can be elected,” he said.

Judge Bhute said the elections were the lifeline of a democratic set-up and every vote is crucial in bringing an eligible politician to power. Expressing concern over the declining percentage of polling in urban pockets, Judge Bhute said, “To keep alive the democracy and elect the government of our choice, 100% participation in polling is needed.”

Senior civil judge and Member Secretary of District Legal Services Authority R.S. Chinnannavar termed voting as the biggest weapon given by the Constitution to every citizen to elect a good government and ensure development.

Deputy Commissioner Deepa Cholan, who presided over the programme, said that only active voters’ participation would make the Indian democracy more vibrant. Ms. Cholan asked youth to become ambassadors of polling and to motivate others to visit the nearest polling booths and enrol.

175,2020/01/26,"Ahead of Budget, HKCCI lists out demands for region","The Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HKCCI), a body of industrialists and traders of Kalyana Karnataka region, has written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman urging her to incorporate the demands concerning the region in the Budget for 2020-21.

The letter was jointly written by Amarnath C. Patil and Shashikanth B. Patil, president and secretary of HKCCI respectively and it mentioned a number of pending projects and demands.

One of the major demands was the special grants for the Kalyana Karnataka Regional Development Board (KKRDB) that came into existence to implement the special status accorded to the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution.

The Union government has not given any assistance to the Kalyana KKRDB stemming from Article 371(J) of the Constitution. The government has provided funding to Telangana and Vidharba regions which have special status and also enhanced assistance to North-Eastern regions by 21%. Hence, the KKRDB should also be given central assistance, the officer-bearers said in the letter.

The HKCCI also expressed its discontentment over the non-implementation of the National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ), and the Kalaburagi Railway Division, which were sanctioned in 2013.

They said that the Centre sanctioned NIMZ in 2013 and it has the potential of industrialisation of Kalaburagi district and providing employment to 2.6 lakh youths of the region.

Furthermore, they added that the

Railway division at Kalaburagi was announced in 2013 and that same year the foundation stone for the same was laid.

They added that 42 acres of land was acquired and earmarked for the Kalaburagi Railway Division and the land so acquired had been insulated by fencing.

“In the absence of a division of its own for Kalaburagi, the Kalyana Karnataka region is fragmented between five railway zones making it difficult for the people of the region,” they said in the letter.

The other demands include the establishment of a All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, procurement of equipment required for night landing at the newly-built Kalaburagi Airport, the establishment of Special Economic Zones, development of Solapur – Karnool six-lane National Highway to pass through Kalaburagi city, and projects to addressing the drinking water crisis in Kalaburagi city.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ahead-of-budget-hkcci-lists-out-demands-for-region/article30656731.ece

Some people captured the movements on their phones and these video clips are now doing the rounds. Hundreds of people from different places visit Shravanabelgola every day. The number of tourists on weekends is higher.

Last year, ahead of Mahamastakabhisheka, leopards were spotted at Chandragiri.

Then, the Forest Department had placed cages and captured them. Chandragiri is the place where the Jain saint Bhadrabahu and his disciples including Chandragupta Mourya are believed to have spent his last days.

‘Exercise caution’

When The Hindu contacted Sivaram Banu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, on Saturday, he said cages had been kept with baits around Chandragiri to capture them. “Leopards are normally shy animals. They do not come out of their places. However, we have been making public announcements on the need to be careful,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-leopard-sightings-at-chandragiri-cause-alarm/article30655081.ece
177,2020/01/26,Kodagu Medical College hospital in expansion mode,"Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), which became operational four years ago in Madikeri, is being expanded with the foundation stone for a 450-bed hospital attached to the institute to be laid on Monday.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will give a start to the construction on the existing teaching hospital premises. Once the 450-hospital facility (300-bed unit and 150-bed unit) is ready in about two years, the number of beds for healthcare services will rise to 750 as the existing hospital has 300 beds.

Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Medical Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Minister in-charge of Kodagu V. Somanna will be present. MLA Appachu Ranjan addressed presspersons at Madikeri on Saturday to present details about the hospital project.

KIMS has an intake of 150 seats and currently 600 students are pursuing a medical degree and post-graduate courses. In 2016, the district hospital was converted into the teaching hospital of KIMS and it was in need of an upgrade in complying with the norms of the Medical Council of India. Accordingly, the hospital is now being expanded with additional 450 beds at a cost of ₹100 crore. The construction for 300 beds will be take place on the existing hospital premises while the 150-bed facility will come up on the premises of women and children’s hospital.

Cariappa K.B., Dean and Director, KIMS, told The Hindu that the expansion of the hospital will benefit the people of Kodagu as well as neighbouring taluks since the outpatient load had risen to 900 from 200 in three years. Multispeciality services will be convenient for those looking to Mysuru and other places for those services as Madikeri has only a few hospitals and nursing homes under private ownership.

Radiology department

On an average, 75% of beds are occupied in the hospital and the expansion will give rise to adding up of more speciality departments, he added. “We are in need of manpower for the radiology department as the hospital is equipped with ultrasound and CT scan equipment,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kodagu-medical-college-hospital-in-expansion-mode/article30655079.ece

He was speaking at the National Voters Day programme in Kumar Gandharva Rang Mandir.

“If democracy is to survive, everybody should vote. India is the biggest democracy. But our polling percentage seems to be falling, at least in areas like cities. In some cities, people are not voting despite polling day being a holiday. This should stop. We should aim for 100% voting,” he urged.

Additional Deputy Commissioner Ashok Dudagunti urged the youth to come forward and spread the message of responsible voting. He expressed concern that the educated were shying away from voting.

Zilla panchayat CEO K.V. Rajendra regretted that youth would think twice about spending ten minutes at a polling booth. He recalled the efforts of B.R. Ambedkar and his team in drafting the Constitution. He asked everyone to vote without fear or favour and emerge as champions of democracy.

179,2020/01/26,"Sagarmala: Fisherfolk call off stir, but resolve against project grows stronger","On Saturday, after a fortnight of sleepless nights and tense days, Susheela Harikantra, Revati Harikantra, Anjali Arshekar, and several other fisherwomen were relieved as their leaders, lawyers, and representatives of various organisations decided to temporarily suspend their agitation opposing the Sagarmala Project. This was following a High Court stay on the project

For a fortnight, hundreds had been taking turns to spend the night under a pandal erected adjacent to the Deputy Commissioner’s office facing Rabindranath Tagore Beach in Karwar. Braving the winds, companions of their sea life, these women, along with their men and children, stopped fishing and closed fish market and spent nights under the pandal. They were worried that their future and livelihood would be shattered by the project.

‘Can’t afford to lose more’

While they have suspended their agitation for now, they have become stern in their resolve that they want the project shelved. They said they had lost around 13 beaches for various development projects, including Seabird Naval Base, and they could not afford to lose more, which would result in displacing more fishermen.

“The Karwar seashore has already reduced a lot and fishermen community has sacrificed in the interest of development. Now they want to take away whatever is remaining. Where should we go?” president of Chittakula Gram Panchayat and member of the fishermen community Raju Tandela told The Hindu.

Construction of the northern breakwater proposed under the first phase of the second stage of development of Karwar Port (which is under the State government), now funded under the Sagarmala Project of the Union government, is not new, but one that has seen a delayed start.

Although planned 15 years ago, the proposal did not attract any bids from competent companies in either 2004 or 2008 when tenders were floated. It was revived in 2017 and brought under the Sagarmala Project. The ‘bhoomi puja’ was performed during the fag end of the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government’s tenure.

Even as questions are being raised over the sudden protest and politics surrounding it, green activist and executive editor of Karavali Munjavu daily T.B. Harikant explained: “They (fishermen) thought it would not take off just like it had happened earlier. But as the work started and details of the master plan emerged, they understood that it is a do-or-die situation. They want to save what remains.”

Sagarmala Project – Development of Karwar Port (2nd Stage) Proposed under first phase: Construction of north breakwater and extension of berth; total cost ₹276 crore

Proposed under master plan: Construction of five additional berths; other facilities, including warehouses, cold storage, and buildings; desalination plant; transit sheds; railway marshalling yard; and effluent treatment plant; total cost ₹1,178 crore

What officials say: DPR for master plan yet to be approved; it will help develop commercial port; breakwater will stop siltation; will ensure tranquillity in the harbour

What fishermen, activists say: The project will snatch away their livelihood; it will shrink the seashore and lead to sea erosion; no proper study done on environmental impact; no proper planning done for the project; no clarity on the project details

Vinayak Harikantra, a young fisherman, said that despite a lot of opposition during the public hearing held by the Deputy Commissioner in February 2018, the project got clearance. One of the main objections was that the project was prepared without taking into consideration its adverse environmental impact — an issue raised during the public hearing in 2018. Issues such as sea erosion owing to the construction of breakwater, what happens to Kone Nala, a storm-water drain that carries sewage to the sea, silt, and train connectivity to the port were also raised.

Erosion threat ruled out

Speaking to The Hindu, Port Officer of Karwar Port Taranth Rathod, however, ruled out the possibility of sea erosion and claimed that the beach would actually extend after the construction of breakwater, which is being taken up initially.

“The breakwater will actually bring down silt accumulation and reduce the maintenance cost of the port. Dredging will also ensure tranquillity,” he claimed.

But fishermen and Karwar residents see the breakwater as the first step towards reduction in the seashore and imminent destruction of their livelihood. Hundreds of fishermen of Baithkol and Aligadda use the fishing harbour adjacent to the commercial port.

President of the Karwar Boat Union Venkatesh Tandela accused that officials were hiding details of the larger master plan and were just focussing on the first phase work on breakwater to mislead the public.

Under the master plan for Karwar Port, development works worth ₹1,178 crore (initially ₹1,193 crore) have been proposed and as per the officials, the detailed project report for the next 30 years is yet to approved.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dviidt/article30655059.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGKARWAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sagarmala-fisherfolk-call-off-stir-but-resolve-against-project-grows-stronger/article30655061.ece

The term of the previous industrial policy expired last year.

Addressing presspersons after his return from World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said he had promised investors that hurdles for investments in Karnataka would be removed. He met about 40 investors at the WEF with his team of Ministers and officers.

“As per their demand, we will rectify all administrative problems within a month or two and legal problems in the next couple of months by amending existing laws,” said Mr. Yediyurappa. Investors had some doubts and apprehensions to the “cumbersome procedures” in starting their units and he had assured them of solving their problems related to infrastructure and land, Mr. Yediyurappa added.

The visit to Davos assumed significance since Karnataka has decided to hold the Global Investors Meet in Bengaluru in November 2020.

The Chief Minister, flanked by Large- and Medium-scale Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, said that about 12,000 acres of land was readily available for investors in the State.

Admitting that it was difficult to predict inflow of investments right now, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “When we began our tour, we were slightly sceptical about its outcome, but it would go a long way in Karnataka’s development.”

The Chief Minister said the most significant agreement during his Davos visit was with WEF managing director Murat Sonmez on establishing a “Centre for Internet Ethical Things” which would go a long way in inviting investments in the service and IT/biotechnology sectors.

Highlighting the other developments, he said that while Lulu Group’s investment would help farmers in developing food transport chain, Novo Nordisk would invest in health sector (diabetics).",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-to-unveil-investor-friendly-industrial-policy-in-coming-session/article30654785.ece

It was initially speculated that the elephant, believed to be around 15 years, suffered electric shock on coming in contact with a live wire and collapsed. But veterinarian Mujib, who treated it, dismissed the possibility.

Dung examination indicated that the elephant was suffering from dysentery; the stomach was infected, possibly on account of drinking contaminated water or consuming agricultural produce in fields sprayed with chemicals, said Dr. Mujib.

The elephant mustered enough strength to haul itself up and walk for nearly 100 metres, but collapsed again owing to stress induced by the commotion of locals gathering at the farm, he added.

“A second round of treatment commenced, but the elephant was slow in responding this time around,” Dr. Mujib said, expressing doubt about the tusker’s chance of survival. The area is close to Veeranahosahalli range of Nagarahole National Park, but the elephant is outside the forest boundary. A team of Forest Department officials are at the spot and will keep vigil while the veterinarian monitors the elephant’s condition.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i0jtbb/article30654744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TUSK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dehydrated-wild-tusker-battles-for-life-in-hunsur/article30654745.ece
186,2020/01/26,"Cabinet expansion: Differences among bypoll winners, losers","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s impending task of expanding his ministry appears to be tricky now with more contenders for berths than he can possibly accommodate, including party-hoppers who lost in the bypolls.

Now differences seem to be cropping from within the camp of migrants on who should get priority.

The former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who has staked claim for a ministerial berth despite his loss in the bypolls from Hunsur, on Saturday said he could not have given up his constituency without contesting the elections.

Mr. Vishwanath, who quit the JD(S) and joined the BJP before contesting the election, reasoned that he entered the poll fray from Hunsur despite the assurance of a nomination to the Legislative Council as he was averse to the idea of giving up the constituency from where he had been elected in the 2018 elections. “So, I chose to enter the poll fray,” he said.

Council seat offer

He was reacting to a statement made by BJP MLA S.T. Somashekar at the annual Suttur Jatra near here that Mr. Vishwanath had turned down an offer made by Mr. Yediyurappa, prior to the bypolls, to become a Minister through a nomination to the Legislative Council.

Mr. Somashekar said Mr. Yediyurappa had, prior to the bypolls, made it clear that new entrants to the BJP would not be accommodated in the ministry if they lost the elections and had warned Mr. Vishwanath against contesting.

But, Mr. Vishwanath said he was confident of becoming a part of the ministry and said Mr. Yediyurappa had assured him of a berth prior to the bypolls. He cited the example of the BJP government at the Centre accommodating the late Arun Jaitley in the Cabinet despite his loss in the polls.

A similar offer was made to the former Minister R. Shankar. “He was told that he would be accommodated in the ministry after he enters the Legislative Council in May. Hence, Mr. Shankar would be made a Minister as per the promise given by the Chief Minister,” contended Mr. Somashekar. Mr. Shankar chose to stay out of the contest after he was told by the Chief Minister that the party would field a different candidate with a better chance of victory from his constituency.

Referring to Mr. Yediyurappa’s promise, after his return from Davos, to expand the ministry in three days, Mr. Somashekar said they were confident that all the 11 new entrants to the BJP who had been re-elected to the Assembly would become Ministers. He denied that the migrants were bringing pressure on the Chief Minister to expand the Ministry at the earliest. “We are hopeful that the expansion will take place soon,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-expansion-differences-among-bypoll-winners-losers/article30654736.ece
187,2020/01/26,Coronavirus: First suspected case quarantined in Bengaluru,"A middle-aged person from Bengaluru, who returned from Wuhan city in China on January 19, has been kept under observation at the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which has infected a large number of people in China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and the United States.

This is the first suspected case of the virus in Karnataka. The man’s samples (blood and throat swab) have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Although State health officials say they have learnt “unofficially” from the NIV that the result was negative, an official communication is awaited.

Apart from this person, two others from Bengaluru who returned from a trip to Beijing and Wuhan, apart from four Chinese nationals who are on a business trip to Bengaluru, have also been isolated. While the two from Bengaluru have been isolated in their homes, the Chinese nationals are in a hotel. Although all six people are asymptomatic as of now, they are being tracked on a daily basis.

B.G. Prakash Kumar, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu that the person quarantined at RGICD was found to have cough and cold a day after his return. “This person returned on January 19 and when our officials visited his house, they found him having cough and cold. As he had not gone out of his house since returning, only his family members are being tracked for symptoms.”

“Although the NIV has communicated to us unofficially that his samples of are negative, we are waiting for the official communication,” Dr. Kumar said.

As per the standard operating procedure, isolated passengers, even if asymptomatic, will be kept under observation for 28 days. Mandatory thermal screening of all passengers who travelled from Chinese cities, apart from Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, is being done at Kempegowda International Airport.

Dr. Kumar said the Health Department would continue to isolate passengers arriving from mainland China over the next few days. The department has also identified a 10-bed isolation ward at RGICD in Bengaluru and Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru.

He was reacting to reports that the former Minister R. Shankar had said he could not be denied ministership though he had not contested elections, as Mr. Savadi, who had lost an election in the past, had been made Deputy Chief Minister. He said the Chief Minister had the supreme authority about Cabinet expansion and he would take a decision about including migrants who lost elections. He added that Cabinet expansion may happen within a week.

He said there was no truth in the allegation that the migrants were emotionally blackmailing the Chief Minister. “We have regard for leaders such as A.H. Vishwanath and N.

189,2020/01/26,Migrant workers’ ID verification drive: Report likely by Monday,"The government has sought to know if there was a specific complaint and the nature of it that led the police to conduct a verification of the identity cards of migrant workers in Kodagu on Thursday.

The Kodagu police, who clarified that it was a “routine process” and denied any link to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) or the National Population Register (NPR), is expected to submit the details to the government by Monday.

Held in the backdrop of the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the NRC, the drive had triggered speculation that it was part of the NRC and had drawn flak.

P. Manivannan, Secretary, Department of Labour, said he had sought a few clarifications as it pertained to workers and wished to know whether it was done last year as well and the reason behind it.

Kodagu Superintendent of Police Suman D. Pennekar said on Thursday that the ID verification was conducted following a few crimes by some of migrant workers in the past and as tracing the accused had become a difficult task.

Though the verification is conducted at the local station level every year, the police decided to do an online check and had asked workers to assemble at a centralised place, she stated.

Mr. Manivannan said if there was a specific complaint, then the police had the powers to check and he wished to know the nature of the complaint.

“In case there was a complaint following which the police acted, it does not amount to any violation of rights,” he said.

Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy said the ID check pertained to the Police Department and no report had been sought from the district administration.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/migrant-workers-id-verification-drive-report-likely-by-monday/article30654673.ece
190,2020/01/26,Death of tourists: Kerala CM seeks compensation from Nepal,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday requested the Centre to persuade Nepal to compensate the kin of eight Keralites who died due to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning from a malfunctioning heater in a hotel room at Kathmandu last week.

In a letter to Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar, Mr. Vijayan said prima facie evidence suggested that negligence on the part of service providers and failure of the Nepal government’s regulatory mechanisms had caused the untimely deaths.

Mr. Vijayan hoped the Centre would convince Nepal to investigate the tragedy so that the shocked and traumatised families of the victims would get closure.

Earlier, Mr. Vijayan visited the house of Praveen, 39, at Chenkottukonam here. Praveen, his wife Saranya, 34, and their children Sreebhadra, 9, Aarcha, 8, and Abhinav, 7, died in their sleep in the hotel room.

Mr. Vijayan spent almost an hour at the house consoling Praveen’s father Krishnan Nair and mother Prasanna. Thiruvananthapuram Mayor K. Sreekumar accompanied Mr. Vijayan. He also paid homage at the spot where the family members were interred.

Praveen’s friend Renjith Kumar, 39, who hailed from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode, his wife Indu, 34, and their two-year-old son Vaishnav also died in the “accidental carbon monoxide” poisoning.

By some accounts, the two families had huddled together for warmth in Renjith’s room. They were part of a 15-member group who were in Nepal for on a pleasure trip.

Renjith’s son escaped death by sleeping in another room occupied by the group. Praveen and his family had moved into Renjith’s room after their heater failed and children complained of extreme cold.

191,2020/01/26,"Lakhs line up between Kasargode and Kaliyikkavila for LDF human chain against CAA, NRC","Tens of thousands of people joined hands to form a human chain stretching from one end of the State to the other on Sunday evening in a mass protest organised by the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Leaders of the Left parties joined the chain at various locations. CPI(M) politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai was the first link in the chain at Kasargode in the north while Politburo member M.A. Baby positioned himself as the last link at Kaliyikkavila, bordering Tamil Nadu.

The Opposition UDF which had come forward to join hands with the Left parties in the initial days of the anti-CAA protests, however kept away despite fervent and repeated appeals by the ruling front for a united resistance movement.

The chain extended from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod via Kollam, Idukki, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur on one side of the national highway. The LDF activists from Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts joined the chain in Alappuzha.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran and leaders of other coalition parties joined the chain at the Martyrs’ column, Palayam, the same venue where Mr. Vijayan had shared the dais with Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala in a dharna against the CAA in December, before the UDF decided to pull out of the joint campaign.

Ministers T.M. Thomas Isaac, A.K. Balan, K. Raju, M.M. Mani, G. Sudhakaran, V.S. Sunil Kumar, T.P. Ramakrishnan, A.K. Saseendran, K.K. Shylaja, E.P. Jayarajan, Ramachandran Kadannapally and E. Chandrasekharan, LDF convenor A. Vijayaraghavan, MLAs, film personalities and social, cultural and religious leaders were among those who formed part of the chain in other districts.

Wearing headbands and hats with the message “Reject CAA, NRC”, the participants read out the Preamble of the Constitution and took a pledge to protect secular values. Leaders addressing public meetings organised as part of the programme called for the repeal of the CAA and protection of democratic and constitutional values.

Later addressing a public meeting at Palayam, Mr. Vijayan slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it of endangering constitutional and secular values and jeopardising peace. He said the people had seen through the move to discriminate against minorities by determining citizenship on the basis of religion.

Reiterating the State government’s resolve not to implement the CAA and the NRC, he flagged the need to defend the Constitution at any cost.

Ernakulam joins human chain

Thousands joined the 'Manushya Mahasrinkala', the human chain organised under the aegis of the LDF in Ernakulam district as part of the statewide campaign against CCA and Citizen's Register. The Ernakulam district joined the human chain across Kerala at Pongam, near Karukutty. The chain of people linking hands and taking a pledge to protect the Constitution of India ended in the district before Aroor.

An estimated five lakh people may have joined the efforts, CPI(M) sources said. The people began to assemble after about 3 pm and by 3.30 pm the chain was near complete. The local leaders of the CPI(M) and CPI recited an oath and read out the preamble of the Constitution before the dispersal of the party workers and supporters. No untoward incidents were reported during the human chain campaign. -- Our Correspondent

The Devaswom Assistance Commissioner sent the letter on January 21, seeking policemen from the community for the February8 ‘Thaipooyam’ festival duty at the temple. The Ernakulam District Police Association urged the city police Commissioner not to deploy police for the festival duty on the basis of religion.

194,2020/01/26,Science expo awaits crowds,"A science exhibition being held at Yuvakshetra Institute of Management Studies (YIMS), Mundur, as part of the 32nd Kerala Science Congress was yet to pick up momentum on Saturday. The organisers said they expected more crowds, especially school children, on Sunday and Monday.

Although there are stalls of various scientific agencies and Kudumbashree and Khadi, most of them look like information providers, rather than curiosity generators. The ISRO, whose stalls usually evoke curiosity about rockets and satellites among children, is confined in a small room, though set at the starting point of the exhibition. Models of cryogenic engines, however, has the potential to tickle the scientific mind. Next to ISRO, Zoological Survey of India showcased the biodiversity of the Western Ghats. The National Institute of Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, ICAR Sugarcane Breeding Institute Research Centre, ICAR Central Plantation Research Institute, and ICAR Central Institute of Fisheries Technology had all their own products on display.

Kerala State Bamboo Corporation had some of its latest products on display. The Khadi Board stall had women crowding around some modern saris and sofa covers. A Ham radio stall, though with minimal equipment, could make visitors stop and ask ‘what’s this?’ Geopolymer products of researcher Thomas John V. replacing the conventional portland cement had some unique charm, though they were yet to come out of the laboratory. The Integrated Rural Technology Centre (IRTC) had two stalls, one for curios such as terracotta jewellery and the other to show the production of biogas and biocompost..

Disappointed

The Kudumbashree stall owners were disappointed, however. “The crowds reaching here do not buy anything. They are mere viewers. We are disappointed,” said Supriya from Alathur, who makes 32 products out of jackfruit, including halwa.

The stalls of Agency for Non-Conventional Energy and Rural Technology, Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, National Transportation Planning and Research Centre, Worldwide Fund for Nature India, Kerala Forest Research Institute, Kerala State Biodiversity Board, and Regional Agricultural Research Station, Pattambi, had lots of information to provide. Leaflets were plenty for the visitors to carry. When the Malabar Botanical Garden displayed a wide variety of acuatic plants, M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation’s Community Biodiversity Centre, Kalpetta, had several legumes, pulses, paddies, bulbs, roots, and spices on display.

197,2020/01/26,‘The Kung Fu Master’ movie review: Unadulterated action makes up for the many flaws,"A typical action film in Malayalam comes loaded not just with action. It is often a few minutes of fist fights sandwiched in between a long-winded family or political drama. This is where Abrid Shine’s latest outing The Kung Fu Master differs, dedicating much of its second half to just pure action, not the mindless variety, but some fluid show of the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu.

But the novelty in the action is sorely lacking in the script, for which clearly much effort has not been spared. Probably, the director did not want to take his attention away from what he set out to do – to create an all-out action film. The story is thus just an excuse for all the action that is to follow.

Part of the first half is spent in building the picture of a family oozing so much happiness that one knows that a tragedy is waiting for them, as so often happens in such scripts.

The Kung Fu Master Starring: Neeta Pillai, Jiji Scaria

Direction: Abrid Shine

These parts of the film are marked by some lousy acting and clueless writing. Rishi (Jiji Scaria), a Kung Fu trainer, becomes the target of a gang of criminals led by Louis Antony (Sanoop D), after he turns an informer for the police.

Only Rishi survives the inevitable attack that follows. Rishi, along with his Kung Fu-trained sister Rithu (Neeta Pillai) sets out to hunt down the gang.

The ones who manage to survive this bland first half are in for a treat. The director too seems to be in a hurry to finish off these initial parts, to reveal all the hard work he has put in, for the action sequences featuring some authentic kung fu.

That the leading lady Neeta Pillai (who debuted in Abrid Shine’s forgettable Poomaram), is one of the main fighters makes it even better.

She, as well as Jiji Scaria, appears convincing in delivering each of those mind-blowing kicks or those high speed punches, which leave the opponents shaken. Theirs are also the only acting performances worth speaking about in the movie.

The Kung Fu Master showcases the kind of action that Malayalam cinema has not witnessed before. It makes the film stand on its own despite having one of the shoddiest of scripts in recent times.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kuq98l/article30657141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-kunfu-still,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-kung-fu-master-film-review-unadulterated-action-makes-up-for-the-many-flaws/article30657142.ece
198,2020/01/26,Alumni Awards presented at VIT,"Former Chief Justice of India and former Governor of Kerala Justice P. Sathasivam said that the progress of any country, big or small, depends primarily on the standard of education that is imparted at all levels.

In his address at the 25th annual alumni meet at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), organised by Vellore Institute of Technology Alumni Association’s (VITAA) , here on Sunday, Mr. Sathasivam said that whatever be the subject — arts, science, literature, law or technology — one should have a sound ground in it. And that is precisely what every institute or training centre has to ensure at the fundamental phase of each discipline.

He added that all educational institutions should aim at transforming students into resourceful young men and women.

Mr. Sathasivam presented the distinguished alumni awards to alumni during the function. He further said, “Students are often referred as an invaluable investment for future. They are on every count the moulders of a better tomorrow. That is why eminent academicians insist on giving them a cent percent fool-proof coaching and training on whatever discipline they opt for.”

Chancellor of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), G. Viswanathan, in his presidential address said that China was declared as a Socialist Republic in 1949 whereas India was declared as Democratic Republic four months later in 1950. When you compare China and India in terms of per capita income during 1950, India’s was 180 dollar more than China. In 1979, China overtook India by 13 dollars and now in 2020, China is ahead of India by about 8,000 dollars. India’s per capita income is 2,200 dollars and China is about 10,000 dollars.

“India can very well compete with China as we have the potential but we lag behind in education, especially in higher education. That is why I have been urging Centre and State governments to increase their expenditure on education as our spending for education has not crossed 4% of GDP even though several Commissions right from Dr. Radhakrishnan Commission recommended 6% of GDP be spent for education so that students from more poor and middle class students get scholarship,” he added.

VIT vice presidents Sankar Viswanathan, Sekar Viswanathan, executive director Sandhya Pentareddy and pro-vice vhancellor S. Narayanan took part in the function.

200,2020/01/26,TNPSC scam: Accused re-marked scripts in a vehicle on the move and replaced them,"The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police on Sunday arrested a TNPSC record clerk H. Omkanthan (45) on charges of handing over the key of a safe containing answer script bundles to prime suspect Jayakumar of Chennai who made fresh entries on select papers from another vehicle on the move and replaced them at an opportune time. The police conducted a search in the premises of Omkanthan and seized a couple of mobile phones.

Investigators said the accused had in a midnight operation taken away from a vehicle the answer scripts of the Group-IV Services examination conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) and tampered with them before replacing them.

Investigation revealed that Jayakumar here approached Omkanthan seeking his help to access the answer scripts and offered ₹15 lakh as bribe. After taking ₹2 lakh as advance, the clerk managed to get posted at Ramanathapuram district for examination duty on September 1, 2019.

Omkanthan was part of a team comprising another TNPSC employee Manickavel and a police constable that was entrusted with the task of transporting the answer scripts from the Sivaganga treasury to the TNPSC headquarters in Chennai in a parcel vehicle. After collecting the sealed bundles of answer scripts around 8 p.m., the team left for Chennai and Jayakumar followed it in another vehicle.

At 10.30 p.m., the team stopped for dinner. While others were busy in the restaurant, Omkanthan handed over the key of the safe to Jayakumar who took away select bundles to his car. During the next few hours, he made fresh entries in the answer scripts of candidates from whom he had taken money. However, he could mark answers only on 39 answer scripts owing to shortage of time.

When the escort team stopped near Vikravandi to have tea, Jayakumar replaced the bundles, returned the key to Omkanthan and fled. The record clerk was aware that some candidates had used evaporative ink to mark answers and that Jayakumar had made fresh entries.

The answer scripts reached the TNPSC headquarters shortly after noon. The offence took place in the intervening night of September 1 and 2, 2019 along the Sivaganga-Chennai national highway.

While the search is on to apprehend Jayakumar, a special team arrested A. Balasundaraj (45) of Seelayampatti in Theni district who was a middleman in the scam.

Parrying questions on whether the TNPSC staff had checked the seal on the safe and the answer script bundles when they received the consignment, a CBCID official said investigation had revealed that both the seals were tampered with. The statement of the accused would further be corroborated with technical evidence, he said.

The CBCID has so far arrested nine persons, including three candidates in the scam.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/p0wd95/article30657557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TNPSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-scam-accused-re-marked-scripts-in-a-vehicle-on-the-move-and-replaced-them/article30657558.ece
201,2020/01/26,"Padma Awards 2020: Grateful for honour, say awardees from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry","Social worker Krishnammal Jagannathan, industrialist Venu Srinivasan and littérateur Manoj Das have been chosen for the Padma Bhushan awards from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

Carnatic vocalists C. Lalitha and C. Saroja, artist Manohar Devadoss, social worker S. Ramakrishnan, nagaswaram vidwans Kalee Shabi Mahaboob and Sheik Mahaboob Subani and IIT-Madras professor Pradeep Thalappil from Tamil Nadu, and artist V.K. Munusamy from Puducherry are the recipients of the Padma Shri awards.

Krishnammal Jagannathan, 94, heads the Land for Tillers' Freedom (LAFTI), an NGO working for the upliftment of women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and their families, particularly in the Thanjavur region. Her daughter Sathya said Ms. Jagannathan had worked extensively in areas like Kilvenmani following the massacre in 1968, when 44 people belonging to the SC community were burnt by henchmen from an intermediate caste.

“She has helped over 14,000 landless labourers become landowners and is currently helping the victims of Cyclone Gaja secure land that they had lost,” she said.

Venu Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of TVS Motor Company India, thanked the government and said, “It's a great honour and I am humbled to be recognised. This is a recognition for thousands of workers and colleagues who have worked with me – their efforts have been recognised.”

One of the leading bilingual literary figures in Odia and English, Manoj Das has an active presence in the literary and cultural scene of Puducherry. Since 1963, he has been a resident of Sri Aurobindo Ashram, where he teaches literature and Aurobindo's philosophy at Sri Aurobindo International University. “I always feel grateful in my heart for the response I get for my writings,"" he said.

Carnatic vocalists C. Saroja and C. Lalitha, known as the Bombay Sisters, came to Chennai when they were just out of their teenage years. “We came to Chennai on a Government of India scholarship and joined the Central College of Music, where Shri. Govinda Rao was teaching. We learnt under him for 50 years,” said Ms. Saroja.

It was while working on a book on Madras that Manohar Devadoss, the artist who has sketched Madurai's temples and streets in great detail, received the news that he had been selected for the Padma Shri. After a retired IAS officer, Jayanthi, gifted his drawing of Meenakshi Kalyanam to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said Mr. Modi wrote to him, appreciating his art. Mr. Devadoss, whose vision has deteriorated over the years, cannot see now.

Disability no bar

S. Ramakrishnan, founder-president of Amar Seva Sangam (ASS) in Tirunelveli, has been working towards the rehabilitation of the differently-abled in over 300 villages. Paralysed neck-down, he works on empowering those with disabilities in rural areas.

The Nagaswaram vidwans, Sheik Mahaboob Subhani and his wife Kaleeshabi Mahaboob, hail from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh and have settled in Srirangam. “We hail from a long line of musicians, who played the Chilakluripet Paani. We are the 8th generation, and our son Sheik Ferose Babu is the ninth in that line. We consider this award a recognition for our lineage,” said Mr. Mahaboob Subhani.

Pradeep Thalappil, professor, Chemistry department, Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, said he and his team had developed affordable and safe drinking water solutions using nano materials, which had already benefitted about 9 million people. V.K. Munusamy, who was chosen for the Padma Shri, has taken the art of terracotta sculpture far and wide. He learnt the skill of terracotta sculpting from his parents and has dedicated himself to this craft for over four decades. He has sculpted a wide array of unconventional objects alongside traditional sculptures.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/f08nn7/article30655331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH2701BOMBAYSISTERSJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/grateful-for-honour-say-padma-awardees-from-tn-puducherry/article30655332.ece
202,2020/01/26,CM attacks Stalin for questioning good governance recognition,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday hit out at DMK president M.K. Stalin for saying the Tamil Nadu government was not worthy of the recognition it had received on account of the State topping the Good Governance Index.

Speaking at the Tamil language martyrs’ commemoration event in Arumbakkam, Mr. Palaniswami said the State government had been bagging several recognitions and awards for its administration.

“DMK president Stalin is unable to digest the fact that AIADMK-led Tamil Nadu is the best-performing State in India. When SSI Wilson was killed by terrorists, Mr. Stalin immediately released a statement asking how Tamil Nadu can be adjudged number 1 when such instances were taking place. Mr. Stalin doesn’t even know that Tamil Nadu has not been adjudged number 1 based on just one incident, but on a comprehensive study of law and order in the State,” said Mr. Palaniswami.

Listing the achievements of the AIADMK government including construction of 10 flyovers in Chennai to reduce traffic congestion, bringing investments to create 70,000 jobs for Chennai, generating 16,151 MW power and becoming a power surplus State, creation of more manufacturing jobs and two-wheeler scheme for working class women, he said, “We promise that we will build houses for the poor and eliminate huts,” he said.

Mr. Palaniswami criticised the DMK leaders for promoting members from their own family. “Anyone can aspire to become the Chief Minister in the AIADMK. Can Durai Murugan aspire to become the CM in the DMK? There is no way. After Stalin, only Udhayanidhi Stalin will become its leader. Only in AIADMK, a person like me or O. Panneerselvam can become leader,” he said.

Mr. Palaniswami expressed confidence that an AIADMK member would become Chennai’s Mayor and that the AIADMK rule would continue in Tamil Nadu beyond 2021.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-attacks-stalin-for-questioning-good-governance-recognition/article30655328.ece
203,2020/01/26,‘Civic polls a forerunner to Assembly elections’,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said the party’s victory in the local body elections was a forerunner to the Assembly election, and called upon partymen to show similar enthusiasm and commitment in the election slated for 2021.

“Let us take a pledge to win the polls,” he said, addressing a meeting in Myiladuthurai to commemorate linguistic martyrs.

Mr. Stalin alleged that while the BJP-led Central government was treating Hindi and Sanskrit as “two eyes” and imposing Hindi wherever possible, the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu was not guided by any principle.

‘Palanquin-bearer’

“Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has become a palanquin-bearer of the BJP government. We have a Minister of Tamil Development and he has proved to be a joker. He is functioning as a Minister for Hindi and Sanskrit Development,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said by speaking “shamelessly” in favour of Sanskrit at the kumbabhishekam of Thanjavur Big temple, Mr. Pandiarajan took an open stand against Tamil.

Accusing the BJP government of driving a wedge between people by enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Nation Register of Citizens, the Act had become a reality because of the support extended by the AIADMK, he said.

“Even State governments that supported the Act had turned against it. They are adopting resolutions against the Act one by one. But Mr. Palaniswami is remaining silent and refused to allow the private resolution moved by me,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gu8xp6/article30655326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27MKSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/civic-polls-a-forerunner-to-assembly-elections/article30655327.ece
204,2020/01/26,It is a challenge to avoid artificiality and theatrical elements: Jayamohan,"If condensing the five-volume novel Ponniyin Selvan into a two-hour film is a challenge, penning dialogues for the movie is a different beast altogether.

“This is my first film based on a historical novel, and a historical film today cannot imitate the dialogues of films starring Sivaji Ganesan. It is a challenge to avoid theatrical elements and artificiality,” says writer Jayamohan, who has penned the dialogues for the film. According to him, the big task would be to keep it real and authentic to the period as well. He says Ponniyin Selvan is more a fantasy novel than historical fiction, and fantasy has always suited the medium of cinema very well. “[Director] Mani Ratnam has narrated the story through visuals while keeping at a distance the theatrical elements, and I have had to write lines that would support the visuals. I also have the task of enriching the visuals,” Mr. Jayamohan explains. When asked how a motion picture could steer clear of the language used in historical films, since kings were believed to have spoken chaste Tamil, Mr. Jayamohan clarifies that Ponniyin Selvan also has the authentic court language. “But we have handled it in such a way that it would sound like everyday language,” he explains.

Mr. Jayamohan, who has been working on the project since it was conceived by Mr. Mani Ratnam in 2010, says there is no evidence to suggest that Tamil kings spoke a particular type of language. “Probably, they may have used the language found in the inscriptions. But we do not have the text. We also do not know their dressing style. It is purely imaginary,” he adds.

On the task of translating a novel into a film, he says, “If important incidents in a novel can be made into a film, Ponniyin Selvan has many such incidents. I have depended on these incidents for my work on the film.” He agrees that there is a need to delve deep into the minds of characters to study their confusions and oscillations, and in a film, this could be done through important incidents. “For instance, the relationship between Aditya Karikalan and Nandini runs to several pages, and in the film, it can be successfully explored through a strong incident,” he adds. He stresses that the dialogues of cinema completely differ from those of novels, and what cinema requires is dialogues that support the visuals. While Kalki had elevated Vandhya Devan to the status of a hero, often eclipsing Raja Raja, Mr. Jayamohan says only the director could explain the treatment given to each and every character in the film.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nk95uo/article30655315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26JAYAMOHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/it-is-a-challenge-to-avoid-artificiality-and-theatrical-elements-jayamohan/article30655316.ece
205,2020/01/26,Tamil Nadu’s defiant Cauvery delta vetoes drilling,"The Centre’s recent notification exempting oil and gas companies from having to seek environmental clearance for exploratory drilling has reignited tension in the Cauvery delta, the rice bowl of the State, where farmers have just begun to reap a bountiful harvest.

The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) gazette notification, doing away with the need for environment impact assessment (EIA) for onshore and offshore drilling exploration, is likely to trigger a fresh wave of protests in the delta.

The region had witnessed sporadic protests ever since the then UPA government granted permission to the Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited (GEECL) for coal bed methane exploration in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts in 2010 and the subsequent signing of a memorandum of understanding with the GEECL by the State government under the DMK regime in 2011.

However, following stiff opposition from various sections, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, in July 2013, asked GEECL officials to suspend operations until the government took a final call, based on the views of an expert group constituted to study the pros and cons of the project. In December 2014, GEECL made a quiet exit, winding up its office in Thanjavur.

More recently, sustained mass protests, lasting several months, at Neduvasal in Pudukottai and Kadiramangalam in Thanjavur district, sent strong signals of the mood among the farmers in the delta. The award of contracts to Vedanta and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) under the Open Acreage Licensing Programme (OALP) Bid Round-I for hydrocarbon exploration in a few offshore and onshore blocks in the Cauvery basin had stoked discontent and set off a fresh string of protests.

Bolt from the blue

Farmers of the delta reacted with anger and disbelief over the January 16 notification, coming as it does after a period of lull, when farmers were busy raising samba and thaladi crops in a near perfect irrigation season. The MoEFCC has made amendments to the EIA Notification 2006 following requests received by the Ministry “seeking exemption from the requirement of prior environmental clearance under the EIA Notification for onshore and offshore exploratory drilling for oil and gas”.

Until then, even exploratory surveys required the highest level of environmental scrutiny and were classified as category ‘A’, requiring an EIA plan, which would be scrutinised by a committee of experts and subject to a public hearing at the proposed project site. The amendment categorises all offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration as ‘B2’ projects, which will not require an EIA.

Most farmers in the delta view hydrocarbon exploration as a threat to their livelihood and feel aggrieved over the relaxation of norms. “It upsets the entire farming community. The country’s food security depends on the eastern coast, where the deltas of almost all the rivers flowing from the west to the east were situated. While tapping oil and natural gas may not harm agriculture, extraction of coal bed methane and shale gas will be dangerous,” said Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.

Some were taken by surprise over the persistence of the Centre on hydrocarbon exploration. “I am at a loss to understand why the Centre is seeking to discredit itself repeatedly in Tamil Nadu. When the future is said to be in renewable energy, why should the Centre go for hydrocarbons, affecting scarce natural resources,” asked Arupathi P. Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers' Associations of Delta Districts.

“It is nothing but an attempt to stifle the voice of the farmers. They will not get even an inch of land from us – we are willing to even sacrifice our lives,” fumed P.R. Pandian of Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam, a strident voice from the delta.

Opposition builds

Opposition parties too were quick to pounce on the Centre and State governments. DMK president M.K. Stalin called upon the State government to take a policy decision against implementing hydrocarbon projects. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami shot off letters to the Prime Minister and Union Minister for Environment seeking status quo ante. He contended that it was “essential to take the people and all stakeholders along while implementing these projects, so that their cooperation and involvement is ensured”.

But environmentalists such as T. Jayaraman, Chief Coordinator of the Anti-Methane Project Federation, who was arrested for his protests at Kadiramangalam, find the State government stand ambiguous. “Does the Chief Minister believe that the project can be implemented with the consent of stakeholders? Don’t we know how farcical the public hearings are? We can live by importing oil, but not water. Where will we go for food after destroying the delta? That’s why we have been insisting since 2014 that Cauvery delta should be declared a protected agricultural zone. But the State government is still not prepared to do so,” said Mr. Jayaraman.

Lashing out at the Union government too, he said that the Centre does not seem to care about people’s sentiments. It doesn’t take the State government seriously either. The draft amendment was not even circulated to the State, Mr. Jayaraman pointed out.

The larger picture

Mr. Jayaraman claimed that the amendment had come in the wake of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons announcing the opening of international bidding for 11 oil and gas blocks under the OALP for the fifth round. This includes a 4,064 sq. km offshore block in the Cauvery basin, spread over Puducherry, Karaikal, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam.

“This will bring hundreds of wells offshore. The wells will completely destroy fishing, as no vessel can go anywhere near a well. Besides, marine life will also be badly affected and so will agriculture,” Mr. Jayaraman said, pointing out that already Vedanta and ONGC have got permission to drill 341 onshore and offshore wells under the first round of auction.

“There was some restraint at least when the EIA was mandatory. Now they can drill thousands of exploratory wells without any restriction,” Mr. Jayaraman said.

Most farmers are not convinced by the clarifications that oil companies and government officials have come up with in the past. In March 2017, senior ONGC officials held a media conference in Tiruchi to allay the fears of the delta farmers in the wake of the Neduvasal protest. ONGC followed international benchmarks relating to safety and environment protection, the officials maintained. “It is true that delta areas are fertile, but they are also prolific producers of oil and gas. There has been no impact on agriculture due to our activity. There has been no depletion of groundwater or pollution,” a senior official asserted.

The officials claimed that no harmful chemicals were used in conventional drilling for oil and natural gas and there was no chance of pollution as the wells were cased at multiple levels. Rejecting ONGC’s claims that its wells had not affected agriculture or the groundwater, Mr. Jayaraman claimed that the ground water in Kadiramangalam had clearly been polluted.

Interestingly, the ONGC officials also affirmed then that the company was not carrying out exploration of shale gas or coal bed methane in Cauvery basin and did not have any such plan to do so. But Mr. Jayaraman observed that oil firms, with a blanket permission secured in the name of hydrocarbons, could tap any kind of resource now. “We are clear that we don’t want any kind of exploration — either offshore or onshore. We will continue to resist them and will take to the streets after January 27,” he asserted.

More protests

Various other organisations are also planning to launch public campaigns in other forms.

The Kadaimadai Area Integrated Farmers’ Association (KAIFA), which spearheads a youth movement to renovate irrigation tanks in Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts, has planned to request villagers to adopt resolutions against hydrocarbon exploration at the Grama Sabha meetings. It also plans to mobilise youth to protest against the “anti-democratic” amendment, R. Ramkumar, one of the coordinators of the Neduvasal protest and president of KAIFA, said.

The Tamil Nadu Nilam Neer Padukappu Iyyakkam also plans to mobilise public opinion against the Centre’s notification, according to its organiser K.M. Iraniyan. The Left parties have already launched demonstrations in some parts of the delta. The agitations are expected to gather steam once the harvest is over.

With the Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam declaring its intent to move the Supreme Court seeking the quashing of the Centre’s amended notification and a ban on implementing hydrocarbon projects in the Cauvery delta, clearly the last word has not yet been said on the issue.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/t08l05/article30655278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THWELL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadus-defiant-cauvery-delta-vetoes-drilling/article30655280.ece

Pens seized

Investigators seized pens with evaporating ink that were used by the candidates to write the examination. A few answer scripts were also obtained from the TNPSC.

""We are referring the pens and answer scripts to the cyber forensic laboratory for analysis. It appears that the ink was procured locally,"" a CB-CID official said.

Review meeting

At a review meeting with the investigating team, Director-General of Police M.S. Jaffar Sait directed that the photograph of the prime suspect, Jayaraj of Anna Nagar in Chennai, be sent to all CB-CID units in the State.

Special teams launched a manhunt to apprehend Jayaraj and a few other brokers who helped in transacting money, preparing answer keys etc.

99 candidates

Police were in the process of collecting the names of all the 99 candidates who paid agents to pass the Group-IV Services examination.

Not ruling out the possibility of more arrests in a day or two, the official said inquiries were still on with the two tahsildars who played a key role in the scam.

Parrying questions on a similar modus operandi in earlier examinations conducted by the TNPSC, he said police had gone in search of a tout who was allegedly involved in fixing candidates for an examination held in 2017, and any further action would be based on his statement.

Talking to reporters at the BJP office after the Republic Day celebrations, Mr. Reddy took exception to Mr. Rao’s criticism of the NDA government over the CAA issue. He was reacting to Mr. Rao’s statement of Saturday that the State Assembly might pass a resolution against the CAA as did some other States recently.

Mr. Reddy condemned Mr. Rao’s announcement that the State government would not implement CAA in Telangana and challenged him to show if there was anything in the Act that affected any one of the 130 crore people in the country. Mr. Rao or his TRS did not have the moral right to criticise the BJP on the matter, he said.

BJP State president K. Laxman said Mr. Rao had joined the Congress in opposing the CAA with “unfounded doubts and ill-motives.” The BJP’s stand that the Congress and TRS were similar was vindicated now.

Earlier in Republic Day celebrations, Mr. Reddy said the rival parties had taken up a false campaign against the BJP on the CAA issue. Their opposition to the National Population Register as part of the 2021 census was equal to opposing reservations to SCs and STs.

According to Mesram Tirupathi, the Kotwal of the community, the jatara proceedings start at the start of the ‘Pushya masam’ on new moon day. Preparations for the final leg of the event, the Nagoba Jatara, run through the whole month.

The event ends with the Manda Gajiling performance which was slated for January 28. After this, clan members exit Keslapur village in Indervelli mandal where the famous Nagoba temple hosts the festivites.

The most important part of Nagoba Jatara, as far as the government is concerned, is the tribal darbar. In that, officials of various departments, receiving representations from tribal people, aim to solve their issues in quick time. This year, the darbar had been slated to be held on Monday, a day when top officials in the district will be busy conducting election to the posts of chairperson and vice-chairperson in Adilabad municipality.

Reserve day

The election can get extended by a day under unusual circumstances. That is precisely why the date of tribal darbar has been postponed to January 29, which means a delay by at least one day in conclusion of the jatara.

On Sunday, the Mesrams completed the Persa Pen or Bada Dev puja as well as the Baan’k puja by the Bheti Koriad or the brides in the clan who formally became its members after performing the bheting ceremony.

The devotees, who arrived here, will now have to while away time till January 29, instead of leaving on January 28.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/62cn91/article30660221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26-NAGOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nagoba-jatara-to-wind-up-a-day-after-scheduled-conclusion-this-year/article30660212.ece

214,2020/01/26,Planning big for Medaram Jatara,"Big B lends his voice

The Sammakka Sarakka jatara from February 5 to 8 will have a touch of silver screen this year.

The Shahenshah of Bollywood Amitabh Bachchan who is also an occasional playback singer has given his voice to a video released by the government on the jatara in Hindi and English. He sang a song on the high points of the jatara which has attracted viewers.

The video was described as an attempt to mount pressure on the Centre to concede national status to the jatara by publicising it at national and international levels.

Poll staff pay for poor organisation

The polling staff for elections in Tandur municipality faced a never before experience on poll day.

As authorities did not supply them printed material to be displayed on walls outside the polling stations, they got down to preparing charts with handwritten names of candidates and images of symbols allotted to them. Of course, the paper was supplied to them.

It was quite a laborious piece of work for the staff as the names had to be written in big letters and symbols drawn artistically to more or less appear as a replacement for printed material. On a separate sheet, they had to do give other descriptions relating to polling stations, including strength of voters and male-female break-up. All this in addition to their regular election work which in itself was more cumbersome till the end of poll hours.

Many early achievers in Class X

About 1,100 under age class ten students will take the Secondary School Certificate exams this year with due permissions.

As per norms, students were supposed to complete the age of 14 years as on August 31 for exams in next March. If they fell short by one-and-a-half years, children of government schools must take permission of their headmasters while those in private schools must get it from District Education Officers. In both government and private schools, children were supposed to take the permission of Director of Government Exams if they fell short by two years and more. Such permissions this year were given for 1,100.

Going ahead, the brighter lot will stop in their tracks as there is nothing as permissions for under age in admissions to MBBS even if they get good ranks in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test. The students must have completed 17 years on December 31 of any given year for admissions to MBBS in next year.

Media draws attention

Media is at the receiving end of politicians very often these days, irrespective of the reason. The declaration of results in municipal elections was one more occasion for them to train guns on media. Reacting to the results, Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy said media in Telangana has become mostly biased against the Opposition parties and it was evident once again when a section of it put several municipalities in the TRS kitty even before the completion of counting of votes. On the other hand, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao minced no words to attack the social media and even went to the extent of terming it “anti-social media” stating that it was resorting to character assassination and personal attacks. He warned that the State government would not tolerate such media attacks on individuals and it would contemplate action against such vendetta.

215,2020/01/26,Tribal youth slowly turn tipplers,"A nip of cheap liquor slipped and fell on the road from the pocket of a man in a ghastly road accident on the night of January 19 near Muthnur village in the agency mandal of Indervelli.

The victim was not only punch drunk, according to eye witnesses, but was carrying an extra bottle home. This small incident, in fact, reveals a trend — a deeper malaise — in the poor and backward tribal belt of old undivided Adilabad district. People going on a binge is common in these parts.

“Alcoholism has invaded the serene innards of the tribal areas,” observed an elder concerned about the phenomenon. “The government is not even lifting a finger to at least close the ‘belt’ shops,” he accused. His hope? Difficulty in liquor availability perhaps would contain consumption to some extent.

The belt shop, for the uninformed, is an illegal liquor vend which is invariably within the reach of tipplers who do not mind shelling out extra money for its easy availability. All the mandal head quarters in the tribal belt have a plethora of such vends. Indervelli, for example, boasts of at least 15 such in all corners.

Big guzzlers

To get an idea of the spread of the malaise, a comparison between top ‘performing’ retail shops in the agency with those in the plains is revealing. Consider this. One centrally located retail shop in Utnoor has recorded a daily sale worth over ₹4 lakh, while the highest daily sale in any shop in Adilabad district headquarters, a comparatively economically-developed plain area, was ₹1.75 lakh on an average, according to sources.

“The high sale figure means that liquor is being lifted by belt shop owners,” admitted a prohibition and excise department official. “We are unable to control the trend as it could mean a dip in income to the government,” he conceded.

Assured, but not done

Following huge protests recently by Adivasi women in Utnoor and elsewhere in Adilabad, the District Collector and Superintendent of Police assured to close down the illegal vends. “We have closed down all such shops under Utnoor excise station following instructions,” claimed district prohibition and excise officer Ravinder Raju.

He, however, revealed that the liquor outlet in Muthnur village, which the top district officials had instructed him to close down till the duration of Nagoba jatara, the tribal fair, continued to operate till the day before the festival began.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tribal-youth-slowly-turn-tipplers/article30659432.ece
216,2020/01/26,TRS set to retain NMC,"The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is all set to retain the Nizamabad Municipal Corporation (NMC) as the numbers are in its favour though it finished third in the elections by winning only in 13 out of the total 60 divisions.

With the help of its political ally AIMIM, which secured 16 divisions, one Independent and one of the two Congress members, who already joined its camp, the party appears to be in a comfortable position to take over the reins of NMC again.

The TRS leaders also eyed another Congress member, but he reportedly refused to defect. In addition, the ruling party has six ex-officio members, three MLAs Bigala Ganesh Gupta, B. Govardhan and A. Jeevan Reddy and MLCs Akula Lalitha, V.G. Goud and D. Rajeswar. Rajya Sabha member D. Srinivas, technically speaking, did not opt for a vote in the corporation.

Thus, all put together, TRS has a strength of 38 members while the BJP has only 28. Even if the two Congress members and one Independent support the BJP, it will have only 31 members and one ex-officio member, MP D. Arvind, accounting for a total of 32. MIM, which was content with the post of Deputy Mayor in the last NMC, is likely to take the same post this time too given the political conditions.

If the MIM insists for the post of Mayor, the political scene might be different.

Meanwhile, all members of both political groups were shifted to camps in different places. The BJP reportedly sent its members to Maharashtra while TRS to Hyderabad. They would arrive directly at the NMC office at 11 a.m. on Monday to take oath.

Names of Neethu Kiran from Division No. 11 and Lavanya from Division No. 15 in the TRS are doing the rounds for the coveted post. Incidentally, former Mayor Akula Sujatha in Division No. 6 and her deputy Fayeem (MIM) were defeated in this election.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-set-to-retain-nmc/article30659368.ece
217,2020/01/26,BJP will be a constructive Opposition: Arvind,"Member of Parliament D. Arvind, on Sunday, declared that his party would act as a constructive Opposition in the Nizamabad Municipal Corporation (NMC) as it could not achieve the magic figures to take the reins of the civic body administration. He said that the BJP would not indulge in offering inducements to defect corporator-designates of other parties.

“Though we have emerged as the single largest party in NMC and falling short of a few seats to assume power, we will act as the Opposition constructively to check corrupt practices of the ruling party. Over 75 per cent of the majority community voted for BJP and it is a clear vote against MIM and TRS,” he said while addressing a press conference.

He was confident that his party corporators would never defect to TRS as they were wise and committed to the BJP. “It was a vote for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his leadership,” he said.

The MP also said that the TRS leaders should introspect seriously as their party would lose its hegemony across the State in the coming days and ultimately in the next Assembly elections, would experience a humiliating defeat in the hands of BJP. “Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is a disgrace to Hindu religion as he is opposing the CAA and NPR,” he said.

Accusing KCR of threatening pensioners that they would forego pensions if they didn’t vote for the TRS, he said that the “CM degraded the value of his Constitutional position.”

“KCR is surviving as the CM as the Opposition is not strong. With the emergence of BJP as a strong rival, he will have to face the music in future,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5ek5v0/article30660712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ARVIND-NZM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-will-be-a-constructive-opposition-arvind/article30658982.ece
218,2020/01/26,It is democracy and not Congress that has lost in Telangana: Uttam Kumar Reddy,"Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the TRS, BJP and the AIMIM have conspired together to damage the Congress party, and the victory of TRS was based on money, liquor and misuse of official machinery.

After hoisting national flag at Gandhi Bhavan on the occasion of 71st Republic Day on Sunday, he said despite several conspiracies and obstacles, the Congress party performed better than previous elections. He said the share of Congress party in municipal polls has increased compared to Lok Sabha elections held in 2019.

He said there has been a significant increase in Congress party’s vote share from Assembly to Parliament and then Panchayat Raj and now civic polls and this augurs well for the party working to regain power in the next Assembly elections.

Large amounts

Mr. Reddy alleged that the TRS had spent up to ₹ 30,000 per vote in some cases to win the civic polls and this was nothing but a danger to democracy. He called upon intellectuals to launch a movement to save democracy in Telangana.

He said the Chief Minister was working to defeat democracy and the Constitution in every election rather than his opponents. Practices like engineering defections of elected representatives of opposition parties into ruling party; kidnapping of political leaders, extreme usage of liquor, money and official position, house arrests, implication in false cases and using police to harass and terrorise political opponents have become common in Telangana.

Changed tune

Responding to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s announcement that Telangana Assembly too would pass an anti-CAA resolution, he said despite repeated demands by him for a special Assembly session on the issue, KCR remained silent. However, immediately after declaration of results of municipal elections on Saturday, KCR began a new drama.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said TRS and BJP were having a secret understanding in Telangana. He said BJP leaders only give media statements alleging corruption and embezzlement of funds by TRS leaders. But they never made a request to their own party’s government at the Centre to order a CBI probe against KCR or other TRS leaders, he pointed out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/b0020j/article30658960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy26Uttam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/it-is-democracy-and-not-congress-that-has-lost-in-telangana-uttam/article30658961.ece

In a statement here, Mr. Prabhakar said Jupally Krishna Rao had resigned as a Minister from the Congress government in support of a separate Telangana but he is being shabbily treated by the TRS after showing his strength and following in Kollapur constituency.

Defying the party orders, Mr. Krishna Rao ensured the victory of ‘rebel’ TRS candidates in the recent municipal elections in Kollapur fighting on the symbol of the All India Forward Block (AIFB) party.

222,2020/01/26,3 Independents’ call to sail with TRS did Cong. in,"The dreams of the Congress to clinch the Jangaon municipality seem to have been shattered with the three Independents, who won on Saturday, deciding to sail with the ruling TRS.

It may be noted that of the total 30 municipal wards, TRS won 13, Congress 10, BJP four and Independents three.

The Congress reportedly planned to clinch the chairperson seat by taking the help of MLA A. Narasimha Reddy, who won from United Teachers Front (UTF), and party MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, besides roping in the three Independents taking the total to 15 votes.

However, the Independents decided to sail with the TRS. Now, the ruling party will have 16 plus two co-option votes – MLC B. Venkateswarlu and MLA M. Yadagiri Reddy, thus taking the total to 18 votes, easily securing the chairperson seat.

The Congress leadership had offered the chairperson post to elected councillors whoever was ready to rope in the Independents by bearing their election expenditure but none came forward viewing it as a risky affair. They, in fact, wanted the party leadership to finalise the deal before offering the chairperson post to them.

Congress lost its tally from 14 in 2014 to 10 in 2020 while the TRS improved from a mere six to 13. In 2014, the BJP won four wards and Independents three. They retained their tally while the CPI (M) that won one ward in 2014 lost it this time. The total number of wards was 28 in 2014 and now, it has gone up to 30 wards in Jangaon municipality.

223,2020/01/26,Officials told to ensure healthy environment in cities,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has instructed the officials concerned to take measures to ensure that Hyderabad and other cities across the State did not turn into pollution ridden cities by taking steps to protect environment.

Steps should be initiated to plant trees both inside and outside the urban centres as well as forest lands to significantly enhance greenery. The Chief Minister said the State Capital was growing at a rapid pace and population too was increasing several fold. The city had scope for more pollution and any negligence on the part of officials in taking necessary measures was sure to take it to the ranks of other cities which were suffering with acute pollution making people’s life as hell.

There was about 1.6 lakh hectares of forest land available in and outside the State Capital. Accordingly, large scale tree plantation should be taken up on these lands so that the green cover would ensure that pollution was controlled and temperatures were also kept low.

Green cover

The focus should be more on planting trees within the city and the civic bodies, GHMC and HMDA could allot at least 10 per cent of their budgetary allocation towards increasing the green cover.

Officials should ensure that Harita (green) plans were prepared for other cities and towns too and efforts should be made to set up a nursery per each ward. These steps would form part of the measures that would be taken up under Pattana Pragathi (urban development), the Chief Minister said according to an official release.

Basti Dawakhanas

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister wanted the officials to ensure that the number of Basti Dawakhanas functioning within Hyderabad were increased to 350. There were 118 dawakhanas working in different parts of the GHMC as of now and people were effectively utilizing their services.

Given the response to these dawakhanas from the people, steps should be taken to ensure that at least two basti dawakhanas were set up in each of the 150 wards under the GHMC limits, he said exhorting them to complete the process within a month. Focus should accordingly be on ensuring that there were more dawakhanas functioning in the areas where there was significant population of SCs, STs, minorities and the poor.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/officials-told-to-ensure-healthy-environment-in-cities/article30658784.ece
224,2020/01/26,Revenue Act soon to bring transparency in land issues: Telangana Governor,"The State government will soon come out with new Revenue Act aimed at bringing transparency in transaction of lands and simplifying the complicated land related matters.

The government had already embarked upon comprehensive revenue record rectification, updation and purification process to put an end to land-related litigations and disputes once and for all. Clarity on land rights in respect of about 96 % of lands had already been arrived. “The government is also launching an action plan to settle disputes pending in courts and other land related problems,” Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said.

The Governor who unfurled the tricolour in the presence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, ministers and senior officials here on Sunday said changes were also being initiated to ensure corruption-free, delay-free and hassle-free registrations. The enactment of the Panchayat Raj and Municipal Acts coupled with the Revenue Act which was in the offing was reflective of the government’s commitment to offer good governance and become role model for others in the country.

Farm sector

The Government’s focus was on alleviating the plight of the farm sector for which unique initiatives like the Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima which won accolades nationally and internationally were launched and at the same time, emphasis was being laid on construction of irrigation projects. Works on projects like Kaleshwaram and Palamuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation schemes were progressing at a brisk pace while efforts were underway to ensure diversion of Godavari water to Krishna basin.

The Governor said the State government firmly believed in give and take relationship with neighbouring States and was ready to cooperate with Andhra Pradesh about diversion of Godavari water to Krishna basin. Alternative plan for diversion was being prepared and implementation of this would ensure that problems of districts like Mahabubnagar which suffered large-scale migration, Nalgonda with acute fluoride problem and Rangareddy which faced famine in the past were addressed permanently.

Assured irrigation

“The plans for filling reservoirs will lead to a situation where farmers looking at the sky for rainy clouds would be gone forever,” she said. On the health front, the government was gearing up to launch ENT and dental tests on a saturation basis covering the entire population on the lines of Kanti Velugu. This would enable the government to develop “Telangana health profile”.

The Governor who elaborated on the steps taken for forest growth and other aspects said the administrative reforms launched by the new State, especially the reorganization of districts and creation of new municipalities and corporations, making the administrative units small, ensured that administration went closer to the people. “There is no doubt that effective and efficient implementation of development and welfare schemes in the State become possible with reforms like this,” she said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sry1zu/article30658733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy26Gov1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/revenue-act-soon-to-bring-transparency-in-land-issues-telangana-governor/article30658735.ece
225,2020/01/26,Leadership let Congress down,"The municipal election results that were declared on Saturday clearly shows that it was leadership that had either made a party successful or failed another.

There were some places where Congress was unable to win even a single seat. This shows how poorly leaders at the district-level or State-level had failed the party.

At the same time, it was the leadership of TRS that had led the party sweep the elections.

Take the case of Sangareddy and Sadashivapet municipalities. Congress legislator T. Jayaprakash Reddy has been representing the constituency. Though he had announced that District Congress Committee (DCC) president T. Nirmala Jayaprakash Reddy would be the chairperson if Congress won the elections, he had not shown much interest in campaigning.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao and former MLA Chinta Prabhakar took the elections seriously and saw that Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy got defeated at his home turf.

Though Mr. Harish Rao was limited only to the erstwhile Medak district, he made all out efforts to see that the party won all the municipalities. Even at Narayanakhed, it was stated that the local leadership tried to back-stab local MLA M. Bhupal Reddy that had resulted in municipal elections. However, Narayanakhed municipality was sure to fall into the TRS kitty as both the MLA and MP vote had gone in favour of the ruling party.

Similarly, at Narsapur in Medak district, Congress failed to win even a single ward where former minister V. Sunitha Lakshma Reddy changed loyalties. It was alleged that Ms. Sunitha had not allowed the second rung leadership of the party to grow while the party leadership from either the district-level or State-level failed to address the issue. Similar was the case at Dubbak in Siddipet district where Congress did a big zero.

Both the communist parties failed to win even a single ward in the 15 municipalities. Surprisingly, TDP was able to win two wards at Ameenpur municipality.

It seems the Congress had reached the ground level and may have a fate similar to that of the TDP in the State unless it starts addressing the issue immediately.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/leadership-let-congress-down/article30658472.ece
226,2020/01/26,CM to inspect Palle Pragathi work,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has announced his resolve to conduct surprise visits to the villages to get first hand information about the progress of works launched there as part of Palle Pragathi, the programme aimed at strengthening the infrastructure at the village level.

The ambitious programme for the all-round development of villages should not turn into an event for photo-ops for officials and ministers and they should work for improvement of greenery and sanitation at the ground level with utmost commitment. The government was planning to launch Pattana Pragathi soon for improving the civic infrastructure in towns and cities taking inspiration from the works launched under the Palle Pragathi.

The Chief Minister expressed displeasure at the way some ministers, district collectors and public representatives were getting photographed while sweeping the village streets.

Photo opportunity

“Posing for photographs is not proper. It is not their duty to sweep the villages. There are people designated for the work and the government has appointed adequate staff to carry out these work and ministers and others should effectively supervise the work being done by them not just for namesake participation in the programme,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao reviewed the progress of works launched under the Palle Pragathi programme with ministers E. Dayakar Rao, A. Indrakaran Reddy and Satyavati Rathod and senior officials headed by government’s chief adviser Rajiv Sharma and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar on Sunday. He said the government had launched the Palle Pragathi programme with an aim to improve the infrastructure at the grass root level.

Funds available

The government had filled vacancies in the Panchayat Raj Department and appointed secretaries to all villages besides enhancing salaries to the staff. Steps had been taken to release ₹ 339 crore every month for taking up works at the village level and tractors were being procured for taking up works in each village. “The works like maintenance of cleanliness and sanitation should continue on a daily basis and it should not be a one off event. I have decided to conduct surprise checks to ensure this,” he averred.

The officials informed the Chief Minister that nurseries had been set up in 12,705 of the total 12,751 villages and 6,017 tractors had been purchased so far while orders were placed for purchasing another 4,534 vehicles. Drains spanning 62,976 km were cleaned and patchwork on roads was completed at 56,050 locations as part of the programme implemented in two phases.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cm-to-inspect-palle-pragati-work/article30658433.ece
227,2020/01/26,Kishan Reddy slams Telangana CM for attacking Centre on CAA,"Taking exception to Telangana Chief Minister’s criticism of the NDA government at the Centre over the CAA issue, Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy on Sunday challenged K. Chandrasekhar Rao to point out anything in the amended Citizenship Act that affects anyone in the country.

His response comes a day after Mr. Rao said the State assembly may pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) like some other States did recently.

“I condemn KCR ji for announcing that he will not implement CAA in Telangana, while talking about the central government.

“I challenge the Chief Minister to show if there is anything in the Act that affects any of the 130 crore people (in the country),” the Union Minister of State for Home told reporters here.

Mr. Rao or his TRS does not have the moral right to criticise the BJP on the matter, he said.

State BJP president K. Laxman claimed that Mr. Rao has joined the Congress in opposing CAA with “unfounded doubts and ill- motives.”

BJP has been stating that Congress and TRS were similar and it is becoming evident now, he alleged.

Coming out strongly against the law, Mr. Rao had on Saturday said he may convene a meeting of regional parties and Chief Ministers to oppose the amended citizenship law.

Asserting that the TRS was secular by nature and policy, he said the CAA was a wrong decision by the Centre as the Constitution provides fundamental rights to all people of the country irrespective of religion, caste and creed.

As such, keeping Muslims outside the bill (CAA) itself pained him, he had said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nuci8y/article30570428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15GKISHANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kishan-reddy-slams-telangana-cm-for-attacking-centre-on-caa/article30657541.ece
228,2020/01/26,Change the topography of cities and towns for better: Telangana Governor,"Stressing the need for changing the topography of cities and towns in the light of rapid urbanisation, Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan exhorted the newly elected people’s representatives to take up the responsibility of changing their respective cities and towns for better.

‘People too should participate’

The government was planning Pattana Pragathi for development of urban areas, on the lines of Palle Pragathi conducted twice for rural areas soon, and the people should participate in the programme to transform their cities and towns with proper plans. “The municipal elections are over now. The newly elected people’s representatives should take the responsibility,” the Governor said.

Dr. Soundararajan was speaking after unfurling the tricolour on the occasion of the 71st Republic Day here on Sunday. She inspected the ceremonial parade of five contingents - 5th battalion of The Sikh Regiment, 3rd battalion of Telangana State Special Force, Indian Air Force, Andhra Pradesh Special Police and NCC Boys & Girls - on the occasion.

The Governor recalled how Palle Pragathi enabled villages transform preparing annual, and five-year plans based on revenue, expenditure needs, and resources. The government had come forward to provide matching grants to villages and towns in tune with the grants released by the Finance Commission, and said ₹ 339 crore was being released every month for villages.

Account every paisa

The government was prepared to release funds regularly to towns and villages too. So, people and elected representatives should shoulder the responsibility of ensuring proper usage of funds in a planned manner. The Governor was particular that every paisa should be accounted for. Officials, public representatives and people should know their responsibilities, she stressed.

“Nobody should be allowed to be negligent in their duties,” the Governor asserted. Since the existing legislations were insufficient in this direction, the government brought in the new Panchayat Raj and Municipal Acts to increase accountability on the part of the rural and urban local bodies.

State a torch-bearer

Dr. Soundararajan also elaborated on the steps taken by the government to ensure the law and order situation that propelled the city to become the most livable and an investment destination. The State had become the torch bearer for others in terms of administrative reforms, while it was also ranked number one in the country for its slew of welfare programmes unheard of in the past.

The Opposition parties, particularly the Congress and the BJP, failed to make much impact, in spite of putting up a brave front till the counting of votes was taken up on Saturday morning. Both finished a distant second and third in winning the wards from a total of 3,052 (2,727 municipal council wards and 325 municipal corporation wards). The TRS bagged 1,686 wards followed by the Congress (569), the BJP (293), the AIMIM (87), the CPI (20), the CPI(M) (12), the TDP (8) Independents (248) and others (49) out of the 2,972 declared results.

However, the main function in Srinagar was conspicuous by absence of any senior regional leader or ex-legislator, with no leader from the National Conference (NC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Peoples Conference showing up. Senior regional leadership, including Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah of the NC, Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP and Sajad Lone of the People’s Conference have been under detention since August 5.

Addressing a thinly attended gathering in Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir Cricket Stadium, Farooq Khan, Adviser to the Lieutenant-Governor, said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen on ushering J&K into a new era of progress and prosperity. The visit of 36 Union Ministers was the first step in this regard. The Ministers, besides inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of various development projects, reached out to the people and assured them of peace and prosperity.”

The Srinagar venue was sealed off by the security forces.

Drones were pressed into service to maintain vigil in and around the venue. A spontaneous shutdown was observed across the Valley, where all shops were closed and thin traffic plied on the roads. An official said the mobile services were stopped “as a precautionary measure to thwart any militant attacks”. The service was restored in the evening.

Jammu function

Lt. Governor G.C. Murmu hoisted the national flag at Jammu’s Maulana Azad Stadium, where hundreds of people and politicians attended the function.

“2019 was a year of momentous change for J&K. The abrogation of temporary provisions have removed the artificial legal and economic barriers between J&K and the rest of the country and have fully integrated it. The people of J&K now stand on the same pedestal as those in the rest of the country, with the same rights, benefits and prospects,” said Mr. Murmu.

He praised the bravery of the J&K police and the security forces in battling militancy and ensuring that there is public order in J&K. “Militancy remains our biggest concern as innocent youth are indoctrinated to take misguided path. Though incidents of militancy have come down drastically, the threat posed by it requires attention not only to eradicate it but also prevent loss due to it,” he said.

The Lt. Governor termed the last year-and-a-half of Central rule as “transformative for J&K”.

“A team of Central agencies had come and with the support of local police took two people from Kako village in Jehanabad and interrogated them…they were neither detained nor arrested...they were released after interrogation,” Jehanabad SP Manish Kumar told The Hindu over phone. “The case against Sharjeel Imam has not been lodged in Bihar, so we cooperated with the Central agencies and cannot say much on it,” he said.

Local sources in Jehanabad said a police team conducted a raid at Sharjeel Imam’s house in Kako village in the wee hours of Sunday and took two of his cousins for interrogation. On Saturday too, a police team visited Arwal Mor in Jehanabad town where an anti-CAA-NRC-NPR protest has been going on for over 10 days to look for Sharjeel Imam but he was not found there. “The police looking for Sharjeel Imam reached the spot but didn’t arrest anyone from there,” said a local journalist. Locals also recalled that Sharjeel Imam son of Akbar Imam, has been a bright student since childhood and he was in IIT-Mumbai before joining the JNU to pursue Ph.D.

235,2020/01/26,"Local language, dialects to be medium of instruction in Chhattisgarh: Baghel","Local Chhattisgarhi language and different dialects will be made the medium of instruction in primary schools across Chhattisgarh from the next academic session, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said on January 26.

Speaking at the Republic Day function held in Jagdalpur, around 290 km from here, he cautioned political parties by quoting Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar — if parties place their creed above the country, then people’s freedom will once again be in danger and might end forever.

Appealing to the people to work towards protecting the Constitution, he said its different aspects will be taught in schools.

The State government had on January 24 issued a circular to schools, asking them to hold discussions on the Constitution after prayers every Monday.

He said the previous UPA government at the Centre had made a provision in the Right to Education Act 2009 to ensure children are taught in their mother tongue as much as possible.

“But ironically, the State has not yet taken any concrete step in this direction,” he said.

“From the forthcoming academic session, arrangements will be made to use local Chhattisgarhi language and dialects like Gondi, Halbi, Bhatri, Sargujia, Korwa, Pando, Kudukh, Kamari and others as medium of instruction in primary schools,” Mr. Baghel said.

Various programmes will be held to discuss the lives of great personalities so that the young generation gets inspired by their deeds, he added.

“...We must resolve to protect our freedom till the last drop of blood. To achieve our social and economic goals, we should follow constitutional measures,” he added.

Mr. Baghel said India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had identified communalism as the most dangerous trend of his time, and hence insisted on a “secular Constitution“.

“The biggest reason behind the heights of development that India has achieved in the past seven decades is the power of our Constitution, which makes the nation a socialist, secular, democratic republic despite all diversities,” Mr. Baghel stressed.

Taking a swipe at the BJP-led government at the Centre amid the backdrop of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Mr. Baghel said, “The present situation in the country is not hidden from anyone.”

“Amid all regressive forces, Chhattisgarh has once again succeeded in proving that we (people) know how to connect, how to create, how to build. People of this State never believed in division,” he claimed.

Highlighting various schemes and achievements of his government, he said criminal cases against 313 people in Bastar region were withdrawn based on the recommendation of Justice A.K. Patnaik-led committee set up to review offences lodged against tribals (in Naxal-hit areas).

Superintendent of Police, Darbhanga, Babu Ram said the incident took place on January 24 when the team, comprising 12 people, including four women, visited a village under Jamalpur police station area.

The team was from a Lucknow-based research organization, which was engaged by a U.S.-based PhD scholar.

However, as they began visiting households and collecting information, the word spread that “NRC surveyors” had arrived, following which villagers grew furious and held them hostage for some time before taking them to the police station.

The situation was defused at the police station where officials verified the identities of the researchers and explained the fact to the villagers, who then went back satisfied, the SP said.

He, however, added that similar incidents had taken place in the district in the recent past and an awareness campaign was launched as part of which residents were asked to “inform the police or local administrative officials” of any surveyors in their area “instead of illegally detaining them”.

With the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) spreading in Bihar, people engaged in conducting surveys for private research and marketing companies are being mistakenly targeted.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) is an ally of the BJP, have been at pains to explain that the CAA would expedite the grant of citizenship to refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, having fled religious persecution in their countries, without affecting Indians and that there was no move so far to bring in the nationwide NRC.

Opposition parties have, however, accused the NDA of misleading the people and pointed out that a country-wide NRC was mentioned in the BJP’s manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls.

The NRC had also found mention in President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to a joint session of Parliament last year, besides in Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s speech when the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was being debated in the Lok Sabha, the Opposition parties said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/21571r/article30657355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26PATNACAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/researchers-mistaken-for-nrc-surveyors-handed-over-to-police-in-bihar/article30657356.ece
237,2020/01/26,Republic Day celebrated across Jammu amid tight security arrangements,"Amid tight security arrangements, the 71st Republic Day was celebrated with traditional fervour and gaiety across the Jammu region on Sunday with Lt Governor G C Murmu unfurling the national flag at the main function in Jammu.

This was the first Republic Day after Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was withdrawn on August 5 last year and the erstwhile State was divided into two Union Territories.

Mr. Murmu unfurled the tricolour at the jam-packed Maulana Azad Stadium in the heart of the city, inspected the parade and took salute at an impressive march past which was commanded by Colonel Rajesh Kumar Sharma of the 5th battalion of J&K Light Infantry (JAKLI).

Besides JAKLI, the contingents of BSF, CRPF, Jammu and Kashmir Armed Police, Indian Reserve Police, Disaster Response Force, Jammu and Kashmir Fire and emergency services, ex-servicemen, NCC girls and boys and Bharat scouts took part in the march past.

He also addressed the function, witnessing cultural and sports programmes by young boys and girls, and scintillating performance by local police’s daredevils’ motorcycle stunt team.

An IAF chopper showered flower petals at the start of the function, which attracted huge applause, while three helicopters flew overhead at regular intervals during the event.

With three former Chief Ministers — National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti — still under detention in Srinagar, the only prominent face among the politicians at the official function was Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina.

“This Republic Day is historic for the people of Jammu and Kashmir because the dream of our martyrs for ‘Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan and Pradhan’ (one Constitution, one flag and one sovereign head) became a reality. Only the national flag fluttered this time,” Mr. Raina told reporters at the end of the function.

The abrogation of Article 370 completed the ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ mission, he said, adding that it is the day to take a pledge to make the country a world power.

However, he refused to comment on the absence of the former chief ministers who are under detention since August 5 last year.

Before attending the official function, the Lt Governor went to the Balidan Stambh earlier in the day and paid tribute to the brave security personnel who laid down their lives in the line of duty to the country.

The function at the Balidan Stambh in the heart of the city was organised by the Army as part of the Republic Day celebrations.

The roads in the city were sealed by police and paramilitary forces, and only vehicles with special passes were allowed to move freely, leading to boycott of the main official function by a group of scribes who alleged harassment on the name of security.

Patriotic fervour was visible across the city as local residents, including shopkeepers, were seen hoisting flags in their localities, while groups of enthusiastic youths, carrying tricolour, went around on their motorcycles and raised slogans in praise of the country.

Almost all political parties, including the Congress, National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), BJP and National Panthers Party, unfurled the national flag in and outside their party headquarters to mark the occasion.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mq5c7s/article30657304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RDAY-JAMMU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/republic-day-celebrated-across-jammu-amid-tight-security-arrangements/article30657305.ece

In her Republic Day address to the State at the Police Parade grounds in Raipur, Ms. Uikey also hailed the government’s three-pronged strategy of “trust, development and security” to improve the law and order situation in the state.

“Vigilant police force and justice delivery initiatives have resulted in reduction of Naxal violence and other offences. The Naxal rehabilitation action plan of the state has been made more attractive,” she said.

“With its three-tier strategy of trust, development and security, the State government has improved the law and order situation in the State. Several steps like giving weekly offs and response allowance to police force have boosted their morale,” she said.

Besides, public awareness campaign is being run to prevent crimes related to chit funds, human trafficking and cyber crimes.

The State has established a new paradigm of community policing through its initiatives like Janamitra, Village Defence Committees, Senior Citizen Cell, Women’s Help Desk etc, she added.

Lauding various schemes of the State government, the governor said, “My government has taken such a new initiative in the last one year, due to which every citizen’s confidence of getting equal opportunity and justice has gone up.”

The State government is primarily focused on ensuring relief to the most backward regions, weakest sections and needy people of the State.

Returning acquired land of villagers in Lohandiguda (Bastar), hike in remuneration for tendu leaves collection to ₹4000 per standard sacks,reviewing cancelled forest rights claims, withdrawing criminal cases against tribals, purchase of 22 minor forest produce on support price, nutrition campaign and many other decisions were taken in this direction, she said.

The decisions of purchasing paddy at ₹2,500 per quintal and loan waiver have also encouraged the farmers, she added.

“There has been a tremendous expansion of road infrastructure in the State. In one year, construction of 28 major bridges were completed while 119 are in progress, she said.

239,2020/01/26,ULFA-Independent carries out four blasts in Assam,"The outlawed United National Liberation Front-Independent (ULFA-I) carried out a series of blasts in eastern Assam on Sunday amid heightened security for the 71st Republic Day.

The police said there was no casualty and the low-intensity blasts caused minimal damage in Dibrugarh and Charaideo districts. The ULFA-I claimed responsibility for four of these blasts, which occurred within a span of 15 minutes, besides another in Tinsukia district. The police, however, confirmed only four blasts.

“We carried out the serial blasts to protest the forced celebration of a day associated with colonial India,” the outfit’s publicity wing said in a statement. Two blasts took place in Dibrugarh town. Another happened at Duliajan in Dibrugarh district, while t he fourth was in Charaideo district’s Sonari.

“We condemn such cowardly acts. An investigation has been ordered,” Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said.

240,2020/01/26,Have not received any evidence on Loya’s death: Minister Anil Deshmukh,"Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday said that he had yet to receive any new evidence about the death of special CBI judge B H Loya who had handled the Sohrabuddin Shaikh fake encounter case.

Many people had contacted him saying that they had evidence, but none so far had come up with actual proof, he said, speaking at the Press Club here.

To a query whether the probe into Loya’s death will be reopened, the minister said, “I received several phone calls from people who claimed they had (new) evidence.

“I told them they can come and meet me. But no one has yet come to meet me with proof (showing that a fresh investigation was needed),” Mr. Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, said.

He had said earlier that the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra was open to investigate Loya’s death afresh if any new material surfaced.

Loya, who was hearing the high-profile Sohrabuddin Shaikh case, died of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014, when he was visiting the city to attend the wedding of a colleague’s daughter.

There were demands from some quarters that the death should be probed as the judge was allegedly under a lot of pressure.

243,2020/01/26,Heritage conservation efforts in Shekhawati region bearing fruit,"Built by a trader’s family in 1892, the iconic Dangayach Haveli in the heart of Nawalgarh town in Rajasthan’s Shekhawati region has emerged as a new destination of a unique participatory heritage conservation initiative, which has generated the potential for protecting hundreds of heritage mansions and facilitating their “adaptive reuse”.

Through the Shekhawati Virasat Abhiyan, a group of conservation architects has extended technical and financial assistance to the owners of havelis, which are famous for their colourful murals and intricate frescos. Their repair, restoration and maintenance involve methods used during the construction of havelis between the 18th and early 20th century.

Open-air art gallery

The initiative taken by a not-for-profit organisation, the Centre for Advancement of Traditional Building Technology & Skills (CATTS), has started bearing fruit in the “open-air art gallery” — the title often given to Shekhawati which has the largest collection of painted buildings anywhere in the world. The campaign has brought together stakeholders to save the rich heritage.

The conservation of Dangayach Haveli and establishment of the Shekhawati Heritage Hub within the mansion has given an impetus to participatory heritage conservation. CATTS secretary Urvashi Srivastava told The Hindu that the new model, besides safeguarding and infusing life in the built heritage, would be replicated across the region.

The Dangayach Haveli, lying in disuse for several years and infested with bats, was restored with the help of local masons who used lime mortar for repairing the plaster and removed whitewash and plastic to stop the damage to frescos. The damaged doors, windows and lime lattices were extensively repaired.

Old washrooms in the Haveli, which were in a shambles, were also redesigned to make the building usable. The heritage hub set up in the Haveli, inaugurated by Jhunjhunu Collector Ravi Jain on December 30, 2019, has started functioning as an interpretation and cultural resource centre. Here the visitors get a glimpse of architectural beauty and get to know history and culture of Shekhawati through an audio-visual presentation.

Adaptive reuse

Ms. Srivastava said this adaptive reuse of the Haveli would ensure that it did not fall into disuse again and its conservation works were funded by the revenue generated from the activities of the hub. “The beauty of the Haveli lies in the planning of space... Our initiative, far from being an investment project, is aimed at restoration of the built heritage,” she said.

Ashutosh Mishra, living in a nearby haveli, said he would be willing to participate in the CATTS project as the old frescos in his mansion had been damaged by the continuous repairs with cement.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ofqtle/article30655260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26HERITAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/heritage-conservation-efforts-in-shekhawati-region-bearing-fruit/article30655261.ece
244,2020/01/26,Bhima Koregaon: Maharashtra mulls legal options to challenge NIA decision,"A day after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the investigation into the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon cases, the Maharashtra government said it is mulling all options including posing a legal challenge to the decision.

If it happens, Maharashtra could become only the second State after Chhattisgarh to institute a suit against the Centre, hours after the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government took a review of the probe this week and called in question evidence produced by the Pune police in its 5,000-page chargesheet. The Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh government had earlier this month moved a plaint under Article 131, which gives the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases between States and the Centre, after the NIA had taken over cases related to Naxal terror.

Maharashtra claims the NIA had also this month taken over the probe into an IED blast of May 1, 2019 in which 15 commandos were killed by Maoists in Gadchiroli district. The MVA may not necessarily challenge the NIA Act in toto but only the provisions of the Section 6(5) which allow the Ministry of Home Affairs to direct the NIA to take over and investigate any offence from the scheduled list. This more so since in the case of Bhima Koregaon and Elgar Parishad the chargesheet has already been filed and it does not “merit a takeover” at this stage, senior officials said.

“While the NIA is within its right to ask for a takeover, it remains in question if the procedure under sub Sections 1,2 and 3 of the Act have been followed. Both the NIA and State have to complete a report if they come across during the probe in scheduled offences under the NIA Act,” said a senior IPS officer of Maharashtra, adding the State could mull a legal challenge.

A political blamegame broke out following the NIA’s takeover. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday said if an SIT were to be set up in the Elgar Parishad case, a lot of IPS officers and leaders of the previous BJP government would be exposed. It is from this fear the NIA was directed to take over the cases from the Maharashtra government, he said.

Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said it was the right decision to takeover the cases from the State government. “It is the correct decision because this case is not confined to Maharashtra, we see its spread all over the country. The Central government has taken the right step, this will expose urban naxals,” he said. “The urban naxal network was exposed by the Maharashtra police after a lot of hard work but some people want to bring the police under a cloud, and started issuing threats to open the case. This was only being done to get more votes,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mh0psu/article30634807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NIA-SUDERSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-mulls-legal-options-to-challenge-nia-decision/article30653569.ece
245,2020/01/26,Bodoland Area is set to be redrawn,"The Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) in Assam is set to be redrawn with the grant of special status.

According to a proposed memorandum accessed by The Hindu, the autonomous council will have special rights for the domiciles, and “outsiders” will have to obtain a “permit” to work in these areas. The draft says the persons “allowed to stay within the council for time being on work permit” will not have the right to vote.

The Union Home Ministry and the Assam government are expected to sign a memorandum of settlement with the banned insurgent group National Democratic Front of Bodoland-Progressive (NDFB-P), on January 27. The outfit had been demanding a separate land for the Bodos, an ethnic group in Assam. Its campaign was marred by violence that had claimed many lives.

Under the proposal, the “Government of India shall grant general amnesty to the convicts of the NDFB (if any) and withdraw all the cases and charges framed” against the members and sympathisers of the outfit. The proposal also includes withdrawal of all cases filed against NDFB workers by the NIA, the CBI and the police and release of all NDFB members from jails.

At least five new districts will be created and included in the revamped BTAD. Its jurisdiction will be extended to Sonitpur and Lakhimpur by creating Mainaosri and Holongi districts.

Now the BTAD, or the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), comprises four districts. The first Bodo accord, signed with the All Bodo Students Union in 1993, led to the creation of a Bodoland Autonomous Council with limited political powers. The BTC was created in 2003 with some more financial and other powers.

The draft says the electoral rolls for the council will be revised and prepared and consequently domicile certificates issued to the residents. “A person will be eligible to cast his/her vote in any election within the Council/Territory if only the names of his/her preceding generations were found in the voter list of 1971 or before, or the Legacy Data of 1971 or before, in compliance with the final National Register of Citizens, from any constituency within the Council/Territory,” it reads.

249,2020/01/26,Rajasthan to fortify midday meal,"The Congress government in Rajasthan is considering expansion of the food fortification project to cover midday meals distributed in schools and Anganwadi centres to provide micro-nutrients to children in view of the high rate of stunted growth. Against the national average of 37.9% children under five years having stunted growth, the figure in the State is 39.1%.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who discussed the steps for food security and measures to check adulteration with Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) chairperson Rita Teaotia here last week, said the fortification of mid-day meals would help tackle malnutrition among children. Food fortification has been executed through the public distribution system for common citizens, women and children.

The project being implemented in the State has covered wheat flour, soya dal, oil and milk to provide micro-nutrients to vulnerable sections of population, while new strategies are being formulated to widen its scope and reach out to more people.

‘Eat right campus’

Mr. Gehlot said the State Secretariat and other offices and institutions would be converted into “eat right campuses” to achieve better results of the food security drive. Besides, new campaigns will be launched to make the people aware of the effects of food adulteration and ensure the availability of safe food products.

Rajasthan has been described as a model State where the edible oil and dairy industries have achieved distinction in fortification of their products.

About 6 crore people in the State are consuming fortified oil produced by over 100 industries.

Ms. Teaotia said she had inspected the State’s food security laboratory and found it complying with the international standards.

She said the FSSAI would assist the State government in its drive for ensuring food security.

Activists working in the field of food security have laid emphasis on strengthening the regulatory mechanism to ensure the quality and safety of fortified foods and recommended a mandatory fortification of oil and milk with vitamins A and D.

As the micro-nutrient deficiency is prevalent in all age and socio-economic groups, the rights bodies have urged the State government to specifically address the issues of child stunting and wasting.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-to-fortify-midday-meal/article30655133.ece

College principal Shyama Roy confirmed that the ban on wearing of burqa in the institute’s premises has been withdrawn and said that the college has issued a second notice specifying that there is no such ban.

“There is a dress code of the college which specifies that a student has to wear a maroon colour kurta, white salwar and white dupatta. There is a misunderstanding in the notice ... We sincerely apologise for it,” Rekha Mishra, a teacher, said.

J.D. Women’s College is affiliated to Patliputra University.

“Many students used to come to classes in their home dresses in burqa, which was opposed by some others. Following the objections, college authorities issued notice asking students to strictly comply with the dress code,” another teacher said.

The students who had objected to the ban expressed happiness over the decision.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qnyxwv/article30655091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26BAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/college-withdraws-ban-on-wearing-burqa/article30655092.ece
253,2020/01/26,Haryana has right to Sutlej Yamuna Link canal: Kumari Selja,"Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja on Saturday said the Supreme Court had validated the State’s right on the water of Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal and it was the responsibility of the Centre to ensure that the State gets its due share.

Ms. Selja was addressing a press conference at her official residence on Safdarjung Lane here in connection with the recent meeting of political parties of Punjab, seeking setting up of a tribunal to check river water availability in the State. She added that it was a clear violation of the Supreme Court order. She said: “The State Congress and the people have struggled a lot in the courts on the issue of SYL. We will not back down in claiming our constitutional rights.” Haryana has around 40 lakh hectares of cultivable land, of which 33 % is irrigated through canal water, 50% through tube wells and the rest by rainwater. Whereas a network of canals is spread over 30 lakh hectares of land in the State but the canals remain dry due to water scarcity. The Haryana government should move the Supreme Court on this issue and bring SYL water to the State and the Centre should also explain its position in this matter, she said. She added that the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to distribute the water of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal between Punjab and Haryana and why the Centre was not taking any steps for it?

“Is it not true that the Prime Minister did not give time to the parties of Haryana to meet them on SYL issue? After this, why did not the State government pressurise the Centre? Haryana government should clarify what efforts it has taken during the last three years,” she asked.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lfqz8z/article30597118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19KUMARISELIJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sc-order-on-sutlej-issue-violated-selja/article30654762.ece
254,2020/01/26,England sets South Africa improbable target of 466 to win,"Captain Joe Root top scored as England took a huge 465-run lead over South Africa on the third day of the fourth test and were bowled out for 248 just before stumps in their second innings at The Wanderers on Sunday.

The score left them with two days to dismiss their hosts, who will have to chase an improbable fourth-innings target if they are to win the test and level the series at 2-2.

Fourteen wickets fell on a busy Sunday that saw South Africa dismissed for 183 at lunch, 217 runs behind Englands first-innings score of 400.

Root did not enforce the follow on but instead rammed home his teams advantage as England batted briskly in their second innings before the captain was the last man out, superbly caught by South African counterpart Faf du Plessis to give debutant Beuran Hendricks a maiden test five-wicket haul.

Root scored 58, Dom Sibley made 44, Sam Curran an entertaining 35 and Ben Stokes 28 with Hendricks finishing on 5-64 off 15.3 overs.

Openers Zak Crawley and Sibley put on a 56-run opening-wicket partnership in a positive second-innings start before Crawley was out for 24.

World-record target

Stokes was in belligerent mood, having been fined for verbally abusing a spectator after going cheaply in the first innings, and sought to get retribution as he raced to 28 off 24 balls, with six boundaries, before Hendricks had him caught in the slips.

Curran also made up for a first baller in the first innings as he accelerated the run rate in the last hour before being caught in the deep off Hendricks.

All the while Root kept the scoreboard ticking over to ensure South Africa will have to chase a world-record fourth innings target on a pitch where the bounce was becoming increasingly more uneven.

South Africa bowled a man light when veteran Vernon Philander pulled up with a hamstring injury after nine balls, further weakening a home attack already sorely missing the suspended Kagiso Rabada.

Philander was sent to hospital for a scan, said Cricket South Africa, threatening an inglorious end to his test career as he is retiring from the international arena.

Mark Wood completed a five-wicket haul earlier as South Africa were dismissed in the morning session, adding 95 runs to their overnight score.

“I'm over the moon — a very special day,” said Wood, who credited a shorter run-up for his success.

“Since I have (done that), it's been a lot better. I've got a little bit more momentum; it's taken pressure off my body. It's been nice to take a load off.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ayv0vn/article30659619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHAFRICA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-tour-of-south-africa-south-africa-vs-england-fourth-test-in-johannesburg-day-3/article30659620.ece
255,2020/01/26,Ranji Trophy | Gowtham boost for Karnataka,"Karun Nair sweated it out at the practice session on Sunday along with the rest of his Karnataka teammates as it was business as usual for the teams at the Karnail Singh Stadium here.

Back to leading the side after missing out on the previous game, Karun is aware the competition enters its business end and a win here against Railways in the Ranji Trophy match starting on Monday would put the team back in the reckoning for a spot in the knockouts.

It may not be easy though, given the inconsistent graph of the former champion this season so far.

Struggle

Despite a dominating performance in the shorter formats, Karnataka has struggled in the longer version. It has all the ingredients, but has failed to produce any individual brilliant performance.

The team is yet to see a century from one of its batsmen while the bowling has struggled in the absence of injured off-spinner K. Gowtham after the first game. He is back for this match.

“Every batsman wants to score and do something exceptional. It’s just a matter of time and believing in yourself and getting it done once or twice. It’s all about clicking in one game.

“Once that happens, others will also start believing in you and in themselves and you will see things flowing,” Karun said.

The good thing for Karnataka is that the opposition is equally in churn. Railways stunned heavyweight Mumbai to end 2019 on a high but that hasn’t eclipsed the team’s struggles. Captain Karn Sharma has been out for the last two games with a groin strain and will be missing out this one as well.

Railways missing spinner

Seamers Himanshu Sangwan and T. Pradeep have done the bulk of work in bowling but have found little support from the rest barring medium-pacer Amit Mishra. The absence of an effective spinner in the middle sessions has hurt the team.

Former captain Mahesh Rawat is back, which means the team’s top-scorer and wicketkeeper Dinesh Mor may have to sit out.

Playing its penultimate game and currently 11th on the table, Railways’ hopes of making the top-five are, at best, mathematical.

Karnataka, though, is seventh with 17 points and with a game in hand, would like to go home for its last two games on a winning note.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vnj9ar/article30659564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27GOWTHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-gowtham-boost-for-karnataka/article30659565.ece
256,2020/01/26,Hyderabad staring down the barrel,"In what is fast turning out to be a season of despair, Hyderabad needs to change gears as it is now a struggle for survival when it takes on Rajasthan in a four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group clash at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Monday.

The home team — with just one win (against Kerala) and five losses from six games — is at the bottom of the table with six points and captain Tanmay Agarwal should be looking for some kind of team effort.

Coach N. Arjun Yadav says they are clearly playing for pride now and the primary objective against Rajasthan is to take the first innings lead. “We are down but not out,” he said hoping for a stand-out performance at least in the last couple of games.

Nothing to rave about

In batting with the exception of wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth, captain Tanmay Agarwal and Jaweed Ali there was nothing much to rave about in the last two games.

The combined failure of the experienced duo of B. Sandeep (four matches, 41 runs) and seasoned opener P. Akashth Reddy (six matches, 172 runs) has cost Hyderabad this season.

In bowling, though pacers Ravi Kiran (18) and Mohd Siraj (17) — the latter now on India-A duty in New Zealand — were amongst wickets they never really ran through the opposition. And all-rounder T. Ravi Teja in three matches looked a better batter — 189 runs — than a bowler — three wickets.

No strike bowlers

Off-spinner Saaketh Sai Ram (four wickets in three) and Mehdi Hassan (14 wickets in six) never looked like strike bowlers. Interestingly, leg-spinner Akash Bhandari has been drafted into the squad for this match.

Meanwhile, Rajasthan — 10 points from five matches — will look up to its experienced captain, all-rounder Ashok Menaria, once again. He is its lead scorer this season with 440 and the only one to score a century. The team will also pin hopes on Rajesh Bishnoi, Mahipal Lomror, and opener Yash Kothari to come to good with the bat.

Rajasthan owed its solitary win — against Kerala in the last game — to left-arm spinner Shubham Sharma, who picked up 11 wickets. But, the focus will be on experienced pacer Rituraj Singh and left-armer Tanveer-ul-Haq to get the early breakthroughs on a pitch which is expected to play true.

The teams (from): Hyderabad: Tanmay Agarwal (capt), P. Akshath Reddy, B. Sandeep, Javeed Aliu, Saaketh Sairam, Rahul Buddi, K. Sumanth, Mehdi Hassan, T. Ravi Teja, C.V. Milind, Himalay Agarwal, J. Mallikarjun, Ajay Dev Goud and Akash Bhandari.

Rajasthan: Ashok Menaria (capt), Yash Kothari, Mahipal Lomror, Aniket Choudhary, Manendra Singh, Ram Niwas Golara, Rajesh Bishnoi Sr, Rituraj Singh, Arjit Gupta, Aditya Garhwal, C.P.

257,2020/01/26,"NZ vs IND T20I series: Learnt art of chasing watching Kohli bat, says Shreyas Iyer","There is no one better than Virat Kohli when it comes to chasing down totals in white-ball cricket, something that India’s newest No 4 Shreyas Iyer wants to emulate on a consistent basis in coming days.

With a half-century and 44 off 33 balls in the successful chases in the first two T20 Internationals, Iyer is fast becoming another viable option for the Indian team apart from its talismanic skipper when it comes to tricky run-chases.

“I personally feel that you have a fair idea how many runs you are going to chase and at what run-rate you have to chase them. Virat Kohli is the perfect example when he goes out to bat and the way he plans his innings. I learn a lot from him personally, the way he grinds out and he tries to finish the game. That’s the best part about him,” Iyer told mediapersons after India took 2-0 lead in the five-match series.

He also learns a lot from his senior Mumbai teammate Rohit Sharma, who can demolish any attack on his day.

“(I) Also (learn from) Rohit Sharma, whenever he’s given an opportunity, he makes the best use of it. All these amazing characters in the team set a really good example for us youngsters.

“There’s a lot to learn from them and that’s what I try to apply whenever I go out there. I think that I have to stay not out and it really helps me grind throughout that middle period and when the time comes, I take on the bowlers. That’s how you plan your innings when you are chasing,” Iyer said.

The 25-year-old is known for his penchant for hitting big sixes but he also understands the value of rotating the strike as a middle-order batsman.

“You have to play all sorts of shots and take singles. As well as when you want to hit sixes, you have to be aware of the fact that you have to create that moment for yourself. You have to give yourself that time to get set. That’s what I usually do.”

He has now played 34 white-ball games for India (15 ODIs and 19 T20Is) and realises that staying at the crease an important virtue.

“I have realized playing so many matches that as long as I stay on the wicket, I tend to see the ball really well and I can take on the bowlers,” he opined.

“The Eden Park is a ridiculously short ground for an international game but even then it doesn’t make six-hitting easier,” Iyer reckons.

“You do feel that the boundaries are close and you can easily clear them. But at the back of your mind, I like to give myself some time and I also count the spinners’ overs, and gauge how many they will bowl.

“If you give yourself time and charge at them in the later overs, your eyes are also better set and once you do that, it doesn’t matter how big the boundaries are. You can still easily clear them,” he added.

He did admit that chasing 133 was easier as he knew that there was no pressure of scoreboard on either him or KL Rahul.

“It makes you feel a little composed while chasing 130 because at the back of the mind, you know that you have to maintain a run-rate of about 7.

“And at the same time, you curtail the risk as well. It was very important for us to keep at the back of the mind that we need to keep rotating the strike and when the time comes, we need to take charge on the bowlers.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hmcx62/article30657874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHREYASIYER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-vs-india-second-t20-international-in-auckland-shreyas-iyer-on-art-of-chasing/article30657875.ece
258,2020/01/26,"NZ vs IND second T20I: Bowlers stood up and took control, says Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli lauded his bowling unit for taking control of the proceedings from the onset after an emphatic seven-wicket victory against New Zealand in the second T20 International in Auckland on Sunday.

Ravindra Jadeja (2/18 in 4 overs) and Jasprit Bumrah (1/21 in 4 overs) were primarily responsible for restricting New Zealand to 132 with the help of a steady Mohammed Shami (0/22 in 4 overs).

“I think we had another good performance today, especially with the ball. The bowlers stood up and took control of what we wanted to do out there. Sticking to one side of the wicket was a very good feature for us as a team to restrict a good New Zealand team to 132 which I think was below par,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

The low target led to India chasing down the total with 15 balls to spare.

“The low total led us to bat in that manner but we thought the pitch was good for 160 in the first half. We understood the angles of the field better, how the pitch was playing and I had to think on my feet as a captain,” he added.

Jadeja had the advantage as the ball gripped on this surface which was different from the first game.

“The ball gripped for the spinners and I think Jadeja was outstanding. Chahal was a banker. Bumrah was amazing as well, and Shami and Shardul and Shivam making very good contributions with the ball but I think we backed it up in the field more importantly,” he added.

Kohli’s opposite number Kane Williamson reckoned that the pitch was tough for batting compared to the first match and that they were 20 runs short.

“It was a tough day. The wicket was quite different from the first game. I think as a batting unit we needed another 15 or 20 to make it a little bit more competitive. But credit to the way India bowled,” Williamson said.

He termed India as a “class side” which put them under constant pressure.

“They’re a class side in all departments and they put us under pressure in that middle period. Even though we only had 130 on the board on a small ground, we still knew if we were able to take early wickets and build pressure like they did, then you never really know.

“But they showed their experience and took the game much deeper than we were able to in the first innings and they were very clinical.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5l4z4n/article30657518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATKOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-second-t20-international-in-auckland/article30657519.ece
259,2020/01/26,"NZ vs IND T20I: Rahul, Shreyas call the shots after bowlers’ super show","India tightened their grip on the T20I series with a seven-wicket drubbing of New Zealand in the second match after their bowlers stifled the hosts on a pocket-sized Eden Park in Auckland on Sunday.

Boasting a formidable batting line-up, chasing 133 proved to be a cakewalk for the visitors on a pitch that was slightly on the slower side.

The very short boundary ensured the match ended with as many as 15 balls to spare.

The trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami allowed no respite to Kane Williamson’s team after New Zealand surprisingly chose to bat, restricting them to 132 for five.

K L Rahul then scored 57 not out off 50 balls while Shreyas Iyer scored 44 off 33 balls, the duo adding 86 runs for the third wicket and after Rohit Sharma’s twin failure.

Tim Southee took 2-20 as India had to do without major contributions from both Sharma and skipper Virat Kohli.

Sharma (8) was out caught at slip in the first over off Southee. New Zealand’s new ball bowlers were compact and didn’t let the Indian top order get away unlike the first T20I on Friday.

Even so, Rahul and Kohli added 31 runs for the second wicket. The latter then was caught behind off Southee in the sixth over with Tim Seifert taking a brilliant diving catch.

Kohli scored 11 off 12 balls and the wicket’s slow nature was starting to impact proceedings. New Zealand held back their spinners too, but Rahul-Iyer settled down in this passage of play.

They rotated strike well and added 50 in 55 balls by minimising risks. Rahul brought up his 11th T20I half-century off 43 balls.

Overall, Rahul hit three fours and two sixes, while Iyer hit one four and three sixes.

India crossed 100 in the 15th over after which Iyer cut loose to approach the finish line. He fell just prior, holing out off Ish Sodhi (1-33).

But Rahul stuck around while Shivam Dube finished the job with a six over midwicket.

This was after Indian bowlers made good use of a slower pitch.

Opting to bat, the Black Caps couldn’t generate enough momentum in the middle overs and finished with a sub-par total.

Martin Guptill top-scored with 33 off 20 balls, while Tim Seifert was unbeaten on 33 not out off 26 balls.

Guptill and Colin Munro (26) provided a measured start to New Zealand putting on 48 runs for the first wicket.

Surprisingly, India held back Jasprit Bumrah (1-21) as Shardul Thakur (1-21) and Mohammed Shami (0-22) bowled four overs in the power play. The tactic worked as Thakur got rid of Guptill at end of six overs.

India then used the slow nature of the used-wicket to put brakes on the New Zealand middle order. Wickets came at a regular interval as the Black Caps struggled to get the big shots out.

Yuzvendra Chahal (0-33) and Shivam Dube (1-16) combined well after the powerplay, while Ravindra Jadeja was the stand out bowler with figures of 2-18 from four overs.

Overall, India also raised their fielding effort barring a bizarre drop from Virat Kohli late in the innings.

Dube got rid of Munro in the ninth over while Colin de Grandhomme (3) failed to get going once again. Jadeja gleefully accepted his return catch.

The hosts were reduced to 81 for four in the 13th over when skipper Kane Williamson (14) became Jadeja’s victim, caught in the deep by Chahal.

The wheels had truly come off the New Zealand innings as they were struggling to get the big shots away and squandered their measured start away.

Ross Taylor (18) struggling for timing throughout his 24-ball stay was a prime example. Without Seifert’s effort, including a four and two sixes, the score wouldn’t have achieved any respectability.

Iyer walked off the field in the last over after hurting his left knee whilst fielding.

More than 500 people had visited the ‘Kirukkalam Vaanga’ counter on Sunday. They were given papers and pens to scribble and the bits of papers will be pinned up on a board on Monday. There was also a white board on which the visitors wrote their name and a volunteer wrote it again in Tamil - Brahmi script. The visitors could take selfies with it. They were also asked to give their suggestions and opinions and it was displayed nearby.

C. Sivakumar, curator of the museum, says the whole initiative is aimed at creating awareness about historical sites, inscriptions, and historical findings in the region and how these need to be preserved. Public should avoid scribbling on these rocks and inscriptions. That is why they are given papers and pens and asked to scribble on it.

Volunteers from the Chera Mandala Historical and Cultural Research Society and History Department students of the Government Arts College and Nirmala College for Women were also part of the one-day programme at the museum. Several photographs of archaeological findings, places of historical importance, inscriptions and hero stones were displayed at the counter. Some of these had been vandalised.

The volunteers explained the need to preserve the sites. From 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., the visitors learnt about rock paintings, burial sites, historical sites and the importance of museum. Some of them also took a look at the collections at the museum.

268,2020/01/26,Coimbatore Corpn. bid to improve Swachh Survekshan ranking,"It is one thing to encourage people to vote and quite another to tell them whom to choose. This is, perhaps, what the Coimbatore Corporation is doing in encouraging people to vote in Swachh Survekshan 2020.

Swachh Survekshan is an annual exercise that the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs conducts to rate cities on cleanliness. As a part of the exercise the Ministry lets citizens have a say in how effective is their local body in cleaning the city. And, this gains importance because the citizens’ feedback influences how the Ministry ranks cities.

Ahead of this year’s rating exercise, Swachh Survekshan2020, the Ministry has once again opened the web page (swachhsurvekshan2020.or/Citizen Feedback) to let citizens vote. To encourage the city’s residents to vote, the Coimbatore Corporation is conducting outreach programmes to create awareness and encourage voting.

In a flyer that is being distributed to public, the Corporation is seen suggesting the residents give it the maximum mark – 10.

After showing residents the options to choose against the ‘state’, ‘district’, and ‘name of urban local body/city’ drop boxes, the Corporation asks residents to key-in their mobile number and choose the appropriate gender. But when it comes to the ‘cleanliness level in neighbourhood’, ‘cleanliness level in public and commercial areas’ questions, the Corporation has suggested that the rating be the maximum- 10- in the flyer.

For the next two questions in the website – ‘segregation of dry and wet waste and ‘plants in road dividers’ – the Corporation has suggested that the answer be ‘yes, always’. The Corporation repeats the maximum mark suggestion for the sixth question on the website as well, which is cleanliness level in public toilet.

Objective

The Corporation officials say the objective behind the outreach is to create awareness on Swachh Survekshan among as many people as possible, something that the Ministry wants. As for the maximum marks it has suggested, the officials say the civic body cannot afford to say otherwise.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2q6b7e/article30654740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB26VOTEGIVING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corpn-bid-to-improve-swachh-survekshan-ranking/article30654741.ece
269,2020/01/26,Protest staged against CAA,"Members of the Tamil Nadu Towheed Jamaath took out a protest rally here on Saturday against the recently introduced Citizenship Amendment Act.

Thousands of people, including a large number of women, took part in the which was held from Central Post Office near old bus stand to the District Collectorate here. However, the protesters were stopped much before the Collector’s office by the police.

The protesters also demanded that enumeration processes like National Population Register and National Register of Citizens should also be stopped.

The protesters waved the National Flag all through the protest and held placards against the Act.

The protesters also demanded that the State government should pass a resolution in the Legislative Assembly against the Act and it should stop NPR, NRC processes in State.

Syed Ali, State Committee member of the organisation said that despite huge protests the Centre is not ready to listen to the public and withdraw the law.

273,2020/01/26,Oppn parties’ slumber helping Modi take anti-people decisions: Chidambaram,"The Opposition parties’ slumber has helped Prime Minister Narendra Modi take one anti-people decision after another. However, after the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed, the vacuum created by political parties had been filled by a new force – that of students and the youth, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said here on Saturday at the meeting the Congress had organised to condemn the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“Throughout India, a force aside from political parties has emerged. It has filled the vacuum created by political parties that have failed to take on the ruling BJP government. Looking at the force, political parties should wake up from their deep slumber. I bow down to the force,” he said.

Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the economy was hit hard by the effects of demonetisation and the introduction of GST, export was falling and unemployment was rising. Yet, the BJP was able to return to power.

The confidence that the victory gave Mr. Modi had distracted him from what was to be done or take the right decision – put the economy back on track.

He first took up triple talaq. After the Supreme Court had ruled that triple talaq was illegal, where was the for the BJP to criminalise the action. It was this criminalisation that the Congress was opposed to, Mr. Chidambaram said.

The Prime Minister next attempted to implement the National Register of Citizenship exercise to identify illegal immigrants in Assam. Home Minister Amit Shah had termed the 19.06 lakh-odd immigrants as termites and threatened to throw them out of the country before 2024.

In passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the Modi government had undone in 72 hours what the Constitution makers took three months to debate, he said in reference to the time taken to draft Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Thinking that the Opposition parties were sleeping, Mr. Modi took the step but he did not foresee the emergence of students and youth as a force against it.

“The Congress is opposing the CAA not for what it says but for what it does not say – that the Muslims have been excluded and will not get citizenship,” Mr. Chidambaram said. The Act was discriminatory, it would not stand the scrutiny of law.

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said the reason for Congress' weakness was that its office-bearers were not talking about the achievements of its leaders and the failure to communicate with the cadre.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/9icw7j/article30654648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB26-MEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/oppn-parties-slumber-helping-modi-take-anti-people-decisions-chidambaram/article30654649.ece

Radhika Vemula, Rohith Vemula’s mother, who was accompanied by the dadis and former JNU student Umar Khalid unfurled the national flag. They sang the national anthem along with thousands of people including women and children who had gathered at Shaheen Bagh to celebrate the occasion.

Jignesh Mevani, MLA of Gujarat's Vadgam Assembly Constituency, was also present there.

Let a thousand Shaheen Baghs bloom to protect our Constitution from our rulers.

The protesters, who are opposing the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and a pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC), have been sitting on protest at Shaheen Bagh for over a month. The protesters said they will continue their agitation until the government decides to rollback the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

From children to women, many held the national flag and sang patriotic songs. They chanted CAA se Azaadi, NRC se Azaadi, BJP se Azaadi (freedom from CAA, NRC and BJP) while raising other slogans against the CAA and the NRC.

“We do not want a Prime Minister who cannot listen to our grievance and address our concerns. Why has the Prime Minister or any of his representatives addressed us yet? Why didn’t he visit us and explain the CAA and NRC?,” asked 75-year-old Sarwari, one of the dadis, who has been part of the protest for over a month now.

The 82-year-old Bilkis said, “This is our nation and our forefathers have contributed in the freedom struggle of this country. Today, if we fail to protect the Constitution and the secular fabric of this country, we will fail to save the future of our nation,” she said. Recalling violence at the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Jawaharlal Nehru University, she asked if this was how the government was promoting the beti bachao beti padhao concept. “Are our students even safe on their campuses? Was it right to barge inside the campus and assault students in this manner? Is this beti bachao beti padhao?”

The 90-year-old Asma Khatoon was also present at the flag hoisting ceremony.

Shaheen, another protester and a resident of Jamia Nagar, said: “We will not allow this divide and rule policy to be implemented here. We have been living here in harmony since ages. Today they are trying to divide us on the basis of religion and will follow it up with caste discrimination. We cannot let this happen. And why is the government not visiting us if they are so confident about their stand on CAA and NRC?”

Shahzia, who joined the agitation 15 days ago, said she will continue to protest until there is an assurance from the government on the newly amended act. “If we do not fight for our rights today, the future generation will question us tomorrow. This fight is not religion centric. It is a common fight to save our nation from the divide-rule policy of the government,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/h40oe3/article30659223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-CITIZENSHIPPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/republic-day-at-shaheen-bagh-dadis-rohith-vemulas-mother-hoist-national-flag-amid-chants-of-azaadi-and-jana-gana-mana/article30659224.ece

According to the police, Mr. Imam, a resident of Bihar and a former Jawaharlal Nehru University student, delivered “inflammatory and instigating speeches expressing his opposition to CAA and NRC”. Police have videos of his speeches that he had delivered at Shaheen Bagh and outside Jamia Millia Islamia.

Widely circulated

“His speeches are widely circulated on social media and police have received five complaints. The matter was discussed with senior police officers and after getting their approval, an FIR was registered at Crime Branch police station,” they said.

These speeches have the “potential to harm the religious harmony” and the unity and integrity of India, for which the case was registered against him, police said.

He reportedly said that if he can organise five lakh people, it would become possible to “permanently cut off Assam with the rest of India...if not permanently, then at least for a few months”.

A case against Mr. Imam under IPC Sections 124A (an offence by words, either spoken or written causes disaffection against government established by law), 153A (promoting enmity between different religious groups with an intent to create disharmony) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) has been registered, the Delhi police said.

276,2020/01/26,"Delhi under multi-layered, ground-to-air security cover for Republic Day celebrations","With the 71st Republic Day celebrations set to begin in New Delhi shortly, the entire national capital has been put under a multi-layered, ground-to-air security cover with thousands of armed personnel keeping a tight vigil over it, including the celebration venue Rajpath.

Aided by dozens of drones in the air and hundreds of CCTV cameras and facial recognition devices, besides several anti-aircraft guns on the ground, the security personnel are keeping a hawk-eyed vigil over Rajpath, where President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be celebrating the occasion along with chief guest, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and other dignitaries, besides thousands of citizens.

Over ten thousand security personnel have been deployed to keep vigil over the Republic Day celebrations on Sunday, said officials.

Sharpshooters and snipers have been deployed atop high-rise buildings to keep watch on the eight-km-long parade route from Rajpath to the Red Fort, they said.

The celebration venue Rajpath will remain inaccessible to general traffic till 12 noon, till when the entry and exit gates of the Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Patel Chowk and Lok Kalyan Marg metro stations too will remain closed, beginning from 8.45 am.

The Delhi police has also installed its facial recognition devices at all entry gates of the celebration venue to identify miscreants and suspects, said officials.

Special security arrangements have been made for Brazilian President Bolsonaro, who is the chief guest for the Republic Day parade, Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal had said earlier.

More than 2,000 Traffic Police personnel have been deployed to ensure smooth flow of the traffic and facilitate spectators reach the venue.

Hundreds of CCTV cameras too have been installed as part of the security arrangements, including at least 150 cameras in areas covering the Red Fort, Chandni Chowk and Yamuna Khadar, they said.

“We have a four-layered security arrangement. Inner, middle, outer and one along the border areas across the national capital,” said Singhal, adding drones have also been deployed to aid and assist security personnel on the ground and give feed to them on the general and security scenario around them.

“Around 5,000 to 6,000 Delhi police personnel have been deployed in the New Delhi district along with 50 companies of paramilitary forces,” he added.

With the Republic Day celebration being held within a fortnight of the upcoming Delhi assembly elections, the police personnel have even otherwise been on alert, the official said.

The police have already been undertaking various security measures, including the anti-terror ones, like checking people and vehicles entering Delhi, intensified patrolling of malls and markets and enhancing security cover of vital installations, besides intensifying the regular verifications of tenant and servants, the officials said.

The police have also asked hotels, taxi and auto drivers to remain alert. In view of the heightened security, patrolling in public places has been intensified.

“We have intensified patrolling in public places. Group patrolling and vehicle checking is being carried out with the help of Central Armed Police Forces. Frisking at metro stations, railway stations, airport and bus terminals has also been intensified,” a senior police official said.

Apart from securing the celebration venue Rajpath, adequate security and traffic arrangements for the ‘At Home’ function at Rashtrapati Bhavan too have been made.

The security personnel have identified vulnerable spots such as crowded markets, railway stations, bus stands and other high-value establishments, where extra police personnel have been deployed.

A traffic advisory has also been issued about the elaborate arrangement route diversions on Sunday, as per which no traffic was allowed on Rajpath from Vijay Chowk to India Gate since 6 pm on Saturday, the officials said, adding the ban will continue till the parade gets over on Sunday.

277,2020/01/26,"Channelling the citizen: Role of YouTubers, bloggers in anti-CAA protests","As the clarion call for harmony and solidarity issued from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh resonates in households across small-town India, behind the message lies the medium. A band of intrepid online warriors has ensured that the metropolitan ferment percolates into the hinterland. These YouTubers, bloggers and youth activists, devoid of the easy labels one can stick such as “sickular” or “compromised”, have leveraged the reach and speed of social media to exert influence independent of any mainstream media groups.

One such face of “new-age journalism” is Mohammed Tasleem, a Jamia Millia Islamia student, whose YouTube channel — Jamia World — relays every important event in the university, which has become the epicentre of protests against the amended citizenship Act.

Armed with a mobile phone, selfie stick and a microphone, Mr. Tasleem, a graduate in television journalism who is pursuing master’s in international relations from JMI, goes around the campus and nearby areas covering every aspect of the anti-CAA protests. “I have been covering the Jamia protests 24X7 since it started on December 13. I am always here, so obviously I reach much before the other media channels do,” he said. On a daily basis, Mr. Tasleem uploads close to half-a-dozen videos, popular among which are speeches delivered at the protest site, graphic details of police lathi-charge, live telecast of Delhi Police intrusion into the Jamia library and so on. For now, likes, shares, and followers are the only “profit” that Mr. Tasleem earns. “My motto is to ensure that the news that most mainstream media outlets do not want to show for whatever reasons reaches the people. This is what I do using the social media,” he said.

The Facebook and YouTube page of Jamia World is a collection of videos, majority of which are played without any commentary.

Professional YouTubers

There are others such as former journalist Akash Banerjee who have used the social media effectively for political satire and comment. His YouTube channel has over one million subscribers, a mark that he crossed recently. Mr. Banerjee said YouTube channels such as his have an advantage over the mainstream media as they do not have to deal with the usual pressures of generating revenue and TRPs. “I don’t have to worry about serving the lowest common denominator,” Mr. Banerjee said. Many online platforms like his are publicly funded, which helps them to stay out of government control.

“It’s not that digital platforms are showing anything dramatically different from the mainstream media. It’s just that sometimes, we highlight news stories that are often buried in the inside pages of a newspaper,” Mr. Banerjee added. One of his most popular videos, he said, was on data fudging by the government. “The biggest scam of the government is systematically slaughtering data. I have highlighted it in different episodes,” he said.

A similar online sensation is 25-year-old Dhruv Rathee, who has been doing video blogs on YouTube since 2016. For him, it all started with the story of IAS officer Ashok Khemka who was transferred repeatedly in Haryana. Mr. Rathee is a mechanical engineer by training and is now pursuing a bachelor’s in economics and political science. “My primary goal is to break down complex topics in simple words and summarise a whole lot of information on specific topics in 10 minutes so that someone who doesn’t know anything about it is able to understand easily,” Mr. Rathee said.

He said that raising the issue of electoral bonds, which were introduced through the Finance Bill, 2017, was one of his achievements. The mainstream media had ignored the issue for a long time. “I feel like the media took up the story much later. It was buried and the implications of the Finance Bill, 2017 were not explained properly,” Mr. Rathee said.

On mainstream media, he said it can’t be replaced by any other medium as it remains the primary source of information. “We neither have the manpower nor the resources to gather news the way they do,” he added.

Another youth icon, Communist Party of India leader Kanhaiya Kumar, has notched up 1.98 lakh subscribers for his YouTube channel. The former JNU Students’ Union president has earned a fan following for his incisive demagogy; the channel is a repository of the speeches and TV shows he has participated in.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/m72n54/article30654994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26TASLEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/channelling-the-citizen/article30654995.ece
278,2020/01/26,Shah has insulted 16 lakh students: Kejriwal,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday attacked Home Minister Amit Shah over his comments on Delhi government schools, and said that it is not right to “make fun” of the hard work of students, or their parents and teachers.

During a press conference, Mr. Kejriwal appealed to Mr. Shah to not do “dirty politics” over schools.

‘No dirty politics’

“There should not be any dirty politics over education. Mr. Shah said that education in Delhi was not good and that the schools are bad... I invite him today, you [Mr. Shah] give me the time, I will cancel all my appointments and take you to Delhi’s schools. You tell me which school you want to go to. We are not saying that everything is fine, but we have done a lot of work,” he said.

He added that 16 lakh students are studying in Delhi government schools and the institutions are doing better as a result of their hard work, and the efforts of their parents as well as the 60,000-65,000 teachers.

“Through your statements, those 16 lakh students have been insulted, those 65,000 teachers have been insulted, the parents of these 16 lakh students have been insulted. If you have a problem with us, then attack us... Do not abuse the hard work of 16 lakh students and their parents and teachers,” he said.

“I appreciate Mr. Kejriwal for serving Delhi as his motherland. I joined politics when I was 21... politics back then was based on values. I first came into mainstream politics in 1977 when the Delhi Assembly did not even exist. I was given the opportunity of being the first Sikh Minister of Delhi by Madan Lal Khurana.

Mr. Shah’s remarks came during his address at a volunteers’ meet Jeet Ki Goonj at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, which was attended by the party’s social media volunteers. “Today, more than 25,000 people are sitting here... Your confidence, your capacity, your courage show that in 2014 you were with Narendra Modi; in 2019 and 2020 also you are with Modi. I have trust in your support, your courage, your capacity to fight and your commitment to the party and I can tell that the BJP is going to form the government in Delhi,” Mr. Shah said.

“Be it the election of 2014 or 2019; of U.P., Tripura, Manipur or Assam; the BJP has succeeded in these difficult elections. Sometimes it appeared that we are not going to succeed, the opposition parties felt happy, but when the cyber-warriors start working, then Modi and the BJP has emerged victorious,” he added.

“When you support the BJP, you secure India’s borders, take a big step towards making India a $5 trillion economy, and provide support to households of 60 crore people who now have power, water, toilets, health cards, gas connections and drinking water,” said the Minister.

‘88% vote share’

In 2019, out of the 13,750 booths in Delhi, the BJP won on 12,088 booths, which comes to a total of 88% of the vote share, claimed Mr. Shah, adding that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal “tweets to mislead the people of Delhi”.

“You [party volunteers] have to apprise the people of Delhi about the truth through social media... Mr. Kejriwal promised that he will give RO quality water to the people of Delhi and lay pipelines. The water of Delhi was found to be the most polluted out of 21 cities of India. Mr. Kejriwal must answer why the people of Delhi are compelled to drink polluted water,” he said.

“You have to expose these falsehoods which may be connected to the development of Delhi or on CAA or for provoking the Muslim youth. The Modi government has taken decisions to strengthen the country but people are being misled,” he alleged.

“After changing the country for the better, PM Modi now wants to change Delhi,” said Mr. Shah.

The Minister also attacked the BJP’s political opponents and said they were part of the ‘Tukde-Tukde gang’.

“The Congress, Mamata Banerjee, SP, BSP and AAP misled the country, triggered riots, made Delhi unsafe...can they save Delhi? They are all the Tukde-Tukde gang. They still say they are with Shaheen Bagh... the lust for votes has blinded them,” he alleged.

As per the practice, Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and Sub-divisional Magistrates hoist the Tricolour in case the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are not present at the function. Haryana Cabinet has 13 ministers, including the Chief Minister, but there are 22 districts. Mr. Vidrohi said the government officials hoisting the flag was against the spirit of democracy.

284,2020/01/26,"‘In Faridabad, nearly half of all water connections are illegal’","Dabua Colony in Faridabad’s New Industrial Town (NIT) is among the most populous residential colonies in Haryana with an estimated population of three lakh.

Though the colony is mostly regularised, around two-thirds of the water connections there are illegal.

Superintending Engineer, MCF, Bikram Kardam conceded that more than one lakh water connections in Faridabad were suspected to be illegal. He said that though 2,73,000 units paid property tax, only around 1,40,000 had a legal water connection.

Mr. Kardam added that a survey was under way and those with illegal connections were being served notices by the respective executive engineers. “After the serving of the notices, water connections of those who fail to procure regular connections will be disconnected,” said Mr. Kardam.

Underscoring how the menace of illegal water connections goes unchecked by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, ex-serviceman Rishi Pal Chaudhary, a Dabua colony resident, called himself a “fool” for having procured a legal water connection a decade ago.

“People have illegal water connections from the pipeline laid by the municipal corporation and are using water for free for almost a decade. I was a fool to have taken a legal connection,” said Mr. Chaudhary (67).

Spread across three municipal wards – 8, 9 and 10 – Dabua has a large number of small-scale industrial units running from houses without licences. Though these units have power connections, they draw water illegally from the municipal pipelines, Jaspal Singh, who runs one such unit, said, adding: “I never felt the need to take a water connection.”

Similarly, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Nagar, locally known as SGM Nagar, also in the NIT area, has a large number of illegal water connections, with the residents drawing water from the pipelines laid by the municipal corporation.

Raju, a physically challenged grocery shop owner, said that he had been staying in the colony for around ten years and had been using water without a legal connection. “Why should I apply for a connection, when I am getting water without a legal connection?” he retorted when asked if he had ever applied for one. He claimed that almost one-fourth of the water connections in the colony could be illegal.

Gulshan Gaba, running a small industrial bags unit in Gali No.10, said that there were around 150-odd tubewells installed by the MCF in the colony and a majority of the water connections were illegal. However, a portion of the SGM Nagar, falling under ward no.17, which is regularised, has regular water and sewer connections.

“Several areas of SGM Nagar, including Gali No.10, are unauthorised. A survey was conducted five years ago and again a month back. We hope the remaining areas will also be regularised soon,” said Mr. Gaba.

He added there were around a 1,000 small and medium industrial units in SGM Nagar that mostly make automotive parts.

Laxmi Chand, a 61-year-old tea stall owner, said a majority of the houses did not even have sewer connections and most of the people had dug up pits to make up for it. He also did not have a legal water connection.

“Getting a legal water connection costs around ₹2,000. I cannot afford it. So, I took an illegal connection from the municipal corporation pipeline running close to my house,” said Laxmi Chand, with a grin.

Though Jawahar Colony, with a population of around 1 lakh, mostly have legal water connections, illegal connections are rampant in the neighbouring Parvatia Colony and Sanjay Colony with a majority of the population being daily-wager migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mctojf/article30654884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE26WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-faridabad-nearly-half-of-all-water-connections-are-illegal/article30654885.ece

288,2020/01/26,Noida hospital to compensate family for death of woman during surgery,"While observing the importance of obtaining informed consent from a patient “cannot be undermined”, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has directed Fortis Hospital, Noida, to compensate a family by paying over ₹10 lakh for a woman who died following a surgery.

Noting that the patient was a “mother, a homemaker and her contribution towards the family cannot be measured in monetary terms”, the NCDRC said: “The amount being awarded as compensation is directed to be paid by the hospital as taking informed consent from the patient or attendant is its duty.” The Bench also said: “The fact remains that the patient died subsequent to stenting which further enhances the importance of taking informed consent. Had the patient’s attendants been informed of the risks involved considering the patient’s age, the choice of going ahead with the surgery or not could have been thoughtfully exercised by them.”

During surgery

The directions came when the apex consumer panel was hearing a plea which claimed that no written consent was taken from either the 73-year-old patient or her family. Only during the surgery, the family was informed that “certain complications” had arisen, which also led to the patient being paralysed later.

The NCDRC said: “The consent form filed with an affidavit is blank with respect to columns explaining the risks and hence we conclude that doctors did not disclose the nature and procedure of treatment, benefits and alternatives if any, available and the risks involved. There is negligence on behalf of the hospital.” An additional amount of ₹25,000 was also directed to be paid to the family towards litigation costs.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/noida-hospital-to-compensate-family-for-death-of-woman-during-surgery/article30654772.ece
289,2020/01/26,Think big!,"‘Let a man have high thoughts even if he is not able to live up to his aims. It might be fulfilled at some point of time in his life perhaps.’ This is a sample of the rich insights that make the Tirukkural ever relevant to the human race, Sri Tamizhmagan said in a discourse.

Any individual belonging to any culture, faith or century, and speaking any language, is sure to feel the far-reaching influence of the wisdom that the text disseminates. The literary beauties in the pithy couplets complement the profound thoughts they convey as is seen in the way many matter-of-fact statements are illustrated with word pictures drawn from day-to-day life that leave a lasting and unforgettable effect in the mind.

For instance, the essence of valour is captured in the image of one who aims a dart at an elephant and misses it; this is shown to be an act of greater courage than one who aims an arrow at a rabbit in the forest.

It is common sense to understand one’s strengths and weaknesses in any undertaking. If one is not honest about this, he is sure to face failures. This idea is illustrated with a visual image. A cartload of peacock feathers may appear to be light; but if it is overloaded beyond its capacity, it is sure to break the wheel. This also shows that anything in excess is harmful and can cause disaster even if it is life-giving medicine.

There is a striking visual image to show how wealth is earned by saving small quantities of money; and how if by ill-luck one falls into misfortune, all this can leave him at one stroke. It is like the way people trek in one by one to attend a theatre performance. But when the show ends, the entire crowd is seen dispersing with great haste.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/think-big/article30659475.ece
290,2020/01/26,Watch | A book to go with your hair cut,"Inch by inch, Pon Mariappan's salon in Millerpuram is getting cramped. Not just customers fill up his 10X10 sq.ft.shop. Nor do newspapers, magazines, television set, posters of cricket and cinema stars or an overkill of cosmetic kits clutter the tiny space. Instead, you will be surprised to find the unlikeliest item in a barber’s shop -- heaps of books!

He has put up a shelf that can hold 250 books. The rest remain piled up in corners, balance on a stool like Jenga blocks, peep out from top of a cupboard or kept inside cartons. But the 39 year-old shop owner is not complaining. This is the dream, Pon Mariappan says, he nurtured ever since he dropped out of school in class 8 because his father could not afford his education.

""I always wanted to study more to be able to do something different,"" he says. While destiny willed it otherwise, he never gave up on his dream. He worked as a loader for 18 years, saved money and set up the salon. ""I believe knowledge takes you far and always wondered how to make people read,"" he says, “and especially inculcate the habit of reading in children.”

When he started the Suresh Beauty Centre in 2014, he saw his customers glued to their cell phones or only watching television in his shop as they waited for their turn for the hair cut.

That is when the idea struck him and one morning he removed the TV and replaced the magazines with five books. These were biographies of leaders like Periyar, Annadurai, Kalam, Abraham Lincoln and Karl Marx. After few days, he noticed random customers picking up the books and flipping through the pages, some spent time to read them too. “It was enough to inspire me,” says Mariappan.

Over the next few months he built on his collection with books bought from scrap dealers, stores offering discounts and at book fairs. By 2015 end, one wall of his salon was dedicated to books on philosophy to science thrillers, fiction to folk tales, religion and mythology to moral stories and fairy tales for children.

""Whenever a customer walks in, I request them not to use their mobiles and instead pick up any book to read while waiting. In the beginning, not everybody heeded to my request but over a period, majority of them did,"" says Mariappan.

With his young customers he is more persuasive. When students walk in, he requests them not only to read but also write a gist of what they read. He maintains a register from December 2018 and so far, more than 300 children have put down their names with school and class, the title of the book along with the author's name, the page numbers read and summary of what they read.

Mariappan began the new year by offering a discount of Rs.30 (on his price of Rs.80 for a hair cut) to all those who read at least 10 pages of any book sitting in his salon and also write about it. From next month he also plans to introduce open mike reading during weekends. ""My idea is to make the school children read aloud and help them to conquer stage fear,"" he says.

Following some social media posts, Mariappan came into limelight last month for the unique salon he has been running silently for six years. Ever since he has been flooded with requests for interviews and donations of books. ""I need to get another book shelf ready quickly and also make space for it inside the shop,"" he smiles.

More than the number of books or the titles he has accumulated, his unique initiative t o encourage his customers to read has endeared him to people. His efforts have been applauded by his favourite author S Ramakrishnan and Thoothukudi MP, Kanimozhi has contributed 50 books to his library.

Mariappan is excited about the first bunch of English books he received last week from publishing house Hatchette India. ""Till now, I had only Tamil books,"" he says, and cites some of his favourites -- the life story and works of Bharathiyar, Swami Vivekananda, Thiruvalluvar, Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi and several other freedom fighters, national leaders, thinkers, scientists, philosophers.

From next month, he is planning to also lend books to college students as a trial. ""I feel happy to integrate my passion with my work and make people invest their time in reading,” he says and adds, ""Nothing provides a stronger pull than the experience of reading and getting lost in the world of books.""",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/i3q533/article30656865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pon-Mariappan-a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pon-mariappan-maintains-a-mini-library-inside-his-salon-in-thoothukudi-that-boasts-of-a-collection-of-900-books-in-tamil-and-english/article30656866.ece

292,2020/01/26,EWS cut-off marks in Civils likely to be lower,"The newly-introduced Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota may prove to be a boon for the poorer sections from the upper castes in the Civil Services examinations this year as their cut-off marks are likely to be lower than the General and OBC categories.

The assumption is based on the statistics of other recruitment examinations conducted at the national level in 2019 and that is the indication even in Civil Services where the EWS candidates will have some advantage in the final selections.

Trainers who have studied the statistics say that in the Combined Medical service examination 2019, the minimum qualifying mark out of 400 for General category was 224 , OBC (183), SC (192), ST (159) while it was 126 for EWS. Similarly, in the same examination, the cut-off marks at the final stage out of 600 were 306 for the General category and it was 268 for OBC, 271 for SC, 225 for ST and 220 for EWS.

The ONGC GATE marks also indicate the same trend where the cut-off marks for EWS was 396, far lower than the 557 marks for the unreserved category and 433 for the OBC category. The cut-off marks for the SBI clerical grade exam released for Tamil Nadu for EWS were 28.5 as against the cut off for General (61.25) SC (61.25), ST (53.75) and OBC (61.25), according to sources.

If the same trends are considered for Civil Services examination too, the cut-off for EWS is likely to be lesser that General and OBC categories. However, marks and cut-offs are dynamic in nature in selections and none can predict them that easily, agree the same trainers.

“The Civil Services examination has become highly competitive and unpredictable in the recent past and at an average any aspirant needs two to three years of focussed hard work to succeed. Though meritorious, an aspirant belonging to the EWS would find it very difficult to sustain his preparation for a long period due to financial constraints and the compulsion to work. The quota for EWS may give them some hope,” feels Gopalakrishna, director of Brain Tree.

About 18 vacancies in IAS, 15 vacancies in IPS, and nine vacancies in the Revenue services, are expected to be reserved for the EWS in 2019.

Would this trend continue in future? “Being the first year, it appears many candidates have not availed the reservation due to absence of information. The low cut-offs are expected only this year and from next year, they are expected to rise sharply as more and more eligible candidates will try their luck in the quota, argues another Civil Services trainer.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ews-cut-off-marks-in-civils-likely-to-be-lower/article30660013.ece

On Saturday, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan had urged people who had travelled to China after January 1, 2020, to report at the nearest health facility if they had fever, cough and respiratory distress. A 24x7 helpline (+91-11-23978046) was made operational for any clinical queries.

On his return to Hyderabad a few days ago, a youngster, who is pursuing MBBS at a medical college in Wuhan, China, was suspected to be having nCoV. However, his samples tested negative and he was discharged on Saturday morning.

Meanwhile, people who flew in from Hong Kong continued to be screened at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, using thermal scanners and thermal guns. However, no one showed symptoms of nCoV.

Meeting

On Monday, Telangana Health department officials would participate in a video-conference with Preeti Sudan, Secretary to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to discuss the preparedness for and steps taken against nCoV. Besides, a multidisciplinary central team would reach Hyderabad to review steps taken for management and control of the virus.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fever-hospital-sends-threes-samples-for-ncov-test/article30659959.ece

According to Mr. Kaseem’s advocate A. Bapu Rao, the case came up for hearing on Friday and the order was pronounced.

“A magistrate shall not grant remand to police custody unless he is satisfied that there is good ground for doing so and shall not accept a general statement made by the investigating or other police officer to the effect that the accused may be able to give further information. Hence, for all the reasons as discussed above, this court is of the opinion that the petition for police custody of respondent/A2 can not be granted,” read the order.

The Additional Junior Civil Judge, Gajwel also observed that there was a huge delay in the arrest of the respondent/A2, which is around four years.

295,2020/01/26,"Analyse candidates before choosing NOTA, young voters told","In a hall packed with first-time and young voters, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan appealed to analyse candidates contesting elections before choosing NOTA.

At the 10th National Voters Day celebrations at Ravindra Bharathi, Saifabad, on Saturday, she spoke about NOTA and the responsibility of casting votes, apart from presenting awards.

“I appreciate the provision of NOTA. However, there is a practice among youngsters — they don’t analyse, and choose NOTA. Analyse whoever the candidates may be. Check whether they fit your expectations, and if they will serve your constituency. If no one fits your expectations, please go for NOTA. Because of NOTA, I am afraid, nobody is analysing candidates,” said Ms. Soundararajan.

She urged the youngsters to exercise their franchise and encourage their family members and friends to do the same while stressing that the National Voters Day has to be marked as a celebration of democracy.

Chief Electoral Officer Rajat Kumar said the National Voters’ Day is celebrated to mark the day Election Commission of India was formed in 1950. He spoke about the initiatives taken over the past two years, such as taking measures to enrol people with disabilities as voters and providing facilities to them to participate in the voting process.

The Governor, along with Mr. Kumar, presented awards to first-time voters, police officials and others. State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy was present on the occasion.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/analyse-candidates-before-choosing-nota-young-voters-told/article30654923.ece
296,2020/01/26,‘Students going abroad should keep the Indian flag flying high’,"Appreciating The Hindu’s commitment to education, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said the newspaper created an opportunity to read and now it was providing the opportunity to learn.

Inaugurating The Hindu International Education Fair at Taj Vivanta here on Saturday, she called upon the students to explore the world and grab the opportunities using the professional guidance extended.

The Governor said she rescheduled her day’s meetings after The Hindu approached her to inaugurate the education fair, given her respect for the newspaper and also her desire to interact with students.

Recalling her own experiences as a medical student in Canada 25 years ago, she explained how her stay changed her outlook towards her profession, learning new things and implementing the same once she was back home. She cited how she picked up a few initiatives like placing toys in the paediatrics department to keep tiny tots smiling rather than frightened.

‘Ample opportunities’

Stating that the ‘foreign-returned’ tag is a pride in India, she said there are ample opportunities for students going abroad in terms of guidance and financial support — banks give study loans while the Central and State governments also extend financial aid. Students should make use of such opportunities and be successful.

Ms. Soundarajan reminded students to be ambassadors of India in the foreign countries that they visit for education or to reside. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created a new image for India on foreign soil, she said, adding that students going abroad should keep the Indian flag flying high.

She had everyone in splits when she recalled how a child she interacted with at an airport was inspired to become a Governor. The school girl was not willing to believe that Ms. Soundarajan was a Governor as ‘generally old men occupy the post’. After being informed that she was the youngest in the country to hold the position, the kid clicked a photo with her and declared her intention to become a Governor in future.

Ms. Soundarajan was presented with a framed picture of the Page 1 of The Hindu on the day she was born — June 2, 1961. Thrilled, she said it was great to read the paper of the day that she was born.

The Governor’s spontaneity was evident when she related to similarities between her and Telangana. Her birthday falls on June 2, the day Telangana was formed. Also, like Telangana, which is the youngest State in India, she is also the youngest Governor in the country. Often, she is referred to as TS (Tamilisai Soundarajan), which is also the acronym of Telangana State.

297,2020/01/26,Experts advise against engaging agents for visa paperwork,"Over 1,000 students harbouring dreams of higher education overseas turned up for The Hindu International Education Fair 2020 where they got an opportunity to interact with experts on education, consular officers and diplomats from various countries. The experts shared dos and don’ts of documentation with key takeaways being planning in advance, and ‘honesty’ in submitting documents.

Andrew Fleming, British Deputy High Commissioner to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, encouraged students to file applications on their own and not engage visa agents who “complicate things”. He said applicants often tend to pay agents a lot of money for something they can do themselves. “You have to be honest with yourself. Do I have everything here? If not, my advice is to defer for a year; make sure you have everything before you apply,” he said.

Touching upon how counterfeit documents can lead to applicants being barred from the UK, he said, “If you produce an incorrect document, and when I say ‘incorrect’, I don’t mean a mistake on your part, or that you have put the wrong piece of paper in. I mean something which is actually forged or counterfeit. In that case, you are going to face a 10-year ban from travel to the UK. Often these problems arise not from the individual; they arise also because of agents who do extra things.”

Describing the UK as a world leader in education, Mr Fleming said universities there are renowned for their quality, diversity and impact. He added that the visa issue rate for Indian students is 96%.

Responding to a question about the new graduation immigration route, Mr Fleming said, “The rules for graduation route will apply to anybody who goes to the UK starting this September. The details haven’t been published. It will come out. It does require that you will apply for a further permission to stay in the UK. It is not like you will get a visa for five years, and not three. You have to apply separately after you graduate.”

Ari Katz, Vice Consul, US Consulate General in Hyderabad, said education in the USA can be expensive and that applicants should factor in tuition cost, living and travel expenses. He said that students must prepare for the interview by being ‘genuine’ and honest, and discouraged them from taking the route of rehearsed speeches.

Taking questions from a participant on what applicants should do if they change plans and want to work after finishing a course, Mr Katz said applicants should have concrete plans and need to speak ‘convincingly’ about them. “You need to have plans beyond working in the US,” he added.

Responding to a question on nervousness of applicants during interviews, Mr Katz advised students to be ‘prepared in a genuine way’ and plan. He discouraged them from using scripted speeches. Mr Katz also said that visa interviews are short, and clarified that a visa allows applicants to arrive at a port of entry but it is the Department of Homeland Security which determines the length of stay.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/auz98m/article30654896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25-EDU-FAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/experts-advise-against-engaging-agents-for-visa-paperwork/article30654897.ece

That was the dilemma for thousands of visitors at the Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF) as multiple sessions unfolded at the same time on the second day. There was Bahar Dutt speaking about her new book India’s Experiments in Saving Nature, Paromita Vohra talking about dating, sexting and modern love, Harini Nagendra sharing her views on trees and human interaction, and Arun Mohan sharing his story about the ghost solar cooker from the 1950s.

Spread through the day with workshops, story-telling sessions, book launches and conversations, the HLF was a packed affair.

“India is urbanising but not at a rapid pace. Bihar and Kerala have the highest migration rates but they are at two different ends of spectrum. There are districts in Maharashtra and Bihar where the sex ratio of men and women is loaded in favour of women,” said Chinmay Tumbe, talking about his findings in his book, India Moving: A history of migration.

“If children don’t climb trees how will they love trees? People should see seeds grow into plants and a bonding will develop,” said Harini Nagendra, author of Cities and Canopies, as author-illustrator Nirupa Rao spoke about how children can now identify 10 brands of cars but would be hard-pressed to name 10 plant species.

A Syndicate meeting of the varsity held here on Saturday did not discuss the issue though action was expected to be taken against those involved in the incidents based on a report submitted by a three-member committee of faculty members.

Vice Chancellor K.N. Madhusoodanan said the issue was not discussed at the meeting as the committee had sought time till January 29 to complete its inquiry. A press release issued by the varsity a day after the incident had said that action would be taken against those involved in the incidents within two days.

Aasil Abubacker, 21, a final year student of B.Tech instrumentation programme, was allegedly attacked by Rahul Peralam, a student of M.Tech fire and safety course, and Prajith K. Babu, who is pursuing the B.Vocational programme.

In his complaint, Aasil had alleged that the duo’s car had rammed his motorbike, and that he was hit on the head with iron rods later. The incident followed differences that cropped up among hostel inmates after the annual fest.

Rahul and Prajith are unit president and secretary respectively of the SFI. The Kalamassery police had registered a case against the accused under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code for attempt to commit culpable homicide. They are yet to be taken into custody. Prajith had figured among the three SFI members, who were arrested by the Central Police in connection with the controversial chair burning case at Maharaja’s College on January 18, 2017.

307,2020/01/26,Government okays lease model for waste-to-energy facility,"The Government has issued an order converting the concessional agreement signed between the Kochi Corporation and GJ Eco Power Private Ltd., the company entrusted with the construction of the waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram, into a lease agreement.

The order issued by T.K. Jose, Additional Chief Secretary, and dated January 16, stated that the Government had annulled a decision taken by the Kochi Corporation council not to convert the pact into a lease agreement as per Section 57 (d) of the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994.

The corporation has been asked to implement the decision taken by the State Level Advisory Committee (SLAC) chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose to convert the concessional agreement into a lease agreement.

The civic body had signed the concessional agreement to set up the plant in 20 acres near the now defunct solid waste management plant at Brahmapuram in 2016. The company had submitted a letter requesting that the pact should be converted into a lease agreement as banks would not provide loans for the project if it was not categorised as a lease agreement.

However, a meeting of the corporation council held on December 22, 2018 deferred it and suggested that the proposal be placed before it with the consent of the health standing committee.

A meeting of the committee held on March 25 last year decided not to consider the proposal by the SLAC. The council meeting held on April 29 ratified the decision taken by the committee and reported it to the Government.

Violation

The Government examined the council decision and quoted Section 57 (d) of the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994, which stated that the Government could annul/amend the council resolution once it was found that its guidelines on plans, schemes, programmes, and conditions of grants were violated by local bodies.

The order said the Government had taken a policy decision to approve the project submitted by GJ Nature Care consortium to set up a waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram. The council decision has been cancelled as part of implementing the Government policy on municipal solid waste processing, it added.

Meanwhile, representatives of GJ Eco Power Ltd. said they were ready to receive municipal solid waste for the energy plant from February next year. “The process of bio-drying of waste after sorting recyclable items and treating them for obtaining refused derived fuel will be carried out till August. We expect to start power production by September,” they added. The Kerala State Electricity Board has agreed to purchase power generated by the 9.76-MW plant at the rate of ₹6.17 per unit for a period of 20 years from the commercial operation date.

According to the agreement, the Kochi Corporation will provide 300 metric tonnes of waste, including biodegradable and non bio-degradable waste, on a daily basis to the company.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/81ui0a/article30655460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvki-wasterevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/government-okays-lease-model-for-waste-to-energy-facility/article30655461.ece

The chain, initially disorganised, from Golpark in the south Kolkata to Shyambazar in the north, finally came together to form one long and continuous line, with many joining at various points in the city.

Dilip Roychowdhury, retired school teacher, in Shyambazar regretted that he could not get his son or grandchild leave the television set to join the rally.

“This rally is important. We are not against identifying legal and illegal citizens but that cannot be done by attacking a social structure that evolved over hundreds of years,” said the former History teacher.

Many, however, could be seen moving away from the main human chain to join the two-week sit-in at the Park Circus, described often as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh.

Many could also be seen eating and distributing chire (flattened rice) as a mark of protest against BJP’s Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya’s recent comment.

On January 23, Mr. Vijayvargiya said he suspected that there were some Bangladeshis among the construction labourers who had been working at his house after he had found them eating poha (flattened rice that is called chire in Bengal). On behalf of what is a described as “a Bangla nationalist” organisation, a group assembled about 50 people in Shyambazar who ate and distributed flattened rice.

“If for having chire we can be identified as Bangladeshi, then we all are from Bangladesh,” said Pranojit Dey of the organisation, Bangla Jatiyatabadi Sangathan.

“Let them throw us out. I have filed an RTI against all major State and national [BJP] leaders a few days back, seeking proof of their citizenship. Let them first furnish their papers before harassing us,” Mr. Dey said. The organisation members later joined the human chain at Shyambazar.

Both Hindu and Muslim community members could be seen tying Rakhi, as a mark of friendship. The day did not pass without minor scuffles between the supporters of the TMC and the BJP.

Ramakrishnan on January 26 said the country was going through a peculiar situation where its citizens were not even allowed to enjoy their legitimate rights due to the attempts of a few who wanted to take the country back to a primitive state.

Addressing the 71st Republic Day celebration at the Kozhikode beach, after hoisting the tricolour, Mr. Ramakrishnan urged citizens to be cautious against divisive forces trying to stoke communal sentiments. “Those who are entrusted with safeguarding constitutional values should not use it as a tool for implementing their defective policies,” he reminded.

“It is our duty to stay united against the attempts to weaken our constitutional rights. Though Kerala stands 23rd in India with respect to geographical area, we come first in endeavours of safeguarding our democracy, secularism and unity. That was the reason the Kerala legislature could even pass a resolution when it noticed an anti-constitutional move,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. He maintained that the State would continue its fight for protecting fundamental rights.

While lauding the huge participation of students and youth in the country’s fight against emerging religious discrimination and violation of constitutional rights, Mr. Ramakrishnan said it reflected their longing for a united country without any discrimination. “The divisive forces are trying to erase even the martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi from India’s soil, which should be attended to very cautiously.”

Holding the Union government accountable for weakening the Indian federal system, Mr. Ramakrishnan said there were attempts at treating Kerala with enmity. “The move to choke the financial lifeline of Kerala is in direct violation of the Indian federal system and Constitution. Those responsible for it should rectify it immediately and protect the rights of the State,” he said.

The Republic Day celebration which was hosted at the Kozhikode beach drew the crowd with various cultural events.

310,2020/01/26,KPCC revamp: Kozhikode gets prominence,"The Congress leadership in north Kerala, especially Kozhikode district, has something to cheer following the reconstitution of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC).

The elevation of District Congress Committee (DCC) president T. Siddique to the post of vice president and secretaries P.M. Niyas and K. Praveen Kumar to the post of general secretaries showed that the high command has placed its bet on this young team to revive the party in Kozhikode.

They have been chosen not only for owing allegiance to either of the groups led by Ramesh Chennithala, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, or former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, but also for their work during the Lok Sabha elections last year. It is also for the first time that a district leader has been selected to be the post of vice president.

Earlier, Mr. Siddique, who had relinquished his candidature for former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to contest from the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, was nominated as one of the six working presidents.

This was also after considering his performance of putting the beleaguered party back on the track after a long time.

Despite lobbying from the ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups, the post of working president has been completely rejected.

Also, the AICC has retained one of its general secretaries, N. Subramanian, and removed another, P.M. Suresh Babu, for different reasons. Currently, Mr. Niyas and Mr. Babu are councillors of the Kozhikode Corporation.

North Kerala also gets another vice president, K.C. Rosakutty from Wayanad district while K. Sudhakaran ( Kannur), V.A. Kareem (Malappuram) C.P. Muhammed, and C. Chandran (Palakkad) have been appointed general secretaries.

However, Kasaragod district has not got its due in the KPCC list. Possibly, the leaders believe that it would be given preference when all the office-bearers including secretaries and executive committee members are finalised by February 10.

However, the Congress high command will face another problem of choosing the right candidate to helm the Kozhikode DCC following Mr. Siddique’s appointment as vice president.

The new DCC president has a bigger role to galvanise the rank and file of the party for the coming three-tier local body polls this year.

Incidentally, the Congress has not had any representation from Kozhikode district in the State Assembly since 2006. Now, several names - K.M. Ummer, U. Rajeevan and V.M. Chandran - are doing the rounds for the DCC president’s post.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kpcc-revamp-kozhikode-gets-prominence/article30655426.ece

Chithra was not allowed to hoist the national flag at a Panchayat Union Elementary School at M. Paraipatti near Usilampatti in Madurai district on the occasion of Republic Day on Sunday.

Three supporters of Ms. Chithra were injured in a scuffle following a quarrel with panchayat ward member M. Manimaran, who had objected to the panchayat president hoisting the Tricolour at the school, saying she was an “outsider” from Rajakkapatti.

The police said that Mr. Manimaran, who is the ward 4 member, was annoyed as he was not invited for the Republic Day celebrations in the school. After a quarrel among the two groups, Ms. Chithra left the scene without hoisting the flag. The School Headmaster then unfurled the flag.

Later, Mr. Manimaran’s supporters reportedly assaulted A. Periyakaruppan, 55, C. Petchiammal, 30, and A. Asai Prabhu, 25. All the three have been admitted to the Government Hospital in Usilampatti. The Elumalai police are investigating.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/panchayat-president-not-allowed-to-hoist-national-flag-at-school-near-usilampatti/article30657208.ece

329,2020/01/26,Udupi CMC decides to build multistoried parking complex,"With the density of two-wheelers and four-wheelers increasing in the city and the sides of major streets being used for parking affecting traffic, the Udupi City Municipal Council (CMC) has decided to construct a multistoried parking complex here.

The problem of parking is quite acute at City Bus Stand, Service Bus Stand, KSRTC Bus Stand, and Kavi Muddanna Road areas. So much so that even areas marked for parking by the side of widened roads are full. This has led to haphazard parking in many places.

To deal with this, the Udupi CMC has written to the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department, Mysuru Division, to check the stability of the one storey building belonging to the CMC where the KSRTC bus stand is located here. The CMC had constructed this building on 61 cents of land in the heart of the city about 15 years ago. It houses the bus stand and some shops on the ground floor and more shops on the first floor. The bus stand will shortly be moved to its own new building at Bannanje here.

The CMC wants to construct the new multistoried parking complex on this 61 cents of land. The existing building would have to be demolished and a new building would have to be constructed. “The shops will be accommodated on the ground floor of the proposed new multistoried parking complex. We hope to make provisions for the parking of about 300 vehicles – both two and four wheelers. This construction of the new complex may cost about ₹40 crore,” Anand Kallolikar, municipal commissioner, told The Hindu.

The Chief Engineer, PWD, is expected to come here in about a fortnight. After getting the stability certificate of the existing building, the municipality will go ahead with the next phase of plan. The multistoried parking complex is expected to solve not just the parking problem but also facilitate smooth movement of vehicles in the area.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/wcgfpv/article30655086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MNUDUPIPARKING1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/udupi-cmc-decides-to-build-multistoried-parking-complex/article30655087.ece
330,2020/01/26,Diversifying risk with Fund of Funds,"What is a Fund of Funds?

Just like a mutual fund (MF) scheme invests in shares of listed companies, a Fund of Funds (FoF) is a scheme that invests in units of other MF schemes.

Simply put, FoF is an MF scheme but one that does not invest directly in stocks or securities but in other MF schemes. In India, only a few fund houses offer FoF schemes that allow the investor to diversify the risk across schemes or fund managers through a single fund. Some fund houses that have FoF schemes in India are Quantum Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton, among others.

What are the advantages of investing in an FoF?

The biggest advantage is, it gives the investor an opportunity to invest in different schemes managed by different fund managers. At times, this approach may work better since different fund managers might have have different expertise in terms of investing in large-caps, small-caps or mid-caps. With a single FoF, the investor will be able to benefit from the diverse investment approach. While most MF houses invest in their own schemes through an FoF, there are some that also invest in other fund houses’ schemes thereby offering more diversity. For instance, the FoF scheme of Quantum Mutual Fund invests in schemes managed by Kotak MF, ICICI Prudential MF and Aditya Birla Sun Life MF.

How are gains from FoF investments taxed?

For tax purposes, FoF is treated as a non-equity fund even though most FoF schemes invest in equity-oriented funds.

As a result, gains arising out of FoF investments do not get the benefits that an equity scheme gains derive. For instance, in equity schemes, if the units are held for more than 12 months, then no short-term gains tax is applicable.

But, in debt and debt-oriented funds, the units have to be held for over 36 months to avoid short-term gains tax. Incidentally, in its pre-Budget memorandum, AMFI suggested that the definition of ‘equity oriented funds’ (EOF) be revised to include FoF investments as well, which would lead to such investments getting the same tax benefits that an equity or an equity-oriented scheme enjoys.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/lj596t/article26160526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUPEE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/diversifying-risk-with-fof/article30654207.ece
331,2020/01/26,Endowed with benefits,"We are going to look at a policy with a defined term and with a maturity or survival benefit: an endowment policy.

The ‘bonus’ is that it offers a bonus as well, a sharing of the investment profit of the policy premium by your insurance company. The bonus is for those who opt for a with-profit policy and has its own terms and conditions.

Though it was not always popularised with this name, the endowment policy is the most commonly known life insurance policy in India.

We are all familiar with policies pitched as financial plans targeting a specific life event or goal, like funding a child’s wedding or higher education. Those would usually be endowment policies.

The policy maturity is timed for this event and the maturity value, sum assured (SA) plus bonus, if any, will be available right in time for it. This is in addition to the basic value that, should the policyholder die before the maturity date, the SA and accrued bonuses, if any, will be paid as the death claim. While this SA is guaranteed, the bonus or its quantum, you should note, are not.

Past-year bonuses can be a guide but no guarantee. A typical scenario would look like this. A 28-year-old man would like his new born son or daughter to have an assured cushion of funding for higher studies when passing out of higher secondary or Class 12. His target would be an endowment for 17 years with a sum assured of, let us say, ₹10 lakh.

Policy premium

The premium for the policy depends on three factors. The age of the life assured, the term of the endowment and the SA. With various companies, it is around ₹55,000 to ₹60,000 a year. The health status of the proposer is also an important factor. An endowment policy has various features. The core is insurance against the risk of death, the second is a survival or maturity benefit and a third feature is investment returns, or the savings part of the policy.

The term policy has only the first function. So, the endowment policy premium is higher than a comparable term policy premium to pay for the added benefits.

While considering the asset creation function of an investment, life insurance policies have a great advantage over regular savings like deposits and so on. The entire asset gets created the moment the policy starts, thus protecting against the greatest downside of dying too soon. The caveat is, the policy has to be kept in force by paying the premiums on schedule or the advantage will be lost. Added benefits of taking this route for savings and asset creation is that the premium has a tax benefit and the policy proceeds are tax-free, both when it is a maturity claim or a death claim, a considerable advantage indeed. Popular policies are HDFC Life Endowment Assurance Policy, LIC New Endowment Policy and SBI Life Smart Bachat.

As with many life policies, you can opt for various riders right at the beginning such as accidental death rider, critical illness cover, disability rider or the waiver of premium rider.

Many buy a life insurance policy looking at it in isolation. A better way is to see and compare the range of policies available and pick the best suited to your situation and needs.

In this process of familiarising you with various types of policies we will look at unit-linked insurance policies in the next instalment of Cover Note.

332,2020/01/26,The price you pay for faulty anchoring,"In his bestselling book on behavioural psychology — Thinking, fast and slow — Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman explains the ‘anchoring effect’ through an experiment he once conducted using a wheel of fortune.

Mr. Kahneman rigged the wheel which was marked from 0 to 100 so that it would stop only at 10 or 65. He asked participants to spin the wheel and then asked them to note down the number where the wheel stopped, which was, of course, either 10 or 65. He then asked them two totally unrelated questions — is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger or smaller than the number you just noted down?

The second question was — what is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN?

The spin of a wheel of fortune cannot possibly yield any useful information on the two questions listed above and the participants ought to have ignored the wheel. Yet, their responses on the estimate were 25% and 45%.

This is called ‘anchoring effect’ where people refer to an initial clue or one piece of information (10 or 65 as above) to arrive at value, even though it may result in an error in judgment. Mr. Kahneman described it thus — it occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity.

This bias is very prevalent in our day-to-day interaction like in shopping at roadside shops where we bargain. We typically start the bargaining from the price which the vendor quoted irrespective of whether it is right or wrong.

You can see the same effect in discount sales as well, where we end up either buying lot of stuff or stuff which we don’t actually need. We get anchored to the list price and the steep discount as a cue for making the decision to buy. Much of the value that the customer perceives is based on anchoring of discount price rather than estimating actual value of the goods to take an informed decision.

This anchoring bias is prevalent in investing too. One of the basic traits of good investing is to buy stocks, bonds or any asset at a cheaper than intrinsic value.

Investors often take this message very seriously and display their behaviour very consistently on the wrong side. They end up taking the wrong initial clue, which is stock price or asset price, as the value instead of looking at fundamental data like earnings, book value or cash per share.

Consider this example from the real world:

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. (DHFL) share were priced at ₹590 each in January 2018 — retail shareholders held 8.4% of the firm’s equity. During the course of the year, business fundamentals deteriorated , resulting in a sharp drop in price from ₹590 to around ₹300 — a 50% fall from the previous peak.

Instead of taking stock of the new reality, investors rushed to buy more of the stock misled by the 50% fall from peak price — after all, isn’t buying stock cheaper a great idea? And so, the retail shareholding doubled from 8% to 16%. Investors probably felt the worst was over.

But the stock continued to fall. In the next three months ending (April 2019) the stock fell from ₹300 to ₹150, another 50% fall from recent peak and 70% drop from all-time high.

Though both the peak prices are irrelevant data for assessing the current investment value, investors were misled and bought more shares taking the share of total retail investment in the stock to 21%. But the stock fell even more... to ₹30 in the next six months. The market price of ₹30 represented a fall of 80% from recent six-month high, or 90% from a 12-month high or 95% from the all-time high. Thanks to their sustained buying, the share of retail investors in DHFL jumped to 32% in the same period.

Losing wealth

Retail investors had lost huge wealth, time and energy by wrongly anchoring the previous high price and continuously buying the stock which was rapidly losing value.

They failed to appreciate that any decision to buy a stock should be based on the intrinsic value of the company and that the previously traded price is a completely irrelevant data point in the decision-making process. They were misled because they “anchored” their expectations to an irrelevant number.

Similar anchoring bias is also displayed during the selling of a stock. Investors are often reluctant to sell a stock which is below their purchase price (wrong anchor) and willing to wait endlessly rather than assessing the current intrinsic value of the stock to make the right decision.

How to reduce or avoid the effect of wrong anchoring bias in decision making?

1. Decisions to invest in or divest from a stock should be based on valuation of the stock using parameters such as EPS, cash flow per share, book value etc. rather than on the price.

2. The ‘previous high’ price is an irrelevant data point for considering today’s purchase or sell decision. The current price is the new reality and the investor should consider all the relevant information to take appropriate action.

3. Investors have also lost opportunities by not buying stocks where business is flourishing which is reflected in a high stock price stating the price has already moved from, for example, from ₹100 to ₹150.

The question that investors should ask is: is the price of ₹150 still attractive to make a required rate of return. If the value is still there, then it makes sense to invest and not be bothered about the lowest price point, which, in this case is ₹100.

4. Finally, avoid herd behaviour like the black sheep in the flock. Knowing the risk — the sheep started moving in the opposite direction to survive.
