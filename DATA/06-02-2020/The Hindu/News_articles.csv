0,2020/02/06,Bengaluru Raptors storm into semifiinals,"The brilliance of Brice Leverdez and captain B. Sai Praneeth helped defending champion Bengaluru Raptors outplay Awadhe Warriors 5-0 And enter the semifinal of the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Thursday.

Warriors got off to a perfect start with the men’s combine of Ko Sung Hyun and Shin Baek Cheol scoring an impressive win over Arun George and Rian Agung Saputro.

Raptors’ World No. 39 Brice Leverdez cruised past World No. 64 Ajay Jayaram in the Trump match for the latter. The former overcame a hesitant start — he looked rattled by Jayaram’s deceptive shots at the net — to score six points in a row in the first game and wrap it up in quick time.

In the second, Leverdez was more aggressive as he took a comfortable 8-2 lead only to see Jayaram fight back with a solid net game. However, the Raptors shuttler shifted gears and came up with telling smashes to win five straight points and seal the contest.

Tai Tzu on song

World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying outslugged a defiant World No. 14 Beiwen Zhang in women’s singles, warding off a spirited comeback by the latter midway through the second game.

Tai swung the match in her favour whenever her opponent gained ground with impeccable drop shots.

With a 2-0 cushion, World No. 11 B. Sai Praneeth, playing the Trump match for Raptors, warded off a spirited challenge from World No. 41 Wong Wing Ki Vincent and gave his team an unbeatable 4-0 lead.

Sai Praneeth’s ability to get his smashes right whenever he was under pressure proved decisive in the final analysis.

Raptors joined North-Eastern Warriors, Chennai Superstarz and Pune 7 Aces in the semifinals.

The results: Bengaluru Raptors bt Awadhe Warriors 5-0 (Arun George & Rian Agung Saputro lost to Ko Sung Hyun & Shin Beak Cheol 15-14, 7-15, 11-15; Brice Leverdez bt Ajay Jayaram (T) 15-9, 15-9; Tai Tzu Ying bt Beiwen Zhang 15-12, 15-12; B.

1,2020/02/06,Sharath tames Sathiyan and Harmeet as Indian Oil clinches title,"For years, the best team final in the country’s table tennis has been witnessed in the Petroleum inter-unit tournament, and not the National championship.

This is bound to happen since the Petroleum sector uses the services of every member of the National team. The resultant clash involves those forming the creamy layer of Indian table tennis in both sections.

In the men’s team final that lived up to expectations, Indian Oil’s Sharath Kamal and Manav Thakkar joined hands to end the unbeaten run of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation since 2015 with a 3-2 win at the Thyagaraj Sports Complex here on Thursday.

Blistering form

Riding on Sharath’s blistering form, Indian Oil twice levelled the match with the nine-time National champion beating World No. 30 G. Sathiyan and the newly-crowned National champion Harmeet Desai..

ONGC, which had taken the lead when Desai scored over Thakkar in the repeat result of the recent National final, and again when former National champion A. Amalraj beat Sudhanshu Grover, now looked at Sathiyan to pull off the deciding singles.

Thakkar, who stunned Sathiyan in the National semifinals at Hyderabad on Sunday, started slowly and conceded the opening set. In the next two, Thakkar came back strongly with some well-measured backhand placements to repeatedly fox Sathiyan.

In the fourth and fifth sets, Sathiyan opened up 4-0 leads but with contrasting outcomes. Though he managed to win the fourth to force the decider, he could not prevent Thakkar from making it 4-4 and 6-6 before trailing for the first time in the decider.

Though Thakkar squandered a match-point, he regained his composure to win 12-10 and became a member of Indian Oil’s winning team for the first time. The triumph was a kind of revenge for Indian Oil which was upstaged in the women’s team final on Wednesday evening.

Having beaten ONGC in the league stage, Indian Oil did not spare much thought in finalising its combination in the final. The decision to make youngster Diya Chithale play two singles and the National runner-up Krittwika Sinha Roy one backfired.

Manika Batra twice levelled the tie-score by winning her singles but found no support from her Indian Oil teammates. Diya lost the first singles to Ankita Das and Krittiwika surprisingly surrendered to Divya Despande in the third. In the fifth, Pooja Sahasrabudhe overpowered Diya to clinch it for ONGC.

The results: Team championship (finals): Men: Indian Oil bt ONGC 3-2 (Manav Thakkar lost to Harmeet Desai 8-11, 6-11, 7-11; Sharath Kamal bt G. Sathiyan 5-11, 11-9, 11-7, 11-9; Sudhanshu Grover lost to A. Amalraj 5-11, 5-11, 8-11; Sharath bt Desai 9-11, 11-6, 11-3, 10-12, 11-4; Thakkar bt Sathiyan 9-11, 11-7, 11-7, 4-11, 12-10).

Women: ONGC bt Indian Oil 3-2 (Ankita Das bt Diya Chithale 11-7, 11-8, 11-3; Pooja Sahasrabudhe lost to Manika Batra 11-13, 9-11, 8-11; Divya Deshpande bt Krittwika Sinha Roy 8-11, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8; Ankita lost to Manika 7-11, 8-11, 12-10, 7-11; Pooja bt Diya 11-5, 11-9, 11-13, 11-9).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/zaoro9/article30754956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07ONGC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sharath-tames-sathiyan-and-harmeet-as-indian-oil-clinches-title/article30754957.ece
2,2020/02/06,Pardeep Singh wins men’s 102kg gold at national weightlifting tournament,"Pardeep Singh bettered his snatch record with an effort of 151kg and went on to win the men’s 102kg gold medal in the National weightlifting championships at the Khudiram Anusilan Kendra here on Thursday.

Pardeep, who had 150kg and 201kg in snatch and clean and jerk for a total of 351kg in the Asian championships in Ningbo (China) last year, improved his own snatch record by one kg.

He began the clean and jerk with 185 and lifted 195 on his second attempt. With an aim to improve his clean and jerk and total records, the Railways lifter, who had settled for a bronze with 321kg in the previous Nationals, entered 203 in his concluding effort but could not achieve the target.

Vikas shines

Vikas Thakur, another prominent lifter, totalled 346kg, including 154 in snatch and 192 in clean and jerk. This was three kilos below his performance in the Asian championships last year, but won him the 96kg crown comfortably. The Services lifter had 152 and 197 in the two segments to finish fourth in the continental event.

“Both Pardeep and Vikas are peaking nicely for the Asian championships in Kazakhstan in April.

“They are at about 90 per cent of their ability and we expect some good results from them this time,” said National coach Vijay Sharma.

Sharsti ‘snatch’es gold

Sharsti Singh rode on her superior snatch to aggregate 205kg for the women’s 81kg title. The 10kg lead in snatch proved decisive for her as she did an identical 112kg in clean and jerk with the second-placed Baljinder Kaur.

The results: Men: 96kg: 1. Vikas Thakur (SSCB) (snatch 154, clean and jerk 192, total 346); 2. Jagdish Vishwakarma (Cht) (147, 180, 327); 3. Suresh Yadav (Odi) (140, 170, 310).

3,2020/02/06,Will try to win medals in CWG and Asiad: Sanjita,"After winning the women’s 49kg silver in the National weightlifting championships here, K. Sanjita Chanu may have stepped on the road to redemption but still wonders what the doping episode, which stole more than a year of her career, has in store for her.

A Commonwealth Games champion in 53kg, Sanjita was handed a provisional suspension by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) in the World championships in the USA in 2017. However, her case courted controversy due to several procedural lapses.

The IWF, which revoked her provisional suspension about a year ago, has been tight-lipped over the case and has not delivered the final decision yet.

“I am sad that they are not giving any final decision. I came here to compete but the thought kept coming that more than one year was wasted. My name and life got spoiled and we don’t know yet the exact reason why it happened. This should not happen to anybody else,” Sanjita told The Hindu.

“After that episode, I thought of quitting. Then I thought, ‘why should I quit like this? I have not taken anything that is banned.’”

Big relief

Two successful lifts, one each in snatch and clean and jerk, amid distinct nervousness helped Sanjita come a distant second with a total of 185kg behind Mirabai Chanu. But it came as a big relief for the 26-year-old from Manipur.

“I was nervous. I was making a comeback after such an episode and everybody was watching me. I had tension and the body got tight because of that. That’s why I dropped most of the lifts.

“After the 2018 Commonwealth Games, I am competing now in a big event. I competed in 53kg in my last Nationals in 2018. Last year, I did not have much time to compete in the National. No one allowed me to train because of the doping story and there was no facility at home. I competed in inter-Railways and slowly got into the training mode.

“Since I struggled to increase my body weight, it would have been difficult to go up to 55kg after the shuffle in weight divisions. That’s why I chose 49kg. I did 88kg and 113kg in the inter-Railways and had hoped to repeat it here.”

Sanjita was hopeful of reviving her career. “I will improve my performance and will try to win medals in the Commonwealth and Asian Games,” said Sanjita.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2vkt8y/article30755372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07CHANU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/will-try-to-win-medals-in-cwg-and-asiad-sanjita/article30752636.ece
4,2020/02/06,Wrestling Federation of India confident about approval for Chinese delegation’s participation in Asian meet,"Even as the world grapples with the Coronavirus and its spread, the Wrestling Federation of India is confident of the government agreeing to allow the Chinese delegation for the upcoming Asian Championships here.

India has stopped e-visa facility for Chinese visitors and there are doubts on their participation due to health concerns since wrestling is a contact sport with a high possibility of infection. “Chinese officials have claimed that the 40-member delegation has been tested and quarantined, and cleared of any infection. Even if they do come, they will have to follow the due process of being tested on arrival,” WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said here on Wednesday.

He added that the federation had already written to the MEA and was confident of getting a positive response for both the Chinese and Pakistan delegations. Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, however, said a final call would be taken by the MEA in consultation with the Health Ministry. “We cannot take any risk, especially in an Olympic year. It is an extraordinary situation and we will act accordingly,” Rijiju said.

The Asian Championships will be held from February 18-23.

Asked about Sushil Kumar’s chances of making it to Tokyo 2020, Brij Bhushan insisted that the federation would not allow a repeat of the 2016 fiasco and controversies that saw India go unrepresented in the 74kg category at Rio.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wrestling-federation-of-india-confident-about-approval-for-chinese-delegations-participation-in-asian-meet/article30746431.ece
5,2020/02/06,Weightlifting | A new record — and gold — for Lapung,"Services lifter Sambo Lapung scripted a new National record of 188kg in clean and jerk on his way to the gold medal in the men’s 89kg in the National weightlifting championships at the Khudiram Anusilan Kendra here on Wednesday.

Lapung, who had secured the silver medal in 81kg last year, hoisted 145kg to take a one kg lead over R.V. Rahul in snatch. Later, he broke the clean and jerk record of 187kg in his final attempt to aggregate 333kg.

Hailing from Arunachal Pradesh, Lapung — a former National champion in 69kg — won a National title after four years. “I switched to 89kg immediately after the last Nationals. I was getting injured for lowering my body weight too much. Am happy to create a new record,” said Lapung.

Railways’ Rahul was second with 323kg, while Ram Karan Prajapati — another Services lifter representing Uttarakhand — got the third place with 314kg.

Below-par show

Despite her below-par performance, local girl Rakhi Halder won the women’s 64kg crown with 210kg.

Rakhi’s effort earned her a comfortable victory as her nearest competitor Harjinder Kaur registered 200kg.

However, the total of 210kg was below her best showing of 218kg, including 95kg in snatch and 123kg in clean and jerk, in the Qatar Cup Olympic qualifying event in December.

The 26-year-old, who lifted 93kg in her final snatch attempt, managed 117kg in her first clean and jerk effort. Gritting her teeth, she tried to raise the bar in her next two attempts — including her bid to do 125kg in the last — but did not get the desired result.

“My sore left thigh prevented a smooth action. I will try to improve and qualify for the Olympics,” said Rakhi, who had totalled 214kg in the World championships in Pattaya in September last.

The results: Men, 81kg: 1. Papul Changmai (SSCB) snatch 145kg, clean and jerk 172kg, total 317kg; 2. Amarjit Guru (RSPB) 137kg, 172kg, 309kg; 3. U. Sivaprakash (Pud) 136kg, 171kg, 307kg. 89kg: 1.

7,2020/02/06,Shooting | Olympic selection trials from Feb. 20,"The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has announced Olympics selection trials in rifle, pistol and shotgun for those shooters who do not have the required number of scores to rate them as per the selection policy.

The trials will be held at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, from February 20 to 25.

Tejaswini Sawant and Yashaswini Singh Deswal are the only two who have won the Olympic quota and would be subject to these trials, which are basically meant for shooters in the periphery.

Former world champion Tejaswini who won the Olympic quota in rifle 3-position event will require to shoot one trial.

As per the policy, the Olympic quota winners would automatically get selected for the World Cup to be staged in Delhi in March.

In the case of Yashaswini, whose name figures in the list, it has been announced that it would suffice if she shoots the World Cup in Delhi, to render the required number of scores for consideration for Olympic selection.

Sheoran, Swapnil in hunt

Akhil Sheoran and Swapnil Kusale will be shooting the trials in men’s rifle 3-position event in which the Olympic quotas were won by Sanjeev Rajput and Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar.

In an event like men’s air pistol, in which Saurabh Chaudhary and Abhishek Verma won two gold medals each in the World Cups last yar, there will be trials for Shahzar Rizvi, Omprakash Mitharval, Arjun Singh Cheema and Ravinder Singh.

Interestingly, even in men’s rapid fire pistol event, in which India has not won an Olympic quota, there will be trials for Gurpreet Singh, Arpit Goel and Bhavesh Shekhawat.

Same is the case in men’s trap in which Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Lakshay Sheoran, Zoravar Singh Sandhu and Vivaan Kapoor have been called for trials.

For the first time in 20 years, the Indian trap team has not won an Olympic quota.

There will be trials for women’s trap and skeet as well, even though there is no quota as yet available.

Options open

Since the National federation has the option of swapping some of the Olympic quota places, it has perhaps tried to keep all its options open by getting everyone ready for the Olympic race.

Except for rare instances, the Olympic quota winners have all been pretty strong in holding on to their supremacy with good performances in their events so far.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/shooting-olympic-selection-trials-from-feb-20/article30746190.ece
8,2020/02/06,PBL | Aces move into last four,"Pune 7 Aces scored a hard-fought 2-1 win over Hyderabad Hunters to take its tally to 20 and qualified for the semifinals of the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday.

Hunters finished their engagements with 11 points and bowed out.

In men’s doubles, Aces’ Chirag Shetty and former World champion Hendra Setiawan combined well to outplay Ben Lane and Sean Vendy.

The 18-year-old Priyanshu, ranked World No. 284 and playing the Trump match for Hunters, lost to the more experienced Mithun Manjunath in a thriller.

In the first game, Manjunath’s better court coverage and telling smashes helped him win 15-11. A more aggressive Priyanshu won the second, predominantly scoring points with down-the-line smashes. In the decider, Manjunath raced away to an 8-2 lead before Priyanshu levelled, clinching the next six points.

With the match tied at 13, Priyanshu returned deep, but saw Mithun unleash two powerful cross-court returns which saw no reply.

“The shuttle was very fast and I was playing my first match in the PBL. It is a very satisfying win in a very tough match,” said a delighted Mithun.

P.V. Sindhu ensured Hunters got their first point when she outclassed the young and inexperienced Rituparna Das.

In mixed doubles, a Trump match for Aces’ Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock, the left-right combine of Vladimir Ivanov and N. Sikki Reddy of Hunters won the battle of big smashes and smart net-play to make it 1-1.

World No. 37 Loh Kean Yew of Pune defeated World No. 28 Sourabh Verma in the final contest to seal it for Aces.

9,2020/02/06,South Korea’s Soonwoo Kwon has the final say against Prajnesh,"The Indian challenge in singles at the Tata Open Maharashtra ended on Thursday following Prajnesh Gunneswaran’s 6-3, 7-6(5) defeat at the hands of the South Korea’s Soonwoo Kwon.

The India No. 1 displayed much attacking verve and constantly took up aggressive court positions. But Kwon, the tournament’s fourth seed, while being resolute in defence, also transitioned seamlessly into attack mode. On the day, he would hit one winner more than Prajnesh (22 to 21) and commit 12 errors fewer (35 to 47).

Trading breaks

The match started capriciously, with the two trading breaks in the first two games. Down a break-point at 2-3, Prajnesh dumped an easy overhead into the net. It was not long before Kwon won the first set 6-3.

“I lost that set pretty much because of that smash,” Prajnesh said later. “I started well. Broke rightaway, but missed too many first serves. I should have held that serve. I was a little bit rusty with my forehands. I missed a lot of cross-courts I used to open up the court.”

Better display

Prajnesh played a much better second set, staying with his opponent for the first eight games. But the World No. 88 upped his level in the ninth, earning mutiple break points.

But Prajnesh proved equal to the task by saving four of them before holding serve with an ace and an expansive forehand winner.

Swinging it his way

The match slipped into a tie-break and there Kwon outshone Prajnesh.

At 3-3, the 22-year-old hit an ace and then when Prajnesh sent a forehand wide, Kwon had the match on his racquet.

The Indian netted a backhand to give Kwon two match points and the South Korean took it on the second, putting away an easy forehand volley.

“I don’t think I played a bad match,” said Prajnesh. “I am not much better than him, but at the same time not much worse. So they were really small margins. But these are the kind of matches I should be winning consistently. Like, three... four matches in a row. I don’t think I am far away but I need to be more consistent.”

Italian shock for Paire

Top seed Benoit Paire turned in an abject performance to crash out in the first round. The World No. 19 lost 6-4, 6-4 to Italian Roberto Marcora, ranked a whopping 155 places below him.

Marcora broke in the fifth game of the first set to take it 6-4. He broke at a similar stage in the second but Paire came back immediately to restore parity. But Marcora broke again to 5-4 and saved two break points to emerge victorious.

The results:

Singles (second round): Soonwoo Kwon (Kor) bt Prajnesh Gunneswaran 6-3, 7-6(5); James Duckworth (Aus) bt Taro Daniel (Jpn) 6-7(4), 7-6(6), 6-3; Egor Gerasimov (Blr) bt Nikola Milojevic (Srb) 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.

11,2020/02/06,"Everyone has to manage their expectations, says ATP executive V-P Alison Lee","In light of the Tata Open Maharashtra not featuring a single top-10 player for the first time since 2003, ATP’s executive vice-president Alison Lee said on Thursday it would have been prudent for the organisers to have pursued players ranked 10 to 40.

Pushed back

With the ATP Cup taking the coveted start-of-the-season slot and Doha 250, with its hefty prize purse, running concurrently, Pune had to push its dates by a month.

“This is not necessarily a bad week,” Lee said on Thursday. “Montpellier and Cordoba this week have very good player fields. They’ve been in those weeks for a long time and know they have to go after players fairly aggressively.

“The tournament director here [Prashant Sutar] acknowledges they didn't know what to really expect. They have seen that they have to go after other top players or rising stars. I think everyone has to manage their expectations,” she said.

“Getting top-10 players is very difficult. You look at Roger [Federer], Rafa [Nadal] and Novak [Djokovic]. How many 250s did they play last year? I’m not saying it would be impossible to get a top-10 player, but I think the focus should be on those from 10 to 40,” she said.

Changes likely

But she acknowledged that while a comprehensive review has been planned for 2023, there could be changes to the calendar before that.

“The 2021 calendar is already published and Pune will be in the same week. But 2022 is not set and I know Doha is very keen to move out of week one.

12,2020/02/06,Davis Cup | Paes named in six-member team for Croatia tie,"The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has announced a six-member team for the Davis Cup World Group qualifier tie against Croatia to be played on indoor hard court in Zagreb on March 6 and 7.

The team will have Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Sumit Nagal and Ramkumar Ramanthan for singles. There will be three doubles players in Rohan Bopanna, Leander Paes and Divij Sharan.

Rohit Rajpal continues as the captain of the team, even though he was originally supposed to be the skipper only for the tie against Pakistan. Zeeshan Ali will be the coach.

“Once the Davis Cup tie was shifted out of Pakistan and played in Kazakhstan, it was decided that Rohit would be the captain of the team for the year 2020,” clarified Akhouri Bishwadeep, CEO, AITA.

The selection committee meeting was held under the chairmanship of Balram Singh on Thursday, and was attended by Rajpal and Ankita Bhambri.

Zeeshan and Nandan Bal were consulted over phone before the team was finalised.

What happened?

When asked about the withdrawal of the press release a few minutes after it was sent by the AITA, the CEO clarified that the person who had sent the release thought that there was a mistake.

“The selection committee had also decided that Anand Dubey and Yash Pandey would be the physios for the team. But, it was brought to the attention of the committee that Anand could be busy with the Fed Cup team, if it was held the same week,” said Bishwadeep.

Even though a six-member team has been announced, only a five-member team has to be intimated to the ITF. One player would travel as a reserve, and the name would be decided in due course.

Clarity needed

“We could have announced the team later, but some of the players whose availability we had sought, wanted clarity as they needed a three-week period to enter tournaments, if they were not selected for Davis Cup duty. Hence, the team has been announced now,” said the CEO.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/jp0hw6/article30754826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07PAES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/davis-cup-paes-named-in-six-member-team-for-croatia-tie/article30754827.ece

14,2020/02/06,Tata Open Maharashtra | Sasikumar’s efforts fall short against Daniel,"Sasikumar Mukund put up a spirited fight but couldn’t stop Taro Daniel from winning 6-2, 7-6(7) and advancing to the second round win of the Tata Open Maharashtra on Wednesday. Sasikumar’s loss now leaves Prajnesh Gunneswaran as the only Indian in the singles main draw.

Against a player ranked more than a hundred places above (263 to 102), the 23-year-old Indian, after having lost the first set tamely, refused to surrender and even earned a set point to take it into the third. But in the end Daniel’s experience and the ability to hit the heavier ball at crunch moments proved the difference.

At the start though, Sasikumar displayed none of the nerves that can accompany someone playing his first tour level match. In the very first game he strung together a forehand winner, an ace, a service winner and a backhand pass on the stretch to hold to love.

But the level didn’t last. The Indian was forced to save four break points to hold to 2-1 before losing serve twice to go 2-5 down. On the Daniel serve at 5-2, Sasikumar had his opponent down at 15-40, but the two-break cushion helped his opponent play without nerves and seal the set.

Continued struggle

Sasikumar’s struggle with his serve continued into the second as he had to wipe out three more breakpoints to hold to 3-2. But unlike in the first set, he tidied his game up and held to 4-3 and then 5-4 for the combined loss of just two points.

The wobbly serve though returned to haunt him at 5-5, with three unforced errors and a double fault handing Daniel a chance to serve for the match. It was just that the Japanese faltered too, with three unforced errors of his own, before a crushing forehand winner by Sasikumar, one of 28 he hit on the day, stretched it to a tie-break.

At 3-3, Sasikumar won back-to-back points, the second courtesy another fine forehand. With a serve still up his sleeve, the second set seemed his to lose. But when presented with an overhead, he decided to take it on the bounce rather than full as he couldn't sight the ball clearly under the lights. The move proved costly as he hit it way out.

Daniel then made it 5-5 with a bullet ace before earning his first match-point when a Sasikumar backhand didn't cross the net. The latter erased it with a fine inside-out and when a defensive lob from Daniel sailed wide he had a set point to take the match to the third. But a fine body serve by Daniel followed by two unforced errors from Sasikumar, including a botched volley, handed Daniel the match.

“The tennis was very disappointing,” Sasikumar said later. “Considering it was the first time, my attitude was great as I hung in there. But the tennis itself wasn't great. I was more aggressive in the second set because out-rallying him was proving tough. Wish I had done that from the start.”

17,2020/02/06,Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders nearly tied,"Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are nearly tied in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, with nearly all results counted in a contest marred by technical issues and reporting delays.

The race remained too early to call early Thursday with 97% of precincts reporting. Party officials were scrambling to verify the remaining results three days after Iowans gathered at caucus sites across the state to begin choosing which Democrat will take on President Donald Trump in November.

A new batch of results released just after midnight narrowed the margin between Mr. Buttigieg, the former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Mr. Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont. Mr. Buttigieg has a lead of three state delegate equivalents out of 2,098 counted.

The nearly complete results show Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders leading Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with former Vice-President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar trailing behind.

Technical problems

But the results in Iowa were muddied by the stunning breakdown of the caucus reporting process in a state that traditionally kicks off presidential nominating contests. Iowa officials initially attributed a delay in reporting results to technical problems with an app that precinct chairs were supposed to use to record votes, then to backlogs as those volunteers tried to call the party to submit their totals. Even as the total number of results ticked up throughout Wednesday, obstacles remained. Some tally sheets were making their way to party headquarters in Des Moines through the mail, which contributed to the delay.

Much of the political world has already shifted its attention to New Hampshire, which holds the first primary in the Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight on Tuesday.

20,2020/02/06,"German state premier quits, calls for poll","The premier of Germany’s Thuringia state stepped down and called for snap elections on Thursday, barely 24 hours after he was elected with the help of far-right AfD in a vote Chancellor Angela Merkel called “unforgivable”.

Thomas Kemmerich, from the liberal Free Democrats, said he would apply for the regional Parliament to be dissolved in response to the outrage over his appointment, which drew comparisons with the rise of Nazis in the 1930s. “We want elections to remove the stain of the AfD’s support from the office of the premiership,” he said.

Mr. Kemmerich’s election on Wednesday marked the first time in German post-war history that a state premier was helped into office by accepting far-right votes, crossing a red line in a nation haunted by its Nazi past.

He became the surprise winner of a run-off vote after AfD lawmakers ditched their own candidate to back him, in what Mr. Kemmerich called “a perfidious trick” by the far right.

Chancellor Merkel called the vote “unforgivable” and said the result “must be reversed”.

She reiterated that her centre-right CDU would never work with the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD, on a regional or national level.

Thousands took to the streets in cities across Germany late Wednesday to vent their dismay at the vote outcome, including in Berlin, Frankfurt and Thuringia’s capital Erfurt.

Some carried signs that read “Never again”, while others recalled that it was in Thuringia in 1930 that a Nazi minister was first allowed into government.

The aftershocks of the crisis were being felt in Berlin too, since Thuringian state lawmakers from Ms. Merkel’s own CDU lined up with the FDP and far right in voting for Mr. Kemmerich over popular incumbent Bodo Ramelow from the far-left Die Linke.

Ms. Merkel’s coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democratic (SPD), reacted furiously to the debacle, calling for her conservative party to clearly distance itself from the AfD if the national government is to survive.

“There can be no carrying on as usual without resolving this problem,” fumed SPD co-leader Norbert Walter-Borjans.

The SPD and CDU are due to hold crisis talks in Berlin on Saturday.

Addressing the controversy during a visit to South Africa, Ms. Merkel called Wednesday’s vote “a bad day for democracy” and said the role played by her local allies “broke with the values and convictions of the CDU”.

Christian Lindner, national leader of the FDP, one of Germany’s smaller parties, said Mr. Kemmerich was right to free himself “from dependency on the AfD”.

But given the political storm, Christian Lindner said it was necessary to reaffirm his own position at an emergency meeting of the party’s leadership in Berlin on Friday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/german-state-premier-quits-calls-for-poll/article30755049.ece
21,2020/02/06,Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?,"The spread of the novel coronavirus in mainland China continues unabated. On February 5, mainland China recorded 3,694 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and 73 deaths, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 28,018 and deaths to 563. This is the second consecutive day when the number of daily new cases rose sharply. On February 4, mainland China recorded 3,887 new confirmed cases and 65 deaths.

The Hubei province alone, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 2,987 new confirmed cases and 70 new deaths on Wednesday. With this, the Hubei province so far has 19,665 confirmed cases and 549 deaths.

Which countries/regions outside mainland China have reported nCoV cases?

As on February 5, 28 countries/regions have reported 243 cases of the virus.

Also Read For Xi, the biggest challenge yet comes laden with risks

With 35 cases, Japan has reported the most number of cases. It is closely followed by Singapore with 28; Thailand 25; Hong Kong 21 cases including one death; South Korea 19; Australia 14; Germany and Malaysia 12 each; Taiwan, and the U.S. 11 each; Macau and Vietnam 10 each; France 6; U.A.E. 5; Canada 4; India 3; Philippines 3 cases including one death, Italy, U.K., and Russia 2 cases each; Nepal, Cambodia, Finland, Sri Lanka, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and Cambodia 1 case each.

How many human-to-human transmissions have been seen outside mainland China so far?

As on February 4, the World Health Organization said 27 cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus had been reported from nine countries outside of China.

The first case of human-to-human transmission outside China was reported from Vietnam. It was followed by Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Germany, Singapore and the U.S.

Also Read WHO busts myths and fake messages on coronavirus

So far, 15 healthcare workers in mainland China have been infected through such transmission. The main route of transmission currently in China is believed to be through human-to-human transmission as the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan city, which is considered as the source of the virus, was shut down on January 1.

Can the virus be transmitted during the incubation period?

China’s National Health Commission Minister had first warned that the virus might be spreading even during the incubation period when symptoms do not show up in a person infected with it. Then on January 30, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published a Correspondence that reported a Chinese woman who had purportedly not shown any signs or symptoms of infection having transmitted the virus to a German during the incubation period.

The NEJM paper was, however, found to be misleading with the journal Science reporting that The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the German government’s public health agency, and the Health and Food Safety Authority of the State of Bavaria having established, based on a conversation with the Chinese woman, that she had indeed had a few of the symptoms while in Germany. According to the Science, she “felt tired, suffered from muscle pain, and took paracetamol, a fever-lowering medication”.

What is WHO’s position on virus transmission during the incubation period?

Also Read Paper claiming novel coronavirus can be transmitted during incubation period ‘flawed’

WHO’s Situation Report posted on February 1 said: “WHO is aware of possible transmission of the novel coronavirus from infected people before they developed symptoms. Detailed exposure histories are being taken to better understand the pre-clinical phase of infection and how transmission may have occurred in these few instances.”

It then stresses that “asymptomatic infection may be rare, and transmission from an asymptomatic person is very rare with other coronaviruses, as we have seen with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission.”

The main driver of nCoV transmission is people who exhibit overt symptoms. Such people will spread the virus more readily through coughing and sneezing, WHO says.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden says on its website that scientific evidence on the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) shows that it “does not infect at all during the incubation period. There is therefore much to suggest that similar would also apply to the new coronavirus”.

Can people exhibiting mild symptoms transmit the virus?

Two laboratories have been independently monitoring virus shedding by patients exhibiting few or minor symptoms and being treated in Munich. These patients have “symptoms of common cold rather than viral pneumonia”, according to a press release.

The doctors at the two laboratories could isolate the infectious virus from the pharynx (part of the throat). Both laboratories “found signs of viral replication in the pharynx” besides the lungs.

Based on these observations they say that persons who have “mild or early symptoms of common cold (sore throat, signs of sinusitis, feeling unwell without fever) may be able to transmit the novel coronavirus to other persons”.

“Because of the immediate relevance for infection control, the participating institutions have decided to release this information prior to completion of studies and formal scientific publication,” the researchers said. The observations have not been published in any journal post peer-reviewing. The findings have not been independently verified by other labs, either.

What do people with mild symptoms spreading the virus mean for infection control?

The Chinese woman who infected the German colleague is an example of a person exhibiting mild, non-specific symptoms spreading the virus to others.

If further studies find that some people infected with the virus have only mild symptoms, it would mean that many people might have gone or will go undetected. So the actual number of cases might be higher. More studies are needed to confirm if people with mild, non-specific symptoms might be spreading the virus and infecting others.

Like in the case of the Zika virus, can the nCoV be transmitted from a mother to the child (vertical transmission)?

In China, a baby born to a mother who tested positive of the virus was found to have been infected 30 hours after birth.

“This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,” chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital’s neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters.

But it is also possible that the baby was infected after birth probably due to close contact with the mother. No details are yet available to confirm or refute the claim by the Chinese doctor.

Vertical transmission (mother-to-child) is confirmed if the virus is transmitted from the mother to the foetus, during delivery or from breastfeeding. According to WHO, there have been no reported cases of vertical transmission in the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

According to the New York Times, the hospital disclosed details of a second case involving an infant who was born healthy but got infected 16 days later. The mother and the baby’s nanny were diagnosed with the virus after the baby was born.

Though the median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years, these two cases suggest that even infants can get infected with the novel virus.

Does a negative result mean the person is not infected with the novel coronavirus?

Not always. There have been at least a few instances when people have initially tested negative for the novel coronavirus before being testing positive. It is not clear at what stage of infection the initial tests and final tests were done.

Of the 1,155 people tested, as on February 6, in India for the virus, only three have been found positive. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a press release on February 6 that all 645 evacuees from Wuhan had tested negative. In addition, 510 samples had been tested by ICMR network laboratories and only three had turned out as positive. All the three people who tested positive are being kept in isolation wards in Kerala.

Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, believed to be a whistle-blower on the coronavirus outbreak, felt unwell and started coughing after treating a patient who later developed a fever. Dr. Li’s test results came back negative a few times before his infection was confirmed.

Similar cases have been reported from elsewhere. In Canada, a Chinese woman initially tested negative before further tests confirmed infection. In another case in Canada, a student from Wuhan, who was asymptomatic, initially tested negative. A second test confirmed the case as positive. In Japan, a person who returned from Wuhan had symptoms such as fever and coughing but initially tested negative. An additional test discovered the infection, according to a February 1 news report.

The failure to detect at the first instance could be due to early stages of the infection. “Our testing procedures are evolving and getting more and more precise,” Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams said in a statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/spkqns/article30754412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronajpg-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explainer-when-can-people-transmit-the-novel-coronavirus/article30754330.ece
22,2020/02/06,China to cut tariffs on $75 billion in US imports: official,"China on Thursday said it will halve punitive tariffs on USD 75 billion in U.S. imports from February 14, a month after Beijing and Washington signed a truce in their long-running trade war.

The reduction will apply to levies of 5% and 10% that were imposed on more than 1,700 items in September, according to the State Council Tariff Commission.

Products that had been hit by the 10% tariffs included fresh seafood, poultry and soybeans.

Tariffs also applied to items such as tungsten lamps for scientific and medical purposes, as well as some types of aircraft.

The move is aimed at “promoting the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations”, the Commission said in a statement.

It added that the reduction will kick in at 0501 GMT on February 14 — the same day Washington is expected to halve tariffs on USD 120 billion worth of Chinese products.

The Commission added it “hopes that both parties will be able to abide by their agreement, strive to implement its relevant content, (and) boost market confidence"".

Other retaliatory tariffs, however, remain in place.

The U.S. and China in January signed a partial deal that dialled down tensions in their bruising trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional USD 200 billion in American goods over the next two years.

As part of the phase one deal, the U.S. would halve its tariffs on USD 120 billion of Chinese goods to 7.5%, and the Trump administration called off added tariffs that would have taken effect last December.

At President Donald Trump’s annual State of the Union address this week, he said U.S.-China relations are the “best” ever currently.

China’s latest tariff reductions come as it grapples with a shortage of resources in a fight against a new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 560 lives.

On Tuesday, a top U.S. trade official said the virus outbreak will delay Beijing’s plans to buy goods from the U.S. under the phase one deal.

But Washington expects “minimal impact” from the virus on the U.S. economy.

China’s recent virus outbreak has caused Beijing to impose travel restrictions across cities, with millions of consumers staying home during its otherwise busy Spring Festival holiday.

23,2020/02/06,Indian-American Usha Reddi vie to enter Senate from Kansas,"Usha Reddi, Indian-American Manhattan city mayor who is running to enter the Senate from the U.S. state of Kansas, has raised over USD 100,000 in campaign donation.

Ms. Reddi, 54, who is seeking nomination from the Democratic party, migrated to the U.S. along with her parents in 1973 from Andhra Pradesh when she was eight.

She was sworn in as the Mayor of Manhattan city in Kansas last month.

The current Republican incumbent Senator Pat Roberts has announced not to seek re-election, making it an open seat this November.

Kansas, a Republican stronghold, has never elected a Democrat since 1932.

Four candidates including her are running for the Democratic party primaries to be held on August 4. Seven Republicans are vying for the Republican primary.

By vocation a teacher and education union leader, Ms. Reddi has twice been elected to four-year terms on Manhattan’s City Commission. On January 7, she began her second term as a mayor.

In July 2019, 40 years after her father Venkata Yeleti, 77, assaulted her, he was convicted of felony rape and was sentenced in Virginia. Ms. Reddi strongly feels that it is important to embrace her past and take control of her destiny.

“If I can put my dad away after 40 years, everything else seems OK,” Ms. Reddi recently told Kansas City in an interview. Running for the U.S. Senate from a Republican bastion is considered to be an uphill task. I understand it’s an uphill battle, but everything in my life has been an uphill battle,” she said.

The first Indian-American to serve as a mayor in Kansas, Ms. Reddi is the first Kansas mayor to simultaneously run for the U.S. Senate. She is also the first woman of colour to run for an office representing the entire state.

According to a statement issued by her campaign, Ms. Reddi has so far raised more than USD 100,000 in her Federal Election Commission.

“It’s an honour to engage with Kansans on the important issues we face. I believe their support is based on the trust built through these contacts,” she said in the statement.

Last month, she received the Elected Women of Excellence Award from the National Foundation of Women Legislators.

Ms. Reddi was first elected to the Manhattan City Commission for a four-year term in April 2013 and re-elected in 2017. She first served as the Mayor in 2016-2017 and now again in 2020.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qhy4vo/article30748387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ushareddi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-american-usha-reddi-vie-to-enter-senate-from-kansas/article30748388.ece
24,2020/02/06,U.S. announces launch of International Religious Freedom Alliance,"The United States on Wednesday announced the launch of a 27-nation International Religious Freedom Alliance, which will try to adopt a collective approach in protecting and preserving religious freedom across the world.

It is an Alliance of “like-minded partners who treasure, and fight for, international religious freedom for every human being”, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in his address during the formal launch.

Among the prominent countries to join the alliance are Austria, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Israel, Ukraine, the Netherlands and Greece.

“Defending the right of all people to live their lives according to their conscience is one of this administration’s top priorities,” Mr. Pompeo said in his address.

“Indeed, we must affirm, and fight for, that truth now more than ever. More than eight in 10 people in the world today live where they cannot practice their faith freely,” he said.

“We condemn terrorists and violent extremists who target religious minorities, whether they are Yezidis in Iraq, Hindus in Pakistan, Christians in northeast Nigeria, or Muslims in Burma,” Mr. Pompeo said.

“We condemn blasphemy and apostasy laws that criminalize matters of the soul. We condemn the Chinese Communist Party’s hostility to all faiths. We know several of you courageously pushed back against Chinese pressure by agreeing to be part of this Alliance, and we thank you for that,” Mr. Pompeo said.

“Finally, our Alliance is off on the right foot as countries do their parts to advance this mission,” the top American diplomat said.

During the launch meeting, according to a senior State Department official, participating countries are to discuss kind of areas that they are going to work and focus on.

“The areas will include things like technology and religious oppression, blasphemy and apostasy laws, for instance. Toolbox will include things like, whether it’s putting out statements, actions that can take place in international bodies that the group can come together and hopefully come behind, the possibilities of sanctions being used,” said the official.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it is a consensual body. Every nation is not bound to join in each of the items that come forth.

“But as countries look at this and say that’s something we’re interested in, then they can join. And if they decide, look, that’s not one we’re interested in, then they won’t, and there is no penalty or foul for any of participation or non-participation,” the official said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/beaapg/article30748331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKUZBEKISTAN-USAPOMPEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-announces-launch-of-international-religious-freedom-alliance/article30748332.ece
25,2020/02/06,"“It happened in seconds"": airliner skids, breaks open in Istanbul airport","A Turkish airliner skidded off a runway, crashed into a ditch and broke apart while landing in bad weather in Istanbul Wednesday, killing three people and injuring dozens more. Passengers had to scramble through the split fuselage to escape.

The aircraft, operated by low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines, was arriving at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport from the western Turkish city of Izmir with 183 passengers and crew on board when it had what the Transportation Ministry described as a “rough landing.”

Istanbul Gov. Ali Yerlikaya said the plane failed to “hold onto the runway” and skidded some 50-60 meters before it dropped into the ditch from a height of about 30 meters.

""We are deeply saddened ... (But) we are very happy that we escaped a greater accident,” Yerlikaya said, adding that the plane could have burst into flames.

Rescuers, assisted by an excavator, were seen working on one spot on the wreckage and it was not clear if they were searching for one person who remains unaccounted for.

The airport was shut down after the incident, which occurred at around 6.30 p.m. local time (1530 GMT), and flights were diverted to Istanbul’s main airport.

‘Happened in seconds’

Survivor Dogus Bilgic, 24, told Turkish television channel NTV that he fled the smashed plane by way of a gap near his seat and was one of the first passengers to get out.

“We travelled (on the runway) for some 20 or 30 seconds, then all of a sudden we flew off the runway,” he said while seated in a wheelchair because of a leg injury. “It happened in seconds.”

“I was seated in 25C. I believe the plane broke apart at row 26,” Bilgic recalled, adding that he threw himself out of the plane when he saw the opening.

""The front (of the plane) was in a terrible state. I saw, after I was on the ground, that it had completely broken apart,” he said.

As other passengers emerged from the wreckage, Bilgic said he helped two or three to the ground.

“I carried them somewhere because they weren’t doing as well as us,” he said, then ran away from the plane with others, fearing a possible explosion.

“There was complete chaos,” he said.

A video obtained showed the wreckage of the plane in a field adjacent to the end of the runway. The video shows heavy rain and strong winds at the time, with smoke coming from one of the engines as passengers climb out of the fuselage onto the wings of the plane and away from the crash site.

Eyewitness Hasan Eraydin, who shot the video, said he had been driving home from work when he heard a rumble. “We were about 30 meters away we tried to get to the scene to help, but there was some sort of a canal in between and it was impossible. We thought ‘God willing, no one has died’.”

Dozens of rescue crew members swarmed around the flood-lit fuselage, including around the cockpit, which had flipped over. The plane was a Boeing 737 that was 11 years old, according to the flight tracking website Flightradar24.

""We are aware of the media reports and we are gathering more information,” Peter Pedraza, a Boeing spokesperson, said.

NTV said the injured included the plane’s two pilots, who it said were in serious condition. The television channel l broadcast a recording of the communications between the pilots and air traffic control in which the pilots are told that previous flights had reported strong tail winds.

“According to the information we have, there was a rough landing. The accident occurred after (the plane) could not decelerate and rammed into a field from the end of the runway,” Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Mehmet Cahit Turan as saying.

Prosecutors opened an investigation of the accident, Anadolu reported.

Second accident this year

Pegasus is a privately-owned, low-cost carrier based in Istanbul that flies 97 routes, mostly within Turkey and to destinations in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. It is majority owned by Turkish billionaire Sevket Sabanci and his family, who have big investments in the country in areas as varied as real estate, clothing, health clubs and packaging materials.

The accident comes a month after a Pegasus plane with 164 people on board skidded off the runway at the same airport in Istanbul. There were no deaths or injuries in that incident on January 7.

In January 2018, another Boeing 737 in the Pegasus fleet slid off a runway at northeastern Turkey’s Trabzon Airport and down a dirt embankment. The plane came to rest in the dirt above the Black Sea with its nose pointed toward the water. None of the 168 passengers and crew members were injured.

Planes are designed to absorb impact forces in the bottom of the fuselage to improve the chances that passengers in the cabin above will survive.

In 2013, the tail of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 broke off after the jet hit a seawall during approach to San Francisco International Airport. Three people died, 49 were seriously injured and scores more suffered minor injuries, according to the U.S. accident report.

That same year, a Lion Air Boeing 737 split in two after landing in shallow water short of the runway in Bali, Indonesia. All 101 passengers and seven crew members survived.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k94pt0/article30748280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1204261009THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/airliner-skids-breaks-open-in-istanbul-leaving-3-dead-179-injured/article30748282.ece

In its daily update, the health commission in Hubei also confirmed the number of confirmed infections in the outbreak has reached 28,018 nationwide with 3,694 new cases reported.

The epidemic, which has spiralled into a global health emergency, is believed to have emerged in December from a market that sold wild game in Hubei's capital Wuhan.

Hu Lishan, an official in Wuhan, warned Wednesday that despite building a hospital from scratch and converting public buildings to accommodate thousands of extra patients, there was still a ""severe"" lack of beds in the region.

There was also a shortage of ""equipment and materials,"" he told reporters, adding that officials were looking to convert other hotels and schools in the city into treatment centres.

27,2020/02/06,Donald Trump acquitted by Senate,"U.S. President Donald Trump, impeached by the House of Representatives , was acquitted by the Senate late afternoon on Wednesday, bringing to a close a bitter process that lasted close to five months. Senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit Mr. Trump on the abuse of office charge, with Republican Mitt Romney voting alongside all 47 Democrats. They voted 53-47 as per party lines to acquit the president of the charge of obstruction of Congress.

“The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,” Mr. Romney said before the vote. “Corrupting an election to keep one's self in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.”

Mr. Romney is the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president from his own party. There was speculation earlier on Wednesday that some Democrat senators – such as Krysten Sinema (Arizona) and Joe Manchin(West Virginia) would vote with Republicans to acquit the President, but they did not do so.

Mr. Trump was impeached by the House for conditioning $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine and a crucial White House meeting with its president Volodymyr Zelensky on the Ukrainians publicly announcing investigations into Mr Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter.

Shortly after the vote Mr. Trump tweeted a video of election signs starting with ‘Trump 2024’ and culminating in ‘Trump 4EVA’ (i.e., ‘Trump forever’). Mr. Trump has repeatedly joked that he might serve more than the constitutionally mandated limit of two terms.

“Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election. Read the Transcripts,” Mr. Trump tweeted a few hours later.

“Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by the Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said via a statement.

Speaking before the vote Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer criticised the arguments law professor and criminal defence attorney Alan Dershowitz had made on the Senate floor in defence of Mr. Trump. “These are the excuses of a child, caught in a lie.”

Mr. Schumer called the arguments in defence of Mr. Trump, “as dangerous to the Republic as this president … a fig leaf so large, as to excuse any presidential misconduct.”

Senate Democrats could not get enough GOP votes to summon fresh witnesses and evidence during the impeachment trial. Among the possible material witnesses Democrats wanted to hear from was former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Mr. Bolton had, as per reports of a leaked book manuscript, said that Mr Trump had asked him to withhold the aid to Ukraine pending an announcement of the investigations.

House Democrats are “likely “ to subpoena Mr. Bolton, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters on Wednesday.

“When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore, you have to spotlight that, you have to protect the Constitution whatever the political consequences,” Mr. Nadler said.

Trump continues to lash out

At the annual National Prayer Breakfast meeting on Thursday Mr. Trump criticised his political opponents.

“I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong, “ Mr. Trump said in a reference to Mr. Romney, who had alluded to his faith during remarks about voting to convict Mr. Trump.

“Nor do I like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that’s not so,” Mr. Trump said, in a comment directed at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who has said before that she prays for the President.

Ms. Pelosi, who was also present, was seen standing and clapping for Mr. Trump as he was introduced. The last time they were in the same room was on Tuesday, at the House, when Mr. Trump did not shake Ms. Pelosi’s hand and Ms. Pelosi tore up a copy of Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address after he was done delivering it.

Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks on his impeachment and acquittal later on Thursday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/te6u4a/article30738392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5-isbs-newsmakeGLH72OMMN3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/senate-acquits-trump-of-abuse-of-power/article30746761.ece

29,2020/02/06,"'Wer Kann, Der Kann!': An unscripted tragicomedy, featuring cakes and kitchen disasters","It’s a real shame that I didn’t know about the Netflix series Nailed It! until last week. I came across the German version of the show quite unexpectedly and sat through the hilarious season for all of its six episodes, which ran for nearly thirty five minutes each.

The baking show has been swimming in the Netflix aea since March, 2018, and the international editions include the ones made in French, Mexican, and Spanish. The German version, which is called Wer Kann, Der Kann!, is hosted by Angelina Kirsch. And for each episode, she’s accompanied by the pastry chef, Bernd Siefert, and a special guest, ranging from an online gaming granny to a magician. The three judges take their seats on the other side of the contestants’ (three per episode) batch and pass comments about the goings-on throughout the two rounds.

The contestants also keep talking to the cameras about how they’re going to bake the perfect cakes and still end up botching them. When Bernd explains the process that goes into making the pastries and cookies, which follows themes like scary movies, holidays, personalities, etc., he makes it sound so easy. However, when the contestants try to make the same things with their own hands, they somehow fail to stick to the recipes and instructions. Even though, the level of difficulty is different for each episode, nobody bakes cakes that look and taste exactly like the models they’re given. Some of the amateur bakers work as chefs, but even they run out of tricks to save the day.

While some people say that baking calms them down, others run around the kitchen as though their preparations are on fire. It doesn’t matter how eccentric they get, or how tirelessly they measure each ingredient before they put it into bowls and pans, what matters is the end product alone! One of the participants, named Davide, was more interested in flirting with Angelina than on making something that was remotely edible. These unusual combinations power the show sometimes. Nevertheless, since the format doesn’t change much, you might be pushed to the zones of monotony occasionally. Imagine watching more bakers making more mistakes and the judges making more small talk as there’s nothing else to bank on! Yes, for a series of such little proportions, an increase in the number of episodes per season would have been disastrous.

Other than the kitchen calamities that the series focuses on, what’s intriguing is the eye on minute details that Bernd highlights – example: he tells you about how a scoop, or two, of extra buttercream can spoil the cake. And by the time he finishes the sentence, another camera gets ready to take you to the scene of destruction. It’s an unscripted tragicomedy that most of them don’t mind being a part of, as the winner walks away with a cool sum of € 5,000.

I couldn’t help thinking how an Indian edition of Nailed It! would turn out. Although, the series would be filled to the brim with people from the North Indian states, there’d be a handful of bakers from the North East and the South regions, as well. And I’m guessing Karan Johar would be up for the task, as there’s nobody else in Bollywood currently who has the raw tenacity to headline a television series and turn the mundane tables on their heads to make it more appealing and lively.

While I’m gallantly giving ideas to Netflix, let me go a bit further to announce the cash prize, too – ₹ 5,00,000!

If Netflix picks up some clues from this piece, I hope they invite me and watch me make a fool of myself. Anyway, if they’re planning on expanding the Nailed It! universe via upcoming seasons and international versions, I hope they bring in some sort of newness to the show – the kind of zaniness that’s impossible to look away from. Otherwise, the viewers might look for something fresher to keep them occupied.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/7su8uy/article30752220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07bgfrws1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/wer-kann-der-kann-an-unscripted-tragicomedy-featuring-cakes-and-kitchen-disasters/article30752222.ece

Known as Madurai Anbu among members of the film fraternity, he heads a production house called Gopuram Films.

A number of property documents, promissory notes and postdated cheques taken as collateral were recovered during the search and have been seized by I-T officials. It is estimated that the concealment in his case is likely to exceed ₹300 crore. There have been no cash seizures so far in the case of actor Vijay. But I-T officials said they were investigating his investment in immovable properties and remuneration received from AGS Entertainment for Bigil. “Searches at some of the premises are still on,” according to a statement by Surabhi Ahluwalia, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media and Technical Policy) and CBDT spokesperson.

31,2020/02/06,This virtual reality installation explores the literary world of Kafka in five minutes,"From the corner of my eye, I see something dangling from the right side of my head; mildly weighing me down. I lift my palms, only to realise that they have transformed into scrawny, hairy nondescript limbs. Here, in the Old Town of Prague (Czech Republic), in a small, dingy room which is faintly familiar, I spot a mirror. It is not until I move to face it that I see what I am now — yes, I woke up as a bug.

Memoirs of a loner

I am trapped, and wilfully so, in the literary world of Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. For anyone who has read The Metamorphosis, Gregor Samsa is not a stranger; rather he is an emblem of loneliness and misery, a very relatable figure at that, whose characterisation speaks volumes of the condition of social isolation. At Goethe-Institut, this literary world of the 20th Century, takes shape in delightful five-minute intervals inside a curtained, dark contraption equipped with VR headsets and motion sensor footwear and gloves. VRwandlung, as the virtual reality installation is called, will land one in Gregor Samsa’s shoes, firing a curiosity that will only result in one going back to pick up a copy of The Metamorphosis. This is precisely what the library at Goethe-Institut intends to do.

When I meet Ján Tompkins, he is helping a viewer slip into the shoes, inside the setup. Ján who joined the team headed by Mika Johnson (who is behind VRwandlung) as a social media assistant, is supervising the set up in Chennai. After the experience, he sits me down to explain the inception of this installation. “The Goethe-Institut in Prague is responsible for the financial upbringing of this project by Mika Johnson. There were three separate teams working on the installation — one for the engineering of the bug’s body, another for the art direction who created the model of the surrounding and a separate team who scanned this setup on to a virtual space,” says Ján. Mika, the director, is a Kafka fanatic and he had worked on VRwandlung in 2017, for over a year.

“As we all know, people who like Kafka either really like him or don’t. There is no in between. So when Mika, got the opportunity to set up something in the (4 metre by 4metre) space, [The] Metamorphosis fit well since most of the story takes place inside a room,” Ján explains. VRwandlung has travelled to 50 or more cities in over 30 countries. At any given point, simultaneous shows are likely to be set up across locations. In the European Union, they had travelled with a makeshift box that had the entire kit within it. Institutes also sometimes locally source the technology to make it available to the students.

Experience on demand

“We didn’t have a target audience because VR is still a new technology in many places. But after the installation was set up in Prague, we realised that a lot of our unintentional audiences were students and those who haven’t read Kafka before,” says Ján adding that it is getting increasingly hard to get people to read. Especially when the work is more than 100-years-old, and originally written in German. By giving a taste of the work, replete with a few dialogues, the installation only intends to pique one’s interest. The design is also done deliberately in an open-ended manner, in an effort to invite readers to revisit the novel. The mirror is a pivotal element in the setup. “We didn’t want to create the entire piece, because then it would be 40 minutes long. We wanted the piece to be just an extension of the literature,” says Ján. Though this is Mika’s first experiment with virtual reality, he is already working on multiple projects involving this technology. One of his long term goals is to create a set up with different rooms that people can navigate through, each one being a different literary world of Kafka’s.

Transforming literature into something tangible, is still very new in the country. But currently, across the globe, there is an evident shift from VR being associated with only video games to other purposes. “VR has finally found its footing as a very legitimate art form that gives one the freedom to break the boundaries of storytelling. Literature can be easily transformed into something very experiential,” says Ján adding that collaborations like that of Mika’s are definitely on the rise. Though VR presents itself as a medium to portray stories in a different way, they may work better for some narratives than others. “You should always ask what the story benefits from, by being in VR,” says Ján. If it is just a story that wants one to remain stationary, it is no different than a movie.

VRwandlung will be on display till February 15 at Goethe-Institut, Rutland Gate 5th Street.

32,2020/02/06,A run to fuel dreams,"You can see them if you happen to walk by the Kasimedu fishing harbour late in the afternoon. Their black hair sun-bleached to a brown, clad in shorts and crinkled shirts, they hop about the docked boats running errands for the owners. These are dhees boys, a term for teenage boys who do small jobs such as scrubbing the boats’ hulls clean with soap oil for a token pay. Many of them are school drop-outs. “Some children from the fishing community discontinue their studies for want of just a few hundreds for their school fees,” says MD Dhayalan, president, Indian Fisherman Association.

He mentions examples of boys and girls whose parents are unable to afford ₹800. “Saving money for a rainy day is impossible for the fishing community,” he adds. “Through the year, they spend on nets, diesel, repair work... fishing as a profession is unpredictable. They usually earn just enough to make ends meet and sometimes even lesser,” says Dhayalan.

Paying their children’s school fees becomes even more of a task since the new term for the year starts when the State’s ban on fishing using mechanised boats is on. “This is when there is no money on their hands,” explains Dhayalan, adding that the Government can take the initiative to waive off school fees for struggling children from the community. “We do our bit through our educational trust every year,” he says.

Dhayalan knows how important education is. So do the youngsters of Royapuram-based team Ocean Awareness who carry out beach clean-ups and awareness drives on plastic pollution among fisherfolk. “Which is why this time, the yearly run we organise focusses on education,” says K Vinoth from the team. Funds from the event will go towards the education of 30 children from the fishing community.

“They are students with good academic potential, who are from less-privileged backgrounds,” adds Febin Francis John, who is also part of Ocean Awareness. They have tied up with a school in the area which is curating the list of potential candidates. Usually at their runs, Ocean Awareness uses the felicitation stage to talk about issues such as dangers of plastic at sea. “At this edition, we will talk about the importance of insurance for fishermen,” he explains.

Febin says that while those who work on the bigger trawler boats have insurance, small boat fishermen do not bother about it. “They have an attitude that ‘after I myself am gone, what good is the money to my family’,” he says, adding, “This should change. Hopefully, we can bring about some difference.”

33,2020/02/06,Pawsome People Project to host the first pet festival in Coimbatore,"Megha Jose, the founder of The Pawsome People Project is excited. “We are an NGO that works for the welfare of animals and we are hosting Pawsome Pet Fest, the first pet festival in Tamil Nadu. I promise that it is going to be fun,” she says. Megha who lived in Bengaluru for a while saw how pet festivals were common there. She also felt people were kinder to animals on the street. “Sadly, things are not the same here and I want to change that,” she says. Megha hopes that festivals such as these will dispel common misconceptions people have about stray dogs. “Not all stray dogs are rabid, and neither are all of them dangerous and aggressive.”

Megha Jose

Everyone is welcome to the pet fest. “There are carnival games and stalls that sell food, clothes, crafts, home décors and bath products. There will be an open mic in the evening.” Megha invites visitors to the fest to take a closer look at the decorations. There will be origami cranes, butterflies and kites made by the volunteers who worked on them for an entire month. The venue will also have placards displaying animal rights and laws. There will be free vet consultation, training sessions by experts, fashion shows, adoption camps and an off-leash area. “Coimbatore doesn’t have any dog parks for them to play like the one at Elephant Pond in Karnataka. For many pets that live in apartments, this is an opportunity to jump and run around,” she says adding that there will be an off-leash area of 1, 000sq feet for them to do so at the venue. Vignesh A, a photographer from Gandhipuram who owns a year-old Labrador says, “My dog spends most of his time indoors due to lack of space outside my home. I take him for a walk twice everyday, but it is not enough to keep him fit. I look forward for this fest where my dog can run around and have fun with other dogs. I also hope to get a few tips from the dog trainers there.”

Pawsome People Project has been working with Humane Animal Society for the past five months and they have sterilised 50 street dogs, built 10 dog shelters on roadsides across the city and fed 300 street dogs last month. The volunteers are divided into 45 groups based on locality and they are responsible for identifying and sterilising street dogs in that area. Says Kiirthana R, a volunteer with Pawsome People Project: “We are trained to approach and handle stray dogs. After gaining their trust, we take them to the clinic in HAS to be sterilised and vaccinated. Once they have recovered, we leave them at the same spot where we picked them from. Now, most of the dogs around my area know me and they wag their tail when they spot me. It is a very beautiful feeling.”

Pawsome People Project has managed with contributions from their friends and family so far. “We plan to make the organisation bigger and create more awareness drives. All the proceeds from this fest will be used for the welfare of animals. Our ultimate aim is to train the stray dogs as service dogs but I know it will take us a while to reach there,” she acknowledges.

Mini Vasudevan of Humane Animal Society says that she is happy to see the increasing number of people who are concerned about animals in the city. “There are a lot of youngsters involved and it is a positive sign. Such initiatives will make people more caring about animals. I am also glad that Coimbatore is the venue for the first pet festival in the state. I hope that the other cities will also take it as an example,” she adds.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/60bamt/article30751432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STREETDOGS,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-pawsome-people-project-hosts-the-first-pet-festival-in-coimbatore/article30751436.ece
34,2020/02/06,Never be unhappy,"What is the universal goal that we all share?

“I want to be happy.”

Take anyone. A small child wants to be happy; an old man wants to be happy too. In any continent across the world, every person wants to be happy. This is why many philosophies (and religions) promise some path to the destination of eternal happiness. Ultimately, happiness and unhappiness are experiences in our mind. That is why people feel happy for different reasons, in different surroundings, in different company. One person finds happiness in accumulating mansions and expensive cars. Another finds happiness in an austere life or serving others. One likes to be alone, another prefers to be surrounded by people. It depends on the mind.

By nature, our mind moves without pause from one thought or feeling to the next. The mind’s distracted nature is always in evidence; just recall a time when you tried to concentrate or meditate — you would have found your mind wandering repeatedly. Happiness and unhappiness, like all other experiences, are transient. Happy moments pass, leaving behind pleasant memories. Unhappy moments usually pass too, leaving behind unpleasant memories. Consequently, you cannot feel happy all the time, however much you may want to. If something makes you happy, it will change and maybe annoy you, or your mind will change and you will grow dissatisfied with it over time. Just look at your life experience and that of others around you — you do not need me to convince you of this fact. Both the world outside and our mind inside change ceaselessly — that’s their nature. Happiness and unhappiness come and go in our mind, from minute to minute.

Ever-changing mind

Here’s another way to look at it. Our mind is excited and active when we are happy. Look at a child before her birthday party, or the mother waiting to see her son after a long time. But the mind cannot continue to remain like this all the time. There is a sense of excitement and anticipation driving the mind. Once the party is over or a week after the son has returned, the excitement fades, hopefully leaving behind a feeling of satisfaction instead. Of course, something unexpected may happen and the happiness may not even materialise, or may be mixed with unhappiness — the child may not receive the gift she expects, or the son may behave in a manner that displeases his mother. Even if everything goes wonderfully, it is not natural to remain in a state of excitement all the time — after a while, it is simply exhausting for the mind and body.

“I want to be happy” is a temporary goal. “I want to be happy always” is an impossible goal.

So what is the possible goal?

I don’t want to be unhappy ever.

The natural progression is for excitement of happiness or pleasure to give way to a feeling of contentment. In other words, “being happy” is always temporary, but it may culminate in feeling fulfilled or content. When we feel satisfied our mind becomes restful. And, when we have that feeling of quietness or contentment, we are not unhappy — or at least, we are less unhappy.

It is undesirable, and probably impossible, to be in a state of excitement all the time, but it is possible to have a quiet or still mind all the time. Of course, that is not how we are usually, but it’s neither undesirable nor impossible.

It is correct to say, “I don’t want to be unhappy ever.”

What does it mean to be free of unhappiness? Not that we will lead an ecstatic pleasure-filled life all the time, for that is impossible through any means. It means that we are peaceful within; that we have restful contentment instead of the mental urge to chase something without a pause. This is a lasting goal. It is not just possible and desirable; it is absolutely essential if we are to have balance in our lives.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/never-be-unhappy/article30750491.ece

36,2020/02/06,"India, African countries resolve to fight terror","﻿India and several African countries on Thursday pledged to deepen cooperation to combat the growing threat of terrorism and preserve maritime security by sharing information, intelligence and surveillance, in a joint deceleration adopted at the first India- Africa Defence Ministers conclave at the ongoing Defexpo. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said India was geared to provide a range of military hardware to Africa.

‘Threat to peace’

“We condemn, in the strongest terms, the growing threat of terrorism and acknowledge that it constitutes a major threat to peace and security in the region. We urge all countries to take resolute action in rooting out terrorism in all forms and manifestations, terrorist safe havens and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and eliminating financing channels and halting cross-border movement of terrorists. We understand the need for all countries to ensure that all territory under their control is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries in any manner,” the Lucknow Declaration said, emphasising the need for stronger international partnership in countering terrorism and violent extremism, including through increased sharing of information and intelligence.

The Declaration also called for strengthening the UN Counter-Terrorism mechanisms and to ensure strict compliance with the UN Security Council sanctions regime on terrorism. “We urge the international community to envisage the adoption of Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UNGA,” it stated.

Maritime security

Recognising the importance of the oceans and seas to the livelihoods of our peoples and that maritime security is a pre-requisite for the development of blue or ocean economy, the Declaration said, “We seek to increase our cooperation in securing sea lines of communication, preventing maritime crimes, disaster, piracy, illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing through sharing of information and surveillance.”

38 countries

The dialogue was attended by 12 Defence Ministers and 38 countries were represented at the conclave. “India will continue to intensify and deepen engagement. It will be a partnership guided by your priorities. More specifically on the defence cooperation, these include strengthening cooperation and mutual capabilities in combating terrorism and extremism, keeping our cyberspace safe and secure and supporting the UN in advancing and keeping peace,” Mr. Singh said, offering offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), fast interceptor boats, body and vehicle armour, night vision goggles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Dornier aircraft, and arms and ammunition.

He said India’s partnership with Africa was an open one with “all the possibilities and avenues for collaboration from our side being open to you to choose from and decide as per your priorities.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xl85rx/article30755495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THLTDEFEXPO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-african-countries-resolve-to-fight-terror/article30755496.ece
37,2020/02/06,Team Air India flew into an eerily quiet Wuhan rescue,"An eeriness greeted the crew on-board Air India’s Boeing 747 aircraft as it approached Wuhan on a mission to rescue the first batch of 640 Indians from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. The pilots on-board the plane remember the city as “a scene from an apocalypse movie”, a “ghost town”.

“Initially it was like any other flight and airways were busy. But when we started descending, the silence started creeping on us. The airport was absolutely silent. All the aircraft were parked and sealed. The streets were empty and it felt like a ghost town,” recalled Captain Amitabh Singh, Director of Operations of Air India and in-charge of the 34-member rescue team.

Five pilots and 15 cabin crew were sounded off about a mission to evacuate Indians from Wuhan “2-3 days” before the scheduled departure. A day before the flight, the pilots and cabin crew underwent detailed briefing on the mission, including from doctors on the disease. The airline also procured medicated suits, protective shoes, gloves, N-35 masks, glasses and caps for the crew and the support staff.

VVIP aircraft

A Boeing 747 aircraft, usually kept on standby for use by VVIPs, took off from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport at 12.30 p.m. on January 31 for the first rescue flight along with extra fuel, spare parts, and sufficient food and water. The aircraft, known as a jumbo, was chosen for its seating capacity as the twin-deck plane can accommodate 423 passengers.

Another pilot, who requested anonymity, said he chose not to inform his family about his role in the mission.

After a four-hour long flight, the jumbo landed at Wuhan and what followed was a long, anxious wait of nearly eight hours for passengers to start boarding the flight. The Chinese authorities allowed students to depart from their hotels and hostels for the Indian Consulate only after the Air India plane took off from the Indira Gandhi International Airport.

The students were then allowed to travel to the airport only after the aircraft reached Wuhan, resulting in the long ground halt, explained Captain Singh, whose responsibility it was to co-ordinate with officials in China.

The flight was operated by Captain Kamal Mohan, Captain Sanjay Achalkar, Captain S.H. Reza, Captain Bhupesh Narain. The cabin crew team was led by Manju Tanwar.

A team of three doctors and four nursing staff on-board the flight measured the temperature of all 324 passengers and taught them to wear masks before allowing passengers to board.

Precautions taken

Inside the plane, precautions were taken to minimise exposure. All passengers were seated in the Economy Class, the engineers and doctors were in the First Class in the front-section, while the extra cabin crew and commercial staff were on the upper deck, in the Executive Class.

The flight returned to New Delhi at 7.30 a.m. on February 1, where the officials of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and personnel from the Army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police were waiting. Passengers were then offloaded, medically checked, and escorted to the buses waiting to take them to the camp.

38,2020/02/06,"India, U.K. to sign pact on jet engine development","India and the U.K. are exploring various options for collaboration on joint defence projects and are close to signing a government-to-government agreement on jet engine technology development, U.K. Minister for Defence Procurement James Heappey said on Thursday.

“The two governments have decided to collaborate in the development of a jet engine. We are on the verge of signing a government-to-government agreement on jet engine technology development,” Mr. Heappey said speaking at Defexpo 2020. The announcement is imminent, he said, without getting into the details.

Before attending the expo, he was in New Delhi where he met senior government and military officials.

Official sources said the agreement was likely to be done within few weeks. In addition, the U.K. government is working on a government-to-government framework for defence deals in future given India’s preference for that route. The mechanism needs to be agreed upon by both sides is also expected to be ready along with the jet engine agreement.

Third aircraft carrier

Mr. Heappey also made a pitch for joint technology development for sixth generation fighters which can go into India’s fifth generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft. He discussed about Indian Navy’s plans for a third aircraft carrier for which the U.K. has already offered the design of its Queen Elizabeth class carrier. On this, he said, there was genuine enthusiasm in the Indian Navy on how it could be adopted by India.

In 2017, the two countries had agreed to extend cooperation on developing advanced defence products such as gas turbine engine and air defence missile systems and a collaborative project was set up between engine maker Rolls Royce and India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation on jet engine technology.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-uk-to-sign-pact-on-jet-engine-development/article30755415.ece
39,2020/02/06,India to study air corridors for trade with Central Asian countries,"Apart from developing trade via the Chabahar port in Iran, India would like to explore setting up “air corridors” between India and five Central Asian nations, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Thursday. The air corridors — similar to what India established in 2018 with Afghanistan — would include regular cargo flights with special clearing and customs facilities to expedite the movement of goods, especially fresh fruit and other agricultural produce, and were currently being discussed by the MEA.

“While flying time from Delhi for most of the Central Asian destinations is two hours, it may take two months for containers sent overland from India to reach these places,” Mr. Jaishankar said, speaking at the inaugural of the “India Central Asia Business council” which brought together Indian businessmen and diplomats from five Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. “Availability of air corridors can boost trade in perishable goods, agricultural and food products,” he added. The minister also observed that it was a “matter of concern” that a lack of “overland connectivity” — a veiled reference to barriers to transit trade through Pakistan — had kept the total trade between India and Central Asia quite low at approximately $2 billion per year. India, Mr. Jaishankar emphasised, remains committed to the Chabahar port project in Iran.

“India proposes to overcome this challenge through the Chabahar route. India, Iran and Afghanistan believe that Chabahar will become the fulcrum of connectivity for Indian goods to reach Afghanistan and further north to Central Asian states, and for the landlocked Central Asia to find access to ocean through this port,” he said, referring to the ₹100 crore investment the recent Bbudget has proposed to develop the Iranian port.

Businessmen and diplomats present however remained skeptical of the viability of Chabahar without considerable progress on infrastructure on the ground. At present, most of the trade between Central Asia goes via Bandar Abbas in Iran, northern Europe or China. In recent years, the government has been seeking to develop more direct routes from Chabahar, a trilateral arrangement with Iran and Afghanistan, the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and becoming a part the Ashgabat Agreement. However, the rail-link between Chabahar and the crossover into Afghanistan is yet to be developed, which would be an important part of growing regular trade. At present, $1.5 billion of the $2 billion trade with Central Asia is with Kazakhstan, and more than $1 billion of that comes from crude oil exports to India.

Other participants said that apart from connectivity, visa procedures need to be streamlined further in order to grow services, especially medical tourism that brings hundreds of patients from Central Asia to India each year. “Especially in cases of life-saving treatment, like bone-marrow transplant patients and other organ transplant patients, we would like the government to help issue visas on priority basis,” said Dr. Kanwar of “Connecting Patients, LLP”. The India Central Asia Business Council is being set up by the Federation of the Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

According to an “outcomes document” presented to Mr. Jaishankar, the council also decided to establish four working groups including on energy, agro and food processing, tourism and pharmaceuticals to present recommendations for ways to further boost trade.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ip1kh5/article30755280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TH-THGRP-JI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-study-air-corridors-for-trade-with-central-asian-countries/article30755281.ece
40,2020/02/06,Parliament proceedings | SC setting time for Speakers to decide on de-qualification avoidable: Ravi Shankar Prasad,"Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday spoke out against the Supreme Court’s directive to the Speakers of the Assemblies and Parliament to decide on de-qualification of lawmakers in three months. He said the ruling was avoidable, and “we need to have institutional respect” for the legislatures.

His view was endorsed by Congress member Anand Sharma, who said the ruling amounted to a transgression.

The court has said it twice that a Speaker should be substituted with an independent tribunal to decide on disputes over disqualification.

The latest ruling came on January 21 on a petition filed by Congress legislator Keisham Meghachandra Singh against the Manipur Assembly Speaker over disqualification of Minister T. Shyamkumar, who joined the BJP after contesting the election on Congress ticket.

“With the greatest respect to the honourable Supreme Court, those sweeping comments against the presiding officers were surely avoidable. We need to have institutional respect for all institutions of the country. The presiding officers of the legislatures are equally important functionaries in the constitutional process,” Mr. Prasad said in the Rajya Sabha.

Agreeing with the Law Minister, Mr. Sharma said, “I agree with the honourable Law Minister on this. This is a serious matter. It is a transgression. The Constitution is clear in its scheme of things and the division of powers.”

They were speaking after DMK member P. Wilson mentioned at Zero Hour that the “inordinate delay” in disposing of complaints under the anti-defection law defeated the very purpose of it. The Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985, was to curb defections. “A political party goes before the electorate with a particular programme and puts up its candidate on certain promises. Such a person who gets elected cannot change his affiliation for extraneous reasons,” Mr. Wilson said. He argued for a mandatory time frame to decide on defection cases.

Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said it was an important issue, and parties should come together to suggest an alternative.

The DMK has moved the Supreme Court, alleging that the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker did not act on a petition for disqualification of 11 AIADMK lawmakers who voted against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami during a 2017 confidence vote.

The 11 lawmakers included Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/przqh7/article30755206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7TH-RS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-sc-setting-time-for-speakers-to-decide-on-de-qualification-avoidable-ravi-shankar-prasad/article30755207.ece
41,2020/02/06,"Parliament proceedings | No plan to amend Constitution to include Net access as fundamental right, says Ravi Shankar Prasad","Minister for Communications Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday justified the imposition of Internet blockade in Jammu and Kashmir by stating that national security trumped over the right to use the Internet and the blockade would be reviewed periodically based on the law and order situation in the region.

Mr. Prasad, who was answering a question in the Rajya Sabha, clarified that the government had no plans to amend the Constitution to include access to the Internet as a fundamental right.

On January 10, the Supreme Court, in its 130-page judgment, stated the government should “forthwith” review its orders suspending the Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir. It declared that the freedoms of speech, expression and conducting business on the Internet are fundamental rights integral to Article 19 of the Constitution and subject to reasonable restrictions.

Reiterating this point, Mr. Prasad said the misconception that the right to access the Internet was a fundamental right should be cleared.

“While the right of use of the Internet is important, the security of the country is equally important. Law and order is a State subject. Can we deny that the Internet, a fine creation of the human mind, is not being abused by terrorists, by agent provocateurs, by giving fake news, demanding other kinds of exhortation for communal violence?” Mr. Prasad argued. No one can deny the abuse of the Internet for spreading violence and terrorism, and Pakistan had been doing it in Kashmir and ISIS prospered because of the Internet, he noted.

Mr. Prasad emphasised that the Constitution, which provided rights, also laid equal stress on their regulation. “Use the Internet but you cannot create violence... and weaken unity, integrity, and security of the nation”, he said.

Whether it was a BJP government or a non-BJP government, the Internet had been restricted on several times on account of its abuse. The Supreme Court had said the suspension of the Internet should be periodically reviewed. A committee at the Centre, comprising the Home Secretary, the Law Secretary and the IT Secretary, made periodical reviews, while committees did the job in the States. A decision on discontinuing the blockade would be taken by the Jammu and Kashmir administration.

The government recently allowed partial Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir.

Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad slammed the partial rollover of Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, saying it was done only on paper. Even text messages weren’t going through, he alleged.

Congress member Amee Yagnik asked Mr. Prasad to clarify on whether the government had a specific policy detailing the conditions under which Internet could be denied to citizens. The Minister was not able to give a specific reply. He said there were temporary suspension of Internet rules, which was under the consideration of the Supreme Court. “What the Supreme Court has said is that you must have more frequent periodical review, which we will be doing,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7btd6h/article23474172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RAVI-SHANKAR-PRASAD-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-plan-to-amend-constitution-to-include-net-access-as-fundamental-right-prasad/article30755230.ece

Kanimozhi, participating in the discussion on Budget in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, said India today was also seeing an unemployment rate which was a 45-year high.

“The urban youth are unemployed and it is worse in the rural sector. Recently in Salem [in Tamil Nadu], a woman who lost her husband could not find employment and she sold her hair to support her family. This is the state in which our country is, and we are talking about a multi-trillion economy.”

She said her State had also requested the government to increase minimum wages of MGNREGS workers at least to ₹350 but the Centre continued to give less funds.

Congress member Manish Tewari noted that no parameter of the state is doing well currently and that all the pillars of the economy — savings, consumption, and employment — are all down.

Trinamool Congess MP Abhishek Banerjee said Budget 2020 was brutal, barbaric, harsh and heinous murder. “There are failed flagship schemes like Khelo India, Fit India. Now the government’s new flagship scheme is ‘Becho India’ [Sell India],” he said.

‘Right move’

43,2020/02/06,Narendra Modi silent on real issues: Rahul Gandhi,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “distracting’ people by talking about ‘other’ issues and remaining silent on the real issue of unemployment.

“The PM is distracting people from real issues by talking about Jawaharlal Nehru, Pakistan and Bangladesh,” Mr. Gandhi told presspersons in Parliament after Mr. Modi’s reply in the Lok Sabha to the debate on Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to the joint session of Parliament.

The former Congress chief said that earlier the government would talk about making India a $5 trillion economy and Make in India, but now Mr. Modi was trying to distract by talking about other things such as the Congress, Pandit Nehru, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“Talk about the main issue Prime Ministerji. Tell the youth what you are doing about jobs ... His style is to distract the country. He had said two crore jobs will be given to youngsters, but five-and-a-half years have passed. Last year 1 crore youth lost jobs, he is unable to say a word,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi was targeted by the Prime Minister several times in his 98-minute speech in the Lok Sabha. Without naming Mr. Gandhi, the Prime Minister referred to him as a tube light, and recalled a speech of the Congress leader from one of the Delhi election campaigns where he is reported to have said that youth of India would beat him [Mr Modi] with lathis for not being able to provide jobs.

“For the past 20 years, I have been used to verbal abuses [gaali] and am now gaali proof. I will do so many surya namaskars [salutations to the sun] that my back becomes strong to face lathis,” he said. Again, without naming Mr Gandhi, the Prime Minister said some people were like a ‘tube light’ that received electricity a little late.

MP seeks apology

At the Congress’s official briefing, senior leader and party spokesperson Manish Tewari said Mr. Modi’s speech oscillated between “stand-up comedy and rank communalism”. He accused Mr. Modi of quoting Jawaharlal Nehru “out of context” and demanded an apology. “It is extremely unfortunate and deeply regrettable that the Prime Minister’s comments oscillated between stand-up comedy, half-truths and rank communalism. It is regrettable that he should quote one of his illustrious predecessors Jawaharlal Nehru completely out of context,” Mr. Tewari said.

This comes on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Parliament, accused the regional leaders of attempts to foment trouble in the run-up to the revocation of Article 370 and 35A on August 5, 2019.

Both Mr. Omar Abdullah and Ms. Mehbooba Mufti were booked under Section 107 along with Section 151 (for apprehension of breaching peace).

Earlier in the day, officials said former Minister Sagar, a close confidant of incarcerated NC patron Farooq Abdullah, along with Mr. Madni, a former Deputy Speaker and uncle of Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, were shifted from the MLA Hostel sub-jail to the M-5 guest house on Gupkar Road, which is also designated as a sub-jail.

Mr. Madni, according to the PSA dossier, was booked for his role during a civilian agitation that followed the double-rape and murder of Asiya and Nelofar in 2009 and for “his role in conceiving the self-rule doctrine”. Mr. Sagar’s dossier underlined his statements made “against the vision of India, Article 370 and Article 35 A” and “his potential to mobilise people.”

Dr. Farooq Abdullah became the first mainstream leader to face the PSA in September 2019. The recently released Peoples Conference chief Sajjad Lone and PDP youth president Waheed Parra were also placed under house arrest.

Officials said the multi-storey MLA Hostel in Srinagar was likely to be vacated of all detained mainstream leaders.

Reacting to the development, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said the BJP-led government at the Centre is “testing the patience” of the people by such “undemocratic moves”.

Jammu and Kashmir unit of the CPI(M) also condemned the slapping of the PSA on the prominent Kashmiri leaders, while the Congress termed the decision as “unfortunate.""

45,2020/02/06,"India, Russia try to resolve impasse over Ka-226 helicopter deal","Issues concerning the production localisation of Ka-226T light utility helicopters are in the process of being resolved, N.M. Srikanth, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Indo-Russian Helicopters Limited (IRHL), said on Thursday. The final deal for manufacturing the helicopters in India has been held up for a while.

At the ongoing Defexpo 2020, Russian Helicopters (RH) signed a road map with IRHL for localisation of Ka-226T helicopter production in India.

“The Defence Ministry has sought details regarding the localisation of the helicopter. We have submitted fresh details on that addressing the clarifications,” Mr. Srikanth said, adding the revised techo-commercial bid was now with the Ministry and may come up before the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) at its next meeting.

The IRHL is a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Russian Helicopters (RH), which will assemble the Ka-226T helicopters in India.

Elaborating on the localisations plan, Mr. Srikanth said it would be spread over four phases. In Phase 1, 3.3% indigenisation would be achieved for 35 helicopters, in Phase 2 it would go up to 15% indigenisation for 25 helicopter, 35% indigenisation for 30 helicopters in Phase 3 and eventually to 62.4% indigenisation in Phase 4 for the last 50 helicopters.

The first helicopter would be delivered within 36 months from the signing of the contract and order completed in eight years, he stated.

The helicopter is powered by a French engine and would have 74% Russian content and 26% European content.

In 2015, India and Russia concluded an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for at least 200 Ka-226T helicopters estimated to cost over $1 billion. The Kamov-226T is meant to replace the ageing and obsolete Cheetah and Chetak fleets of the Indian Army and the Air Force.

As per procedure, the Defence Ministry has issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to IRHL for 200 helicopters. The RFP earlier mentioned a localisation of 70%, over which the final deal was held up as the JV could not meet that.

Of the 200, 60 helicopters will come directly from the RH plant in Ulan Ude and remaining will be assembled in India from supply kits from RH. This is where the issue of localisation is critical. “As 60 helicopters will be imported, the 70% localisation should be met with the 140 to be assembled in India, which would make it almost 100% localisation and not possible to meet,” one official said.

The road map signed at the Expo defines the main stages and terms for producing the Ka-226T helicopter in India and lays down the timelines for setting up production, contracting with suppliers, transferring design documentation, supplying technological equipment and machine kits, training Indian personnel and other key stages of the project to localise production, the RH said in a statement.

“The road map signed today will be the basis for further development of the Ka-226T localization project in India after the signing of the contract,” said Director General of Russian Helicopters holding company Andrei Boginsky.

To meet the localisation requirements as part of the deal, RH is entering into agreements with Indian companies for spares and components. While the Ka-226T is an India specific variant, the Ka-226 is flown by the Russian border security and coast guard which come under the Federal Security Service (FSB)",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r5q54r/article30754481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ka-226T,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-russia-try-to-resolve-impasse-over-ka-226-helicopter-deal/article30754482.ece
46,2020/02/06,BJP's major plank in Delhi polls is Narendra Modi’s governance record: Prakash Javadekar,"Union Minister Prakash Javadekar is also the BJP’s poll in charge for Delhi. He speaks on the campaign, its tonality and the anti-CAA protests that were also a theme running through the polls…..

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had a strong campaign theme of work done, how did you counter it?

Our major plank in these elections is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance record and the development activity he has done. In contrast, in the last four and a half years Mr. Kejriwal was only blaming Prime Minister Modi — that he (Mr. Kejriwal) was not being allowed to work, his projects were being blocked etc. Now, the AAP’s campaign slogan says, “Acche Beetey Paanch Saal,” how is he saying that? More importantly, he failed Delhi. Delhi voted for clean politics, and now his party and its legislators have been spoken of as involved in corruption and this has damaged Delhi. People are disappointed and he (Mr. Kejriwal) has stopped all work. So much so that he hasn’t allowed the good schemes of the Centre to be implemented in the State — he has not allowed Ayushman Bharat or even the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.

But the municipal corporations have a strong BJP presence and are responsible for much of the civic infrastructure. Do you still think the “no work” tag would stick?

Municipal corporations in Delhi were not allowed to work. The State government did not give nearly ₹10,000 crore that was due to the municipal corporations. Our corporators should have highlighted the fact that the Kejriwal government was obstructing funds and works by the municipal corporations. It wasn’t highlighted earlier, we highlighted in the campaign.

The BJP however took a conscious decision in the last few days to go hyper local and go in for small meetings rather than a big blitzkrieg of rallies etc? Were you compensating for the fact that you don’t have a chief ministerial face to project?

In many States in the past we have not declared a chief ministerial candidate. All parties sometimes declare, sometimes they don’t. We decided to do an intensive door-to-door, street-to-street campaign because this booth-wise campaigning is our strength as a party. We felt there was a gap in terms of door-to-door campaigning which we made up in the last few days.

But the one point where the AAP campaign has struck a chord is the question “Kejriwal Vs Who?” Could a face being projected have helped?

If you look at other parties, even Congress, it too hasn’t projected chief ministerial candidates in previous polls. We ourselves, in 2014, did not project anyone in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana. We came to power and subsequently Devendra Fadnavis, Raghubar Das and Manohar Lal Khattar were made chief ministers, and in 2019 we had declared them as chief ministerial faces, still we lost Jharkhand. So these things are election-specific and are different in different circumstances, there is no formula.

BJP leaders have said that they will continue with the subsidy provided for power and water. Will that promise be adhered to, if you are voted to power?

Government is a continuous process and there is no reason why water and power subsidies will not continue. For example, ration cards have continued whichever is the government, there is no need to emphasise that.

The tone of the campaign has been very shrill and has seen many of your star campaigners being banned from campaigning by the Election Commission. Was this strictly necessary?

It happens in the heat of poll campaigns that some people can make certain statements.

You yourself termed Chief Minister Kejriwal a terrorist.

That’s not strictly true. I merely pointed out that Mr. Kejriwal has himself confessed he is an anarchist. All I said was that there was very little difference between an anarchist and terrorist.

The BJP raised the issue of Shaheen Bagh in a big way and also frame it as something that is not keeping with the Constitution?

It (Shaheen Bagh protests) is a live issue not only because traffic is disturbed, but also because the people of Delhi have seen, over the many years, the plight of refugees from across the border, how they had been treated. If you see some of the anarchist slogans being raised in Shaheen Bagh, it is unacceptable. For example, how can anyone accept the kind of speech and slogans that Sharjeel Islam has spoken. We (Union government) haven’t disturbed the dharna, and have handled it in a calm and peaceful manner. What the Prime Minister Modi said, that the protest is a “prayog” (experiment), is absolutely correct, because the idea of those behind the protests is to spread this across the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p7id16/article30754275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TH-THGRP-JAV-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/our-major-plank-in-delhi-polls-is-modis-governance-record-prakash-javadekar/article30754276.ece

48,2020/02/06,Bodo accord to bring Narendra Modi to Assam for first time since anti-CAA protests began,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Kokrajhar on Friday to attend an event to celebrate the signing of the Bodo Accord.

Mr. Modi thus will be able to do what a previous Prime Minister from the BJP, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, could not. The second Bodo Accord, signed in 2003, led to the creation of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), but Vajpayee, considered its catalyst, could not attend the ceremony to mark its formal signing that year. The first accord, signed in 1993, was considered toothless.

Mr. Modi’s visit will be the first to Assam since protests erupted against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last year. His summit with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in December in Guwahati was cancelled because of the protests, while he skipped the inaugural programme of the Khelo India Youth Games in January, notwithstanding an invitation from the BJP-led State government.

The protests have been minimal in the four districts of western and north-central Assam that make up the BTC. The Prime Minister, officials said, is unlikely to face any protests or black-flag demonstrations, which have dogged the visits of other BJP leaders, including Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, to other parts of the State.

Security forces have, however, intensified vigil in Kokrajhar after two improvised explosive devices were recovered 225 km to the west of Guwahati, barely 48 hours ahead of Mr. Modi’s scheduled visit.

Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) G.P. Singh said the IEDs were detected based on the statement of an arrested member of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent, headed by the elusive Paresh Baruah.

In a tweet around midnight on Wednesday, Mr. Singh said: “@GhtyCityPolice has made significant recovery of IEDs from Panbazar and Paltanbazar area. These were planted by ULFA to vitiate the peaceful environment in the State. We remain alert to evil designs of nefarious elements.”

Leaders of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) said volunteers of the union and other civil society organisations have been assisting the administration to ensure a smooth celebration of the signing of the third Bodo Peace Accord.

The ABSU was a signatory to the third accord in January along with three factions of the extremist National Democratic Front of Boroland and the United Bodo People’s Organisation.

The students’ union insisted that the PM’s visit was not poll-oriented. The elections to the BTC are due later this year while the Assembly election in Assam is a little more than a year away.

“It is nothing but a celebration of a historic accord by the entire Bodo society,” ABSU president Promod Boro asserted. “We are expecting more than 5 lakh people for the PM’s programme that is expected to trigger a slew of developmental projects in the Bodoland areas,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iogff3/article30067660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRICS-SUMMITLEADERSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bodo-accord-to-bring-pm-to-assam-for-first-time-since-caa-protests-began/article30753512.ece
49,2020/02/06,Only High Court can transfer Elgar Parishad case to NIA court: Defence,"A defence lawyer in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case argued on Thursday that only the High Court can transfer the case to the special NIA court.

A sessions court in Pune is hearing an application filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to transfer the case.

The agency moved the court after the Union government transferred the probe to the Central agency.

The NIA lawyer on Thursday sought transfer of case papers, seized data, court records and proceedings to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

Advocate Siddharth Patil, one of the defence lawyers, argued that as per Section 407 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a case can be transferred from one district to another only by the High Court.

“Not only the (main) chargesheet but supplementary chargesheet has been filed and we are in the middle of framing charges,” he said.

“This court does not have the power to transfer the case,” he argued.

Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar said she wanted a day’s time to argue on the NIA’s plea. Additional sessions judge S.R. Navandar then adjourned the hearing to Friday.

The Centre last month transferred the probe from Pune Police to the NIA, a decision which the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra criticised.

The case is related to speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, and the next day’s violence near the Koregaon Bhima war memorial in the district.

Pune Police claimed that the conclave was backed by Maoists, and the speeches made there triggered the violence.

During the probe, the police arrested Left-leaning activists Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao for alleged Maoist links.

50,2020/02/06,"PM Modi attacks Opposition for ‘misguiding, misinforming’ people on Citizenship law","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a blistering attack on Opposition parties on their attempt to “misguide and misinform” the nation on the new citizenship law, saying the Kerala Chief Minister was on one hand warning about extremist elements infiltrating anti-Citizenship (Amendmend) Act (CAA) protests and on the other his Party was supporting them in Delhi.

Replying to the debate in Rajya Sabha on a Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, he quoted statements made by Ram Manohar Lohia and Lal Bahadur Shastri on supporting minorities facing persecution in Pakistan.

“Is it ok to misguide and misinform the nation? Can anybody be a part of a campaign that does the same? The path being taken on CAA by many Opposition parties is unfortunate,” he said.

Mr. Modi said the Kerala Chief Minister has warned about extremists being involved in anti-citizenship law protests in the State but Left party members were supporting similar protests in the national capital.

He said there was an attempt to cover undemocratic activity under the garb of protests against the law. He went on to say that no one is going to get political benefit out of the protests.

He made the statements on protests against the new law, which seeks to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants of all faiths, except Muslims, from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who have come to India by December 31, 2014.

The 15.6 km-long railway link connects Gangasagar in Bangladesh to Nischintapur in India (10.6 km) and from Nischintapur to Agartala railway station (5.46km).

The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) is bearing the cost for laying the track on the 5.46km Indian side and the cost of laying the 10.6 km-long track on the Bangladesh side is being borne by the Ministry of External Affairs, the officials said.

Indian Railway Construction Company Limited (IRCON) is the executing agency for construction of the project on both sides and ₹580 crore has been sanctioned for the Indo-Bangla railway work in the Indian side.

Work is in progress in full swing in the Indian side and we hope to complete it before September 2021. The process for acquisition of land is complete and the land has been handed over to IRCON, Raman Singla, Deputy Chief Engineer of IRCON International Limited, told PTI.

A district magistrate-level meeting of three districts of Bangladesh and Tripura have reviewed the progress of the Agartala-Akhaura railway line on Wednesday.

57,2020/02/06,Sabarimala review case: Supreme Court reserves order on issue of reference of question of law to larger Bench,"The Kerala government on Thursday objected to the Supreme Court keeping the Sabarimala review case in limbo till a nine-judge Bench is done examining questions referred to it on the constitutionality of essential religious practices followed by multiple faiths.

The government apprehends the possibility of the case being reopened if the nine-judge Bench ends up declaring new law in the future. Such a turn of events may even lead to the upending of the September 28, 2018 majority judgment of a Constitution Bench, which had declared the prohibition of entry of women aged between 10 and 50 years as unconstitutional and discriminatory.

CJI defends Gogoi Bench’s reference

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde, heading the nine-judge Bench, however, defended the November 14, 2019 reference made by a five-judge Sabarimala Review Bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi. “By making this reference order [on November 14], the Bench [led by Justice Gogoi] has not prejudicially affected anybody's rights. It may be the most innovative idea, but it has not affected any rights,” he said.

The Bench reserved orders on the issue whether the Review Bench could have referred other questions of law to a larger Bench. The CJI said the order would be pronounced on February 10.

The Kerala government, represented by senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, contended that the Review Bench could not have made the November 14 reference to a larger Bench before completing its assigned task. Review jurisdiction of the court was limited to judgment under review while a reference to a larger Bench leads to the declaration of new law. Review and reference were like chalk and cheese. The Gogoi Bench could not have walked both, it argued.

A review of the Sabarimala case only entailed examining whether the September 2018 judgment was wrong. Now, the reference may mean this nine-judge Bench is declaring new law in cases like Sabarimala. How can a new law be retrospectively used on an already decided case?, Mr. Gupta said.

“But if a larger Bench lays down new law, the Review Bench would have to follow that law,” the CJI responded.

“Exactly, that is why I am saying the Sabarimala review should not be kept pending,” Mr. Gupta submitted.

Senior advocate Fali Nariman, who had intervened, agreed with the Kerala government, saying “when a review petition is pending, the idea is to hear it”.

On November 14 last, the Gogoi Bench, in a majority judgment, did not decide the Sabarimala review cases before it. Instead, it went on to frame “larger issues” concerning essential practices of various religions. It further clubbed other pending cases on subjects as varied as female genital mutilation among the Dawoodi Bohras to the entry of Parsi women who married inter-faith into the fire temple and Muslim women into mosques and referred them all to a larger Bench. The reference order also asked the larger Bench to consider the Rule pertaining to the prohibition of entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala temple. Chief Justice Bobde, who succeeded Justice Gogoi as top judge, set up a nine-judge Bench to hear the reference.

But the reference hit a bump on Monday when Mr. Nariman objected to it. He had argued that the court cannot declare law in thin air.

On Thursday, Mr. Nariman argued, “Fundamental [to judicial process] is you apply law to the facts of cases and not decide the law before looking into the facts... Never indulge in the exposition of law outside the realm of the facts of the case.”

He said the Gogoi Bench's sole task was to review the Sabarimala judgment of September 2018. The major ground for seeking a review was the finding in the September 2018 judgment that Ayyappa devotees do not form a separate religious denomination. On November 14, the Review Bench recorded no errors apparent or miscarriage of justice in the 2018 Sabarimala verdict.

“When Ayyappa devotees was not found to be a separate denomination, then these reference questions on Article 25 [religious freedom] are purely an academic exercise. It was not necessary to raise these hypothetical questions in reference. The President, and not the CJI, consults the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution on questions of law and facts,” he argued.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan agreed that review jurisdiction did not include “framing a catalogue of questions randomly”.

“But what if judges have a doubt? They refer it to a larger Bench. Are you saying the President can refer questions of law to the Supreme Court, but judges cannot?” senior advocate A.M. Singhvi countered.

To the Kerala government's submissions, Mr. Singhvi said, “What if another Bench refers these questions to this nine-judge Bench, which answers them. Can the five-judge Bench, which will resume the Sabarimala review, ignore a law laid down by the nine-judge Bench?""

Senior advocate K. Parasaran said the Supreme Court, as the highest court of the land, has unlimited jurisdiction. The fact that it was reviewing Sabarimala judgment did not preclude it from referring other questions of law and cases with similar issues to a larger Bench.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta contended that the objections raised against the November 14 reference to a larger Bench was based on “inherently faulty premise”. ""To say that a Review Bench cannot refer questions of law to larger Bench is absolutely absurd... No technical fetter prevents the Supreme Court from doing complete justice”, he said. He referred to how the Section 377 IPC matter (decriminalisation of homosexuality case) was referred for a fresh examination at the curative stage.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egsxj2/article30679238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sabarimala-case-sc-reserves-order-on-issue-of-reference-of-question-of-law-to-larger-bench/article30751565.ece
58,2020/02/06,"Path chosen by you can lead to anarchy, Narendra Modi cautions Opposition","Putting up a strong defence of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in both Houses of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday cautioned that the ongoing protests might lead to a situation of anarchy and asked what would happen if people in the Opposition-ruled States refused to obey laws enacted by their own Assemblies.

Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address to Parliament, he accused the Opposition of instigating people and sought to assure members that no Indian citizen would be impacted by the CAA.

He contended that the Congress was creating a kalpanik vai (an imagined fear), something, he said, Pakistan had been doing to mislead Indian Muslims.

‘Routine exercise’

In the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Modi said the National Population Register (NPR) had been introduced by the UPA government in 2010 and argued that the Congress was now misleading people despite its being a ‘routine administrative exercise’ that was used to identify the beneficiaries of government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Opposing the NPR was similar to “opposing the poor beneficiaries”, he said.

“This path will create problems for you [the Congress] as well as the country. I am issuing this warning because we should all be concerned about the country. If the Rajasthan Assembly passes a law but none in Rajasthan is ready to obey it, take out processions and resort to violence... your government [the Congress] is there...What will be the situation? In Madhya Pradesh, you are there. If the M.P. Assembly takes a decision and the people of the State go against it... Can the country run like this? Should we go on the path to anarchy,” Mr. Modi asked in the Lok Sabha.

In a scathing attack in the Lower House on the Congress’s style of functioning, the Prime Minister said India would never have been able to abrogate Article 370, solve the Ram Janmabhoomi title dispute or ban triple talaq if he had followed the same path as the Congress governments.

He also hit out at Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) politicians, such as Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and Farooq Abdullah, contending that their detention was a fallout of the fact that they had tried to instigate the people to rebel, while his government had faith in the Kashmiris.

Describing Kashmir as India’s “crown jewel”, he said J&K had seen a massive push in development work.

Mr. Modi, who spoke for 1 hour 38 minutes, mostly targeted the Congress, holding it responsible for the Partition, the imposition of the Emergency in 1975 and the anti-Sikh riots.

“For someone’s aspiration to become the Prime Minister of India, a line was drawn on the map and India was divided into two. After the Partition, the way how Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities were persecuted is unimaginable,” he said, without naming Jawaharlal Nehru.

Mr. Modi, however, chose to extensively quote India’s first Prime Minister to defend the CAA and cited a letter written by Mr. Nehru to the first Chief Minister of Assam Gopinath Bordoloi, on the need to differentiate between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants.

“Was Nehruji communal? Did he want to create a Hindu Rashtra? I want to ask the Congress,” he asked.

In the Rajya Sabha, he cited statements by Lal Bahadur Shastri and a November 25, 1947, resolution of the Congress Working Committee to support his arguments.

“I don’t believe the Congress was communal on November 25, 1947, and is secular now,” he said. Referring to the ongoing protests against the CAA, Mr. Modi said the “students should ask themselves” if they should support “misinformation”. In a bid to lighten the mood, he said he was inspired by Rajya Sabha chairperson M. Venkaiah Naidu, who is known for using rhymes and acronyms in his speeches, when he quipped “those who used to be silent are now violent”.

Before walking out in protest, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that while the Congress “supports” citizenship for Hindu refugees, it opposes the law that determines it on the basis of religion.

Taking a dig at the party’s ‘Save the Constitution’ campaign, Mr. Modi said the Congress would do well to remember it a 100 times a day since they were the ones who imposed Emergency, arbitrarily dismissed elected governments, tried to take away the power of judicial review from the judiciary, set up the Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) to function as “a remote control” to the Manmohan Singh-led government, while Rahul Gandhi had torn up a copy of an ordinance.

Invoking the contributions of stalwarts like Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Ashfaqullah Khan, Begum Hazrat Mahal and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Mr. Modi claimed that while the Congress looked at them as ‘only Muslims’ his government looked at them as Indians.

“I had the great privilege to touch the feet of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan at a very young age,” he said.

Economic aims

Addressing concerns raised by Rajya Sabha MPs about the condition of the Indian economy, Mr. Modi asserted that there was “no need to despair” as the “fundamentals of the economy are strong”. Stating that the country was aiming to be a $5 trillion economy, he said there could be no progress by “thinking small”.

Responding to the Opposition saying that he used to oppose the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax as Gujarat Chief Minister, Mr. Modi said he had addressed the issues he had raised then when he became Prime Minister.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q7oaq9/article30750416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06NARENDRA-MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/path-chosen-by-you-can-lead-to-anarchy-narendra-modi-cautions-opposition/article30750417.ece
59,2020/02/06,Nirbhaya case: Supreme Court to hear Centre’s appeal on February 7,"The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to urgently list an appeal filed by the Central government challenging the Delhi High Court’s rejection of its plea to separately execute the death sentence of the Nirbhaya gang rape convicts.

A Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana, on an urgent mentioning by the government, said the special leave petition would be listed before an appropriate Bench on February 7 for hearing.

The Centre had challenged a January 31, 2020 decision of the Sessions Court to postpone the issuance of fresh death warrants against the four Nirbhaya convicts, especially Mukesh Singh, whose mercy petition had been declined by the President on January 17. It argued in the apex court that, under the Delhi Prison Rules of 2018, the pendency of legal remedies or mercy petitions of other co-convicts would have no bearing on the fate of a convict whose plea for mercy has already been rejected.

The government contended that the 2018 Rules do not prohibit the execution of the death sentence of co-convicts, one by one, on the rejection of their respective mercy petitions. It said that deferring the execution of the death sentence of all the four convicts, specifically when Mukesh’s mercy plea had been dismissed by the President, had led to “gross miscarriage of justice” to the victim’s family as well as society as a whole. The convicts were taking the judicial process for a ride.

The High Court judgment, however, held that the 2018 Rules observe that the pendency of any application filed by one convict would necessarily require the postponement of the death sentence of all his co-convicts, even those whose mercy plea had been rejected.

The court said there could not be a situation whereby one convict “swings” and the others’ lives are later spared by the President. Commutation of the death penalty of a fellow convict was a ground for filing fresh mercy petition after all, it reasoned. The convicts have to be executed together and not separately, it held.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9frbgr/article30742637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRBHAYACASEVERDICTPATIALACOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-to-hear-centres-appeal-on-friday/article30748642.ece
60,2020/02/06,Difficult to collect data of Bangladeshis living illegally: Centre,"The Centre on Wednesday informed the Rajya Sabha that it is “not possible to collect accurate data” of Bangladeshis living illegally in various parts of the country since their entry is “clandestine and surreptitious.”

Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said in a written reply that last year 1,351 illegal immigrants were apprehended along the Bangladesh border and handed over to the Bangladeshi authorities. Till January 27, as many as 83 illegal immigrants were caught. In the years 2017 and 2018, the number of such illegal immigrants apprehended and handed over to Bangladesh stood at 1,175 and 1,118 respectively.

The highest number of illegal immigrants — 992, 900, 1167 and 74 in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (till January 27) — were apprehended from areas along the West Bengal border.

“As per limited data available, the number of Bangladeshi nationals who have overstayed in the country beyond the period of their visa validity after entering India legally during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is 25,942, 49,645 and 35,055 respectively,” Mr. Rai said.

“Illegal immigrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in a clandestine and surreptitious manner. Detection, detention and deportation of such illegally staying foreign nationals, including Bangladeshi nationals, is an ongoing process. Since entry of such foreign nationals into the country is clandestine and surreptitious, it is not possible to collect accurate data of such Bangladeshi nationals living in various parts of the country,” Mr. Rai said.

‘Data not maintained’

On being asked about the the total number of refugees belonging to Hindu, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian and Sikh religions from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh currently residing in the country, Mr. Rai said in a written reply that India was not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereon and “data relating to foreign nationals claiming to be refugees and residing in India are not maintained centrally.”

62,2020/02/06,Bengal Governor hints at making changes to Assembly address,"West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday hinted that he could make changes to his speech that has been approved by the State Cabinet for his address to the Assembly before the start of the Budget session on February 7.

“A draft of the address has been made available to me after approval of the State Cabinet. That is under my consideration. If I leave one issue, or would like to make an addition, I will do it in a formal manner,” Mr. Dhankhar told journalists on the sidelines of an event at the Raj Bhavan.

Any departure from the speech approved by the Cabinet could trigger a fresh row, but Mr. Dhankhar said “the Governor and the State government should be accommodative of each other’s view”.

“Even if there are different points of view that cannot take us to a level of confrontation. That is (we have) to be accommodative of each other’s point of view, keeping only one thing in mind — rule of law, the Indian constitution and the welfare of the State, its people, and its development,” Mr. Dhankhar said.

64,2020/02/06,CPCB pulls up 14 coal plants,"The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has pulled up 14 thermal power plants for not complying with a December 31, 2019 deadline to limit sulphur dioxide emissions.

These are 5 plants in Haryana, 3 in Punjab, 2 in Uttar Pradesh, 2 in Andhra Pradesh, 2 in Telangana and 1 in Tamil Nadu with a total capacity of approx 15 GW that have missed the deadline.

Phased-approach

To limit particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide emission from thermal plants, India put in place a phased-approach that directs 440 coal-fired units — responsible for about 166,000 MW of power — to put in place measures to limit pollution by December 2022.

However 11 plants in a 300 km radius of Delhi were to comply by December 31, 2019 because of the poor air quality in the city as well as the surrounding Gangetic plain.

Some of them claimed to have set in place the process for acquiring flu-gas desulphurisation technology where as others said they were yet to award tenders. Only one of these plants has actually implemented technology to limit emissions.

Plea in NGT

Non-compliance by the thermal power plants is an ongoing dispute being contested at the National Green Tribunal through a petition filed in April 2017.

There is an ongoing case in the Supreme Court regarding the extensions given to these plants.

The 14 plants have been given until the end of this month to explain to the CPCB why they have not complied with the norms and why action should not be taken.

The CPCB has the power to impose steep fines or shut a unit under the provisions of the Environment Protection Act.

As per Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) estimates, these norms can help reduce PM emissions by about 35%, NOx emission by about 70%, and SO2 emissions by more than 85% by 2026-27 against a business-as-usual scenario with no pollution control technologies.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qc6ic5/article30745053.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6TH-SMOKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpcb-pulls-up-14-coal-plants/article30745054.ece
65,2020/02/06,Navy to get third Scorpene submarine in December,"The third Scorpene submarine, Karanj, will be delivered to the Indian Navy by December and all six submarine deliveries would be completed by 2022, Nicolas de La Villemarque, Vice President India, Asia and Pacific of Naval Group, said on Wednesday.

Mr. Villemarque said discussions were on to fit Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) modules on all Scorpenes beginning 2023. “The Scorpene submarine has the ability to be equipped with an AIP system. The first AIP will be equipped during the first refit of the first Scorpene,” he said in a conversation with The Hindu at Defexpo 2020, which began here on Wednesday.

Talks were underway with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) and the Navy. A design agreement was expected to be signed with the DRDO by the year end, he stated.

Karanj was launched into water in January 2018 and is currently in advanced stages of sea trials. The first Scorpene, Kulvari, was commissioned in 2018 and it would go for a normal refit after six years in 2023, during which time time the AIP would be installed. Second Scorpene Khanderi was inducted in September last.

An indigenous fuel cell-based AIP module is currently under development by the DRDO. The project reached a milestone in October 2019 with the successful operation of a land-based prototype engineered to the form-and-fit of a submarine. The DRDO has expressed confidence that the module will be ready in time for installation on Kulvari.

An AIP module gives stealth and extended endurance to diesel-electric submarines by allowing them to stay submerged longer.

Mr. Villemarque said they would do design simulations to “work out the technicalities of the project which involves Jumboisation, the process of cutting, joining and putting various blocks together.”

Project-75I

Naval Group is among the five Original Equipment Manufactures (OEM) shortlisted for the Navy’s project for advanced submarines under Project-75I being processed through the Strategic Partnership (SP) model of defence procurement. MDL and Larsen & Tourbo are the two Indian companies shortlisted under it and the Request For Proposal (RFP) would be issued to them.

Mr. Villemarque said they awaited a interest from the Indian companies to discuss potential tie-ups. “Our submarine is bespoked to the Indian Navy requirements. It was based in both Scorpene and Barracudda class platforms,” he added.

The Naval Group last month responded to the Navy’s long-pending tender for heavy weight torpedoes, which would equip the Scorpenes.

Delayed plan

Earlier, the Navy planned to install AIP modules on the last two of the six Scorpenes as they rolled out of the production line. However, it could not be realised due to developmental delays.

The Air India subsidiary Alliance Air has been given ex-post facto permission to connect Chennai with Palaly in Jaffna and Batticaloa.

The flight services from Chennai to Palaly were launched in November last year. Flights to Batticaloa are likely to be announced on February 7, a day before the Sri Lankan Prime Minister meets PM Modi here.

The special dispensation has been allowed until the airline acquires a fleet size of 20 planes, according to a press statement. The airline has 19 aircraft comprising 70-seater ATR 72s and 40-seater ATR 42s.

Mr. Chidambaram made these remarks while delivering the keynote lecture at the formal launch of a collection of essays, Vision for a Nation: Path and Perspectives, edited by Ashish Nandy and Prof Akash S Rathore.

Former Vice President Hamid Ansari and former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh were present at the launch along with CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

The book is the first in a series of books, under the aegis of Samruddha Bharat Foundation (SBF), containing essays from some of the biggest intellectuals as part of a project to develop ideas and themes that is being called as ‘Rethink India’.

“If you call yourself a secular today, there are people who will call you anti-national. There are people who will say you are speaking the language of Pakistan. If you are secular, your patriotism is in question. And many of these people will also have their citizenship questioned. That is the point of danger we seem to have arrived at in the last few years,”he said.

The former Finance Minister said that while the founding fathers had laid the basis of a Constitutional citizenship, now the idea of citizenship is being linked to race, language, culture and religion.

“If this definition is applied, many of us will become diminished citizens,”he said and added that ‘earlier it was part of theoretical ideas of the Hindu right like V D Savarkar and M S Golwalkar, but now it is part of the political project of the government’.

Referring to the on-going protests against the citizenship amendment act (CAA), Mr Chidambaram drew parallels with Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience.

“I am very that people who we thought will not come out of their homes, will not come out too the streets, will come out to brave the cold, water cannons and lathis are now actually practising civil disobedience of Gandhi ji,”he said.

69,2020/02/06,Theater command system under CDS faces teething problems,"The much needed integration of the armed forces under the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to fight modern wars efficiently, is facing teething problems, especially under a budding theater command system.

During a media conference on Tuesday, General Bipin Rawat, India’s first CDS, declared that the formation of theater commands, for joint operations by pooling assets of individual service arms, would be completed in the next three years.

The Air Defence Command, with hubs in Mumbai, Guwahati and Port Blair, combining aviation hardware drawn from the three services—Army, Navy and the Air Force--would be first to kick off.

“A study team is preparing the road map for creation of an Air Defence Command,” the Rajya Sabha was told on February 3 in response to a question.

Two theater commands—the Northern Theater Command and the Eastern Theater Command --are expected to be formed facing China. Another two tri-service commands, including the western theater command, could be deployed along the border with Pakistan. Analysts say that the chances of a two-front war with China and Pakistan are remote, but Indian military planners are looking at all possible contingencies.

Gen. Rawat revealed that a Peninsula Command would be formed to counter threats along the maritime borders. The Navy would have a larger role to cover the broader Indian Ocean Region (IOR) domain, starting from East Africa, the Malacca Straits and Australia.

The tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command has already been in place since 2001, with primary focus on the IOR. The Strategic Forces Command, another tri-service institution, is in operational command of nuclear weapons.

With a massive restructuring of the armed forces taking place, the process of the formation of theater commands is facing initial hiccups. “There is a major issue of command and control, which is yet to be resolved. Unlike the United States where the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the operational fount, the CDS does not head operations, which are being handled by separately by the three service chiefs and their branches. This can lead to practical issues of coordination during hostilities” a former aviator, who did not wish to be named, said.

China has also adopted a theater command system since 2016, steered by its Central Military Commission.

The Indian Air Force (IAF), apprehending that its limited number of planes, helicopters and other assets could be locked into theater commands, is engaged in internal discussions over the impending military reforms. “ We are all for jointness under the theater command system, but it should not compromise the IAF’s overall responsibility of safeguarding Indian skies,” a former senior air force official said.

He pointed out that the IAF has the unique advantage of swiftly rotating from one combat theater to another, allowing fuller utilisation of limited assets. “If assets get locked into dedicated theater command without the force becoming bigger, this can compromise operations,” he said.

During his press conference, General Rawat made it plain that the IAF should stagger its expensive big ticket purchases of fighters and other assets. He also stressed that better “management” of available resources should be the focus, rather than expectations of larger military budgets. The former army chief has repeatedly spotlighted the importance of breaking silos and sharing assets available with the three services, especially to streamline logistics.

Focusing on cost-cutting, General Rawat proposed slashing bloated pension funds by increasing retirement age of soldiers to 58, by moving them into roles, where peak physical fitness may not be required.

But the proposal has been met with some scepticism in influential quarters. “Discussions required. Soldiers' retirement age should be increased. But lesson learnt in Kargil war, physical fitness cannot be comprised either. Important in mountains...” Tweeted former Army Chief, Ved Malik.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oookok/article30607996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBIPINRAWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/theater-command-system-under-cds-faces-teething-problems/article30746703.ece
70,2020/02/06,Supreme Court panel recommends several prison reforms,"Every new prisoner should be allowed a free phone call a day to his family members to see him through his first week in jail.

This is among the several recommendations — besides modern cooking facilities, canteens to buy essential items and trial through video-conferencing — made by a Supreme Court-appointed committee to reform prisons.

The 300-page report was taken up for hearing on Wednesday before a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, who asked amicus curiae Gaurav Agarwal to study the report.

‘Common bane’

The court said overcrowding is a common bane in the under-staffed prisons. Both the prisoner and his guard equally suffer human rights violation. The undertrial prisoner, who is yet to get his day in court, suffers the most, languishing behind bars for years without a hearing.

The Justice Amitava Roy (retd.) Committee concluded that most prisons are “teeming with undertrial prisoners”, whose numbers are highly disproportionate to those of convicts. It said there should be at least one lawyer for every 30 prisoners. This is not the case now. Speedy trial remains one of the best ways to remedy the unwarranted phenomenon of over-crowding.

The Prison Department has a perennial average of 30%-40% vacancies.

“The shortage has lingered over the years,” the report said.

Another recommendation is for the use of video-conferencing for trial. “Physical production in courts continued, which however remains far below the aspired 100% in several States, mainly because of unavailability of sufficient police guards for escort and transportation,” it said.

‘Primitive and arduous’

The report described the preparation of food in kitchens as “primitive and arduous”. The kitchens are congested and unhygienic and the diet has remained unchanged for years now.

The court had in September 2018 appointed the Justice Roy Committee to examine the various problems plaguing prisons, from overcrowding to lack of legal advice to convicts to issues of remission and parole.

Besides Justice Roy, a former Supreme Court judge, the members included an IG, Bureau of Police Research and Development, and the DG (Prisons), Tihar Jail.

The decision was in reaction to a letter written by former Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti highlighting the overcrowding of prisons, unnatural deaths of prisoners, gross inadequacy of staff and the lack of trained staff.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/llfaax/article28138351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THiStock-108269216,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-panel-recommends-several-prison-reforms/article30746675.ece
71,2020/02/06,"Relax norms for issue of ration cards to farmers in backward districts, govt. urged","Leaders of Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham on Thursday urged the government to relax norms for issue of white ration cards to farmers in the backward and drought-prone districts of the State.

In a statement, sangham president Y. Kesav Rao and general secretary P. Peddireddy referred to the guidelines for issue of ration cards and said it was decided to deny white ration cards to the farmers who owned 10 acres of land. They said drought and the resultant migration and suicides by farmers was a perennial issue in nine districts of the State. The government should consider relaxation of this rule for farmers of these districts, they said.

They also wanted the government to initiate steps for immediate release of compensation for crop damage, due for payment to farmers for last two years, input subsidy and the amount due towards subsidies on maize and groundnut crops. They said farmers were also waiting for crop insurance money and effective measures from the government side to ensure that the prices of crops like mirchi did not crash.

Stir on February 13

In protest against the ‘raw deal’ meted out to the farm sector in the 2020-21 Union Budget recently presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Akhila Bharata Kisan Coordination Committee called for a nation-wide agitation on February 13, they said.

72,2020/02/06,"Jagan launches website,Rythu Bharosa logo","Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has launched a logo of Rythu Bharosa centres and a website. The website acts as a platform to buy seeds through the Rythu Bharosa centres. The onus lies on the government to meet the expectations of the farmers that quality seeds were supplied to them. Ensure that irregularities do not take place in the supply of seeds, he said at a review meeting on Agri Mission on Thursday.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to display the list of minimum support price (MSP) for each crop at procurement centres and also at village secretariats. The government intervention mandates if the farmer was being paid less than the price fixed. The payments to the farmers have to be made immediately after their produce was purchased. Also, verify and discuss with farmers regarding the price paid for their produce, on a weekly basis. The Agriculture Department should own the Rythu Bharosa centres and the Marketing Department has to focus its attention on godowns and cold storages, he said.

Suggesting the officials to encourage the farmers who do not use drugs/medicines to increase milk supply, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the milk can be marketed as ‘organic milk’ by increasing the remunerative prices suitably.

Legal cell

Responding to the Chief Minister’s suggestion to take a serious view of the cases relating to the supply of spurious seeds, the officials said that a legal cell in the Agriculture Department was being established. There was a positive response from fertilisers and seeds companies. Reputed companies were satisfied with the decisions of the government. The Rythu Bharosa centres would provide a better opportunity to the companies, which were willing to sell the fertilisers and seeds at low prices. The bengal gram seeds were being supplied in a big way as per the recommendations of the university, they said.

75,2020/02/06,IMA to hold awareness camps on coronavirus in Chittoor dist.,"The Indian Medical Association (Tirupati chapter) has embarked on a mission to spread awareness on the dreaded coronavirus at all mandal headquarters in Chittoor district, covering select educational institutions and villages.

Addressing a gathering of students and paramedical staff at the Government Degree College at Puttur on Thursday, the IMA Tirupati chapter president, Dr. Ravi Raju said that the key factor involved in tackling the coronavirus threat was to educate the masses not to panic, but to utilise all available precautions at the disposal of the district medical and health administration and the services of the IMA.

The IMA functionary said that going by the alarming number of casualties in China and detection of cases in India, the threat perception of its spread should not be ruled out, though the current level of incidence was not alarming. “Epidemics could be effectively tackled through the concerted efforts of the government authorities and general public,” he said.

Precautions

Ravi Raju said that people could avoid joining heavy congregations besides postponing tours to chilly areas, maintaining personal hygiene and approaching only qualified doctors when they are suffering from the general symptoms of fever, cold and cough as coronavirus is an epidemic, but required symptomatic treatment only.

At present, isolation wards were set up at the SVRR Hospital and SVIMS in Tirupati, government hospitals at Chittoor, Madanapalle and the area hospitals at Puttur, Nagari, Piler and Palamaner. “As it is not feasible to have such wards in primary health centres and cluster hospitals, the public should cooperate in this regard,” he said.

On Sunday (February 9), the IMA and the AP Government Doctors’ Association (Chittoor unit) would be jointly organising a CME (Continuing Medical Education) programme on coronavirus threat at SVRR Hospital, Dr. Ravi Raju said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ima-to-hold-awareness-camps-on-coronavirus-in-chittoor-dist/article30753529.ece

77,2020/02/06,Insider trading in Amaravati land purchases: CID begins filing FIRs,"The plot in the irregularities in land purchases in the Amaravati region - before the formal announcement of the Capital - seems to be getting murkier, and how. The AP CID says it has now collected direct evidence against some persons, who owned land in Amaravati, of obtaining white ration cards using forged documents.

The CID claims it has already identified 797 white ration card holders, including 268 PAN Card holders who were involved in transactions in 761.34 acres covering Amaravathi, Pedakakani, Tadikonda, Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli mandals, whose open market value is ₹ 291.34 crore, while the sale deed value alone is ₹ 38.56 crore. The market values have been certified by Mandal Revenue Officers of these three mandals.

Falsification and forgery

The CID has booked four FIRs on Thursday in Krishna district against those who have been owning land in Amaravati and who have obtained white ration cards in Penamaluru, Poranki and Yanamalakuduru village near Vijayawada. Among them are a retired railway employee, the spouse of a employee of a PSU Bank, etc.

Basing on a complaint by Tahsildar of Penamaluru, the CID has booked a case against Pollineni Kondala Rao, a native of Yenamalakuduru village near Vijayawada. The accused has been charged with obtaining a white ration card (WAP 0618005A0320) meant for BPL families by submitting fabricated documents. The CID says it has collected evidence of the accused possessing 1.08 acres of land in Nelapadu village in Thullur mandal and after giving his land under the Land Pooling Scheme, he has been given a residential plot of 1,078 sq. yards a 200-sq. yard commercial plot, out of which he has sold 330 sq. yards and built a house in Yanamalakuduru. “While obtaining a white ration card, the accused had concealed this information,” the CID said.

Government employees accused

It has booked cases under sections 177, 403, 420, 468, 471, 120 (B) of IPC.

In another instance, the CID has booked one Abdul Jamadhar of obtaining a white ration card (WAP 0618021800040). A native of Ganguru village in Pemamaluru mandal, Mr. Jamadhar has bought one acre of land at Rayapudi village. The accused was found to have a two-storeyed duplex house in Kanuru village.

In another instance, Mandava Nagamani, a native of Penamaluru village, obtained a white ration card (WAP 0629013A0193), and had purchased 0.95 cents in Venkatapalem. She was found to already have a house in Padmanabhapuram in Poranki village. Bollineni Nagalakshmi, a retired railway employee, was also in the list of white ration card holders, who had purchased land in Amaravati.

Land and lucre

Further, Bhukya Nagalakshmi, a PSU bank employee, was also among the list of white ration card holders. She was found to have possessed 0.25 acres in Nelapadu, while her spouse is an assistant engineer in VTPS, Ibrahimpatnam.

Based on this, the CID has written to respective collectors to cancel the white ration cards of the accused and initiate a probe into how they had secured them. The probe will also include those who have made benami purchases of huge chunks of land.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/insider-trading-in-amaravati-land-purchases/article30752620.ece

A report by a news agency said KIA Motors India, through its sister company Hyundai, was in talks with Tamil Nadu (TN) government officials to shift the factory - that was inaugurated last year in Penukonda Assembly constituency - to some place in TN. When The Hindu contacted the Minister, he said he had talked to KIA Motors officials on Thursday and got a clarification that there was no such proposal.

A political ploy

Member of Parliament Gorantla Madhav representing Hindupur Lok Sabha constituency told The Hindu from Delhi that he will meet Union Industries Minister on Thursday to take up the issue and get a clarification. “Andhra Pradesh government has given so many concessions to KIA and nurtured it like a baby by providing water from Gollapalli Reservoir, close to 600 acres of land and invested in levelling of land etc., At this stage we do not expect the company to shift to another State like a grown up boy,” Mr. Madhav observed.

“The YSRCP government headed by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been working towards improving the investment atmosphere in the State. It is just a political ploy by some Opposition leaders to take away the credit from Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he added.

EVs from same facility

Mr. Sankara Narayana said: “KIA Motors had announced manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (EVs)from this facility and were steadfast on that too and were not looking to shift any of the existing facilities from Andhra Pradesh.” On providing jobs to locals, the company had originally committed to 80 per cent jobs at the time of signing the MoU with A.P. and has been taking all eligible persons for which a skill development centre is being set up.

Meanwhile, Special Chief Secretary, Industries, Investments and Commerce, Rajath Bhargava in a statement said: “The Reuters news is not true. KIA Motors and the Government of A.P. are working together. We strongly condemn the news.”

The report was submitted before a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, during the hearing on a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the court based on a letter by All-India Lawyers’ Union, Karnataka, on the incident of electrocution of five boys in a government hostel at Bannikatti in Koppal district on August 18, 2019.

“The reports show that in most of the hostels run by the State there is no supply of basic amenities like hygienic food, cot, bed, bedsheets, drinking water, electricity connection, clean toilet, water for bathing, etc. Most of the hostels are reported to have unhygienic kitchen and low quality food is being supplied to the children. Drinking water is not available in a major number of hostels inspected in these districts,” stated advocate B.V. Vidhyulatha, who is the amicus curiae appointed by the court for this case, in a memo.

The amicus curiae also presented the reports of inspections of government hostels carried out by the DLSA in Bidar and Koppal districts as a sample to narrate the state of affairs of government hostels in the State.

Following this, the Bench directed the government to submit the gist of the survey, conducted by the district-level committees appointed by the State government as per the court’s October 30, 2019 order, of hostels in Bidar and Kalaburagi where the DLSA had pointed out that students, including girls in some hostels, were going outside the hostels to ease themselves.

In its statement, the government stated that the survey was carried out by the committees headed by Chief Executive Officer of the zilla pancyayat of the respective district, and the process of survey was concluded only on February 5 while seeking time to collate the details of the survey and submit them to the court.

Perhaps responding to the growing clamour for senior Ministers, who have enjoyed power in all governments and “non-performers” to be dropped to accommodate new faces, the State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel asked ministerial aspirants to be patient as they would get “their chance” as the party was planning a major reshuffle later, without giving a time frame.

However, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had been trying to broker peace with aspirants till the eve of expansion, promising a reshuffle in July, when his government completes a year in office. Seven seats in the Legislative Council will also fall vacant by June last week. That is when disqualified MLAs can be made MLCs and later, Ministers. Mr. Yediyurappa has reportedly promised to drop several senior Ministers to accommodate new faces.

The BJP had to drop its decision to induct three leaders from among BJP old-timers due to growing dissidence among aspirants who banded together and held multiple meetings, arguing for regional and caste representation. G.H. Thippareddy, senior MLA from Chitradurga, on Thursday said that Bengaluru and Belagavi had taken up half of the Cabinet at the cost of other regions.

Over 10 MLAs from Kalyana Karnataka held multiple meetings demanding more ministries to their region. MLAs from coastal Karnataka have also demanded a ministry. When quizzed of skewed regional representation, Mr. Yediyurappa had said that making newly elected party-hoppers Ministers, irrespective of other factors, was imperative as it was because of them the BJP government was formed. However, growing dissatisfaction among legislators of under-represented regions was considered a wake-up call to ensure it does not snowball into a bigger issue. The proposed reshuffle in July will ensure better regional and caste representation, sources said.

Lobbying for key portfolios

Hours after the expansion, lobbying intensified for key portfolios among the 10 new Ministers inducted on Thursday.

Ramesh L. Jarkiholi has demanded he be allotted Water Resources ministry that held by his political foe D.K. Shivakumar during the coalition government. However, the Chief Minister is still wary of allotting him the ministry, as it involves handling complex inter-state disputes and legal fight on behalf of the State.

B.C. Patil has reportedly sought to be made Home Minister. S.T. Somashekhar and B.A. Basavaraja have reportedly sought to be allotted Bengaluru Development and Urban Development ministries. However, the Chief Minister has reportedly said allotment of portfolios would be done after consultation with the party high command.

Present and absent

A.H. Vishwanath and R. Shankar, disqualified MLAs who were not made Ministers and are reportedly unhappy, drew attention by being part of the swearing-in ceremony. However, many BJP leaders were conspicuous by their absence. Senior BJP leaders Umesh Katti and C.P. Yogeshwar, who were expected to be inducted into the Cabinet till Wednesday evening when the party decided against it, did not attend the ceremony at Raj Bhavan. Senior ministers B. Sriramulu and K.S. Eshwarappa were also not present. Mr. Sriramulu said he was away because he was busy.

‘In the name of...’

All 10 MLAs who were sworn in as Cabinet-rank Ministers on Thursday took oath in the name of God. Additionally, A. Shivaram Hebbar, B.C. Patil and K. Gopalaiah also took oath in the name of their parents. Mr. Hebbar and Mr. Patil mentioned voters of their constituencies. Mr. Patil cited 12th Century reformer-poet Basaveshwara. All, except Ramesh L. Jarkiholi, touched the feet of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Mr. Jarkiholi shook hands with the CM.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r1gbm4/article30755270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGMINISTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/next-karnataka-cabinet-reshuffle-expected-in-july/article30755271.ece
86,2020/02/06,nCoV scare: Planters may look for workers from other places,"The advisory to Kodagu coffee planters by the Health Department authorities to avoid bringing new workers from Kerala in the wake of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) scare is likely to have some impact on coffee picking activities.

In about 10-15 days, the pepper harvesting season would also commence and go on till April. These activities require a sizeable number of workers with a large cultivable area to cover.

Movement of workers between the borders has been a practice in the area. What difference it has made this time is the advisory after Kerala reported three confirmed cases of the virus and the border districts in the State, including Kodagu, had been kept on high alert, stepping up the surveillance.

Precautions

However, the planters were learnt to have resolved to comply with the health advisory and take precautions as recommended. “We are supporting the steps taken and cooperating with the district administration as well as the district health authorities,” said Vishwanath, Member, Codagu Planters’ Association, Madikeri.

Speaking to The Hindu over phone, the CPA member said the estates get migrant workers from Tamil Nadu and also from North Indian States in addition to Kerala. Usually, they (workers) stay put in the estates until the harvesting season gets over. “Workers belonging to towns in neighbouring Kerala sometimes go to their places and return. In the wake of the directive, we have told them not to make unnecessary visits and remain in the estates, taking precautions,” he said.

Harvesting of Robusta coffee is underway in Kodagu, Mr. Vishwanath added.

Surveillance on border

Meanwhile, the health authorities in Kodagu have urged the people living on the border not to travel to Kerala unless it’s indispensable. The advisory had been given as a precaution in view of the nCoV scare.

“It’s practically impossible to stop the people from paying visits to Kerala but we are sensitising them on why they are being advised against going to the neighbouring State if there was no urgent situation. The steps are meant not to create panic but educate them to be cautious and take essential precautions,” said Kodagu DHO K. Mohan.

Medical teams had been deployed at Makutta, Kutta and Karike on the inter-state border. The gram panchayats of these places had lent support to the Health Department in reaching out to the households with pamphlets on dos and don’ts.

“Our teams are educating the travelling public since many travel to the bordering towns in Kerala for work. We are not carrying out mass screening but checking history of people having cold, cough, fever etc., on whether they had been to China or to 23 coronavirus-affected countries. We look at whether they had been in contact with relatives or friends who had recently visited these countries. If they have a history, we treat them as suspected cases,” he explained.

So far, no suspected cases had been reported in Kodagu.

On the advisory to coffee planters on keeping workers from Kerala in estates, the DHO said, “It’s an appeal from us and we hope they will comply with it as we are told many labourers from Kerala are brought to the coffee plantations in Kodagu during the harvesting season.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/snthg9/article30755093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MYSCORONALED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ncov-scare-planters-may-look-for-workers-from-other-places/article30755095.ece
87,2020/02/06,Cabinet lacks social balance: Kumaraswamy,"Former Chief Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Kumaraswamy rued the inadequate representation of socially- backward castes and groups in the State Cabinet, which was expanded on Thursday.

He said there was disgruntlement among the BJP MLAs regarding this lack of “social balance” and was bound to implode within the party in the days ahead. This government is not stable by any means, said Mr. Kumaraswamy.

He said in the past, efforts were always made to be accommodative to provide due representation to castes that were socially-backward and make efforts to give voice to these communities. But, the BJP has made no such effort. Cabinet expansion underlines its apathy to the socially-backward castes and it is bound to hurt the BJP’s fortunes in future, he said.

‘BSY lacks freehand’

Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah maintained that Central leaders have kept Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa under their grip and had not given him a freehand to function although Cabinet expansion was his privilege as the State’s CM.

Speaking to reporters at H.D. Kote taluk, he said the Cabinet, despite expansion, was incomplete as Ministerial berths for six more departments had been vacant. “He (Mr. Yediyurappa) was denied assent for filling up these berths. I feel sorry for him. The Chief Minister lacks self-rule,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/w0a8qx/article30758844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGHDK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-lacks-social-balance-kumaraswamy/article30754712.ece
88,2020/02/06,"Doreswamy defies police, stages protest in front of the Bengaluru Town Hall","Freedom fighter and centenarian H.S. Doreswamy held a protest on the steps of Town Hall in the city on Thursday in defiance of the police. He said he would continue his protest on Friday as well, and has threatened to sit on a dharna in front of Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Zone, office for putting up hurdles for democratic protest.

Citizens’ Rights Action Committee, a group of individuals and organisations, had sought permission from the police to hold a protest, led by Mr. Doreswamy, against CAA on the steps of Town Hall. “The city Police Commissioner orally said we could go ahead and referred the petition to DCP (Central). We received an oral communication from the police that permission would be given for the venue on Wednesday afternoon,” said Jagan of the committee.

However, late Wednesday night, Mr. Doreswamy received a visit from police officials. “They said that permission had been denied as others had already been given permission during these days. But did the police not know that they had permission to others? I rejected the notice given to me and here I am,” Mr. Doreswamy told The Hindu from the steps of Town Hall.

Chetan Singh Rathore, DCP (Central), said the petition came to him only on Wednesday. “We had already given permission to two protests and two indoor programmes at Town Hall during these five days, which can’t be cancelled. I have permitted them to hold their protest from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday,” he said.

Protesters have sought permission to use Freedom Park for the next four days, but here, too, there appears be problems. “There are multiple protests scheduled at Freedom Park. We cannot allow an overnight protest. We will definitely accommodate them for a day,” said B.

89,2020/02/06,Bidar sedition case | Protesters pose 20 questions to police,"Around 40 people, including lawyers and members of civil society organisations, staged a protest at the police headquarters in Bengaluru on Thursday, condemning police action against students of Shaheen School in Bidar.

Police personnel have been visiting the school and questioning students after they staged a play against Citizenship (Amendment) Act. A teacher and parent have been arrested on the grounds that the play was seditious and inflammatory.

Protesters raised 20 questions that they wanted the police to answer, and have demanded that the police be sensitised about the Juvenile Justice Act and child rights norms. They submitted a representation to the Director-General of Police stating that the police action was in violation of the Act. “We were assured that the students would not be questioned again,” said the protesters.

Mohammed Tahir, a lawyer, said: “Despite outrage by civil society, they are questioning students. This clearly shows that the right- wing workers want to close down a minority institution.” Sharada K.S., State committee member, All-India Democratic Women’s Association, said the arrested should be released.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/protesters-pose-20-questions-to-police-on-bidar-sedition-case/article30753743.ece

91,2020/02/06,150th anniversary celebrations of University College begin,"Dharmadhikari of Kshetra Dharmasthala D. Veerendra Heggade on Thursday said University College, Mangaluru, and a few other government colleges have been able to remove misconceptions about government educational institutions with their quality education.

He was speaking after inaugurating the 150th anniversary celebrations of the UCM, established in 1868, here. Universities, Mr. Heggade said, should be knowledge dissemination centres and not mere information centres. He complimented UCM for being one among the former.

In his introductory address, UCM Principal M.A. Uday Kumar recalled the vivid history of the institution, including its teachers and students. The college that was almost becoming extinct was revived following efforts by its old student, the then Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily, and became a constituent college of Mangalore University in 1993, he said.

Earlier, the dignitaries inaugurated an exhibition narrating the history of UCM, and released a special postal cover and a souvenir.

92,2020/02/06,Farm labourer beaten up,"An agricultural labourer, belonging to a Scheduled Caste, was assaulted by six people including two forest guards after being tied to a tree near Hullemane in Sakleshpur taluk.

The incident came to light after the victim filed a complaint with Sakleshpur Rural Police on Wednesday. The police have registered the case under the SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, among others.

Murthy, the victim, was allegedly assaulted by Gangaraju Gowda, Some Gowda, Swamy, Lokesh Gowda, all residents of Hullemane, and two forest guards, whose names not shown in the complaint.

He told media that the accused stopped him while he was returning home after getting down from a private bus from Sakleshpur around 1 p.m. on Monday (February 3).

Accusing him of creating a fire in the forest area, they tied him to a tree and beat him up severely with belt and sticks. He has bruises all over his body. Later, two forest guards also joined the accused and they took his signature on a blank sheet of paper.

“I was returning home after work in Sakleshpur. I don’t know anything about the fire in the forest area. They blamed me and assaulted me. I was screaming for help, but they beat me for hours, before letting me go around 5 p.m.”, he said. His wife Prema took him to the government hospital in Sakleshpur, where he is undergoing treatment. Murthy’s family members have urged the police to take action against the accused.

Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests of Hassan, has refuted the allegations made against his staff. He told The Hindu that two guards reached the spot after they received information about the forest fire. “Our persons did not beat him up. They took his statement where he apologised for his actions.

93,2020/02/06,‘Manu Baligar should resign’,"Progressive writer and activist R.K. Hudgi has demanded the resignation of Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Manu Baligar, for what he called failing to protect the autonomy of the premier Kannada body. He was speaking at a session on Kalaburagi district - various aspects, held at the parallel venue in Ambedkar Bhavan.

“Being the KSP president, Mr. Baligar should have prevented the interference of the State government in the affairs of the autonomous institution when Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi tried to change the president of the Chikkamagaluru Sahitya Sammelana held at Sringeri,’’ Prof. Hudgi said.

“Later, Mr. Ravi stopped the funding for the Sammelana, but Mr. Baligar did not object to it. He should have protested against the government demanding that it carry out its obligation of releasing money to the KSP. But that did not happen. He only said he had written a letter to the government seeking money but it failed to elicit the required response. This is unacceptable of a person who is heading the KSP.’’

“I demand that Mr. Baligar resign immediately after the Sammelana,’’ he said.

“When the Sringeri police stopped the Sammelana on the second day, after creating a fake threat about some anti-social elements planning to hurl petrol bombs, Mr. Baligar did not complain to the Chikkamagaluru SP. He should have lobbied with Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai to ensure that they were arrested and that the Sammelana went on as planned. But this did not happen. That is very sad. Kannadigas did not elect Mr. Baligar for the purpose of following the orders of the government,’’ Prof. Hudgi said.

“Some people are arguing that we should listen to the government and obey its orders, however unjust, because it funds the KSP and the Sammelanas. But this is not correct. They are not paying money out of their pocket. The money is pooled by the taxpayers to be given to cultural organisations like KSP. The government does not own the KSP. The KSP has no obligation to obey the orders of those who rule the state,’’ he said.

“I suspect that Mr. Baligar has chosen H.S. Venkatesh Murthy as the president of the Sammelana at the behest of Mr. Ravi,’’ Prof Hudgi said. He urged writers and thinkers to condemn what he called the high-handedness of the government in cultural affairs.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/manu-baligar-should-resign/article30749657.ece
94,2020/02/06,Analysis: Congress facing caste conundrum in appointment of KPCC chief,"The Congress high command seems to be taking no chances with Karnataka and is carefully considering candidates from all castes for the appointment of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president’s post. A decision on this has been deferred for nearly two months.

Meanwhile, leaving no stone unturned, seers, leaders and legislators of Karnataka’s two dominant castes — Lingayats and Vokkaligas — are lobbying hard to get the party’s coveted post in the State since the resignation of incumbent KPCC chief Dinesh Gundu Rao, MLA and former Minister, who took the decision after the party’s debacle in the Assembly bypolls.

Since the party’s future prospects in the State largely depends on the Congress president and the stature of the person chosen to fill the post, the central leaders of the party are weighing all options, particularly the caste combination, in the selection.

The Vokkaliga community and its legislators have been putting pressure on the high command to appoint seven-time MLA and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar, who was the working president during 2008-10 when former Minister R.V. Deshpande was the KPCC president.

S.M. Krishna, ex-Chief Minister who is now with the BJP, was the only Vokkaliga to head the State Congress since the 1970s. Mr. Krishna, who was the KPCC president during 1999–2000, campaigned against the then J.H. Patel government and brought the party to power in 1999 and ruled till 2004.

However, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has been opposing Mr. Shivakumar’s candidature, believing that a large chunk of Vokkaligas have been rallying behind H.D. Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (Secular) in the southern part of the State and the party would benefit little from a Vokkaliga leader’s appointment.

On the other hand, four leaders belonging to the other dominant community, Lingayat-Veerashaiva, have also been lobbying to get the post. In a bid to checkmate the rise of Mr. Shivakumar, who is facing IT and ED cases following his alleged role in money laundering cases, Mr. Siddaramaiah has been promoting the candidature of M.B. Patil, former Home Minister and Lingayat leader from north Karnataka. In fact, Mr. Siddaramaiah, who hails from the Old Mysore region, now represents the Badami constituency in north Karnataka. He fought from two seats – Chamundeshwari in his native Mysuru district and Badami – and lost in the former.

However, the “original” Congressmen are opposed to Mr. Siddaramaiah’s nominee on the grouse that the former Chief Minister has the habit of “snubbing dissent” within the organisation. Mr. Siddaramaiah, once with the JD (S), joined the Congress in 2006.

In the last five decades, four Lingayat leaders have become KPCC presidents between 1970-2020. K.H. Patil (twice), Veerendra Patil, V.S. Koujalgi and Allum Veerabhadrappa headed the State Congress at different periods. Mr. Veerabhadrappa was the last Lingayat to head the KPCC during 2001–03.

However, it was former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara, a Dalit leader, who headed the party the longest — eight years — since the days of Devaraj Urs (1970). He was the Congress president from 2010-18. Two elections were held during his tenure and the party came to power both times (2013 and 2018), though in 2018 with coalition partner JD (S). K.H. Ranganath (1985-86), H.K. Rathod (1980-83) and Mallikarjun Kharge (2005-08) are other Dalit leaders who have headed the KPCC.

Three Brahmins — V. Krishna Rao (1992-95), R.V. Deshpande (2008-10) and Dinesh Gundu Rao (since 2018) — have occupied the post. The only Christian to occupy the post was former Union Minister Oscar Fernandes from Udupi.

Former Chief Ministers D. Devaraj Urs, S. Bangarappa, N. Dharam Singh, former Union Minister B. Janardhana Poojary (twice) and D.K. Naikar belonging to OBCs have occupied the post of KPCC chief.

The question now is if the high command would succeed in placating both the dominant communities that seem to be in the race at this juncture. Sources said the State Congress leaders expect some clarity on the matter during the coming session of the State legislature, which will commence on February 17. The party is aware that indefinite postponement of a decision would demoralise the cadre, who are already on a low ebb, sources added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y9x8xn/article30749252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DKSHIVAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-facing-caste-conundrum-in-appointment-of-kpcc-chief/article30749253.ece

Of them, only two — Mr. Jarkiholi and Mr. Singh — have been Ministers earlier and the remaining eight were sworn-in as Ministers for the first time.

Mahesh Kumathalli was the only party-hopper MLA who, despite winning the recent bypoll, was not inducted into the Cabinet on Thursday. Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said it had become difficult to accommodate Mr Kumathalli in the Cabinet but assured him of giving him “another big responsibility”.

96,2020/02/06,Kambar favours universal use of Kannada in e-governance,"Chandrashekar Kambar, Sahitya Akademi president and former president of the Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelan, has favoured the effective implementation of technology in administration and for universal use of Kannada in computing and e-governance.

He was speaking at the inauguration function of the sammelan in Kalaburagi on Wednesday.

“Several years ago, at the insistence of writer Poorna Chandra Tejaswi, I appealed to the State government to give a push to Kannada computing. We were convinced that no language can survive without the use of modern technology and the use of the language in computers. The Department of Kananda and Culture, headed by then director Manu Baligar, released ₹ 2 crore for the project. The work began in earnest and teams of technologists came up with software and fonts. Some departments started using Kannada software. But this work has stopped or has slowed down at some level. I appeal to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to continue the work and ensure that computerised Kannada is used at all levels of government and in e-governance,” he said.

Dr. Kambar batted for content dubbing of informative TV channels in Kannada. Channels such as Discovery and History produce good quality content that can be educative and informative.

“They are very useful for children. These channels are now available in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi and some other Indian languages. But they are not available in Kannada. This is because some people in the film industry is opposing dubbing. Such opposition is not good. Informative channels are our window to the world and allowing dubbing will enhance our knowledge base. There is no merit in not allowing dubbing. I appeal to Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi to allow dubbing in Kannada,” he said.

He favoured primary education in the mother tongue of the child and urged the State government to introduce universal and compulsory education in Kannada medium in all schools. “This will help preserve our culture. Nothing else can,” he said. He blamed East India company administration for inculcating a craze for English education among the people.

“The introduction of English education by the British was strongly welcomed by the masses in India as they had been denied the opportunity for education for millenia. The deprived classes and Dalits who had not been exposed to education till then were excited about the opportunity,” Dr. Kambar said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/l8orap/article30748364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSAMMELANKAMBAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kambar-favours-universal-use-of-kannada-in-e-governance/article30748365.ece
97,2020/02/06,Questions over judicial custody of Veerappan’s aide,"Child rights activists have questioned the judicial custody of 41-year-old Stella Mary, who was arrested earlier this month for her alleged role in the 1993 Palar bomb blasts when she wasbarely 14 years old.

The Kollegal police stumbled upon Mary on February 1 by chance while they were investigating a minor outbreak of fire in a sugarcane field in Jageri village in Chamarajanagar district.

Mary, who is now wife of Veluswamy, had been working as a contract farmer with her husband. When a herd of elephants had entered their sugarcane fields recently, she had opened fire in the air to drive them away, leading to a minor fire.

The police, while investigating the fire, inquired about her ability to operate a gun and learnt about her past association with forest bandit Veerappan. As she was found to be an accused in the Palar bomb blasts, attack on Ramapura police station and illegal transportation of arms, Mary was arrested and sent to judicial custody.

But, child rights activist and advocate P.P. Baburaj pointed out that Ms. Mary, who is 41 years old now, could not have been older than 14 years old in 1993 when the offence was committed.

He said a girl under the age of 18 years cannot be sent to judicial custody according to the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act of 1987.

“Even though she is 41 years old now, what is relevant here is her age at the time the offence was committed. She was a juvenile then and cannot be sent to judicial custody”, he said.

The right course for the police is to produce her before the Juvenile Justice Board of Chamarajanagar, said Mr. Baburaj, who has earlier served as a member of Juvenile Justice Board and Child Welfare Committee of Mysuru district.

Juvenile Board

Endorsing Mr. Baburaj’s view was Mysuru District Child Protection Officer Diwakar. “She has to be presented before the Juvenile Justice Board because the crime has occurred before she was 18 years old”, he said.

Questioning her judicial custody, Mr. Diwakar said, depending on the Juvenile Justice Board’s order, Ms. Mary may be kept in the State Home for Women if there are issues with keeping her in the Girls’ Home as she had crossed 18 years of age now.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/questions-over-judicial-custody-of-veerappans-aide/article30748359.ece
98,2020/02/06,"Farmers protest seeking water from KRS, Kabini","Scores of farmers staged a demonstration in the city on Wednesday urging the authorities to release water from the dams for irrigation.

The members of the Federation of Farmers’ Associations and the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association said that a meeting of the Irrigation Consultative Committee should be convened at once to release water from the KRS and Kabini reservoirs. This is to help fill the water bodies and tanks in the downstream as the water is required to irrigate thousands of acres.

Reservoirs full

Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Federation, said there was copious rainfall during the monsoon last year and hence all the major reservoirs are full.

99,2020/02/06,MCC looking for new hawking zones,"In its bid to free non-hawking areas from street vendors, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is identifying new locations for notifying them as “hawking zones” for vendors’ relocation and rehabilitation. This is in addition to the “hawking zones” already notified.

The Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) had been prepared for 12 zones already notified as hawking areas a few years ago. Funds for providing basic facilities such as toilets, drinking water, and shelter (no permanent structures) were being awaited from the government.

In fact, 25 hawking zones had been identified but the DPRs had been prepared only for 12 and the MCC hopes to get the DPRs ready for other zones too once new locations are identified as more street vendors need to be relocated.

The effort is part of implementing proposals that are crucial to maintaining the city’s cleanliness.

The street vendors had been recently oriented about the steps taken by the MCC for their rehabilitation. Once the facilities are made available, they have to shift to the hawking zones, according to sources in the MCC.

However, there has been resistance from street vendors. Moreover, the MCC was also delaying providing facilities. Unless the MCC makes a sincere effort, the issue may not find a solution.

The notified hawking zones lack basic facilities and therefore vendors are reluctant to relocate, barring a few. A toilet block has been built at the notified place near Ballal Circle but no street food vendor has shifted there.

MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde told The Hindu that the MCC was identifying new places for developing them as “hawking zones” as the idea is to clear the hawkers from the non-hawking zones, especially in the core heritage district (around the palace).

“We don’t build permanent structures in hawking zones. Facilities such as toilets, drinking water, and temporary shelters are created for the vendors to carry out their business. The MCC gives space to everyone and ID cards had already been issued to the street vendors,” he said.

Funds available

For the rehabilitation of street vendors, funds were also available under the National Urban Livelihood Mission. “We know the vendors are economically poor and they need space to eke out a living. The public needs should also be kept in mind. We will try to balance it out. The process may take some more time but the MCC is firm in its stand on clearing the vendors from non-hawking areas,” he clarified.

During the survey conducted a few years ago, as part of National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), 1,149 street food vendors had been identified.

Another survey was also done to identify remaining vendors. Each will be allotted space in the respective zone as per the allocated numbers to end unauthorised vending.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5hi7wl/article30748333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MYSVENDORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mcc-looking-for-new-hawking-zones/article30748334.ece
100,2020/02/06,Kodi Mutt seer prophesies no problems for State govt.,"Seer of Kodi Mutt, Shivanand Shivayogi Rajendra Swami, known for his predictions, has prophesied that the present BJP government will complete its term without any hurdles.

Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi on Wednesday, the seer said that according to his predictions, there would be no serious issue in the State politics.

The seer added that the problem in State politics would be sorted out soon and there would be no problem for Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa even if any leader was bent on getting a ministerial berth.

“The State government will function smoothly till Udagi. I will let you know what will happen after that,” he said.

More rains

Forecasting more rains in the next rainy season, the seer said more fire- and rain-related mishaps were bound to occur. There would also be a threat of the spread of new diseases, he said.

101,2020/02/06,Govt. will enforce Kannada teachingin all private schools: Yediyurappa,"The State government will take steps to ensure that Kannada as a language is taught in all private schools, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced at the 85th Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Kalaburagi on Wednesday.

This comes in the wake of demands from some Kannada activists to make Kannada-medium instruction compulsory in all schools in the State. Sammelan president H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, who spoke after the Chief Minister, also reiterated this demand.

“We are committed to putting in place a series of steps to see that Kannada is taught in all schools, aided and private, as a language. Kannada should be taught as the first or second language in schools. We will also take steps to strengthen government schools,” the Chief Minister said.

To inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry, the State government is setting up mobile planetaria. This will increase the interest of children in space technology and India’s efforts in space exploration, he said.

However, the government alone cannot do much to strengthen government schools. The community and parents should work with the government to make sure that government schools are strengthened and become able to provide quality education to all, he said.

The State government was committed to protecting the interests of the State in Mahadayi and other inter-State river water disputes. The government will take the inter-State border row based on the Mahajan commission report, now pending in the Supreme court, to its logical end, he said.

The government will address backwardness and related issues. It will make sure that adequate funds are allocated to the development of Kalyan Karnataka. Among other things, the government will establish a hostel for students from Kalaburagi region in Bengaluru. Land has been allotted in Nagarabavi in the State capital for the hostel that can accommodate around 200 students, he said.

The government has decided to celebrate Kalyan Karnataka Utsav once every two years. This will showcase the culture of the region, he said.

“We are working towards forging sentimental and emotional unity of the State, apart from unity based on language or administration. Our dream is to see that Karnataka remains a homogeneous unit with equality and equal opportunity for all,” the Chief Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iotzsf/article30748321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGSAMMELANCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-will-enforce-kannada-teachingin-all-private-schools-yediyurappa/article30748322.ece
102,2020/02/06,"SWR gets ₹2,709 crore funds in Union Budget","South-Western Railway (SWR) received a total grant of ₹2,709 crore for 2020-2021 in the Union Budget even as people in Kalyana Karnataka are livid over the meagre allocation of ₹1,000 for setting up the administrative office of the proposed Kalaburagi Division under Central Railway.

Considering the State government’s expected contribution of ₹786 crore under deposit schemes of new lines and road over/under bridges, the overall allocation comes to ₹3,495 crore for SWR, said Chief Public Relations Officer E. Vijaya. The ₹ 2,709 crore from the Union government includes capital and extra-budgetary resource funds, the highest ever after SWR’s formation, she added.

Smoother train movement could be expected on the Bengaluru-Chennai section following provision for automatic signalling with centralised traffic control on the Bengaluru-Jolarpettai section while similar a provision has been made for the Yeshwantpur-Yelahanka section too. As much as ₹8 crore has been allocated for the Baiyappanahalli new terminal. In all, nine RoBs and 15 RuBs were sanctioned.

The Hassan yard will be remodelled to facilitate taking trains from Bengaluru and Mangaluru directly without engine reversal. Amenities at various stations will be improved at a cost of ₹126 crore.

Important lines of SWR will be covered under automatic signalling [30% of network] thereby ensuring seamless operations. Instead of a coach factory, a composite repair shop will be set up at Kolar at a cost of ₹495 crore.

A new line between Dharwad and Belagavi via Kittur that cuts shorts the present distance has been sanctioned at the instance of Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi.

Kalaburagi division

Activists from Kalyana Karnataka blamed the political executives for the non-realisation of the new Railway Division that was sanctioned about six years ago. The Daund-Kalaburagi and the Pune-Guntakal electrification works got ₹128 crore, the Gooty-Dharmavaram doubling got ₹135 crore, and the Munirabad-Mahbubnagar new line got ₹100 crore in the region.

103,2020/02/06,Only 10 MLAs to be inducted into Yediyurappa’s Ministry on Thursday,"On the eve of Cabinet expansion, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to have taken a step back and decided to induct only 10 newly elected party-hopper MLAs and not anyone from among the party’s old-timers.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had earlier said 13 leaders would be inducted, including three party old-timers. The decision to induct the 10 MLAs was taken to contain growing dissidence within the party as lobbying to secure Cabinet berths intensified among old-timers and it “threatened to go out of hand”, said party insiders.

Of the 11 newly elected party-hopper MLAs, all except Mahesh Kumathalli, who won from Athani, will be sworn in as Ministers at Raj Bhavan on Thursday at 10.30 a.m. Mr. Yediyurappa, who announced the decision late on Wednesday evening, repeatedly said senior leader Umesh Katti, who was expected to be inducted, would “definitely be made a Minister” later.

Sources said Mr. Katti was unhappy at the turn of events and had registered his protest. When asked about Mr. Kumathalli’s exclusion, the Chief Minister said it had become difficult to accommodate him in the Cabinet and promised to give him “another big responsibility”.

“The central leadership of the party has directed me to induct only 10 newly elected MLAs on Thursday. They have asked me to go to Delhi to discuss the induction of others later,” the Chief Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/only-10-mlas-to-be-inducted-into-yediyurappas-ministry-on-thursday/article30745673.ece

105,2020/02/06,Curtain goes up on Thunchan fete,"The Thunchan Festival, one of the biggest literary events in the State, began at Thunchanparamba, Tirur, on Thursday.

Inaugurating the four-day festival, Assamese filmmaker Jahnu Barua said that humanistic affluence was much superior to being temporally rich. Having a lot of money cannot make someone superior, he said. But being rich in humanism can make people and society superior. Presiding over the function, Jnanpith laureate M.T. Vasudevan Nair said that the country had two extra languages in Ramayana and Mahabharata.

“We see people trying to associate their locations with events and characters of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Thus we have 23 languages,” he said.

Memorial lecture

Delivering the Thunchan memorial lecture, novelist C. Radhakrishnan said that although the world had become an electronic cocoon with facilities to reach anyone anywhere, man is increasingly becoming a living entity without any relatives. “Modern science and our tradition should go hand in hand,” he said.

M.V. Shreyams Kumar, former MLA, inaugurated a book festival. Poets Manambur Rajanbabu, Alankode Leelakrishnan and P.K. Gopi led an instant poetry competition for college students. K. Sreekumar led a literary quiz for college students.

Aimed at showcasing the tourism potential of these rural destinations, the Meenachil-Meenanthara-Kodoor river linking programme is organising tourism fairs at 10 locations along the recently opened cruise circuit in the river. The initiative will start with ‘Vayalarangu fest’ at Padiyarakkadavu on Friday. The three-day event will promote activities based on village tourism and showcase the local tradition, culinary culture and art forms. Visitors will be taken on canoes through the inland water routes across the village.

George Abraham Kottanad, general secretary of Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association (MTEA), the missionary wing of the Mar Thoma Church that organises the annual event.

Fr. Kottanad said it was the ecumenical spirit and the reformation ardour of the 19th century that initiated the Maramon Convention in 1895.

Biblical discourses

The spiritual retreat is a week of prayer, meditation, singing, sharing and hearing Biblical discourses by prominent speakers.

Joseph Mar Thoma, Metropolitan of Mar Thoma Church, will inaugurate the annual event at a function to be presided by MTEA president Euyakim Mar Coorilos Episcopa at 2.30 p.m. on February 9. Fr.

110,2020/02/06,Haemophilia patients weary of AHF shortage,"The 2,000-odd haemophilia patients in Kerala are in dire straits as there is acute shortage of anti-haemophilia factor in the State.

Haemophilia is a genetic disorder that prevents clotting of blood. People with the disorder will not have sufficient clotting factor in their blood to arrest bleeding in case of injuries. The bleeding is managed by injecting the missing clotting factor, the anti-hemophila factor (AHF), to the patients. In a majority of the patients, there will be deficiency of Clotting Factor 8 or 9.

“Haemophilia patients have been getting anti-haemophilia factor through the Karunaya Benevolent Scheme for the past eight years. But there is acute shortage of the AHF in Karunya pharmacies across the State now,” said E. Raghunandanan, national executive member of the Haemophilia Federation of India.

“We came to know that the two companies, Baxter and Novo Nordisk, which used to supply the factor to the Karunya pharmacies, stopped the supply as they had yet to get huge arrears from the government,” he said.

Desperate calls

“We are getting desperate calls from patients and their families from across the State. Haemophilia patients cannot survive without the clotting factor,” Mr. Raghunandanan added.

An adult haemophilic patient needs around 3,000 units of AHF to arrest a single bleeding episode.

Thus, the annual treatment cost of a patient with frequent bleeding episodes will reach more than ₹1.5 lakh, which cannot be afforded by a majority of the families.

Even a rich family will be pushed to debt traps with the cost of treatment.

“These families depend solely on the supply of AHF from Karunya pharmacies. If they stop the supply, many of them will bleed to death. A survey showed that more than 70% of the haemophilia patients are disabled as they did not get timely treatment. When the existing patients are not getting the AHF, new patients are denied registration in the Karunya scheme,” Mr. Raghunandanan said.

Moreover, haemophilia patients in the State are in a rude shock over the news that the government is going to stop the Karunaya scheme by March.

Thousands of patients urge the government to continue the scheme, their only hope for survival.

“The government should include haemophilia care in the State Budget, like the Puducherry and Tamil Nadu governments. The registered patients in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu get AHF from district and taluk hospitals and medical colleges. The State government should also bring haemophilia under the National Health Mission. Under the mission, the Centre will take care of 60% of the total expense,” Mr. Raghunandanan, who is also secretary of the Haemophilia Society, Kunnamkulam chapter, said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/haemophilia-patients-weary-of-ahf-shortage/article30755298.ece
111,2020/02/06,Cemeteries Bill fears unfounded: Balan,"The proposed legislation that seeks to guarantee the right to burial for Christians will not adversely affect any particular denominations, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs A.K. Balan told the Assembly on Thursday.

Replying to discussions following the introduction of the Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Bill, 2019, Mr. Balan said it was aimed at empowering families belonging to a parish with the right to be buried in the cemetery where their ancestors had been interred.

Maintaining that the concerns raised by certain Christian denominations were unfounded, the Minister said the Bill was introduced on the basis of judgments issued by the Supreme Court in 2017 and the Kerala High Court 2019, both of which held that the last rites of no devotee should be disrupted in the name of faith.

The discussions witnessed United Democratic Front (UDF) members accusing the government of drafting the Bill without holding adequate consultations with Church heads.

Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Bill in its current form would pave the way for unforeseen consequences. Other UDF legislators claimed the legislation sought to homogenise the final rites of the Christian community, thereby going against the government’s avowed stance to preserve plurality among sections.

Dismissing such claims, Mr. Balan said the proposed legislation was aimed at protecting the rights of the deceased.

Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan, who headed a Cabinet subcommittee to resolve the dispute, said the issue had affected the maintenance of law and order, prompting the government to intervene.

Following the discussions, the Bill was referred to the Subject Committee concerned to rectify its inadequacies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t2pg5f/article30755928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tv-Cemeteriescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/concern-over-cemeteries-bill-unfounded-balan/article30753871.ece
112,2020/02/06,GSDP posts impressive growth,"The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of the State has recorded an impressive growth during the past three years, says the Economic Review 2019.

From the 7.3% posted in 2017-18, it rose to 7.5% in 2018-19. The average growth rate during the three years has been pegged at 7.2%. This was in contrast to the national growth rate of 6.9%.

The secondary sector, comprising manufacturing, power and gas, among others, has posted a growth rate of 8.8 % followed by the tertiary sector with 8.4%, in 2018-19.

Negative growth

The primary sector recorded a negative growth rate of -1.43%, mainly on account of a slowdown in the mining and quarrying sectors. The agriculture growth rate during the tenure of the previous government was -2.5%.

But in 2016-17 and 2018-19, it rose to 0.6%. The fall in cash crop prices and recurrent floods rendered a major jolt to the sector. But the area under paddy cultivation increased from 1.07 lakh hectares in 2016-17 to 2.03 lakh hectares in 2018-19.

Manufacturing sector

The manufacturing sector grew at 11.2% against the 3.7% in the previous year.

The total turnover of State public sector undertakings under the Industries Department in 2018-19 was ₹3,442.74 crore, an increase of 17.9% from the previous year. The micro, small and medium enterprises sector posted an impressive growth with 13,826 units starting operations in 2018-19.

The investments in this sector has been pegged at ₹1,321.94 crore and generated 49,068 jobs.

While the per capita income was ₹1,48,078, the national average was ₹93,655. This also means that the average income per person in the State was 1.6 times the Indian average in 2018-19.

The State has made significant advancements in Information Technology too, the review says.

The State has 54% Internet penetration, which is the second highest in the country. The number of Non-Resident Keralites has come down from 24 lakh in 2017-18 to 21 lakh in 2018-19.

But the NRI deposits in bank increased by 11.83% in 2018-19 compared to the previous year.

Revenue expenditure

The revenue expenditure grew to ₹1,10,316.39 crore in 2018-19 against the ₹99,948.35 crore in 2017-18. Disbursal of the third and fourth instalments of the arrears of the 10th Pay Revision Commission was the main reason for the increase in revenue expenditure.

The share of Central taxes and duties with grant-in-aid and other receipts for Plan and non-Plan is decreasing, the review says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1st0js/article30756070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tv-financescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gsdp-posts-impressive-growth/article30753780.ece

But it is symptomatic of the paradoxical situation confronting the CPI(M) and the party-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government Mr. Vijayan is heading, in the aftermath of the arrest of the two youths under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on November 1.

Mr. Vijayan’s announcement in the Assembly on February 5 that he wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to hand over the ongoing NIA investigation against the two youths is a reversal of what he had said in the Assembly a day before. On February 4, an agitated Mr. Vijayan had asked in the Assembly whether he should entreat Mr. Shah to get the case back from the NIA.

On the defensive

The CPI(M) has been on the defensive ever since the arrest of the two youths under the UAPA, which the party officially calls draconian, even as the Chief Minister, who is holding the Home portfolio, defended the police probe into the case. Even when the party leadership was critical of the registration of the case against the duo under the UAPA, Mr. Vijayan defended the police and named the arrested as Maoists. According to the State police, the duo were actually activists of the banned CPI (Maoist). Mr. Vijayan was seen as taking a huge political risk then as he had drawn flak from not only the Opposition but also from the Communist Party of India (CPI), a major alliance partner in the LDF.

The Chief Minister’s U-turn on the NIA probe into the case could be an act of political expediency in the face of the Opposition’s aggressive stand that it was invocation of the UAPA charges against the youths that allowed the NIA to take over the probe from the State Police. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s visit to the families of the two youths — hailing from the Muslim community — on January 21 was seen as a game changer. CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan had to come out two days after Mr. Chennithala’s visit that the arrested youths were still members of the party.

Taking sting out

The Chief Minister’s letter to Mr. Shah will be construed as an effort to take the sting out of the Opposition’s charge that his stand on the UAPA was not as vigorous as his opposition to the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which he strongly condemns as discriminatory.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3e0urf/article25871618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-PINARAYI-VIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-govts-u-turn-on-nia-probe-reflects-cpims-conflicting-stand-on-uapa/article30753337.ece
114,2020/02/06,"Drop amendment in IT Act, Centre told","The Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution urging the Centre to drop the proposal in the Finance Bill 2020-2021 to amend Section 6 of the Income Tax Act of 1961 as it will badly affect the Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) and the State’s economy.

The proposed amendment in the name of checking tax evasion will prevent hundreds of NoRKs, especially those working in Middle East countries, from coming down to stay with their families, the resolution moved by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan noted.

Tightening the residency provisions, the Finance Bill had proposed to reduce the period of stay in India to 120 days from 182 days earlier for persons of Indian origin (PIOs) to be categorised as Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) with effect from April 1, 2020.

The amendment will lead to reduction in the income of those engaged in small business and they will be able to retain the non-resident status only if they stay abroad for 240 days. At present, only 182-day is enough. Those working in the oil rigs and coming home for one month off duty will also be affected.

The NoRKs have a significant contribution in the economy of the State and their contribution accounts for 15% of the Gross State Domestic Product. The economy of the State that has been affected by the slowdown will be badly affected if the Centre went ahead with the proposed amendment.

The resolution also pointed out the proposal to amend the IT Act of 1961 to tax Non-Resident Indians not paying taxes in any foreign country. Now, if an Indian or a person of Indian origin managed his stay in India such that he remained a non-resident in perpetuity, he was not liable to pay tax on his global income here.

The State government, immediately after the presentation of the Union Budget on February 1, had opposed the proposal. The Centre, officially clarified, that the amendment was not aimed at taxing Indian citizens working abroad. The situation would be different if the proposals in the Finance Bill 2020 were included in the IT rules, the resolution said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/drop-amendment-in-it-act-centre-told/article30752686.ece
115,2020/02/06,Kerala govt. facing harsh discriminatory approach from BJP-led Centre: CPI(M),"The CPI(M) on Thursday alleged that the Left-ruled Kerala government is facing a ‘harsh discriminatory’ approach from the BJP-led dispensation at the Centre.

An editorial in the forthcoming edition of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy says that because of this ‘prejudiced’ attitude, Kerala is experiencing a serious financial crisis. “The Modi government seems determined to thwart the LDF government’s development agenda by strangulating its finances,” it says.

The editorial says the Centre has all the powers to raise resources while the States are required to undertake development and social welfare expenditure that far exceed their revenue generating capacities. “While this is a common problem for all States, Kerala is being singled out for exceptional treatment by denying it its due share of taxes and resources,” it alleges.

Borrowing limits

Citing examples, the editorial says the Central government has reduced the funds that can be borrowed by Kerala in the last quarter of 2019-20. As per the budgetary allocation, the loan should have been ₹10,233 crore. But only ₹1,900 crore has been sanctioned. Instead of the ₹19,500 crore received as borrowing in last fiscal, it will just be ₹16,602 this year. In the place of the ₹3,200 crore loan received in the last quarter of 2018-19, Kerala will get only ₹1,920 in the last quarter of 2019-20, it adds.

The CPI(M) alleges that there is constant delay in receipt of GST compensation. The State also did not receive flood compensation given to seven other States despite facing floods in August 2019. “An additional Central assistance of ₹5,908.56 crore was granted to seven States from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for damages during the southwest monsoon in 2019, but not Kerala.”

Arrears

“Kerala has been one of the better performing States in the implementation of the rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS). However, the Centre has been tardy in sending funds and arrears to the tune of ₹1,215 crore which are pending. For payment of paddy procurement also there are dues of ₹1,035 crore,” it says.

The party also alleges that the Union Budget for 2020-21 has further ‘neglected’ and done injustice to Kerala.

The 15th Finance Commission in its recommendations for 2020-21 has reduced Kerala’s share in the net proceeds of taxes to 1.94% from 2.5% recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. Even the recommended amount of tax devolution by the commission (₹16,616 crore) has not been allocated in the Budget. The State’s share in Central tax has been proposed at ₹ 15,236.6 crore as against ₹16.401 crore received in 2019-20, it says.

“The Modi government’s violation of federal norms and hypocrisy in talking about cooperative federalism is very much on display when it comes to its dealings with Kerala. The LDF government and the people of Kerala are not going to take these efforts to denigrate their state lying down. They will struggle to assert their rights,” it says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/24fe64/article30755896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TVBUDGETSESSIONPARLIAMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-govt-facing-harsh-discriminatory-approach-from-bjp-led-centre-cpim/article30752519.ece
116,2020/02/06,It’s a tough balancing act for Isaac,"Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac will have to proffer policy prescriptions to overcome the challenges thrown by the economic slowdown and the drastic cut in allocations from the divisible pool of Central taxes for sustaining the welfare initiatives of the State when he presents the State Budget for 2020-21 in the Assembly on Friday.

Dr. Isaac exudes confidence of wading through the crisis and his ebullience largely rests on the 7.5% Gross State Domestic Product growth against the national average of 7.3% in 2018-19. He promises to insulate the State’s economy from the crippling effects of the economic slowdown gripping the country.

Political commitment

Given the political commitment of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in conserving its base comprising weaker sections, the State government will have to strain hard to carry forward the welfare pensions being distributed to about 42 lakh beneficiaries. However, resource mopping for continuing the pension outgo would be a daunting task.

With local body polls round the corner, the government could not afford to make any compromises in clearing the bills of local self-government institutions on time. This is in addition to the routine committed expenditure on salary and service pension.

Raising the tax collection to 20% and recovering the revenue lost through tax evasion may be the first feasible option. The Central government decision to defer the filing of Goods and Services Taxes annual returns and non-payment of Central compensation have derailed the State’s plans to overcome the crisis. Besides, the State’s tax collection has been lingering at about 14%.

The government will have to complete the scrutiny of returns within the next two months and complete procedures for recovering the unpaid tax from traders. The budget is likely to contain a slew of revenue mopping measures in this regard.

The State’s plea for raising the annual borrowing limit continues to remain as a cry in the wilderness. The 15th Union Finance Commission’s approach in tax devolution does not seem to offer any relief to the State.

Centre’s approach

The Budget should have solutions to cushion the impact of the Central government’s alleged hostile approach, which is being construed as the price that the State has to pay for its strong stance on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and allied issues.

A change in the Centre’s attitude seems to be impossible and the only option is to evolve indigenous solutions for the State’s problems. And the Budget is likely to have such solutions too.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ap4wsi/article30755544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TVTHOMASISSAC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/isaac-faces-tough-task-of-balancing-the-books/article30752101.ece
117,2020/02/06,"‘Love jihad’ is a reality in Kerala, claims BJP leader","A day after the Union Home Ministry told Parliament that no case of ‘love jihad’ has been reported by any of the Central agencies, the BJP on Wednesday claimed that it was a reality in Kerala.

Throwing its weight behind the Syro-Malabar Church which kicked up a debate in the State recently over the incidents of love jihad in the State, BJP national executive member P.K. Krishnadas urged the Home Ministry to carry out a “comprehensive probe” into such cases to bring out real facts. “The term love jihad is not defined under the extant laws but it is a fact that it is happening (in Kerala),” Mr. Krishnadas told reporters here.

He accused the present CPI(M)-led LDF government and previous Congress-led UDF government of not giving a proper report to the Centre over the issue. “The State governments controlled by the UDF and LDF gave reports to the Centre saying that such incidents are not at all happening in Kerala,” Mr. Krishnadas alleged.

He said the BJP shared the views of the Syro-Malabar Church on the issue. “The complaint and allegations raised by the Syro-Malabar Church on the issue of love jihad is based on facts and truth. We share their views,” he said.

Mr. Krishnadas said the BJP does not see love jihad as an issue between two religions. “Don’t mistake it as an issue between two religions. There is no religion for terrorists. We don’t see it as a Hindu-Muslim issue or a Christian-Muslim issue,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/love-jihad-is-a-reality-in-kerala-claims-bjp-leader/article30752049.ece
118,2020/02/06,Free liquor from water taps at home? Residents of Kerala town disoriented,"Free liquor from water taps at home? While this could bring cheer to tipplers, it could hardly amuse the residents of New Solomon’s Apartment near the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) stand at Chalakudy.

Old liquor stocks, disposed of by Excise officials, had contaminated a well and entered the drinking water supply of 18 families living in the apartment.

Court order

Excise sleuths had seized and sealed 6,000 litres of liquor, stored illegally in a bar that functioned near the KSRTC bus stand around six years ago. As the court gave permission to destroy the liquor recently, the officials dug up a pit on the premises of the bar last Sunday and poured the liquor into it, without realising the consequences.

The liquor seeped from the pit into the soil and got mixed into the water in the well situated close to the compound of the bar. The well is the source of the apartment block’s drinking water needs.

Residents said they felt confused when they first encountered the pungent smell of liquor in their tap water. Soon, they had to stop using their kitchens. The families were inconvenienced as children could not attend school and adults could not go to work.

Complaints sent

Complaints were sent to the police, the Municipality and health officials. Only then did the Excise officials realise what had gone horribly wrong.

She had attempted the equivalency examination, which included three papers in Malayalam, English, Environment and Mathematics, with the help of KSLMA resource persons last November.

The result of the examination was announced on Wednesday and she scored 205 out of 275 marks.

Bhageerathi Amma dropped out of school after Class III to take care of her younger siblings and could not complete her education. Widowed at a very young age, she never got another chance as she was busy raising her six children. She returned to the classroom in 2019, nearly a century after she left it, through KSLMA's equivalency course.

She completed the course with the help of resource persons S.N Shirley and K.B. Vasanthakumar while her 70-year-old daughter Thankamani offered all the support. According to her resource persons, the centenarian is a smart student who is very keen on continuing her studies. The Class 4 equivalency examination was attempted by 11,593 candidates. The pass percentage stood at 86% with 10,012 candidates clearing the exam. Of the successful candidates, 9,456 were women. Pathanamthitta, where 385 candidates sat for the exam, scored 100% success.

The observation from the court came after it noted the dispute between two factions in the Pandalam royal family, which is the custodian of the sacred ornaments of the Sabarimala temple.

A Bench headed by Justice N.V. Ramana and comprising Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari asked senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, representing the Kerala government, to come up with suggestions to safeguard the ornaments and scheduled the matter for further hearing on February 7.

The court said that the jewellery does not belong to the erstwhile royal family but Lord Ayyappa, and it may appoint a responsible person for its safe custody.

The court observed that there is a dispute between the family members and as a result “why should we not allow the ornaments to be kept in the safe custody of a responsible person”. Kerala government counsel contended that the State could take a decision in the matter.

Raja Raja Varma, a member of the former royal family, moved an application for impleading in the pending matter and sought directions to access the jewellery, kept in custody of the secretary of the Pandalam Kottara Nirvahaka Sangham, to the family’s senior members.

124,2020/02/06,VACB to indict Kunju in flyover graft case,"Former Public Works Minister and Indian Union Muslim League legislator V.K. Ebrahim Kunju on Wednesday faced the prospect of being indicted for corruption in the shoddy construction of the now-defunct multi-crore flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has given the go-ahead for the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to press criminal charges against Mr. Kunju in connection with the “sloppy” execution of the project. The flyover was decommissioned barely a year after its inauguration in 2016 and it had provoked a groundswell of public anger, prompting the Left Democratic Front government to order an anti-corruption inquiry.

The VACB probe is focussed on finding out if there was any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Kunju in advancing a low-interest loan to the private firm contracted to build the overbridge. It is also attempting to ferret out whether Mr. Kunju had accorded illegal financial advantage to the company by fast-forwarding the payment of part bills, allegedly overlooking cautionary reports about the low-grade nature of construction. The agency has also sensed an anomaly in the government’s decision to sanction an advance payment of ₹9 crore to the private builder at an interest rate much less than that charged by nationalised banks.

The VACB is also scrutinising the role of officials attached to the Roads and Bridges Corporation, the State agency tasked to implement the project, and also other officials of Kitco, a State-run consultancy, in the corruption case.

It is also tracking the money trail in the case, including whether those under a cloud of suspicion had amassed wealth or properties beyond their known sources of income. The Enforcement Directorate has sought “third party” information about the case from the agency.

The VACB had concluded that big-ticket corruption and lack of oversight had resulted in the shoddy construction of the four-lane flyover, prompting the government to decommission it in the interest of public safety.

It has already arrested the then PWD Secretary T.O. Sooraj and three others, including the builder on corruption charges.

125,2020/02/06,"nCoV is under control, says Kerala’s Health Minister","The Health Department seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when yet another day passed without anyone testing positive for nCoV in the State. However, public health experts warn that it is early days yet and that the situation involving novel coronavirus is fragile and still evolving.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, who briefed media after the daily meeting of the Rapid Response Team, indicated that “things are coming within our control”.

However, epidemiologists say this would be a dangerous assumption at a time when nCoV is spreading fast and wild within and outside China, with even fourth generation cases being reported from various places.

Continuing the strategy of putting anyone with a recent travel history to China under surveillance, the department put 159 more people under quarantine on Wednesday. As many as 2,528 persons are on surveillance in the State, with 93 mildly symptomatic persons being isolated in hospitals, and the rest (2,435) put on home quarantine for 28 days.

223 samples tested

Till date, 223 samples of suspect cases have been tested with the National Institute of Virology and 193 have tested negative for nCoV. The three patients tested positive are doing well in hospitals, the Minister said.

The department is now focussing on providing psycho-social support to those under long and enforced self quarantine at home by deploying psychologists and counsellors.

In various districts, 191 persons from the mental health services have been engaged to provide telephonic counselling.

An evaluation done on those under surveillance revealed that 30% are following the instructions for quarantine while 16% have fared poorly.

Ancillary staff training

Focus is also being given on training the ancillary staff in the department and on IEC (information, education, communication) activities in the community so that the public comply with the directives being issued by health officials.

Directives have been issued to the hotel industry and homestays and resorts to keep vigil on foreign arrivals. Two tourists who came to the State from nCoV-affected nations have been kept under surveillance at Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam.

126,2020/02/06,Kerala’s rail dreams come a cropper,"Kerala has suffered a setback on the rail front with the Union budget providing only paltry allocation for its prioritised projects, which include completion of doubling of the Ettumanur-Kottayam and Kottayam-Chingavanam corridors, Thiruvananthapuram Central-Kanyakumari line, and the coaching terminal at Nemom.

The Pink Book of Railways, which catalogues works to be executed this year and spells out allocations , shows that the priorities of the Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad rail divisions and the wish list submitted by the State government for development of the rail network have been ignored.

Bias against State

The ‘discrimination’ of the State is evident as doubling works in Tamil Nadu have received ₹700 crore. Karnataka also has received a substantial allocation.

For the ₹500 crore sought for completing the doubling of the Ettumanur-Kottayam and Kottayam-Chingavanam corridors, Thiruvananthapuram Central- Kanyakumari line, and the coaching terminal at Nemom, the allocation given is ₹93.50 crore.

With this outlay, railway officials say only the doubling via Kottayam can be completed partially by arranging another ₹12 crore sanctioned for other works this year. A sum of ₹200 crore is needed for completing the doubling up to Ernakulam in December 2021.

Against ₹300 crore sought for doubling of the rail line to Kanyakumari, the allocation provided is ₹5 crore and ₹128.50 crore through extra budgetary resources (loan from LIC).

Doubling non-starter

Officials say doubling works will be confined to paper as land acquisition cost alone will come to ₹700 crore. The government has sought ₹207 crore from Railways for acquiring 14.80 ha for doubling 7 km from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Nemom and for the coaching terminal. The funds from the EBR can be taken only after land is acquired for the project.

A sum of ₹50 lakh has been provided for the coaching terminal at Nemom from the “umbrella project head’ of Southern Railway.

The doubling of 18.3 km from Ambalappuzha to Haripad has got an outlay of ₹13.95 crore .

Token provision has been given for patch doubling of Ernakulam-Kumbalam, Kumbalam-Turavur, Turavur-Ambalappuzha, and Shoranur-Ernakulam third line under the head doubling.

The demand for splitting intermediate block sections (IBS) of Alappuzha-Ambalappuzha (12 km) and Thurvavur-Kumbalam (17 km) for handling more trains has been ignored. But, IBS has been approved for Kumbalam-Manjeswaram, Tikkottui-Vadakara, and Vadakara-Mahe. Additional platform at the Kannur station and automated coach washing facility at Ernakulam and Kochuveli have found place.

127,2020/02/06,Jagan defends 3-capital decision for A.P.,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday asserted that the decision to have separate seats of governance at Amaravati (legislative), Visakhapatnam (executive or administrative) and Kurnool (judicial) was a cautious one prompted by the benefits of decentralisation and the State’s shoe-string budget.

Completing former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu’s dream capital city, which is neither in Vijayawada nor in Guntur and lacked even a two-lane road, entailed an expenditure of ₹1.09 lakh crore on basic infrastructure alone at ₹2 crore per acre, he said. The present government was not in a position to spend huge sums on such grandiose plans. If the lands where construction activity was not permitted by the National Green Tribunal and the River Conservation Act were to be excluded, the State was left with just about 5,200 acres.

Sharing his views at a conclave ‘Excellence in Education’ organised by The Hindu Group and moderated by its Chairman N. Ram here, Mr. Reddy said even if the government spent 10% of ₹1.09 lakh crore on Visakhapatnam, it would become a growth engine capable of competing with Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad in about 10 years.

Earlier, Mr. Ram called the decision to introduce English medium in government schools a radical step and said it seemed to be demand-driven and in tune with the thrust laid on the English language in the southern States. “What Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy proposed is universalisation of English medium education, which no other State has perhaps ventured out to do,” Mr. Ram observed.

To a question by Mr. Ram on the reverse tendering process, Mr. Reddy said ₹2,000 crore was saved in various works in the last seven months.

Mr. Vijayan has told Mr. Shah that the NIA is not justified in taking over suo motu the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case registered at the Pantheerankavu police station in Kozhikode district. (The NIA had taken over the case on December 16, 2019)

The case, though pertaining to a scheduled offence, is not serious enough to warrant an NIA investigation, he said. The NIA, on its own accord, had taken over the case which was being ‘efficiently and satisfactorily’ investigated by the State police. The NIA decision went against the declared intention of the NIA Act and court orders that stated that the national agency should weigh the seriousness of a case before taking it over from the State police.

Quotes HC verdict

The letter quotes excerpts from a Bombay High Court judgment in the Pragya Singh Chandrapal Singh Thakur vs State of Maharashtra case which observed that the Central government would not be in a position to direct that a case be investigated by the agency merely because it is a scheduled offence. Opposition parties in the Kerala Assembly have expressed the view that the State police should pursue the investigation. Further, the State government has received legal advice that the case should be retained with the State police, the Chief Minister said.

CM mellows down

Mr. Vijayan informed the State Assembly about the letter on Wednesday afternoon. A day before, Mr. Vijayan had drawn flak in the House from the Opposition United Democratic Front over his stand on the issue. By Wednesday, the Chief Minister, however, appeared to have mellowed down his stand appreciably. In writing to Mr. Shah, the State government has bowed to sentiments expressed by the Opposition on the matter, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/transfer-uapa-case-to-state-cm/article30745690.ece
129,2020/02/06,Development works hit: Oppn.,"The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) walked out of the Assembly on Wednesday stating that public works had ground to a halt due to non-payment of work bills.

Congress legislator K.C. Joseph attempted to set the ‘stasis’ in the execution of civil works as a significant talking point in the upcoming campaign for local body elections. During zero hour, he sought leave of the House to stop routine business and discuss the ‘urgent matter’ that adversely impacted the quality of life.

He said the government owed contractors more than ₹1,021 crore. Nearly 4,000 bills were pending payment in panchayats and municipalities. Contractors were at a loss to execute works or bid for new ones. The treasury did not honour any invoice above ₹50,000. Plan fund utilisation for the current fiscal was less than 30%.

‘Jugglery of facts’

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac used florid prose and clever jugglery of figures to hide facts. The treasury was bone dry. Developmental work had ground to a halt. Culverts remained clogged and roads potholed.

Even the welfare schemes for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes had dried up. Infrastructure decay was the order of the day.

Dr. Isaac accused the Opposition of spreading ominous rumours about the State’s fiscal situation. He admitted that Kerala faced a financial crunch.

However, it had not held back on investing in development. The government had allocated ₹1,500 crore for roads.

It has extended contractors facility to discount their bills. They could take advance payment on the bills from banks.

Dr. Isaac said the Plan expenditure for the current fiscal was 52%, which he claimed was a ‘historic high’. The Opposition was resorting to scaremongering, he said.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan ruled the Minister’s reply satisfactory and dismissed the plea for adjournment motion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9ckbfo/article30745676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TVGOVERNMENTCONTRACTORS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/development-works-hit-oppn/article30745677.ece
130,2020/02/06,Staff unions see bid to privatise LIC,"Towards the fag end of December last year, the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) handed over a whopping annual dividend of ₹2,611 crore to the Central government. In 2019, it registered a growth of 9.9%. The fully government-owned company had also a market share of 76%, despite stiff competition from newer companies in the private sector.

Yet, one month later, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the Union Budget the government's decision to divest a part of its stake in the LIC. Though the government presented it as a minor announcement, almost all employee unions see it as the first step towards privatisation.

""This is an institution which belongs to crores of policyholders across the country who have reposed their trust in the LIC. The trust is due to various reasons. Most importantly, from a customer's point of view, we have the highest claim settlement ratio of 98.75%, which none of the private insurance companies can match.

These companies often go for litigation to reject claims, which the LIC never does. So, it is important that such an organisation remains in the public sector,"" says P. Raju, zonal vice president, All India Insurance Employees' Association.

Bonus

The LIC shares close to 90% of its profits as bonus to the policyholders. It has been for years one of the sources of funds for the government to implement big projects. In recent years, there has been criticism that the government is using the LIC's massive cash reserves to bail out organisations facing deep financial crises.

Union leaders cite the recent increase in LIC's stake to around 25% in Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), which has defaulted on its repayments. Another much discussed acquisition of shares is in the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), which has a high percentage of non-performing assets. In the Union Budget last week, the government also decided to sell its remaining stake in the IDBI.

Planning Board member K.N. Harilal sees a connection between the LIC stake sale and the introduction of the new optional personal income tax regime. It is meant to disincentivise policy investments in organisations like the LIC, to weaken it. In view of the move to divest a part of the government stake in the LIC, he calls for strengthening of the Movement for India's Financial Independence (MIFI), launched last year with an aim to uphold the country's financial and political independence.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/j8h41j/article30745651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TVLICSHARESALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/staff-unions-see-bid-to-privatise-lic/article30745652.ece
131,2020/02/06,Spotlight on Wuhan connect,"The spotlight is now on the connect between Wuhan and Kerala as India’s all three positive novel coronavirus cases so far are students of a university in the historic Chinese city, the epicentre of the epidemic.

Wuhan has been a popular destination for Keralites and others as an educational hub with quality and affordable medical courses attracting overseas scholars.

Impressed by factors such as affordability, amenities and international standards in medical education, offered in English, students from Kerala have been flocking to Wuhan University School of Medicine.

Wuhan, over 1,000 km from the Chinese capital of Beijing and 800-plus km from Shanghai, is a historic city and played a key role in the 20th century history of China.

‘Quality education’

“I am very happy about the medical education system at the Wuhan university. They offer quality education at an affordable fees,” a student who had returned from Wuhan said here on Tuesday.

Aiswarya Hariharan, a third-year MBBS student, returned to India early January soon after the school was shut for vacation. According to her, the Wuhan University School of Medicine has become a centre of attraction for MBBS aspirants from Kerala because of its international standard.

“In our batch, there are about 70 international students. Interestingly, 50 of them are from Kerala,” said Aiswarya from Thripunithura, near here.

Parent of another MBBS student studying in Wuhan said he sent his daughter there because of its high standard of education system in a fee affordable to him.

“I spent ₹5 lakh to ₹6 lakh for fee, accommodation and food annually for my daughter. This fee amount is very less compared to many of the self-financing medical institutes with least facilities in India. Besides, studying overseas is beneficial for the students as they get an international exposure,” the parent said.

Revathy Krishnan from Thiruvananthapuram is also doing MBBS in Wuhan. The third-year student said she was very happy about her institute and its faculty who offer medical education on a par with any other reputed Indian medical institute.

500 from Kerala

The students said around 500 from Kerala were doing the MBBS course at the Wuhan university.

They expressed confidence that the Asian giant would overcome the crisis soon and they would be able to continue their education there.

Educational consultant Jacob George, general manager of the Asian Educational Consultancy, however, felt the number of students who went to China for MBBS was minimal as several others preferred countries such as Russia.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t9v34/article30745603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvtvchina,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spotlight-on-wuhan-connect/article30745604.ece
132,2020/02/06,28 special courts to be set up for clearing POCSO cases,"Exclusive courts for clearing the pendency of cases booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in two years will start functioning before March.

As many as 28 such courts will be made operational across the State before the end of the fiscal. It is estimated that nearly 7,000 POCSO cases are pending.

Thiruvananthapuram will have four courts, the maximum number among all districts. It has been decided to set up one court for every 165 pending cases.

All courts will be headed by District and Sessions Judges who are in the judicial service of the State.

The State government had earlier toyed with the idea of appointing retired judges to the post on contact basis.

The government had even sought the views of the Kerala High Court in this regard. However, the move did not go down well with the judiciary.

The Kerala Judicial Officers Association had also made its disagreement known to the proposal. Those who opposed the move had raised questions about the accountability of the judicial officials who would have been appointed on contract in handling the sensitive cases.

Presiding officers

It has now been agreed in principle that the appointments of the presiding officers for these courts shall be made by promoting the senior judicial officers. Some of the court staff may have to be appointed on contract, judicial sources indicated.

The current proposal is for operating the exclusive courts for two years. The government will take a call on the fate of the courts by the end of the two-year term, sources said.

It is estimated that each court would require ₹75 lakh. While the Central government will meet 60% of the expenses, the State will have to chip in with the remaining 40%.

Though an exclusive POCSO court, the first in the State, was sanctioned earlier for Kochi, it could not start functioning for want of infrastructure facilities. The hunt for suitable locations for the 28 courts is on and they could start functioning before the deadline, sources indicated.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8ofpqz/article30745569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-Courtcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/28-special-courts-to-be-set-up-for-clearing-pocso-cases/article30745570.ece
133,2020/02/06,'Hoop Nation': This is how basketball unites these Indians,"Who doesn’t love an underdog?

Sporting history is dotted with numerous examples of unthinkable come-from-behind victories, where grit drops one over might.

Like Kansas City Chiefs overcoming a 10 point deficit in the fourth quarter to down the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl, or the Premier League football club Liverpool FC standing poised to break a 30-year drought to get their hands on the coveted league trophy.

Similar tales of grit and courage, but closer home, is what Hoop Nation, the four-video series (sponsored by NBA and Uber) captures.

The parallels stop there; the stories documented are not of nail-biting, photo finishes to a game or series. For the people featured, the fight is about how their passion for the game of basketball allows them to dream big, offering them a shot at living life itself.

“What made all of them different is the revelation of how the players, coaches, families and the supporters have uniquely made the game of basketball their own,” says Mairu Gupta, senior director, global media distribution, NBA India, adding that the stories show how sport “brings together disparate communities”.

Breaking barriers

It includes the differently-abled bound by a wheelchair — only when throwing hoops — and not in spirit.

Madhavi Latha | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Led by Madhavi Latha, who founded and heads the Wheelchair Basketball Federation of India (WBFI), — and who is herself a national paralympic swimming champion (having earned that accolade at the age of 40 after learning to swim at 37) — the community is ever growing, drawing strength in numbers along the way.

In 2019, WBFI held its sixth national championship in Mohali, an event that had 23 men’s and 14 women’s teams participate.

What Madhavi saw, in 2014, when the opportunity arose to form WBFI and bring coaches from abroad to train prospective talents, was a platform to “inculcate leadership skills in the disabled”.

Who’s who Directed by Shreeda Patel and produced by Asad Abid, Hoop Nation featured four click tracks (one for each location) composed by the sibling musical duo of Anushka and Shikhar Yuvraj Manchanda, known professionally as Nuka and Rākhis.

“It took us about a month to shoot the series,"" says Mairu Gupta. Each video features a track sung by hip hop artistes.

Vocals for WBFI in Chennai is by Deepa Unnikrishnan (known as Dee MC) while for Gangyap Girls it is the Shillong-origin teenage hip hop crew Symphonic Movement. For LBA, rapper Kaam Bhaari (Kunal Pandagle), who made an impression in the Bollywood feature Gully Boy, adds thrust with these lines — Jeetne ka shauk hai to khud ko atal banana padega (if you have the desire to win, make yourself firm). Spitfire (Nitin Mishra) is the featured artiste for the Dharamshala video.

“Because wheelchair basketball is such a dynamic game. A disabled person has as much desire to be active and dynamic as any other young person,” says Madhavi. The response was “amazing” as interest came in from nooks and crannies of Tamil Nadu, she adds.

The best among the lot is Partha, whose spinal injuries after falling off a building while a student with the Vellore CMC confined him to the wheelchair.

“He was a basketball player before his accident. He was feeling bad that he could not play the game like before, and when he heard of WBFI, he approached us,” she adds.

In 2017, despite limited training, Partha travelled with the U-23 team to Thailand, where his display earned plaudits from other teams and coaches.

That first impression was enough, for Partha is now a student at the University of Alabama, in USA, having earned an adapted athletics scholarship to study kinesiology and exercise science, even as he continues to train and improve his game.

A parallel can be drawn to the case of 24-year-old Nima Doma Bhutia, now a member of the senior Indian women’s national basketball team.

Nima, who hails from a tribal community in Gangyap, Sikkim, is a product of the Eklavya Model Residential School, and was inspired to take up basketball by Siddharth Yonzone, the school’s principal and coach. Until Yonzone started his work here in 2007, dropping out at the middle- school level was the norm among tribal girls.

“It was not just sports but music too that I infused into the children. For me, education for first generation learners from such remote areas had to be done differently. These activities kept the tribal children happy, occupied and, most of all, gave them confidence and self-belief,” says Yonzone.

For Nima, the brightest light out of Gangyap, the road to stardom has not been without difficulties.

“It has taken me a number of years to understand that it is extremely difficult to get selected for the nation, especially when one belongs to a minority hailing from a village of a very tiny State. But basketball has changed my life; it is more than just a game. It taught me to aim higher as we shoot the ball high in the basket,” says Nima.

Dominant dons

So good are the ‘Girls of Gangyap’ at the moment that they are now considered favourites to win when they contest the CBSE nationals, although they have a long way to go before being considered the giants of this game in India.

That crown belongs to Punjab, more specifically to the Ludhiana Basketball Academy (or LBA), which has trained “every single Punjab player” to have played for the national team, according to Indian men’s team player, Arshpreet Singh Bhullar.

“[LBA] has played a major role in contributing basketball talents to the national team,” he says.

Punjab recently won the 70th national championship. They had also won it the previous year. Such domination of the sport — as Bhullar notes: “at least seven or eight national team players are from Punjab” — is, perhaps, why the concept of fear is discussed much in the video about Ludhiana’s talents.

“The opponents always have this fear that Punjab’s players are the best and that their youth will also be good,” he says.

It is what the LBA is also enabling, allowing Punjabi youth to dream big.

Satnam Singh Bhamara, 24, from Barnala, is a famous graduate from here, and was drafted by the NBA team Dallas Mavericks in 2015. Others like Amritpal Singh and Amjyot Singh followed in his footsteps in graduating to play in foreign leagues. The latest entrant is Arvinder Singh Khalon, who has been selected to train at the NBA junior academy in Noida, and is expected to take flight to US soon.

Ray of hope

But the sport of basketball stretches its boundaries to accommodate even the most impoverished among marginalised communities — refugees. In this case, it is the Tibetan Children’s Village (TCV) in Dharamshala.

Kamo Rezen, all of 10, is quite the baller and adores Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. He drops hoops with ease, and lays it up for his friends to dunk home. Founded in 1960, the TCV is home to children most of whom have separated from their parents, either at birth or while escaping persecution.

“We encourage them to play after class. It should be okay as long as they don’t fight,” laughs Geshe Tenzin Damchoe, lecturer, Sarah College of Higher Tibetan Studies. He adds that students in the village learn to play volleyball and badminton as well — “because health is as important as education”. As the video ends, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that this sport is much more than just an escape. It offers hope.

134,2020/02/06,‘Darbar’ director AR Murugadoss seeks police protection as distributors demand compensation,"Film director A.R. Murugadoss has approached the Madras High Court seeking police protection for himself. He has claimed that a few distributors of the recent Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar are constantly intimidating, insulting and annoying him at his residence as well as office by claiming to have suffered losses due to bad run of the movie in the box office.

Justice P. Rajamanickam on Thursday directed Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz to obtain instructions from the Greater Chennai Commissioner of Police as well as the Inspectors of police stations in Teynampet and Virugambakkam where the director’s office and residence respectively were located. He adjourned the case to Monday for further hearing.

In the direction petition filed through his counsel Vijayan Subramanian, the director said that he had commenced his career as an assistant director in 1993 and became a director in 2001 with Ajith-starrer Dheena. It was followed by his second directorial venture Ramana starring Vijayakant in which he created social awareness on corruption, red tapism and inefficiency.

After listing out his other blockbuster movies such as Ghajini (2005), Hindi remake of Ghajini (2008), Ezham Arivu (2011), Thuppaki (2012), its Hindi version Holiday, Kathi (2014), Hindi movie Akira (2016), Spyder (2017) and Sarkar (2018), the petitioner claimed to have been a unique director who not only entertains but also delivers a strong social message.

Stating that he got the opportunity to direct Darbar last year, he said, his work in the movie was limited to the creative part of it whereas the entire business of the movies was handled only by Lyca Productions. Despite knowing it well, some of the distributors were unnecessarily intimidating him, the petitioner complained.

He claimed that the distributors tresspassed into his office and threatened his staff. They also gathered outside his residence at a posh apartment complex in Saligramam, within Virugambakkam police station limits, and started abusing him using foul language, he alleged and urged the court to order police protection to his office as well as residence.

He further insisted on deputing a personal security officer too “to safeguard his life.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9s8qch/article30752547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARMURUGADOSSNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/darbar-director-ar-murugadoss-seeks-police-protection-as-distributors-demand-compensation/article30752548.ece
135,2020/02/06,The lost Kannada film 'Chanda Marutha': When the wild wind blows,"I have been looking for Pattabhi Rama Reddy’s Kannada film, Chanda Marutha (Wild Wind) for a while now, to no avail. The reason for the hunt is because it is connected to the democratic protests seen around the country since December 2019 and to the amazing revolutionary spirit of youth. Based on P. Lankesh’s beloved play, Kranthi Bantu Kranthi, Pattabhi Rama Reddy made the film just before the Emergency broke out.

It was the days of Jayaprakash Narayan’s 1974 call: “After 27 years of freedom, people of this country are wracked by hunger, rising prices, corruption, oppressed by every kind of injustice. It is a total revolution we want, nothing less.”

The cast was a veritable who’s who of Bangalore luminaries. Lankesh himself had previously acted as Narayanappa in Pattabhi’s Samskara. Bhaktavatsala Moola, producer of such Kannada films as Kanneswara Rama as well erstwhile company secretary of the leading newspapers of Karnataka, played the professor. Pattabhi’s wife, Snehalata Reddy, actress, writer, social activist, played the professor’s wife. Ashok Mandana, fresh out of National School of Drama and son of Congress MLC Jajie Mandana, played the student with Naxal leanings. Pattabhi’s children too were involved. Upcoming musician and guitar prodigy Konarak Reddy played a pacifist on hunger strike as well as composed the soundtrack. Nandana Ishbilya Reddy, trade union leader and social activist, both acted in and produced the film.

Akumal Ramachandra, now well-known as the one who stunned the art world with his discovery of Harold Shapinsky played a role. Tom Cowan, the young Australian documentary cinematographer who Pattabhi had met through S.G.Vasudev at Cholamandal Artists Village and who previously shot the multi-award winning Samskara, would shoot the film. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, already a well-known director with many Hindi hits to his name, came on board as editor. The film was shot at their old house at 58, St.Mark’s Road, Bangalore. But Pattabhi Rama Reddy, decided to make a small change: for the sake of cinema, he had the Professor’s wife die at the end. Shortly after the film was made, on June 26, 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a national Emergency.

There is more backstory. George Fernandes who was then a firebrand, idealistic labour union leader, was a close family friend and had been hiding at their home, the same old house at 58, St.Mark’s Road where Chanda Marutha was shot. After June 26th, when he wanted to cross the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border to meet with Karunanidhi, he requested Sneha’s help. He disguised himself as a Sikh, carrying a tennis racket, she played his wife and they drove to Madras. The rest is history, as the whole family including Nandana and Konarak were arrested under the controversial Maintenance of Internal Securities Act (MISA) that was passed under Indira Gandhi, in 1971. Sneha asked for their release and allowed herself to be detained instead. She was illegally incarcerated for nine and a half months, was finally released on bail to avoid a custodial death and died, five days after her release, on January 20, 1977.

Back to the film. T.G Vaidyanathan from the Department of English at Bangalore University, on seeing it, wrote a brilliant essay about how life had imitated art, in this case. He observed that George Fernandes hid, much as Ashok Mandana’s character hid, in the same house. When there was a fake call of “Telegram!” post midnight and the cops barged in, ripped out books from shelves and telephone wires and Konarak was arrested, it echoed the quality of the film. And Sneha’s character dies as she did in real life. The year was 1977.

In the course of my hunt, I spoke to Indrajit Lankesh for help locating it within the Kannada film industry. Besides reading Kranthi Bantu Kranthi from a young age, Indrajit has seen innumerable productions of it all over the state. Kranthi Bantu Kranthi is to Karnataka, what Badal Sircar’s Micheel/Procession is to West Bengal. It epitomises vox populi because in ethos and form, it belongs to the people. Therefore Indrajit too joined the hunt for Chanda Marutha. He asked people who have worked for Lankesh Patrike since its inception, but none remembered it. Thus the film is yet to be found.

Then two days ago, while looking through archives for some shooting scripts and production notes ,I came upon a gem. Pattabhi Rama Reddy’s shooting script titled The Wild Wind (Chanda Marutha). Based on P.Lankesh’s Kranthi Bantu Kranthi. Inside, I found written, in his handwriting, the following:

Advice to Oneself

1. Good days coming

Everything changes, the wheel

of the law turns without pause

After the rain, good weather,

In the wink of an eye

The universe throws off

Its muddy clothes

2. Without the cold and desolation of winter

There could not be the warmth and splendour of spring

Calamity has tempered and hardened me

And turned my mind into steel

Words to heed in these days of protest and solidarity, where our youth represent the

wild wind we so urgently need.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4xh1g7/article30752248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07bgfrkir2jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-lost-kannada-film-chanda-marutha-when-the-wild-wind-blows/article30752250.ece

The 60-year-old from Attappady in Wayanad district doesn’t know who Prithviraj or Biju Menon is or the movie she has sung for. But she has emerged a star on social media with her song in Sachy’s Ayyappanum Koshiyum, starring Prithviraj and Biju, reaching theatres today. Composed by Jakes Bejoy, the video of the title track, featuring recording sessions, was released last week. Not only her voice, but her naivety and lack of pretension during her interaction with Prithviraj have won her many fans.

“I am happy that people have loved our song,” she says with a laugh. The lyrics by Nanjamma are in her native Irula language, which goes, ‘Kalakkatha sandana maram vegu vega poothirikka...poo parikkan pokilamo vimanathe paakkilamo...’ (The sandal wood tree in the east has bloomed...shall we go to pluck the flowers and see the aeroplane). The song, passed on to her from her forefathers, is sung when a woman is feeding a child.

She has sung three more songs in the movie. Nanjamma, who belongs to Nakkupathy Pirivu ooru (colony), has been part of Attappady-based Azad Kala Samithi, which has been performing the dance and music of the region across Kerala and outside the state.

“We’ve performed at events organised by Folklore Academy and other art and cultural organisations. We’ve also staged our dance and songs at Utsav, organised by the Kerala government to promote traditional art and dance forms in all the districts,” says Pazhani Swamy S, leader of the Samithi.

Since the movie is set in Attappady, director Sachy wanted tribal songs to be included and that’s when he contacted the Samithi. “He listened to Nanji chechi and later a 11-member team from our troupe was called for a session in Kochi. Later, the songs were recorded in Chennai,” says Pazhani, a tribal watcher of the Forest Department, who has also acted in the film.

He adds that Nanjamma had very little idea about the reach of her song until people came in large numbers to meet her and reports about her were splashed in the media.

“She has been singing from childhood. She hasn’t gone to school and has been making a living rearing cattle. Being in the news is totally new for her. Chechi has acted in one of the song sequences as well,” Pazhani says. Besides a short film, she has sung in the state film award-winning film, Velutha Rathrikal.

The composer says that she wasn’t comfortable singing with the headset on. “She couldn’t keep up with the rhythm. So we had to adjust the tempo after the recording,” Jakes points out.

The title track was chosen from the many songs that Nanjamma and her team performed at the studio with their own percussion instruments. “My role was that of an enabler. The soul of the song is Nanjamma. And you never get bored listening to her even if she repeats the lines,” Jakes avers.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cr020x/article30750807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvmnanjamma,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/60-year-old-nanjamma-goes-viral-with-song-in-malayalam-film-ayyappanum-koshiyum/article30750812.ece

A week before the release, the actor shared the trailer on social media, posting, “I knew this was going to be my last love story, so we decided to make this one of its kind. Filled with all kinds of love. I present to you, #WorldFamousLover!”

The footage promises an engrossing love saga, set around the actor’s relationships with four different women, played by Raashi Khanna, Catherine Tresa, Izabelle Leite and Aishwarya Rajessh. The romances also follow different themes: a high school/ college love story, a husband and wife’s crumbling marriage, a boss and her employee’s intense relationship and two people from different countries hitting it off. However, it is unclear if the film follows the main protagonist’s (played by Deverakonda) life through various stages, or these are four separate stories altogether with four characters played by the same actor.

I knew this was going to be my last love story, so we decided to make this one of its kind.

138,2020/02/06,Vinesh Vishwanath zooms his lens on the passion of theatre artistes in 'Ee Bhoomeente Peru',"“All theatre artistes travel to stage their plays. But what do they get out of the trip? Why do they forsake all for theatre? What does the stage give them?” asks theatre activist Hazim Amiravila, in a post on Facebook.

Ee Bhoomeente Peru, a documentary by Vinesh Vishwanath, tries to provide answers to these queries. A nearly 31-minute documentary, Ee Bhoomeente Peru goes behind the scenes to take viewers into the intense world of theatre even as it highlights the amount of collaboration it takes to make magic happen at each performance. The documentary zooms in on artistes from city-based Kanal Samskarika Vedi as they travel to Dibrugarh, Assam for Bharat Rang Mahotsav (BRM).

Kanal Samskarika Vedi’s Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, one of the three plays from Kerala to be selected for (BRM) last year, has been setting the stage alight with its hard-hitting take against superstition, fascism and attempts to silence protests against curbs on freedom of expression. An adaptation of a short story by KR Meera, Veendum Bhagavante Maranam depicts the problems that arise when a theatre group tries to dramatise Meera’s story to protest against the assassination of a well-known author. The metaplay also portrays the intellectual differences between the actors and the inner politics within the troupe.

The opening shot of Ee Bhoomeente Peru begins with 30 actors of Kanal preparing backstage for their play at BRM. Narrated in a non-linear manner, the film then jumps to Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station where family and friends see off the artistes as they embark on their journey to Dibrugarh, 4,169 km by rail, from Thiruvananthapuram.

For filmmaker Vinesh, it was a new experience as he was not a theatre person and had often thought that the stage was a stepping stone to cinema for many. “It was not until I started assisting Kanal as a technician and an artiste that I realised theatre is so much more; an independent art form in itself. The Kanal artistes come from all walks of life. They had to be away from their family, work and other commitments for 13 days for the staging of the play at Dibrugarh. It made me wonder why they do it. What I got out of the journey, and my experiences with the troupe are some of the highlights of the documentary.”

According to Vinesh, who has directed short films such as Chaos Theory, Karu and Tomorrowland, he had initially planned to shoot a short film with the Kanal artistes during the period of their stay in Assam. “However, I felt shouting out ‘cut’ and ‘action’ during the trip would spoil the fun for the whole group, so I dropped the idea.”

It was the day before their journey to Dibrugarh that the thought of a docu-journey popped up. “Reshma, one of the actors of Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, held her wedding reception on January 31, 2019. We were set to leave for Assam on February 1. It was during the reception that Kannan Nayar chettan, another theatre artiste, suggested shooting a narrative of the journey. As it was an impromptu decision, there was no scripting or planning involved.”

Vinesh, along with his friend, Anand Manmadhan, started the shoot of Ee Bhoomeente Peru right from Reshma’s wedding reception.

Vinesh chuckles as he says: “Although we were two cinematographers at the start, by the end of the trip, there were many. I had requested the members of the group to shoot what they could on their mobile phones and everyone obliged. While some captured scenes in Dibrugarh, others caught the bonhomie during the train journey or narrated what they observed and more.”

Vinesh had to put the editing work for Ee Bhoomeente Peru on hold for over a year, as he worked as assistant director for Prasobh Vijayan’s Anweshanam. The editor of Ee Bhoomeente Peru, Kailash S Bhavan, had four-and-a-half hours of footage after the initial edit. “It was tough trimming it down to the length it is now,” says Vinesh.

For Hazim, the director of Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, staging plays can be frustrating as each show is essentially “written on sand. What’s staged once is gone forever as that exact performance will never happen twice. It’s what makes theatre unique. There is very little appreciation for theatre and acting itself, even amongst people who are culturally aware.”

Theatre, according to Hazim, is team effort. “Even if a play is rehearsed innumerable times, the artistes, after sensing the pulse of the audience, tend to tweak it to garner their attention. The artistes on stage need to be in sync with the others because when one artiste changes the words or gestures on stage, the other artiste needs to pick up the cue and respond accordingly. There needs to be a strong bond of camaraderie between artistes if we need to stage a play successfully. We were fortunate that Vinesh captured on camera our journey and our performance at BRM so that the fun and the memories stay fresh,” Hazim says.

Encore, Encore Veendum Bhagavante Maranam has been staged 35 times. The cast includes Chinchu K Bhavani, Reshma, Kannan Nayar, Santhosh Venjaramoodu, Arun Nair and Viju Varma.

Kanal Samskarika Vedhi, a cultural organisation formed in 2008 by alumni of the Centre for Performing and Visual Arts, aims at promoting cultural programmes and artistic talents. Kanal has staged over 14 plays. Veendum Bhagavante Maranam is Kanal’s 13th play.

Vinesh who dons the role of a cop in Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, says the name for the documentary was inspired by ‘Ee Bhoomeente Peru Aanu Nadakam’, a song Kannan rendered on an impulse at BRM at the end of the play. “The audience did not understand the lyrics but were clapping to the beat of the song. The audience’s applause and appreciation get us going. It was nice to represent our State at a prestigious platform such as the BRM,” says Hazim.

Ee Bhoomeente Peru, will be staged at Ganesham, Thycaud, the venue in which the play made its debut in 2018, on February 7, 6.45 pm. The programme is open to the public.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1rk77p/article30750666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvmBhagavante,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vinesh-vishwanath-zooms-his-lens-on-the-passion-of-theatre-artistes-in-ee-bhoomeente-peru/article30750669.ece
139,2020/02/06,Mollywood actor Neeraj Madhav is riding high on success after 'The Family Man',"If Neeraj Madhav is scaling new heights, he has had to do it the hard way. Beginning with small roles in cinema, he moved on to essay more significant characters before hitting the big time towards the end of last year in the Amazon Prime series The Family Man, directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D K.

He acted in the lead in Anand Menon’s Gauthamante Radham, which was released last week. Neeraj has some exciting projects to look forward to, including a high-profile one in Bollywood. Excerpts from an interview with him...

How would you trace your career as an actor...

There have been times when things have happened out of the blue in my career and times when I have had to push myself.

I always wanted to be an actor but lacked the confidence. It was after Drishyam that people started identifying me as an actor. For the next two years, I had a smooth ride although I was known as a comedian.

When things started turning stale, I began looking for solid roles. Oozham and Oru Mexican Aparatha gave me what I was looking for then. After that, I decided to try for a lead role, which I did in Paipin Chuvattile Pranayam.

The offer for The Family Man came out of the blue and it has proved to be a real game changer.

Has the experience in The Family Man changed you as an actor?

The directors, Raj and DK, chose me after watching my movies. They believe in the collaborative process of filmmaking and gave me a lot of freedom while shooting for The Family Man, which was refreshing. They were all ears to my suggestions. They did not tell me what to do but only what not to do.

Also, working with Manoj Bajpayee was a wonderful learning experience. He comes up with something new each time the crew goes for a fresh take.

In The Family Man, your character is unlike what you had done before. How did you prepare for the part?

Actors in Bollywood do a lot of homework on the characters they play. I am not used to doing such preparations, unless a physical transformation is needed.

Usually, we observe people around us for references. However, as I was playing a terrorist in The Family Man, there were no such opportunities. The directors approached the characters in a humane way, by entering their minds and analysing why they do what they do. I approached the role scene by scene, adding the emotions that suited the character at that point.

Are you happy with the way your career has evolved?

I feel there should be a personal growth as an actor or else the job becomes mundane. You can do a couple of roles for fun or for money but then you need to start looking for roles with substance. I have always wanted to act in Tamil movies, as I feel my dancing skills can be highlighted there. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would be entering the Hindi film industry. When Amitabh Bachchan recognised me during an event, I was on cloud nine.

And you played the lead in Gauthamante Radham and Paipin Chuvattile Pranayam?

Be it the lead role or a small role, the effort one puts in is the same. However, when playing the lead, you have to shoulder more responsibility, like ensuring the satellite revenue, the opening collection...

Since I was on a hiatus from the Malayalam industry while shooting for The Family Man, I was sceptical while doing Gauthamante Radham. I invested some quality time into this project and called Basil Joseph to become the creative director. In between, The Family Man came out and was a hit, which was reassuring.

Gauthamante Radham is about the emotions one feels towards one’s first vehicle, which, I feel, is something most of us can relate to.

There are reports that you had to turn down Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore.

I did an audition for Chhichhore. I met Nitesh and he wanted me to play the character Sexa. But they needed bulk dates, which I couldn’t commit to as I was busy with The Family Man.

You wrote Lavakusha (2017). Do you have plans to write more scripts?

Of course. I wrote Lavakusha as a spy comedy in the lines of films such as 21 Jump Street, which had a mix of humour and action. However, while I had targeted the film for a young audience, the movie was made in a different way, more focused on families and kids.

As an excellent dancer, why haven’t you done more choreography for film songs?

Dance comes easily to me and I enjoy it. I had to do the choreography for ‘Enne Thallendammaava’ (in Oru Vadakkan Selfie) as the situation was such that we had to either shoot it on our own or break the schedule. While shooting the song was a thrilling experience, choreography was not a part of my plan.

Do you have any Bollywood dreams?

Actually, I am all set to sign a Bollywood movie with a top banner. However, I can’t reveal any more details now. I am doing Rajeeshlal Vamsha’s Ka.

The Adi Kapyare Koottamani team is coming back with Paathira Kurbana. Then I am playing the lead in my brother Navneeth Madhav’s directorial debut, Ennile Villain, which I am co-writing as well.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8noh7x/article30741936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvfNeeraj1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mollywood-actor-neeraj-madhav-is-riding-high-on-success-after-the-family-man/article30741937.ece
140,2020/02/06,New TV show on Marilyn Monroe in the works,"A TV series based on the final months of Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe’s life before her death in August 1962 is being developed.

The project from Yellowstone producer 101 Studios and UK production company Seven Seas Films, is based on Keith Badman’s non-fiction book The Final Years of Marilyn Monroe.

It’s also the first filmed project about the late star’s life to be endorsed by Authentic Brands Group, the owner of the Monroe estate. Seven Seas Films acquired the rights to Badman’s book in 2017, reports hollywoodreporter.com.

“Marilyn Monroe is an enigmatic icon whose multifaceted life continues to inspire and intrigue us,” said Katie Jones, VP brand at Authentic Brands Group.

“She was a trailblazer who forged her own path, during a time when women’s voices were often ignored and silenced. It is the perfect time to tell her iconic story as the challenges she faced are still prevalent in women’s lives today.”

The potential series will chronicle the turbulent final months of Monroe’s life, leading up to her death in 1962. It will follow her at a time when she found herself caught between warring factions of the Mafia, the Kennedy political dynasty and the Hollywood elite, including her dealings with Peter Lawford, who’s believed to be the last person to speak to Monroe before her death on August 5, 1962.

101 Studios CEO David Glasser said: “Beloved movie legend Marilyn Monroe has had many memoirs created about her life, but none quite like this. Keith Badman has uncovered gems of never-before-released details, centered around the last few months of her sensationalised life and the accusations made. The series pays homage to the bright star whose life was extinguished too early.”

Seven Seas Films co-founder Dan Sefton added: “Many people think they know the truth about Marilyn Monroe’s final months, but it’s a complicated and tragic story; one which we want to depict with compassion and sensitivity.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/v342ko/article30750572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARILYNMONROEAUCTION,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/new-tv-show-on-marilyn-monroe-in-the-works/article30750573.ece
141,2020/02/06,Remembering the endearing N. Krishnaswamy,"The demise of N. Krishnaswamy, a pioneer in the Tamil film industry, has left a host of artistes of different age groups, sad. Producer, writer, director, magazine editor and dramatist, Krishnaswamy was the first to start an open-air theatre and he was closely associated with the small screen too, producing informative tele-films and serials. A giant in his own way, he is also remembered for his kindness, knowledge, perfection and humility.

Says ‘Villu Paatu’ Subbu Arumugam: “A friend of 60 years, he was more like a brother. Our first meeting was during the making of Paditha Manaivi. Poet Bharatidasan was invited to write the songs. Krishnaswamy described the situation in impeccable English. I explained to the legendary poet that he was explaining the meaning for the line ‘Thooya Ullam.’ The poet was elated and wrote the lyrics. I like perfection, a quality he appreciated. He took me along when he visited VIPs such as Papanasam Sivan, M.K. Radha, N.S. Krishnan, ‘Kothamangalam’ Subbu and ‘Kaviarasu’ Kannadasan. He was an ardent admirer of my Villupattu. He never made a change in my writing. Once, for Pongal, he came to my house with gifts of clothes. I was so moved. That was also the first time I wore a silk dhothi and shirt in my life time.”

Actor Y.Gee. Mahendra: I acted in Anbudan Aruna, the first tele-feature film in Tamil by N. Krishnaswamy. Some of the important decisions we made were connected with his family. The Nungambakkam Ladies Club was started and Mrs. Jayalakshmi Krishnasamy was its secretary. As there were no schools in that area, they started one with my mother Rajalakshmi Parthasarathy as the headmistress. Former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj along with Ms. Manju Bashini named the school “Bala Bhavan,” which grew by leaps and bounds to become Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan. The classes were conducted on the terrace of our house. Every week, we would get together on the terrace and screen the film Padikatha Methai, produced by Krishnaswamy. He would show that film in 16-mm projection and I watched it several times. In fact, my worship of Sivaji Ganesan began right then. I have acted in some of his television serials, which he directed and produced.

Actor Sachu: I was the heroine in his “Mel Maadi Gaali,” a comedy serial shot for Madras Door Darshan Kendra. It was a huge hit, Vivek doing the main role. An able administrator, Krishnaswamy was the master of all arts. A good director and writer, he knew how much dialogue a scene required. I acted in another serial, “Melmaravathur Bangaru Adigalar, Amma,” who was Krishanswamy’s spiritual guru.

Actor ‘Kavithalaya’ Krishnan remembers Krishnaswamy as a humble and sweet person. I had the opportunity to work in his serial. We both were coffee addicts and he made sure that I got my coffee made from his home. We shot the scenes in Nanganallur and he insisted that the crew had lunch together. I’m an ardent admirer of Sivaji Ganesan and on my request, Krishnaswamy would tirelessly recount anecdotes about the legend. Krishnaswamy had a high regard for K. Balachander, my guru and would give me wonderful insights about some of the KB’s films and the man in general. Once we were shooting near the airport and I was supposed to join my family on a pilgrimage. It was getting late. So he finished all my shots first so that I could leave. Such was his understanding.”

Carnatic singer Charumathi Ramachandran: Enkay, as we called him affectionately, was a pioneer filmmaker, next only to K. Subrahmanyam and his brother Viswanathan. Our family was closely associated with him. He was the first student of the Chennai film institute (then Madras) and a founder-member of the Film Institute, Pune. Enkay became famous for memorable documentaries. His ‘Golden Greats’ series for Podhigai on Veena Dhanam, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, GNB, T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai, M.L. Vasanthakumari and others were well-researched. My husband Trichur Ramachandran and I were interviewed extensively for our gurus’ documentaries (GNB and MLV). The ‘Raga Lakshana’ and ‘Composers’ series for Podhigai, featured the lecture-demonstration of my daughter Subhasree and myself. Enkay again invited me for singing for the freedom songs in Tamil. Incidentally, he was well-versed in Carnatic music.” .

Actor Ramesh Kanna: I would remember Krishnaswamy as a fine human being. He was a father figure to me. When I acted in his serial, I was not that popular, but he treated me on par with the main artiste. We both were deeply religious and he took me to his mentor Sri Bangaru Adigal. A perfectionist, he was strict on the sets but off it, he was relaxed and mingled with everyone. He co-produced the English film Sandokan with Kabir Bedi as the hero. Multi-faceted, he also produced and directed Manshulu Marali in Telugu with Sarada as its heroine. All those who enjoyed his warmth will definitely miss him.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/42cc4f/article30750420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FR07KRISHNASWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/remembering-the-endearing-n-krishnaswamy/article30750422.ece

143,2020/02/06,Kajal Aggarwal: The Madame Tussauds recognition is one of the nicest rewards for my 15 years of hard work,"On Wednesday, when her wax statue was unveiled at Madame Tussauds in Singapore, Kajal Aggarwal had the distinction of being the first female South Indian actor to be immortalised thus at the museum. Dressed in a purple pantsuit, Kajal unveiled her wax figure amid a cheering gathering that included her family members.

Fielding questions later in the day, Kajal tells MetroPlus, “There’s an immense sense of gratitude; I’m overwhelmed and humbled by this honour and recognition by Madame Tussauds Singapore. I am happy and grateful for all the love, support and encouragement because of which I’ve been able to achieve this milestone.” When the team from Madame Tussauds contacted her about this, at first she didn’t believe it. It sunk in when she got an official email. “I had tears in my eyes. I was overwhelmed with emotions. I felt a lot of joy but at the same time I felt humbled and responsible for wanting to supersede my personal expectations as well as the expectations that people around me have,” says the actor.

Kajal debuted in a supporting role in the Hindi film Kyun Ho Gaya Na (2004) but the Telugu and Tamil film industries put her in the spotlight, before she courted Hindi cinema again years later. The wax statue, says Kajal, feels like recognition of her work and, “I think it is one of the nicest and sweetest rewards that I have got for the past 15 years of hard work. I asked Madame Tussauds what were the criteria of my selection and they said it’s based on the body of my work and on popular demand. And [the selection was] after screening by a panel of 30 members around the globe, their discussions as well as the voting of fans.”

The actor vividly recalls the preparations, when she spent a day with the London team to give her measurements: “Every part of my body was measured — my nails, my hair, the colour of my skin, eyes, teeth, hair — everything was selected and approved by me. I selected the posture and expression, and the outfit and styling was by my wonderful stylist Archa and this amazing designer who came on board, Yusuf Alrazmi. He gave us this wonderful outfit that weighs eight kilograms and is made of Swarovksi crystals.”

The euphoria surrounding the recognition is yet to fully sink in, but Kajal pauses to mention that it’s a matter of pride for her family who have been supportive of her journey: “[There have been] a lot of sacrifices on part of my parents and my sister and for all of us, it is a moment of pride and it’s emotional.” Looking ahead, Kajal states that she feels more responsible than before as an actor and a public personality. There are personal and professional goals she’s set for herself: “I feel responsible for the kind of work I do, the impact it has on society, and the influence I have on people. I will try my best to live up to it,” she signs off.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/k0phjm/article30749238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kajal-Aggarwal-with-her-wax-statue-at-Madame-Tussauds-Singapore,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kajal-aggarwal-the-madame-tussads-recognition-is-one-of-the-nicest-rewards-for-my-15-years-of-hard-work/article30749239.ece
144,2020/02/06,How a conversation between Mani Ratnam and Dhana led to ‘Vaanam Kottattum’,"The first time Dhana saw Mani Ratnam’s name was when Doordarshan played Agni Natchathiram. “Back then, it was advertised as a ‘Mani Ratnam’ film and that was something new. My whole family was a fan of Mani sir,” recalls the Padaiveeran director, sitting at the Madras Talkies office at Kesavaperumalpuram.

When he was still in school, Bombay released and all hell broke loose. “Pithu pudichu alanjen (‘I went crazy’),” he says, “The film didn’t release in our village near Kodaikanal, but in Theni, which was quite a distance for us school-going kids. Our tuition master took pity on me and took all of us to the film.”

He still calls the Arvind Swami-Manisha Koirala film ‘Bombaai’ — in a rustic Tamil way. Many years later, the rural life he lived would form the core idea for his script that would, interestingly, be produced by Mani Ratnam’s production house.

That is Vaanam Kottattum (VK), releasing this week, as a result of many detailed discussions between Dhana and Mani Ratnam. “It started with a conversation,” he says, explaining, “After the release of Kadal, in which I was an assistant, Mani sir and I were discussing, when he asked about my family. I opened up on them — on my periappa who had a distinctive way of wearing glasses and folding his shirt, my mother who was the sole breadwinner of the family. All these characters decided the course of the story.”

Director Dhana

VK fell in place before Mani Ratnam embarked on his dream project, Ponniyin Selvan, which he is currently shooting.

“He was completely involved in it; he has spent a lot of time and effort. VK is also his baby... it’s just that Ponniyin Selvan is a bigger baby.”

Dhana describes VK as a “family-oriented movie” that encompasses names like Vikram Prabhu, Madonna Sebastian, Shanthnoo, Aishwarya Rajesh, Sarath Kumar and Radikaa. “Isn’t that everything?” he asks, “We might lead different lives and work in different professions, but at the end of the day, we all have a family to go back to. VK explores that emotion.”

VK has considerable emphasis on romance, widely regarded to be Mani Ratnam’s forte. “There are three styles of romance here — urban, confused love (featuring Aishwarya Rajesh), fun love (featuring Vikram Prabhu) and the mature husband-wife relationship, played by Sarath Kumar and Radikaa,” reveals Dhana.

Set in Triplicane, where he lived for a few years when he migrated to Chennai, VK’s storyline also looks into the banana distribution business, which Dhana’s family was involved in. “But don’t ask me what genre the film is,” he smiles, “There are different cues for different genres, but we’ve tried to keep VK based on life. Just like life, there are different emotions captured in the film as well.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q6ehwm/article30749014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6MPvaanamkjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vaanam-kottatum-will-be-based-on-life-says-director-dhana/article30749015.ece
145,2020/02/06,"Kirk Douglas, Hollywood's tough guy on screen and off, dead at 103","Kirk Douglas, the cleft-chinned movie star who fought gladiators, cowboys and boxers on the screen and the Hollywood establishment, died on Wednesday at the age of 103, his son Michael Douglas said.

""It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,"" Michael Douglas said in a statement to People magazine and on his Facebook page.

""To the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to,"" Douglas added.

Kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet, Michael added, saying he was “so proud” to be his father's son.

Douglas made more than 90 movies in a career that stretched across seven decades and films such as “Spartacus” and “The Vikings” made him one of the biggest box-office stars of the 1950s and '60s.

He also played a major role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist - actors, directors and writers who were shunned professionally because of links to the communist movement in the 1950s. Douglas said he was more proud of that than any film he made.

Tributes poured in from Hollywood. Actor and director Rob Reiner said on Twitter that Douglas “will always be an icon in the pantheon of Hollywood. He put himself on the line to break the blacklist.”

Mitzi Gaynor, who appeared with Douglas in the 1963 movie ”For Love or Money,” said the film would “always hold a special place in my heart.”

Bravo Kirk Douglas on an incredible life. Thank you for so generously sharing your amazing talent with all of us. The film we made together will always hold a special place in my heart. My love to Anne & your beautiful family. #KirkDouglas — Mitzi Gaynor (@TheMitziGaynor) February 5, 2020

Danny DeVito called him an “inspirational Scallywag,” while Ed Asner tweeted “I will always be in your awe.”

A stroke in 1996 at age 80 left Douglas with slurred speech and damaged facial nerves. But two weeks later he showed his spirit by attending the Academy Awards ceremony to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. He also continued to take small acting roles through 2008 but said the stroke left him suicidal.

“Humor saved me,” Douglas told Parade magazine in 2014. “At first, I thought my life was at an end. But when I put the gun in my mouth, it hit a tooth. Ow! And that struck me funny. A toothache was stopping me from committing suicide?”

In one of his last public appearances, Douglas was frail and barely audible in a wheelchair as he helped daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones present the Oscar for best screenplay in January 2018. In November of that year he joined his son Michael as the younger Douglas was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Douglas had a distinctive chin, razor-sharp cheekbones and a jutting jaw - looks that he passed along to Michael - and that made him a natural for playing all manner of rugged characters.

He also had a demanding nature that earned him a reputation in his prime as the actor who directed directors. Long-time friend and sometime co-star Burt Lancaster loved to introduce him by saying, “Kirk would be the first to admit he is a difficult person. (Pause) I would be the second.”

“I make my own way,” Douglas once told an interviewer. ”Nobody's my boss. Nobody's ever been my boss ... I've been a maverick.”

Douglas said playing Vincent van Gogh in “Lust for Life” (1956) was his favorite role but “Spartacus” (1960) was his favorite film because, as producer, he took a big step toward breaking the Hollywood blacklist.

The lifetime Oscar was Douglas' only Academy Award even though he was nominated for playing ruthless boxer Midge Kelly in “Champion” (1949), a movie executive in “The Bad and the Beautiful” (1952) and van Gogh in “Lust for Life.”

Douglas' first movie was “The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,” in 1946 after being suggested for the part by acting school classmate Betty Joan Perske, who became famous after changing her name to Lauren Bacall. Douglas was known for powerful performances as characters who had to endure intense on-screen pain. He was stabbed in “Ace in the Hole,” crucified in “Spartacus,” lost an eye in “The Vikings,” an ear in “Lust for Life,” and a finger in “The Big Sky.”

His other notable movies were “Lonely Are the Brave,” “The Devil's Disciple,” “Victory at Entebbe” and “Tough Guys,” which he made with Lancaster in 1986.

Douglas' independent streak led him to set up Bryna Production Co, which he named after his mother, in 1955, snubbing big studio bosses and helping break their monopoly on the industry.

Hollywood ladies' man

Born Issur Danielovich on Dec. 9, 1916, in Amsterdam, New York, Douglas was the only son of seven children born to illiterate Russian immigrants. After graduating from high school, he hitch-hiked to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, where he became a wrestling champion. He also staged and starred in theatrical productions and changed his name to Izzy Demsy. After St. Lawrence, he graduated from New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1941 and changed his name to Kirk Douglas. He joined the Navy following two small Broadway roles. While in the Navy he married British actress Diana Dill and they had two sons, Michael and Joel, before the marriage ended after eight years.

Douglas had a reputation as a Hollywood ladies' man. Among the lovers listed in the 1988 book “The Ragman's Son,” one of several books he wrote about his life, were Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Maxwell, Patricia Neal and Gene Tierney.

While making “Act of Love,” Douglas met and Anne Buydens, the film's publicist, and they married in 1954. Their marriage became one of Hollywood's most enduring despite his affairs. They had two sons, Peter and Eric.

Douglas, who survived a 1991 helicopter crash that killed two people, tried to discourage his children from following him into acting. Still, Michael became a superstar and a successful producer, Joel and Peter also were producers and Eric was an actor until his 2004 death from a drug overdose. “You see how they listened to me,” Douglas once said.

Douglas, who grew a long white ponytail in his later years, published several books, including a book of poetry, prose and photographs in 2014 and Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter and a Lifetime in Hollywood,” in 2017 with his wife.

He established the Douglas Foundation for making charitable donations and in 2015 he and Anne announced plans to give away his $80 million fortune to a variety of causes. The beneficiaries included a shelter for homeless women named after Anne, the Los Angeles public school district, St. Lawrence University and hospitals.

To mark his 99th birthday in 2015 he donated $15 million to the Motion Picture and Television Fund to help build a facility for entertainment industry figures with Alzheimers disease.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/e6kgpt/article30748204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITKIRKDOUGLAS1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kirk-douglas-hollywoods-tough-guy-on-screen-and-off-dead-at-103/article30748207.ece

A source in the investigating agency told The Hindu on Thursday that evidence had surfaced pointing to at least five VAOs who adopted fraudulent means to clear the examination. The examination was conducted on February 14, 2016, to fill up 813 vacancies of VAOs in Tamil Nadu Ministerial Service.

The objective type examination was held covering General Studies, Basics in Village Administration, Aptitude & Mental Ability Test and General Tamil/English in centres located across the State.

“We have arrested one suspect (a serving VAO) who admitted to have paid money to pass the examination. Special teams are on the lookout for four others. There is a possibility that many other candidates (VAOs) would have passed the examination with the help of middlemen,” a senior investigator said.

Suspect surrenders

Meanwhile the prime suspect in the recruitment scam, S. Jayakumar of Mogappair who remained elusive surrendered in a city court on Thursday. He was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

147,2020/02/06,Tamil Nadu to create a pool of teachers for English communication training,"The Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TANSCHE) has initiated steps to create a pool of resource personnel to train and improve the English proficiency of college students, particularly those from government colleges.

In a letter sent to all the Regional Joint Directors of Collegiate Education, TANSCHE has asked for a list of faculty members who are proficient in English. The list can include those from departments other than English as well, it said. TANSCHE has asked for the names of retired faculty members who are willing to train students to be included as well.

Those who have completed certificate courses on training from institutions like British Council, those who are evaluators for English proficiency examinations like TOEFL and IELTS, those who are trained soft skill or personality development trainers and those who have already undergone the soft skills training programme organised by TANSCHE are to be part of this resource pool.

Apart from this, TANSCHE has also asked for details on the number of undergraduate students, the presence of English language labs and availability of wireless internet connection in all the colleges.

Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan has on several occasions stressed the need for imparting English communication training, particularly to those from government colleges, to improve their employability.

Sources in the Higher Education Department said that a renewed push is being given regarding this after Selvi Apoorva took charge as the Higher Education Secretary in the last week of January.

“There is an urgent need to improve the English proficiency of students, We have just initiated the process. A detailed plan on how the training can be provided will be developed in the near future,” an official from the department said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dc6gqh/article30750994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06FEBTH--COLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-to-create-a-pool-of-teachers-for-english-communication-training/article30750995.ece
148,2020/02/06,BJP challenges Stalin to debate on CAA,"BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao on Thursday challenged DMK president M.K. Stalin to a debate on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).​

Addressing mediapersons in Coimbatore, he said that the debate could take place “in any village” of Mr. Stalin’s choice “in the next 20 days.” ​

“We are going to challenge DMK in every village,” he asserted. Claiming that no Indian Muslims would be affected by the contentious Act, Mr. Rao urged Mr. Stalin to explain the reasons the DMK is opposing the CAA. He accused the DMK of “demanding citizenship” for the Muslims of Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Rohingyas of Myanmar.​

Mr. Rao said that the BJP would conduct conferences, public meetings and door-to-door campaigns in support of CAA in Tamil Nadu. He also welcomed those who have recently supported the CAA, including actor Rajinikanth.​

Mr. Rao also welcomed the setting up of an autonomous trust, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, which was announced on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Mr. Rao questioned the DMK as to why the party has not welcomed the construction of Ram temple yet.​

He dismissed allegations of a rift in the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the State. The new BJP president for Tamil Nadu will be announced after the Delhi elections, Mr. Rao added.​

Senior BJP leaders Pon. Radhakrishnan and C.P. Radhakrishnan were present.​

149,2020/02/06,Tamil Nadu Forest Minister Dindigul Sreenivasan gets tribal boy to take off his slippers,"Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan sparked outrage on Thursday, after he instructed a tribal boy at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) to remove his slippers so that he could enter a shrine at the camp.

Later in the evening, the boy submitted a complaint to the police, who however, did not register an FIR at the time of filing this report.

Mr. Sreenivasan, who arrived at the camp to inaugurate the annual rejuvenation camp for captive elephants, called to one of two boys from the Kurumba tribal community, aged 14.

The Minister was standing outside a shrine at the elephant camp and asked the youth to unbuckle his slippers.

When the boy began unbuckling Mr. Sreenivasan’s slippers, waiting photographers tried to take pictures, but were chided by the Minister, who asked them to stop. Coonoor MLA ‘Shanthi’ A. Ramu blocked photographers from clicking clear photographs of the incident.

After Mr. Sreenivasan entered the shrine, another member of his entourage asked the boy to pick up the slippers and leave them at the entrance of the shrine.

After the incident sparked outrage, Mr. Sreenivasan expressed his “regret” at the incident.

“I saw two small boys playing near me, so I asked one of them to help me take off my slippers… the little boy is like my grandson, if anyone’s feelings were hurt, they are a source of regret,” he told journalists.

However, C. Chikbomman, village headman of Theppakadu, urged the Minister to apologise to the community.

“We see the incident as an insult to the community at large and a reflection of the attitude of politicians towards tribal groups,” said Mr. Chikbomman.

He added that after consultations with other village heads, the community plans to stage protests against the Minister.

Senthil Kumar, general secretary of the Mudumalai Pazhangudiyinar Nala Sangam, also issued a statement condemning the Minister’s actions.

“It is deeply regrettable that the Minister, tasked with protecting the interests of the forests and the people that depend on them, has acted in such an insensitive manner,” he said. Mr. Senthil Kumar added that the Minister has committed an offense under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

In the evening, the boy submitted a complaint stating that he felt “humiliated” by the episode, and said that he went home straight after the incident “in tears”. The boy urged the police to register a case against Mr. Sreenivasan, under relevant sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

In the complaint, he said that the Minister and the officials were aware that he belonged to an indigenous tribal community, and that he felt pressured and “afraid” to do as the Minister said. The Masinagudi police accepted his complaint, but said that no FIR has been registered so far.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8asuue/article30752830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Minister-tribalboyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-forest-minister-dindigul-sreenivasan-gets-tribal-boy-to-take-off-his-slippers/article30748707.ece
150,2020/02/06,"Rajinikanth has become a puppet in BJP’s hands, say Tamil Nadu Opposition leaders","Political leaders in the State condemned actor Rajinikanth's statement in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Wednesday.

DMK president M.K. Stalin said there was nothing new in the allegation that political parties were instigating students to protest, since the same allegation was made during the anti-Hindi agitation.

“Just like the anti-Hindi agitation was a success, the present agitation will also prevail,” he tweeted.

Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram expressed disappointment over the actor’s remarks. “If he had asked me, I would have explained to him why the CAA is discriminatory and violates Article 14 of the Constitution,” he tweeted.

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said the actor had become a puppet in the hands of the ruling BJP at the Centre. ""I would like to warn you that till now, you have been talking about issues after being advised by some people. If this continues, it will be your downfall,” Mr. Alagiri said, addressing the actor. He said the actor should compare the most recent amendment to the citizenship law with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 1955 before commenting on the issue. “You are an expert in speaking dialogues written by others in cinema. But in politics, you have to ask yourself if you have understood what others have written for you,” he said.

The Congress leader said CAA, NPR and NRC were interlinked and had the same agenda. “If this comes into force, 17 crore Muslims, three crore Christians and even 83 crore Hindus will be affected. In Assam, 19 lakh citizens were declared as foreigners. Does Mr. Rajinikanth know that Muslims and Hindus were part of this list? Does he want detention centres to be set up across the country, like in Assam?” he asked. “It is clear that Mr. Rajinikanth has decided to carry out the BJP’s communal agenda in Tamil Nadu, and his so-called spiritual politics has now been exposed,” Mr. Alagiri said.

‘Don’t twist facts’

CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said the Constitution very clearly laid out that citizens cannot be discriminated against on the basis of religion. He said Mr. Rajinikanth must first understand that the Census and the National Population Register were different things. “He has become a puppet in the hands of the BJP and is supporting the BJP. Let him support them, but he should not twist facts,” he added.

He alleged that Mr. Rajinikanth’s voice was that of the RSS and the BJP, and there was nothing new in the view he had expressed on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

On Mr. Rajinikanth’s statement that he would be the first to raise his voice if Indian Muslims were to be affected by the CAA, Mr. Balakrishnan said, ”Where was his voice when Mohammed Akhlaq and other Muslims were lynched (by cow vigilantes), allegedly for carrying beef? Did he raise his voice for the Muslims of Gujarat?”

MLA and founder of the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi M. Thamimun Ansari said, “At a time when there are controversies over his tax payments, he’s trying to divert people’s attention by supporting the BJP. Will Mr. Rajinikanth be able to produce the documents of his forefathers? Does he have them? People are protesting of their own accord. It is condemnable that Mr. Rajinikanth has said political parties are instigating people to protest.”

BJP national general secretary H. Raja said Mr. Rajinikanth was right on CAA. “He has understood the issue fully and has spoken the facts,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lmg4a4/article30716924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-has-become-a-puppet-in-bjps-hands-say-oppn-leaders/article30746260.ece
151,2020/02/06,Rajini-Kamal alliance prospects on thin ice,"Actor Rajinikanth’s blunt statement in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Population Register has cast serious doubts on the possibility of an alliance between him and fellow film star and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan for the Assembly election in 2021.

In November last year, Mr. Rajinikanth and Mr. Haasan hinted at the possibility of fighting the Assembly election together in an alliance “for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu”, sparking widespread speculation.

Senior MNM leaders were called to a meeting at the party’s headquarters on Wednesday to discuss, among other issues, Mr. Rajinikanth’s latest comments and whether having an alliance with him would be of any benefit to the party.

MNM general secretary (Organisation) A.G. Mourya said the party and its founder will stick to their declared stance against the CAA. When asked if Mr. Rajinikanth’s latest comments on CAA-NRC-NPR meant that any potential Kamal-Rajini alliance was well and truly off the table, Mr. Mourya said, “We are sticking to our view and we have not changed it. Mr. Rajinikanth is free to have his opinion. We do not have an alliance with him yet.” “We never said we will compromise to make it (the alliance) happen. We are against what he is [for] now. We will not change it now or in future – this is our stand,” he added.

Despite Mr. Rajinikanth’s insistence that he will pursue ‘spiritual politics’, last November’s developments suggested that the two actors could find common ground and the alliance was a ‘done deal’. “This deal is apparently on thin ice,” said an MNM leader who attended Wednesday’s meeting.

A senior member of the party’s leadership group said they were ‘puzzled’ by Mr. Rajinikanth’s comments, and that there was growing concern in the MNM camp that they may be forced to constantly defend his statements if he and Mr. Haasan become allies. “If there are too many disagreements, how can we fix the alliance? We have to fundamentally agree on basic principles. An opportunistic alliance cannot be justified. We are very uncomfortable. We still hope Mr. Rajinikanth will change his views,” the member said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wj7c9w/article30005188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18NOVTH--RAJINIKAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-kamal-alliance-prospects-on-thin-ice/article30746258.ece
152,2020/02/06,‘India may not remain the same in 2047’,"MDMK general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Vaiko on Wednesday warned that the Indian landscape will not remain the same in 2047 on the occasion of the centenary of its Independence if the Centre ‘bulldozed’ people into learning Hindi and Sanskrit.

Speaking on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Vaiko said the Indian sub-continent consisted of many nationalities, religions, languages and cultures. “That is why India should be called the United States of India,” he said.

Condemning the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Vaiko said 11 State governments had vehemently opposed the legislation, and resolutions had been adopted in the Assemblies of Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal against it.

“This is the first occasion in the history of independent India where States have rallied against the Centre. In the State of Kerala, for the first time, 7.5 million people formed a human chain,” he said. In Tamil Nadu, under the leadership of the DMK, the Opposition parties had launched a signature campaign to get a minimum of one crore signature against the legislation, he said.

Mr. Vaiko alleged that the BJP government was anti-Tamil and accused it of hobnobbing with the Sinhalese government in Sri Lanka, which had killed thousands of Tamils.

“The then Defence Secretary during the genocide, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has become the President of Sri Lanka, and this government rolled out the red carpet for him. This is nothing but a terrible betrayal of Tamils,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/axb66p/article30748119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THVAIKO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/india-may-not-remain-the-same-in-2047/article30746244.ece
153,2020/02/06,"Dual citizenship not permitted under Constitution, says Centre","The Central government on Wednesday made it clear in Parliament that dual citizenship “is not permitted” under the Constitution and the Citizenship Act, 1955.

This assumes relevance in the context of the request made by Governor Banwarilal Purohit, in his address to the Assembly last month, for the granting of dual citizenship to Sri Lankan refugees living in Tamil Nadu.

In various memoranda submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi since mid-2016, successive Chief Ministers, including the current one, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, have made a reference to the demand.

During the day, veteran actor Rajinikanth too echoed the demand.

In the Rajya Sabha, replying to a question from N. Gokulakrishnan of the AIADMK on the number of countries with whom India had dual citizenship agreements, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai referred to Article 9 of the Constitution (persons voluntarily acquiring citizenship of a foreign State not to be citizens) and Section 9 of the Citizenship Act (termination of citizenship) to drive home the point that dual citizenship was not permissible.

Bilateral agreement

On the possibility of the Central government entering into a bilateral agreement with the Sri Lankan government for offering dual citizenship to refugees living in India (Tamil Nadu), the Union Minister said “no such proposal is under consideration”. To a query as to how many Sri Lankan Tamils had applied for Indian citizenship, the reply was: “No such records are maintained.”

The Minister also informed the House that under the 1964 Sirimavo–Shastri Agreement and the 1974 Sirimavo-Indira Gandhi Agreement, 6 lakh Indian Origin Tamils (IOT) along with natural increase would be given Indian citizenship, while Sri Lanka would absorb 3.75 lakh persons.

As per the information supplied by the Tamil Nadu government’s Public (Rehabilitation) Department, a total of 4,61,639 IOTs were repatriated to India from Sri Lanka under the two agreements up until 2006, after registering them as citizens of India and issuing passports to them.

Mr. Rai added that in 1988, the Sri Lankan Parliament passed the Grant of Citizenship to Stateless Persons Act, which granted Sri Lankan citizenship to those IOTs who had not applied for Indian citizenship under the previous agreement.

In 2003, it adopted the Grant of Citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin Act, providing Sri Lankan citizenship to the IOTs who had been residing in Sri Lanka since October 1964, as well as their descendants.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dual-citizenship-not-permitted-under-constitution-says-centre/article30746240.ece

The Chinese nationals were handed over to a liaison agent and were requested to prepone their return trip, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said.

All 10 persons who were admitted to the isolation ward of RGGGH and two others from hospitals in Tiruvannamalai and Ramanathapuram were discharged. “Though they tested negative, the isolation wards are being disinfected and fumigated completely,” Ms. Rajesh told reporters on Wednesday.

Continuous monitoring

Officials said the Chinese nationals were staying at a hotel in Sriperumbudur and were being continuously monitored. They were yet to get return tickets.

“Right now, seven persons have been admitted to isolation wards in the State and are under observation — one person each at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital and government medical college hospitals at Kanniyakumari and Villupuram, and two each at the government medical colleges of Tiruchi and Tiruvarur. We have sent throat and nasal swabs and blood samples of five persons for testing,” Dr. Rajesh said.

So far, a total of 13,112 travellers from China and countries that have reported cases of nCoV have been screened in the State, she said, adding: “A total of 1,351 persons — 1,115 who returned from China directly and 236 from other countries — are under home quarantine. We are continuously monitoring them. We have issued them dos and don’ts, and they have to inform us in case of any symptoms. The District Collectors have been involved in this effort.” She added that screening continued in seaports.

She said the authorities were increasing the stock of protective gear. “In addition to the existing stock, we have procured 5,000 pieces of personal protective equipment and are distributing them to different districts. We are also increasing the quantity of disinfectants, hand sanitisers and spirits. We are strengthening disinfection and sanitation work, especially in the districts that share a border with Kerala,” the Health Secretary said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/y1yn2m/article30746215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06HEALTHBEELARAJESHCORONAVIRUSDMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-12-persons-discharged-from-isolation-wards-in-tamil-nadu/article30746216.ece

156,2020/02/06,High Court acquits two IPS officers in a 30-year-old alleged crime,"The Madras High Court has finally given a quietus to two criminal appeals pending before it for the last 17 years in connection with an alleged crime that took place about 30 years ago. It set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by a trial court on two Indian Police Service (IPS) officers for having indulged in corrupt practices while procuring fire fighting centrifugal pumps for the Fire and Rescue Services Department between May 1989 and July 1992.

Justice M. Dhandapani began his verdict in the 2003 appeals with the prelude: “Two of the oldest cases on the file of this court, in the criminal side, which have been confined within the four walls serving their life imprisonment (generally undergone for a period of 14 years) and even beyond, are being released from incarceration by this judgement.” He also took note that one of the IPS officers E. Hariharane had died in the meantime but his wife had got impleaded since she wanted to prove his innocence.

Allowing her plea as well as that of the other IPS officer G. Veeraraghavan, the judge acquitted them of all charges levelled by Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department.

He held that a special court for hearing cases booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988 had got carried away by figures portrayed by the prosecution instead of arriving at a reasonable and justifiable conclusion on the basis of materials available in black and white.

Recalling the history of the case, the judge pointed out that three government tenders were floated between 1989 and 1992 for purchase of high capacity portable pumps. While the first tender was floated by the now deceased IPS officer Hariharane during his tenure as Director of the Fire and Rescue Services department, the third tender was floated by Mr. Veeraraghavan who had succeeded to the post. However, the first tender was approved by the former and the other two by the latter.

After a Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption inquiry suspected foul play in the award of the three tenders, the CB-CID registered a case in September 1996 on the basis of a complaint lodged by the then Home Secretary.

Though a chargesheet was filed against four accused, the special court convicted only three, including the appellants and the contractor to whom the tender was awarded, and sentenced them to two to four years of rigorous imprisonment on April 4, 2003.

Completely in disagreement with the judgement passed by the trial court, Justice Dhandapani said, the tenders had been awarded only on the basis of a report of a technical committee which had evaluated the test pumps supplied by all four bidders. “Therefore, the stand of the respondent (CB-CID) that the pumps did not meet the requisite specification is contrary to materials available on record.” He also pointed out that those pumps were working well even after 10 years since purchase.

The judge also refused to give credence to the prosecution’s claim that members of the technical committee were coerced to give a positive report with respect to the test pumps submitted by a particular bidder. “May be the appellants, as head of the department, may have used a bit harsher way to accomplish the task of purchase at an early date.

The petitioner, D. Kavitha, 39, now serving as an assistant in the Department of Finance at the Secretariat, feared that the police might arrest her since they had apprehended her batchmates M. Vignesh, Sudha and Sudha Devi in connection with the case. She claimed to be on maternity leave at present and was delivered of a baby boy on January 23.

According to the petitioner, she had got appointed in government service after clearing the TNPSC Group II services examinations held for 2017-18. She wrote the examination at St. Joseph’s Higher Secondary School at Verkodu in Rameswaram on August 6, 2017 and secured 48th rank overall and sixth position in communal ranking. Her batchmate M. Vignesh had written the examination at the same centre and secured 46th rank. However, he was recently arrested by the CB-CID sleuths for having reportedly paid money to clear the examinations. Since two other women too had been arrested, the petitioner apprehended that she might get arrested despite having to take care of a just born baby.

Since she was on maternity leave, there was no chance of her tampering with the records, the petitioner said and undertook to furnish solvent sureties and abide by any condition imposed by the court in the event of being granted advance bail.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/secretariat-staff-seeks-advance-bail-in-tnpsc-recruitment-case/article30746178.ece
159,2020/02/06,Ranipet Municipality premises in a sorry state,"While people are greeted by a lush green campus at the Ranipet Municipality on Railway Station Road, a look inside the campus reveals a different picture altogether.

One side of the campus has been used as a junkyard for months. Twelve-year-old Naveen, who along with his father, came to the building in search of an e-seva centre, remarked to his father about the sorry state of affairs of the building.

This is a classic case of law-enforcing authorities flouting norms on the municipality premises in the town here.

While on the one hand, municipal authorities are slapping penalties on citizens caught dumping waste in the open as the part of the Swachh Bharat Mission and actively launching campaigns on cleanliness programme, on the other, the government office is filled with all sorts of wastes including broken/damaged terracotta toys, broken tracker trailor used for garbage clearance, a trash van, and a lot of broken garbage bins.

Many visitors have claimed the swanky entrance and the reality that is seen inside the premises gives a bad impression about the municipal administration. “We want them to remove the scrap and resell them as soon as possible,” said a visitor from Vembuli Amman Koil Street.

The campus recently accommodated the District Police Office, which has resulted in an increase in the number of visitors to the premises. But it seem that no one is bothered about the untidy look of the premises. The Commissioner or any other person in-charge of the Ranipet Municipality could not be reached for their comments. “What message do the government officials want to give to the people while talking about Swachh Bharat mission and cleanliness drive when they do not follow the same,” asked Venkatachalam N. from Kellys Road in Ranipet. Like all others, he also wants the municipal administration to clear the trash immediately and establish an organised parking lot for the vehicles or a garden in its place.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/etkiae/article30746173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06VELLORESCRAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ranipet-municipality-premises-in-a-sorry-state/article30746174.ece
160,2020/02/06,‘No exemption to Sasikala’,"The Income Tax department on Wednesday told the Madras High Court that a decision taken by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to withdraw cases in which the expected tax recovery was less than ₹1 crore would not apply to a case pending against former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala since connected criminal proceedings were pending before an economic offences court here.

The case, pending in the High Court since 2008, has been listed for final hearing before the second Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar. A standing counsel for the I-T department expressed reservations over withdrawing the case.

Accepting his submission, the judges simply adjourned further hearing on the tax case by two weeks.

The case relates to Sasikala’s income for the financial year 1994-95. Though her income for that year was initially assessed to be ₹28.86 lakh, it was later reassessed on the basis of an inquiry by Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC). The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had ruled against the reassessment made on the basis of DVAC report and hence the department had approached the High Court in 2008.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-exemption-to-sasikala/article30746172.ece

The TSRTC EU, which is an affiliate of the All India Trade Union Congress and National Federation of Indian Road Transport Workers, was instrumental in the trade union collective during the strike which began on October 5 last year. TSRTC EU general secretary K. Raji Reddy was a co-convener of the JAC. The other trade union was the Telangana Mazdoor Union whose Ashwathama Reddy served as the convener.

In a statement released to the media, TSRTC EU expressed regret that at a time when employees are continuing to face problems, the JAC has been been a mute spectator. It also stated that it is meaningless if the JAC does not react and find solutions to workers’ problems. This inaction, it said, was the reason for it to dissociate itself from the JAC.

163,2020/02/06,Death penalty for accused in Hajipur rape and murder cases,"Marri Srinivas Reddy, 29, the sole accused in the rape and murder of three minor girls between 2015 and 2019 in Hajipur village of Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district, was sentenced to death by the designated Special Court here on Thursday.

Nalgonda First Additional District and Sessions Judge S.V.V. Natha Reddy found him guilty, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), of kidnap, rape of minors and concealing the evidence.

The victims were aged 11, 17 and 14 years.

The death penalty given for the three crimes chargesheeted separately also included back-to-back life imprisonment, and the capital punishment is subject to confirmation by the Telangana High Court.

All the sentences run concurrently, and the accused can to challenge the punishment in the High Court, Judge Natha Reddy told Srinivas Reddy in the full house court room at 6.30 p.m.

It was at 2 p.m. when the Judge told Srinivas Reddy that the police have proved his role in the three crimes and gave him an opportunity to speak before the verdict was pronounced.

“I have no one and nothing left, even my house was destroyed by the villagers. I did not commit those crimes, the police beat me up and framed me,” he wept with folded hands.

The court broke for lunch, and the verdict came only after a long four-and-a-half hour break.

“In the first case, you are awarded life imprisonment for murder, 20 years and seven years imprisonment for rape and concealing evidence respectively. For the second and third crimes, death penalty under section 302 IPC, 20 years imprisonment each under section 376 for rape, kidnap under section 366 and seven years separately for concealing evidence. And a fine of ₹5,000 in each case,” the Judge said .

In all the three cases, the Court heard testimonies of 101 witnesses in a trial spread over 42 days in October and November last year. The recording of evidence was completed on January 17 and the verdict was scheduled for January 27, however, it was postponed for Thursday.

It was on April 26 last year, a day after a 14-year-old girl of Hajipur village in Bommalaramaram mandal was found dead in an abandoned agriculture well that clues of rapes and murder of the other two minor girls surfaced.

Rachakonda police, who presented the only accused Srinivas Reddy before media on April 30, said he had offered the girls lift on his bike, kidnapped, raped, murdered and buried them in his two agriculture wells.

The revelations of the crimes and exhumation of the girls’ skeletal remains from the wells not only shook the whole State, but demand for his death by hanging became stronger.

Family members, villagers, politicians, women and voluntary organisations who have been demanding the death sentence, erupted in joy after the verdict on Thursday.

Defence lawyer appointed by the Court S.R. Tagore, speaking to The Hindu said his arguments in favour of Srinivas Reddy were that the police could not assert clear evidence of his role in the crimes.

“My argument always was that the police only had incriminating evidence. Anyway, I respect the judgment, and the accused can still appeal to the High Court,” he said.

Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat expressed happiness over the judgment, and said all the oral, scientific, medical and technical evidence collected by police helped establish the crimes.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/death-penalty-for-accused-in-hajipur-rape-and-murder-cases/article30755043.ece
164,2020/02/06,Land acquisition for new Kothagudem railway line gathers pace,"The land acquisition process for the new railway line between Kothagudem (Bhadrachalam Road) and Sattupalli in the erstwhile united Khammam district is progressing at a brisk pace, rekindling hopes of expeditious execution of the long-awaited project in the hub of the vast coal belt.

In 2017, the Central government had given its nod for the 54-km new railway line connecting the coal towns of Kothagudem and Sattupalli to facilitate transportation of coal produced by the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) mines in Kothagudem region in a cost effective manner.

The total cost of the project was estimated at ₹704 crore in 2017.

The management of the State-owned SCCL has accorded high priority to the new railway line, which is expected to accrue multiple benefits to the company in terms of saving cost involved in the existing system of transportation of coal by trucks and addressing the issue of dust emission.

The SCCL reportedly agreed to contribute ₹618 crore towards execution of the new railway line considering the enormous advantages it offers to the company, which is planning to ramp up coal production in the new Kistaram open cast project at Sattupalli mandal and other existing coal mines in Kothagudem region.

The company has so far released ₹156 crore in separate instalments for the most sought-after new railway line, sources added.

According to sources in the Revenue department, the land acquisition process has almost been completed in Khammam district limits for the project.

Land measuring around a little over 400 acres has already been acquired and compensation amount disbursed to land-losers in Penuballi mandal in Sattupalli constituency limits, sources added.

Some minor issues have cropped up as a section of farmers in some villages along the Khammam-Bhadradri-Kothagudem border refusing to hand over their land, citing the possibility of the new railway line passing through the middle of their farms thereby splitting their agricultural fields and denying them access to farming.

Meanwhile, the SCCL officials initiated the process of obtaining clearance for a few hectares of forest land near Lankapalli village required for laying a stretch of 1.4 km railway track as part of the new railway line.

Fresh requisitions for acquisition of additional land for construction of railway quarters and requisite facilities are reportedly being pursued by the authorities for speedy completion of the whole land acquisition process in the next couple of months.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hb4k5g/article30755876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KHM-RAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/land-acquisition-for-new-kothagudem-railway-line-gathers-pace/article30754708.ece

166,2020/02/06,Roar of devotees rent the air as Samakka reaches the altar,"As the darkness enveloped the thick bushes of bamboo forest over the Chilkalgutta hillocks, around 6.30 p.m. several rounds were fired from an AK 47 assault rifle by Superintendent of Police S. S. G. Patil heralding the arrival of most revered and much awaited deity Sammakka here on Thursday.

The beat of drums by Adivasis devotees reached a crescendo and roar of people rented the air.

It is here the people in hundreds and thousands waited with bated breath to witness the arrival of tribal deity Sammakka from atop the hillocks. This was the most auspicious moment they were waiting for.

Many assembled at the spot right at dawn and their numbers swelled with every passing minute. District Collector R. V. Karnan, SP S. S. G. Patil, Adivasi MLAs D. Sitakka and Podem Veeraiah, ministers Satyavathi Rathod and Errabelli Dayakar Rao and a host of public representatives were present.

Traditional offerings

As usual, the tribal priests and police personnel had tough time with the crowds during their procession towards the altar at Medaram village. The ardent devotees swayed in trance and some flung the fowls into the air as a symbol of sacrifice to the goddess, women in good numbers rolled on the roads hoping to get the tribal priests walk over them, others spruced up the road and beautified the path with rangoli and others sacrificed animals and spilled blood as mark of their respect towards the deity. It took over two hours for the priests to reach the altar at Medaram, two km from the Chilkalgutta hillocks.

Some devotees sprinkled the blood of animals into air they just sacrificed against the racing tribal priests and those accompanying them in a show of their reverence. The spectacle raked a chill in the spine of onlookers. Each unfolding moment was alluring and disgusting at the same time.

The roar of hundreds of buses carrying pilgrims into the jungles is relentless.

Patient wait

There were serpentine queues with devotees inching their way towards the altar. As they raised slogans hailing the deities, children blew trumpets in high pitch unendingly much to discomfort of fellow devotees. The women sporting turmeric and vermilion on faces and balancing the lumps of jaggery on their heads patiently waited to reach the altar.

They are all on a pilgrimage to pay homage to the tribal deities -- Sammakka and Sarakka -- who sacrificed their lives fighting the Kakatiya army eight centuries ago.

The quaint village, with a population of 500, spread over just two square kilometres, has become home to lakhs of people who are all camping on every inch of space around the venue. Many raised small tents with tarpaulin sheets amidst bamboo groves, while others stay put in open air braving the chilly weather.

Hardly anybody ventures into this place on normal days due to its remoteness. Now, there were new transformers supplying uninterrupted power supply, hundreds of toilets and hundreds of water taps. There is a sprawling RTC bus stand too, besides mobile ATMs of Telangana Grameena Bank as well.

Fearing stampede like situation, it was said about 20 lakh devotees visited the altar of Sammakka and Sarakka during the past two months. But during the main event from February 5 to 8, on any given day, there could be five to ten lakh people camping around Medaram village, while many of them leave the place after having darshan of the deities.

The devotees started arriving in large numbers at the jatara venues to offer prayers at the altars where the tribal goddesses would be placed during the four-day festival. Women in their best attires and swathed in turmeric paste carrying blocks of jaggery, an offering to the deities, participated in the jatara.

Rekurthi on the outskirts, which was recently merged with Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar, turned into a beehive of activity. The devotees took a holy dip in the Kakatiya Canal waters and participated in the rituals, praying to the deities by breaking coconuts and offering jaggery at the altar.

The traders have set up stalls selling jaggery at the jatara venue, for devotees who offer jaggery equal to their weight (Thulabaram). Incidentally, the jaggery price increased considerably. Instead of ₹ 42 per kg, it has gone up to ₹ 60 per kg. Similarly, the prices of coconut also skyrocketed to ₹ 30 a piece.

There were brisk sales of fowls and sheep, which are sacrificial offering to the deities. Vendors of toys, balloons, and food stalls also had a good businesss.

174,2020/02/06,Bushfire Bash moved to Melbourne,"A star-studded charity game to aid Australian bushfire relief was on Thursday moved from the Sydney Cricket Ground to Melbourne due to forecast torrential rain, forcing some players to drop out.

Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting were to come out of retirement to skipper the teams on Saturday to raise money for victims of the blazes which began in September and have left at least 33 people dead and thousands of homes destroyed.

It was scheduled as a curtain raiser to the Twenty20 Big Bash League final, but with downpours expected, Cricket Australia (CA) said it would no longer be possible at the SCG.

Instead, it will be played on Sunday at the smaller Junction Oval in Melbourne following a T20 clash between the Australia and England women’s teams.

Warne, Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke were among those forced out due to prior commitments.

“We have moved the Bushfire Bash from the SCG because we want to provide every opportunity for the BBL final to be played on Saturday night,” said CA chief Kevin Roberts, amid concerns that the pitch could be damaged if there was a game beforehand.

Gilchrist to lead

Adam Gilchrist will now captain one of the teams in Warne’s absence with Australian Test skipper Tim Paine acting as coach. The Ponting team will be coached by Sachin Tendulkar.

Other international stars taking part include Wasim Akram, Brian Lara, Courtney Walsh, and Justin Langer.

Match profits will go to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund.

The Sydney Sixers will face either the Melbourne Stars or Sydney Thunder in the BBL final, weather permitting.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/bushfire-bash-moved-to-melbourne/article30755042.ece
175,2020/02/06,No Coronavirus threat to Olympics,"Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers said on Thursday the Games would “go ahead as planned”, slamming misinformation over the new Coronavirus for triggering panic.

Chief executive officer Toshiro Muto revealed that a task force had been formed to combat the fast-spreading disease that has killed over 560 people and infected at least 28,000 — the vast majority in mainland China — but promised that the Games would be not derailed.

No alarming public

“The Olympics will go ahead as planned,” he told reporters after a Paralympic project review.

“It is important to remain objective and cool-headed. We don’t want to alarm the public. The infection is still limited and there is no problem staging the Olympics based on the current situation,” he said.

International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence complained that scaremongering had created an “info-demic” that could skew public perception in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics.

“Fear is spreading quicker than the virus,” he said.

“It’s important we quell that fear. Only 191 of the total cases are outside mainland China, so let’s put things in perspective. If you compare those rates with the common flu, they are still relatively small numbers,” said Spence.

“The World Health Organisation has not declared this a pandemic. We dealt with the Zika virus in Rio and in these matters we need to rely on experts.

“We will follow the advice of the WHO. Every organising committee looks into countermeasures, and we have measures in place from previous Olympics and Paralympics here in Tokyo. It is standard practice, it’s business as usual.”

More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like Coronavirus.

Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but 45 cases have been detected, including at least 20 people on a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama.

Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virus.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged that preparations for the Olympics would proceed as normal.

“The Coronavirus is beginning to have an impact on tourism. But the government will continue to steadily prepare for the Games in close cooperation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the local organising committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,” Abe said.

The Japanese government has chartered three flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus.

Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement “thorough measures” to protect people from the virus.

Qualifiers cancelled

The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton. The Tokyo Olympics begins on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on August 25.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/qmsbw5/article30755037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/no-coronavirus-threat-to-olympics/article30755038.ece
176,2020/02/06,Indians’ schedule goes haywire after Coronavirus outbreak,"Following the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus in China, the schedules of India’s top singles players have been badly affected.

In the recent past, Prajnesh Gunneswaran (No. 122), Ramkumar Ramanathan (182) and Sasikumar Mukund (263) have used the rapidly improving East Asian swing of the ATP Challenger circuit in March and April to prop up their rankings.

But with the ATP cancelling all four Challengers in China during March (Qujing, Zhuhai, Shenzhen and Zhangjiagang), the players will now have to look elsewhere. The ATP is yet to make a decision on the tournaments in April, but with apprehensions about travelling very high, the Indians are set to miss the whole swing.

The $162,480 Anning Challenger scheduled for April has been a happy hunting ground for Prajnesh. He won his maiden Challenger title in 2018 and reached the final last year.

Ramkumar has played three Chinese Challengers in each of the past two years and reached the final of a $125,000 Challenger in Chinese Taipei in April 2018. Both Prajnesh and Ramkumar won’t be travelling this year.

“I was supposed to play in China, but won’t be going there,” confirmed Prajnesh. “I’ll be playing in Kazakhstan or something. I just have to look at the calendar and go wherever tournaments are available.”

Hard blow

For Sasikumar, in particular, it will be a hard blow, for he played five Challengers in March and April across China and Chinese Taipei, including the two in Shenzhen and Zhangjiagang that have been cancelled.

“I don't have a schedule, where can I plan next?” said a worried Sasikumar. “The tournaments got cancelled last Tuesday. For now the plan is to stay in Europe. I don't know what's going to happen going forward. The Olympics are at stake if it goes on like this.”

China alone was set to host 14 Challengers this year and there are now fears that with the events getting cancelled, the entry cut-offs at other tournaments will go higher. Prajnesh, however, downplayed it.

“Doesn’t really make it more difficult,” he said. “It’s just a bit more tricky in that it involves more travelling.”

Closely monitored

The ATP said it was monitoring the situation closely. “We had to cancel / delay the Chinese Challengers in March,” said Alison Lee, the ATP’s Executive Vice President, International Group. “We have had to adapt, shift a few tournaments so that player flow was not affected. Natural occurrences like this happen and we have to be prepared. But it's mainly China. Although we may look at delaying the April tournaments.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/1ul6mz/article30754798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07RAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/indians-schedule-goes-haywire-after-coronavirus-outbreak/article30754799.ece
177,2020/02/06,Art that inspires,"A woman clad in a saffron sari sits facing the Ganga in a boat, holding a sitar, with a string of kanakambaram flowers streaming down her back. Captivating in its serenity, the image is a representation of the Benares Ghat, says the artist Preethi Ravi. “I haven’t been to Benares, but the painting is everything that Benares means to me,” says Preethi.

Many of the works on show at the exhibition, “Atelier”, at the Durbar Hall Art Gallery, are contemplative in nature — brooding landscapes and intense portraits. Curated by Suresh TR, artist and founder of Prussian Blue The Art Hub, the show features the works of 14 artists, many of whom are his students.

Asha Nair, whose striking portrait of a black woman with a bright orange headscarf, says the painting was inspired by a photograph she had seen. “I wanted to recreate the beauty of the woman and the depth of expression in her eyes,” says Asha. Another of her works shows an old man with a stick, painted with photographic precision. Many of the artists whose works are on show took to painting as a hobby, says Asha. The show includes works of a few professional artists too.

Shalini Menon paints forests with élan; a palm forest beneath a blue sky demands the viewer’s attention. Her brother, Kailas Menon’s works explore the possibilities of digital art. Meera Krishnan’s series of four small works, titled “Transformation” (in white and sepia-tinted canvases), show the life stages of a butterfly — from caterpillar to a fully grown butterfly.

Vishnu Somasundaran, who took to art, after retirement as an engineer, says his work, “Awakening”, highlights the significance of knowledge in the emancipation of the human spirit. His layered canvas has different textures, and the dominant image is that of a nib indicating enlightenment.

Atelier is on till February 9.

Inspired by nature

Sandhyambika’s solo show, “Green Thoughts” contains a collection of her works inspired by nature. A meditative lily pond, largely bottle green in colour, speckled with bright pink water lilies, occupies a fair share of the wall of the gallery. The artist has placed two similar paintings together to crate the desired effect. “Nature has always been an inspiration for me. It is calming and attempts to bring in a semblance of peace to this chaotic world,” Sandhyambika says.

Sandhyambika, who works at the State Bank of India, Vyttila, says art is a passion she has pursued despite balancing the pressures of her job and family. She works in the night, mainly. “Now that my children are grown up, I have more time to devote to art.” This is her second solo show.

Her frames are life-like and effervescent in treatment. All 24 works on display show various facets of nature and the environment. “I have utilised every opportunity in life to study and observe natural phenomena and natural forms. My work is an expression of the complex, yet undeniable connection we humans have with nature.” Sandhyambika’a mother was an art teacher and she believes her early influences were drawn from her. “However, it has been only 10 years since I delved into serious art practice.”

178,2020/02/06,CUSP arts festival: Convergence on one platform,"The three-day CUSP arts festival served as a platform for vital and exploratory discussions, ending on a musical note each day. A maiden festival in Chennai by the Mumbai-based First Edition Arts (FEA), it featured over 50 performers, musicians and speakers from all over India. Set against the picturesque Luz House in Mylapore, the festival began with the ever expansive philosophy of music by Sundar Sarukkai. Artistic curation, including visual arts, has recently been a topic of discussion among the art fraternity. Day one of CUSP highlighted the same with curators from visual arts, Hindustani music and performing arts. Curation as a celebration of art forms, utilising spaces with digital resources and exploring scattered pieces of heritage sites with more inclusivity were discussed. Bhooma Padmanabhan, the co-curator of this year’s Chennai Photo Biennale said, “Festivals and events that revel in artistic spaces express a sense of solidarity, especially in recent times with socially fragmented spaces.”

This notion of solidarity driven to the forefront by arts was a social call to action echoed through a number of sessions conducted. For example, food blogger Vernika Awal’s personal stories about the changes in Punjabi cuisine after the Partition, explored food and its resounding effect in unifying people from different and possibly contrasting geo-political regions. The Bindu Art School, designed to use art as a new means to livelihood for people affected by Hansen’s disease, drove a moving and impactful message. Rekindled with a sense of purpose and monetary direction, these emerging artists also had their artwork on display as they narrated their stories.

Deliberating on the history of music as a unifier of protesters, and the literary grammar of deep rooted and divisive ground realities, were Ganesh Devy and the Tamil writer Imayam. “At every turning point in the evolution of society, there is music. It serves as a bridge to recalibrate and remember a sense of shared identity,” summarised Devy. Drawing perspectives from Hindustani music practitioners and researchers, the session titled, ‘Hindustani Music: Practice, Performance and Pedagogy,’ made some interesting observations. Interspersed with live music, Ranjani Ramachandran demonstrated the nuances in performance that cannot be learned without individual internalisation of the piece’s essence by the musician. Sumitra Ranganathan traced how the aesthetics that embellish a performer’s piece are largely derived from the person’s region of residence and cultural practices. Warren Sanders, live on Skype, elaborated on the scientific processes and personal pedagogy for students unfamiliar with Hindustani music and its culture. He wonderfully summarised it in a Venn diagram of individual creativity (personal style), standardised repertoire (raagdari) and traditional validity (taleem).

The festival ended its second day to the notes of raag Hemant, a late night rendition, and opened its final day with the raag Miyan ki Todi, a morning concert of sunshine, warmth and another set of innovative sessions to look forward to. Often shied away from, CUSP also called attention to the social spectrums of identification and safety among artistes. Rumi Harish, a fantastic Hindustani musician and gender rights activist, shared his experience as a trans-man in the classical music world. “Why should I wear a sari and perform? Why should it matter what I wear and what I choose to identify as,” he challenged. Rumi questioned the double standards of women’s performance, appearance and personal choices towards their art form and why that was seen as a measuring tool of their presence in the industry.

A panel discussion on creating safer ecosystems for women in classical music explored the legal and psychological repercussions of the current ecosystem. Unofficial work spaces and rehearsals for musicians, lack of contracts for performances and the need to speak out in situations of abuse were highlighted.

This was a crucial conversation to have in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement. It is also a reckoning for young artists to express their thoughts towards the predominant, “It’s okay, this always happens. Let it go,” they usually face. Swarna Rajagopal and Amba Salelkar’s conversations largely extended towards understanding abuse and how to legally deal with them for the arts community. Savita Rani’s theatre performance the next day was a performance, based on these ideas executed with admirable subtext and use of physicality.

It is a tough job to attempt and express the number of concerts that were exhibited over three days, from the Carnatic Quartet’s tunes, Amrita Lahari’s splendid interactive performance, Carnatic open mics, to Sruthi Sagar’s spell-binding renditions. However, ‘Nandanar Charithiram,’ presented through a blend of Villupaatu and Carnatic music ensemble, reflected the spirit of CUSP.

Flautist Shruti Sagar

“It is not just the story rendered here today, nor its characters. It is the sheer capacity of the storytelling to unite different regions within a space of multiple art forms that makes it special,” said Bharathi Thirumagan during the final performance.

On the whole, not only did CUSP 2020 created a platform of intimate performances, interactive discussions and exhibit myriad artwork, it also sought out to digitally document the experience for a wider audience. Although the presence of youth was a bit ont he lower side, FEA’s curation of the festival has massive potential to create larger discussions and engagement in the coming years.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/od7ge9/article30751321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07frVillupaatu02jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/cusp-convergence-on-one-platform/article30751323.ece
179,2020/02/06,Etched in stone: Stone carver Thirupathi P talks about his craft,"“I was nine years old when I started.” Thirupathi P, the stone carver from Chennai’s Dakshinachitra, laughs as he recounts his fight to follow his father’s footsteps. For three generations, his family had been making paniyaram moulds and kal chettis from soft stone.

“Once some people from Tiruvannamalai came to source the stone from our area and they were carving idols of Ganesha and other gods,” he continues. Then a nine year old, Thirupathi wondered why his father and grandfather did not make something like that. “I begged my father to let me drop out of school and learn from them. All I got was a whack and a stern order to get back to my studies,” he recalls ruefully. But he wasn’t going to give up without a fight. “I began to watch the other craftsmen without my father’s knowledge. Slowly through observation and conversation, I picked up the skills.”

Two years later, his father caved in. Thirupathi’s brother knew someone at a training centre in a village near Madurantakam and got his 11-year-old brother admission. Later he trained at a design centre in Bengaluru as well. “It’s been 24 years now,” he says proudly. Once he finished his training, he joined his brother at Kalakshetra and stayed on.

Thirupathi acknowledges the need to change. “If I make the same old designs, people will get bored.” He credits the visitors to his stall with helping him spread his wings. “Many who came to Dakshinachitra liked my work but wanted some different items. So I began taking commissions. They would show me photographs of what they wanted.” How long does it take to make his pieces? It depends on the piece, he replies. “I can make two or three of the regular ones in a day. Some take a week or even a month or two according to the detailing required. If it’s something new, I need to understand it before I start work. If I accept such commissions, they spread the word and others will come to me.”

His “regular pieces” comprises idols of gods, owls, elephants, candle holders, pencil stands, pendants… The most difficult creation was a two-feet diameter ball on which he had to depict Tamil handicrafts. He remembers carving 38 kinds of crafts. “It went to the US. It was around 180kg in weight and cost ₹15,000” he says. Ask if he has a photograph, he says, “It was 12 years ago. I didn’t even think about it then.” Would he do something like that now? “I would think twice,” he laughs, “though I managed to do it back then.”

Thambaalam Jayashree Ravi, President, CCTN, says, “Thambaalam is an exhibition of a curated collection of traditional and contemporary platters in silver, copper and brass. Apart from Thirupathi’s tone platters, we will have Pavan Prajapati from Jaipur who has painted Rajasthani miniatures on wooden trays and Balaji and his father from Anuparpalayam who work with the traditional metal. People can order replicas on full advance and delivery will be between 45-60 days. The order will be transferred to the craftsmen.”

“It’s a totally new idea. I have seen the regular pithalai (brass) platters in my village, of course, but this was…,” Thirupathi trails off. Thirupathi worked from photographs sent to him. Each thambaalam was different, he says. One was plain, another had lots of detail. Compared to some other work, this was quite easy.”

Thirupathi uses different kinds of stone for his work: “maakallu or soap stone, the white and red varieties of marble, and green stone. We also use a variety of Kadappah stone, not the quality used to make tiles but a better one.” The stone he uses depends on what he is working on — idols, he says, can be made from all but, for a candle holder or plate, he has to use something durable. While the soapstone and the green stone is sourced from Tamil Nadu, the marble comes from Varanasi. He explains that a group of 20-30 carvers band together and order a truckload of stones and split it up depending on individual needs. “I cannot afford one truckload,” he smiles, “Nor can I store it.”

His teenage son has begun to learn his craft and that makes Thirupathi very happy. “He is in class eight and comes with me to Dakshinachitra on Sundays. He learns silambam and also works with me. He makes the pendants now. I am training him slowly and very happy that he wants to continue my work.”

Is Thirupathi happy that he fought to get into this field? “Very happy,” is his response. “It’s not about the money. I have the satisfaction of making what the customer wants and of creating beauty. This keeps me content.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/uwahvq/article30751215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thirupathi-at-work,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/stone-carver-thirupathi-p-talks-about-his-craft/article30751220.ece
180,2020/02/06,The quest for bliss,"Over the years, Indian arts have drawn extensively from the idea of devotion in literature and poetry. At the recent performance called Eternal Quest, one saw four seasoned artistes coming together to recreate the devotion in the poetry of Jayadeva, Lal Ded, Gangasati and Mirabai.

While dancers Ranjana Gauhar, Shovana Narayan and Rashmi Vaidialingam performed Odissi, Kathak and Kuchipudi, artist and art curator Alka Raghuvanshi donned the role of the sutradhar, weaving the stories together. She said, giving the prologue to the performances, “Love is the central path to devotion – one marked by faith. By sublimating love into Bhakti, the movement ensured that women’s needs and desires would have legitimate space without ridicule. One of the biggest impacts of the Bhakti movement was the freedom and voice for expression that it gave to women, their quest for ananda or bliss….”

The performance began with Ranjana’s rendition of “Sakhi Hey” in Odissi, the sixth Ashtapadi from Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda in which Krishna represents the divine and Radha, the soul, yearning to be united with the divine. She is the abhisarika nayika who is smitten by the cupid’s arrows and now wants her sakhis to bring her to Krishna so that she can be united with him. “The poem has been translated into 100 languages,” says Ranjana. “It is a poem that rose to such heights that all temples from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Puri to Gujarat sing it as an act of prayer, more than poetry,” she adds. Through her dance, Ranjana portrayed the coming together of the physical and the metaphysical through Radha and Krishna. “Bhakti gives a direction. It is a reminder that we all have a soul and we shouldn’t simply exist at the material level. We are connected through it,” explains Ranjana.

The second performance by ace Kathak dancer Shovana Narayan bridged two very different poets through her dance – Lal Ded and Gangasati. Shovana used the languages they wrote in, namely Kashmiri and Gujarati and two seemingly different philosophies about the same divine. “Within every person, there is an element of Bhakti, it is the belief in something. It is everything -- from participation, to homage, to devotion. It is love for supernatural energy, or a being or a representative or a god. For me, I believe in that power, the pillar that you can run back to, says Shovana. The poetry urges one to dissolve the ‘I’ and be one with the paramatma. “The word bhakti comes from the root word in Sanskrit called bhaj, which means ‘to belong’,” says Shovana.

For Kuchipudi dancer Rashmi Vaidialingam, Bhakti meant an expression of the self that is unique but an embodiment of devotion at the same time. She chose Mirabai’s famous bhajan “Chalo Mana” choreographed by her gurus Raja and Radha Reddy. “Apart from giving rise to a lot of rich literature, Bhakti empowered women and gave them a voice they could not find otherwise,” says Rashmi.

In stringing together these different art forms, Alka says, at the core remained an idea to unite with a larger being, something one might often encounter in one’s art. Having been a dancer herself, the movements have often spilled on to her paintings as well. She says, “The idea here is that different forms of dance must be strung together to form a whole. Bhakti poets too come from different time spans and work as a whole. The poetry is seemingly shringara based, but are essentially Bhakti.”

How does one approach it in today’s times when the question of faith is debated every day? “It has gained even greater relevance for now. We have created these forms, we want to worship. We can call it faith, belief or conviction. We have created them because something bigger, maybe lila, wanted us to create them. But, there is so much unrest outside that it makes us want to touch base with our core, and connect with the Paramatma,” sums up Alka.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/nwx908/article30751124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20191210-WA0040,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-quest-for-bliss/article30751125.ece
181,2020/02/06,Framework for a new modernity,"Featuring the works of six women artists from Italy and South Asia, an art project titled “Visions in the Making” by Art Hub Asia is on display at the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre in Delhi. The project is curated by Myna Mukherjee and David Quadrio. “Andrea Baldi, the Director of the Italian Cultural Centre, asked me to work on this project and I told him that I would do it only if there was an Indian counterpart in dialogue with us and so that is when Myna came into the picture. We decided to work with the proposed artists from Italy and to paiFr them with Indian and South Asian artists. The idea was to try and find a way to make the works somehow resonate with one another and it’s really amazing that everything actually does come together in a strange and magical way,” reveals Quadrio.

All six artists Natascia Fenoglio, Stefania Galegati Shines, Marta Roberti, Amina Ahmed, Shilo Suleiman and Gopa Trivedi come together to create altermodern works that question the notions of standardisation and commercialisation, while simultaneously playing with the concept of time and space in a bid to accommodate new emerging modernity connecting different cultural groups together. “Some of the art works are actually realised here in India like the one by Stefania Galegati Shines, which is realised as a carpet, or the edible bread-hands by Natascia Fenoglio, essentially designed to connect various Indian dance mudras with certain iconic Italian gestures,” explains Quadrio.

Buying an island

Shines presents a project called “Let's buy the island of the females” which deals with the task of buying an island. “The whole work is about buying an actual island named ‘Isola delle Femmine’ which can be translated as ‘The Island of Women’ that is in Sicily in front of the coast. With some friends, we have decided to buy it. So, the island is to be purchased by women, for women. Now, here it is important to understand that across the world only 30% of the area is owned by women and it further drops to 13% in Asia. There is a watch tower on the island that was built in the 16th century. It was badly damaged during World War II. The portraits of the island that you see at the exhibition in form of big format carpets with writings of the noted existential feminist Simone de Beauvoir are all about promoting the idea of buying the island. The idea behind using carpets for making portraits of the island adds to the fact that ‘carpet area’ is also a denomination for measuring land in India,” explains Shines.

On the other hand, Amina Ahmed’s work borrows from folk and spiritual traditions, geometry and metaphors. Her work questions to what degree she can shape her own representations. Her work ‘Grief, Loss, Sorrow’ takes one through the universal act of falling on one’s knees as one bends to read the inscription on the wall using the magnifying glass. “The gesture represents the surrendering, the falling down, when you hear of a death, loss, or sorrow. You fall on your knees, your heart surrenders, and your limbs are no longer yours. The act of falling on one’s knees is also associated with submission and prayer,” explains Amina who couldn’t stop herself from joining the women at Shaheen Bagh. “I felt nothing but love from the women of Shaheen Bagh, a wonderful sense of solidarity and camaraderie,” reveals Amina whose other two works at the exhibition, ‘Transpositions I, II, III’ and ‘Time. Staircase of my Spine’, deal with the thresholds of time and space.

Contemporary artist Shilo Suleiman uses wood and sculpturally painted cut-outs to create layered composites. Her work “I Come from Beauty, I Return to Beauty” tells an old story from a distant land about a beautiful goddess. “There was once a beautiful goddess whose honeyed beauty was so thick that every god who saw her became attracted to her. Unable to control themselves and fearing that these scandals could destroy the ancient heavens, the gods conspired to do something about this. So, they poisoned her, and placed her body beneath the soil in a far and dark and hidden place. But her divinity was so fertile that from her body began to grow medicinal plants that would forever benefit human kind,” explains Suleiman who likes to see her own body as her first canvas.

In contrast, neo-miniaturist Gopa Trivedi uses diverse materials to grapple with the complex socio-political stances pervading South Asia. As part of the exhibition, she presents a suite of delicate aesthetic portraits of saffron flower through its various stages of bloom. “When I say the word ‘saffron’ in today’s context, what all comes to mind? My work is around the idea of saffron as a sought-after commodity as well as the pun that’s associated with it,” teases Trivedi. On the other hand, Marta Roberti presents us with her pictorial tracings that create the illusion of a walk through the forest.

Interestingly, the works of all the artists deal with nature in a particular kind of way. “One of the artists imagines that the yearning to be connected to a higher thing, which is central to Sufism, could actually be a metaphor for a desire to connect with the nature. And a lot of the artists take from nature, as women. Gender is another common theme. The idea was to work around the issues of gender but not necessarily talk about women’s rights as much as representation because right now the art world is really skewed as there are a lot more male artists out there. So this was a chance for us to really amplify what women want,” sums up Mukherjee.

182,2020/02/06,Understanding in-betweenness,"Blending aesthetic appeal with reality, the ongoing multi-media group show of Indian and foreign artists, “You Will Know Me: Migration Stories”, forces viewers to introspect. Curated by Tara Sabharwal at Art Alive Gallery, the exhibition displays a variety of works in diverse medium and deals with the critical issue of displacement of humankind.

Be it the historical colonisation by the West, neo-colonialism, climate change, war and poverty among others have resulted in the rise of refugees and a surge of xenophobia.

“The alien ‘other’ is not only demonised, but also turned into an existential threat,” observes Sabharwal. Being a migrant herself, who is constantly on the journey of self-discovery, made Sabharwal reflect on the human condition of refugees. “I saw in it an opportunity to explore and showcase the in-betweenness, space between two cultures where relationships and negotiations remain unfixed, in a state of constant transformation.”

Concerns of displacement

Sabharwal got together myriad artists hailing from different parts of the world whose works voiced the concerns of displacement of others or their community. Every member of the group agreed to take the show to their location, invite local artist and involve the community to keep the dialogue relevant and urgent. Thus, we have Ayisha Abraham bringing to fore the life of a Nepali guard in her city, Bengaluru; a short film by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam on the displacement of Tibetans; etchings by Mohammad Omer Khalil based on the book “Seasons Of Migration To The North” by Tayeb Salih; Barbara Beisinghoff, a German graphic artist paying homage to German Jewish poetess Gertrud Kolmar murdered in Auschwitz; abstract art by Miguel Angel Rivera using maps, European viruses and geometry dating back to pre-Columbian cultures referring to the colonialism of America, among other works.

Sabharwal’s own work, “Untitled”, a collage of acrylic on silkscreen is autobiographical in nature, showing people in boats, the horizon, and the sky. “It portrays the feeling of being alone even when you are in a group, though alone is in a meditative sense. It also represents a spiritual realm, an individual’s journey, with life undergoing constant transformation. Reflecting the vulnerability of refugees, it shows them looking longingly at the shore and horizon, signifying hope.”

Likewise, Haitian, Leslie Jean-Bart’s collage of six photographs, “Untitled”, is multi-layered and multi-referential. “It has a lot of unsaid, void and shunya. He plays with the sand-water, which even when brought together turbulently never meet. Thus we all are close but not together. The shadow in the work represents in-betweenness,” explains Sabharwal.

On the other hand, Sarojini Lewis’ “El Alamein” (1-6), print analogue photography with calligraphy in ink, is inspired by her grandfather’s migration from Shillong to multiple destinations during his British Army service. “It is a montage that talks about her roots, through her grandfather and parents,” remarks Sabharwal.

Fear and anxiety

Using photographs to narrate human emotions is Veer Munshi’s “How Green Is My Valley” (Grid 1-10). He clicked these images last August when Article 370 was abrogated. “With Internet and communication services suspended, I witnessed a number of people, especially youth, leaving for other States and cities, out of fear and anxiety about the future. That reminded me of the ‘90s, when I, in my 20’s, had to leave Kashmir, my home State. I realised that with the passage of time, nothing has changed, except my beard, which has turned grey,” he quips.

It is remarkable as the black and white pictures peek from the back of the frames with grills. “You feel that the faces peeping from behind a window with jaalis or grills, symbolising curfew and restriction,” clarifies Munshi. Denying that his works carry a political message, he says, “It is done purely from a human angle”.

Conveying effectively how the life of migrant changes, are Ayisha Abraham’s works in the show. While the short film “One Way”, tells us about Shyam Bahadur, who migrated to Bengaluru in 60s and works as a security guard, the images titled “Under The Ground”, show him living with his family in the basement of the residential complex where he works. Viewed in conjunction with the pictures titled “Between The Sky And The World”, the impact is significant, as they depict the lovely mountains and the verdure surroundings of the land, Bahadur has left behind. “I want viewers to feel the poignancy of a migrant’s life, and thus make us empathise with them,” says Abraham.

Being the daughter of Holocaust survivors, Tatana Kellner’s works bring out the anguish and state of refugees. In “Please Exit, Doors Are Closing”, digital prints, we see the situation of refugees in US. While the backpack represents refugees, words like courage, flee, unfulfilled dreams, show different facets of their life. Her trace monoprint on handmade paper installation, “Reconsider”, are human faces, sombre with sadness vivid in their eyes. “They are poetic pieces on humanness and their fragility,” notes Sabharwal.

Breaking the show’s theme, are the stunning works by Mary Ting. Her monoprint silkscreen titled “Hands, Feet, Beaks” raises concern about the extinction of animals due to climate change and global warming while “Have Your Heard?” (silkscreen with watercolour) showing fragments of human hands and bird heads, are metaphors of our dysfunctional world.

While agreeing that migration and refugees are in news, Sabharwal, says the show is not about making a statement. “One needs to understand that we don’t need the ‘other’ to know about self. In order to realise and recognise what I am, why is it imperative to have the other,” she asks. “There is a need to get over the insider-outsider mindset,” she urges.

183,2020/02/06,When art plays a larger role,"As artistes, how many of us think of the world outside? We all have our own niches, fields in which we thrive and we showcase our artistry where we belong. And yet, the world outside the artistic realm still exists and it is our responsibility to be aware of the happenings and issues that surround us.

“What Do We Do With The Imaginary Spear?” was a conversation on identity, assertion, assimilation, and appropriation in the artistic world that was organised by Ranga Mandira Academy of World Dance/Performance & Indic Studies and, supported by T.S. Parthasarathy Education & Publication Trust, Krea University and Australia Council of Arts.

“The art world does not always look at the world outside. It draws from the world but I don’t know if it gives enough,” says Dr. Swarnamalya Ganesh, director, Ranga Mandira Academy of World Dance/ Performance and Indic Studies and Assistant Professor of Practice, Krea University

The conversation brought together three diverse artistes for an evening that was eye-opening, informative and by far one of my favourite evenings. Jacob Boehme, a Melbourne-based artiste of Narangga and Kaura heritage, Tenma, a music artiste hailing from North Madras and leader of The Casteless Collective Band and, Kalki Subramaniam, a trans activist and artiste who uses art to provide a voice without words for transgender victims of abuse.

“With what’s happening all around us, the kind of polarisation, the severe hate being spread not just in India, but across the globe, art becomes more and more relevant as a tool, a very powerful tool for communication in the hands of the peace-loving. Artistes bring to resistance what others cannot do because art has the power to unify,” says Radhika Ganesh, curator of this conversation and a founding member of Ek Potlee Ret Ki, a collective that works with cultural identities and the need to expand people’s political actions to preserve diversity.

“India is in that place where we are constantly questioning about who should be speaking about what,” continues Radhika. For artistes, the question of assertion is also parallel with appropriation. Because those who are from an indigenous community their representation is inherent but for those who want to stand in solidarity, they are always questioning their place.

Inspired by Goodes

The concept of the Imaginary Spear came from footballer Adam Goodes mimicking the imaginary spear being thrown. Given that Goodes hailed from an indigenous community, he faced a lot of racial discrimination for bringing something from his culture; asserting his own cultural identity in a sport that is dominated by whites. After continuous harassment, he was forced to give up his passion. This was when Jacob Boehme created his Imaginary Spears workshops inspired by Goodes, who is his cousin.

“Australia was colonised by the English around 230 years go and we aboriginals are still not acknowledged in our country's constitution We were given citizenship only in 1967, prior to which we were part of the Flora and Fauna Act, which meant we were relegated to the status of plants and animals,” says Jacob Boehme, the founding creative director of Melbourne’s YIRRAMBOI First Nations Arts Festival.

“In Imaginary Spears workshops aboriginal artistes talk about constitutional recognition and treaties with the wider community, raise questions that we based our artistic performances on, questions that needed to be answered,” continues Boehme. I remember how he admitted that as he is a white aboriginal, he sometimes feels guilty because he is allowed entry into places that most members of his community can only dream of simply because he was born fair. But, he also said that he looks at it as an opportunity to open the doors, to work on the inside to make way for the rest of the people in his community to gain entrance.”

India, as you know also faces a high amount of discrimination and a lot of it, is internal discrimination. Here is where Tenma brought in his experience. “Coming from North Madras we are widely considered to be ‘local’ and it is used as a slur against us. Many of us cannot speak English and we are looked down upon by those who can in the rest of Chennai. Speaking about my band The Casteless Collective, we have faced discrimination from even well-known people in the film industry who have told us to leave music, to leave art out of our expressions and the assertion of our identity,” says Tenma, when asked on what he has gone through.

I cannot truly say that I am surprised, a lot of the topics that came up at this conversation were quite sensitive and could easily be construed the wrong way. But what hope do we have for the world, when even art faces discrimination, where even it seems like sometimes art just might not be enough, a universal language that has the power to unite people but is blocked at every turn.

“For me, I had my parents to support me. My father might not have accepted it but he didn’t reject me and my mother loved me no matter what. Many of the others in my community do not have that support system and every year I lose at least one of them to suicide,” says Kalki Subramaniam, one of India’s well-known campaigners behind the Supreme Court of India’s judgment in legalising transgender identity.

Curbing violence

“Violence against transgenders is so much higher than even violence against women. We just cannot report it because we have no rights. So, we use art as a means to communicate our expressions and emotions. I turned to writing poetry because the pen and the paper could not judge me,” says Kalki, who launched the project ‘Stop Blaming the Victim’ to give a voice to the transgenders who faced abuse.

She speaks about how much ragging she went through, how she was sexually, mentally and physically abused and how the other people in her community face similar experiences. For them, art gives them the voice they need, art gives them the outlet to express themselves, art gives them the freedom to be who they want to be. I could write a lot more about this conversation, this enlightening event but I will stop with a final quote by Kalki which made an impact.

“If you see us transgenders on the road, we are easily recognizable because of the way we are dressed. We do not follow what is in vogue rather if we like something, we will wear it. Because for us, that is our art, our fashion is our art, our way of asserting our identity.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/fsxo3m/article30750124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07FRRANGAMANDIRA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/when-art-plays-a-larger-role/article30750125.ece
184,2020/02/06,"Meet Mahesh MK, a speech- and hearing-challenged Kerala artist who communicates loud and clear through his artworks","At an early age, Mahesh MK realised that art does not predicate upon language for “communication”. As a child drawn to painting, he would ask the opinion of his mother, Kusumakumari, whenever he finished a work. Born speech- and hearing-challenged, Mahesh gradually began to “speak to and listen to the world” through his brushstrokes.

“During primary school, Mahesh used to come out on top in art competitions. We encouraged his talent and he began taking art lessons from class 7. After SSLC (class 10), he resolved to devote his time completely for painting,” says Kusumakumari, speaking for her son, a native of Thevally in Kollam.

Mahesh initially focussed on “nature paintings” in water colours and acrylic and, as he became adept at using oil paint, the artist expanded his canvas and branched out to doing meticulous re-productions of the works of Raja Ravi Varma. But for the past 10 years, he has been painting more in the style of murals of Kerala and those became the centrepiece of his artistic life. Ameyam, an ongoing exhibition and sale of his paintings in acrylic at the Museum Art Gallery in the city, puts on display a selection of about 35 mural-like paintings that speak volumes about his brushstrokes.

Lord Krishna and his “faces, avatars and life” form the cornerstone of most of the pieces. There’s one painting depicting the “Lord Shiva family” while another is based on Vyloppilly Sreedhara Menon’s famous poem Mambazham. “I had described to Mahesh the idea for the ‘Mambazham’ painting and left the rest to his imagination and interpretation. We all were surprised to see how well the work turned out to be,” says Kusumakumari, a former school teacher.

Spirit of the law The exhibition came alive after two city-based lawyers — Bindu Gopinath and her colleague J Sandhya — took the initiative to help Mahesh find a platform to exhibit his works. “Mahesh is a client of ours who had approached us regarding a legal matter. Kusumakumari once mentioned about her son’s talent for painting and how he has been keeping his works to himself for a lack of exposure,” says Bindu. She then requested Mahesh to send pictures of his paintings on WhatsApp and the lawyers were struck by the quality the works. The duo then forwarded the photos to artist B D Dattan, who was impressed by Mahesh’s flair and, soon got in touch with the Museum director to check the possibility of organising an exhibition. “In fact, as a goodwill gesture, the authorities eventually decided to provide the venue free of cost,” adds Bindu.

Other works in the collection include a deft piece on the concept of Ardhanareeswara and another depicting tribespeople involved in the trade of coir basket manufacturing. Perhaps, the highlight is the Dasavatharam series, depicting the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu. Mahesh says he learnt the techniques of mural paintings while studying under artist Prince Thonnakkal.

Ameyam, which means “infinite”, is the first exhibition by 45-year-old Mahesh, who holds a diploma in Art and Drawing. “We have titled the show so to highlight the infinite potential of the human mind, which transcends the barrier of language,” explains Kusumakumari. Mahesh’s father, Madanan Nair, is a former accountant.

Ameyam, which opened on Tuesday, also showcases fabric art depicting Krishna on saris done by Mahesh’s wife, Smitha R, a Chethala-native who too is speech- and hearing-challenged. Kusumakumari says the family believes it is “god’s will” when they realised Smitha possessed latent artistic talent and dreams of her own when she became part of the family.

“We didn’t really know that painting was Smitha’s passion until after their marriage. She started honing her skills with the help of Mahesh. They speak the same language,” says the mother. The couple have a six-year-old son, Bhavesh MS.

Mahesh conveys that he’s not much conversant in the sign language, having studied in a regular school, while Smitha, who went to a special school, is quite proficient. Mahesh, who loves to teach, takes “informal” art classes for children at his home to make ends meet.

Despite the challenges, the couple says they are “happy” in the world of colours and canvases. “When I paint, the painting is the only thing I see. I’m able to forget everything else,” says Mahesh, with the help of his mother.

185,2020/02/06,Nathan Sawaya: Around the world with Lego bricks,"Nathan Sawaya’s art is currently on display in multiple continents at the same time. Just at the end of 2019, and till the first quarter of 2020, he has his work showing at the New York Hall of Science and the Houston Museum of Natural Science in the United States; at the Lucas Nogueira Garcez Pavilion in Sao Paulo, Brazil; at the Great Northern Warehouse in Manchester, United Kingdom; and at the Tank Shanghai Museum in China.

This is, by no account, a mean feat. All of these ongoing shows are solo outings of Sawaya’s travelling exhibit, called The Art of The Brick. Though he’s experimented and worked with various media, including clay, wire, bottle caps, and candy, the artist, also known as the Brickartist, works with the popular toy company Lego’s building blocks.

Over the years, he has joined a small club of 14 global LEGO Certified Professionals — a handful of artists, programmers, architects, and animators who are not employed by LEGO but are “officially recognised” by the toy company due to the medium they have chosen to work with.

In 2011, CNN had named The Art of The Brick as one of the top 10 ‘Global Must-See Exhibitions’. Nine years later, and there seems to be no looking back for Sawaya, who was once a corporate lawyer with a practice in New York.

In conversation with MetroPlus, the artist talks about why he gave up Law for art, how travel keeps him creating, and the logistics of trans-continental shipping of artworks that are made of thousands of Lego bricks. Edited excerpts.

What has been your relationship with building bricks? When did it occur to you to work with LEGO?

Like most kids, I had LEGO bricks growing up. My parents were always encouraging creativity. One of the stories I write about in The Art of the Brick: A Life in LEGO [his autobiography, from No Starch Press] is that when I was 10 years old, I asked for a dog, but when I couldn’t get a dog, I built a life-size dog out of LEGO bricks. That might have been the first a-ha moment when I realised that you didn’t have to build what was on the front of the box. I could let my imagination go.

It was later in life, when I was sculpting out of other media, that I thought about this childhood toy. I started experimenting with LEGO bricks as an art medium, and went from there.

How did you make the switch from law?

I used to practise corporate law in New York City. When I came home at night, I would need a creative outlet. Some nights I would draw, some nights I would paint, and some nights I would sculpt. One day I challenged myself to sculpt out of this toy from my childhood: LEGO bricks. I started doing large-scale sculptures. Most nights, I would find myself snapping LEGO bricks together even before I took off my suit or ate dinner. After a long day of negotiating contracts, it felt good to build something with my hands.

Slowly, my New York apartment started to fill up with sculptures. The artwork consumed almost every room. I posted photos on my website to showcase my artwork in a virtual gallery to friends and family. When my site crashed one day from too many hits, I realised it was time to leave the law firm and pursue my passion to become a full-time artist. I quit my job as a lawyer, opened an art studio, and took the leap of faith.

Your reinterpretations of famous paintings as LEGO sculptures connects with people of many generations — people come with their children, and both end up equally enthralled by your interpretations of famous works of art. Did you foresee this?

The series of works on art history were intended to be a way for adults to speak to kids about the art world. For example, how do you talk to a five-year-old about the Mona Lisa? By creating the works out of a medium that children are familiar with, it opens the door to the conversation.

Your original pieces comment on human nature and life, and sometimes engage with questions of philosophy. What inspires these?

A lot of pieces focus on events that happened in my own life and the emotions connected to those moments.

For example, a piece like Grasp depicts a full-size human figure pulling away from a wall of arms that are grasping at the figure and holding it back. The artwork was inspired by my own struggles when I was leaving the practice of law to become a full-time artist. At the time, I was surprised to find people in my life who were very negative about my decision to leave law. They told me I was crazy and making a mistake. I was frustrated and channelled those feelings into a new sculpture.

Do you create even as multiple shows are ongoing? How?

I am constantly working on new works of art. I think it is important to refresh The Art of The Brick when I can. But it can prove challenging with five different exhibitions on tour. Inspiration is a tough thing to define because it can come from different places. Fortunately, having multiple art exhibitions touring the globe, I get to travel around the world a lot. I get to meet different people, go to different locations and experience different cultures. And I use those moments for inspiration. I carry a sketch pad to jot down ideas as I go.

Edvard Munch’s Scream (1893), in Lego, by Nathan Sawaya

How long does it take to finish a medium-sized piece, and how do you get such an assembled piece ready to ship to different countries?

When I do find inspiration for a new work of art, there is a bit of planning. I want to be able to visualise the final piece before I put down that first brick. As I am building, I do glue each brick together. Because we ship artwork all over the world, I found that it is important to glue all of the bricks together to survive the shipping process.

That means that I sometimes have to use a chisel and hammer to break the bricks apart if I make a mistake. This can make for a slow process. When I am working on a sculpture, I spend 10-12 hours a day in my art studio. A life-size human form can take me up to two to three weeks to complete. And I will use as many as 25,000 bricks.

What is the most number of Lego bricks you’ve used in a piece that is currently showing?

One of the largest works that I have created is a dinosaur skeleton [on show at the New York Hall of Science currently] that measures almost 20 feet long. I spent an entire summer working on it, and I used over 80,000 bricks. But over the course of my career, I have also built an entire life-size coffee shop out of LEGO bricks, which used almost 1 million bricks.

You also run Art Revolution for art education in schools. How many schools have you managed to impact and how? Do you plan for its efforts to go international too?

Throughout my own personal journey, I have learned that art is not optional. It’s not a nice-to-have, it’s a must-have. When I was an attorney, I wasn’t happy, but creating art made me happy. It has been proven time and again that students do better in schools when they are exposed to art as part of the curriculum. I want to inspire people to make art, so that they make a better world. Lofty? Sure, I know, but why not? So, a few years ago, I started the Art Revolution Foundation with that goal in mind. It has been a fantastic way to encourage more art and creativity in schools. This past year, we impacted nearly 85 [American] classrooms with over 2,500 students.

186,2020/02/06,Supreme Court bats for just compensation in accident cases,"The Supreme Court has held that compensation payable to a road accident victim should not be assessed neither “very conservatively” nor too liberally that it transforms into a bounty for the claimant.

A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta also reinforced guidelines laid down by the court in 1994 for motor accidents tribunals to intervene and safeguard the “frittering away” of road accident compensation amounts in cases in which the victims are children or illiterate persons or widows or disabled persons.

The judgment came on an appeal filed by the parents of a young girl from Haryana who was left with 100% disability when a rashly driven truck hit the tractor in which she was travelling in 2007. She is bed-ridden.

Ordering compensation of over ₹50 lakh in her case, Justice Gupta acknowledged that it is “impossible to equate human suffering and personal deprivation with money. However, this is what the law enjoins upon courts to do.”

Degree of deprivation

Justice Gupta wrote that the court, while assessing the compensation, should have regard to the degree of deprivation and the loss caused by such deprivation. “Such compensation is what is termed just compensation. The compensation or damages assessed for personal injuries should be substantial to compensate the injured for the deprivation suffered by the injured throughout his/her life. They should not be just token damages,” the judgment said.

Directing the motor accident claims tribunal to invest the compensation amount for the victim in a nationalised bank as per its 1994 guidelines in the Susanna Thomas case, Justice Gupta said the guidelines were meant to protect helpless victims from unscrupulous elements. In special cases, for reasons to be given in writing, the tribunal or the trial court may release compensation amount as is required.

“We reiterate these guidelines and direct that they should be followed by all the tribunals and High Courts to ensure that the money of the victims is not frittered away,” the apex court directed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oaaf6u/article30706068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/supreme-court-bats-for-just-compensation-in-accident-cases/article30755373.ece
187,2020/02/06,Ranjeet Bachchan murder: Suspected shooter held in Mumbai,"The Uttar Pradesh Police’s Special Task Force (STF) on Thursday arrested from Mumbai the suspected shooter in the murder case of right wing Hindu outfit leader Ranjeet Bachchan in Lucknow, an official said.

Based on the information provided by the suspect, two others have also been detained, the official said, without specifying the places from where they were taken into custody.

Bachchan, 40, who had founded the Vishwa Hindu Mahasabha, was shot dead by an unidentified assailant when he was out on a morning walk on Sunday, a couple of kilometres away from the high-security Uttar Pradesh legislature complex in Lucknow.

“Based on specific information, the UP Police’s STF, with the help of their counterparts in Mumbai, arrested the suspected shooter from Mumbai on Thursday,” the official said.

“During their investigation, the STF had got a tip-off about some suspects. While going through the call detail records and mobile phone locations of the suspects, one of them was found to have fled to Mumbai in train,” he said.

Accordingly, the UP STF team reached Mumbai on Wednesday night and arrested the suspect with the help of Mumbai Police, the official added.

“During his interrogation, the police found that he had allegedly fired at the Hindu outfit leader. Based on the information provided by him, police have also detained two more persons in connection with the case,” he said.

188,2020/02/06,"Kolkata Book Fair, where disparate ideologies breathe the same air","An elderly man walking around with copies of a self-published Bengali book accosts visitors: “This has been authored by me, would you please like to buy it?”

Just when you feel sorry for him, you notice a more fortunate author doing the same thing, only that he is stationed at the stall of Penguin Random House, his publisher. “Hello!” Nemat Sadat, the author of The Carpet Weaver, calls out to those entering the stall, “Would you like to buy this book? It’s got good reviews.”

For a writer, finding readers may be a challenge, but readers out to find writers are spoilt for choice, as is obvious at the ongoing Kolkata Book Fair, the 10-day annual event showing every year that the printed word can still produce an explosion of activity in the age of smartphones.

Huge diversity

With close to 600 stalls and attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors every day — last year some 2.4 million people came — the event calls itself, perhaps rightly, the largest book fair in the world. And this being Kolkata, politics is invariably a dominating factor, more so this year, when the country is witnessing widespread protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the prospect of a National Register of Citizens (NRC). And this also being Kolkata, with a long history of inclusiveness, all kinds of political thought have found space at the book fair.

No one can miss the giant screens showing angry speeches of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Her detractors don’t have the luxury of such screens but they are also attracting visitors. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been assigned — call it a coincidence — stall no. 370. The books being sold here include those on Kashmir, Ayodhya and CAA. A man hands each visitor a pamphlet on the CAA.

Exactly opposite — perhaps again by coincidence — is the stall of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat, where a poster explains why the word “jihad” is a “misunderstood concept” and where a banner declares, “Love for all, hatred for none.”

Brisk business

Not very far from the stall of Vishwa Hindu Parishad are the stalls of publishers from Bangladesh, doing brisk business. The signboard of one Bengali publisher, Bijalpa, says “Entire Political Science”, even though the books it is selling are not even remotely connected to the subject. Meanwhile, men and boys are handing out pocket-size copies of the Bible, which people are gladly accepting because it is being given for free.

Then there is the stall of the Students’ Federation of India, manned by erudite youngsters. Here too, you find booklets on the NRC, and on Kashmir. “We have two booklets on the NRC and both have sold 500 copies each so far. T-shirts with anti-NRC slogans are also out of stock now,” said Rana Roy, one of the men at the counter, who is also a member of the SFI central committee.” Then he volunteers an opinion, “Both [Narendra] Modi and Mamata are out to finish democracy. They are two sides of the same coin.”

And finally, disparate ideologies converge at the food stalls — footfalls at which are bound to make book stalls envious. Books, food, political discourse — all in a day’s outing.

The incident was reported from a village in Biswan area of the district. All the dead originally belong to Kanpur district, police said.

“Prima facie,” said SP Sitapur L. R Kumar, the victims, were sleeping in a carpet factory they worked at. The labourers died after inhaling fumes which emanated from a liquid that spilled out from a tanker.

Two stray animals also died due to poisoning, he said. The entire area had been cordoned off for “isolation”, the officer said, adding that a combing operation was on in the nearby areas.

191,2020/02/06,Wardha victim ‘critical but stable’,"The condition of the 25-year-old woman lecturer who was set on fire in Wardha district was “critical but stable”, hospital authorities said on Wednesday.

Navi Mumbai-based National Burns Centre director Sunil Keswani, who was flown to Nagpur to supervise the treatment on Tuesday, examined the woman and had detailed discussions with the team of doctors taking care of her, they said.

The victim Ankita Pisudde (25), a resident of Hinganghat town in Wardha, is undergoing treatment at the Orange City Hospital in Nagpur.

A medical bulletin issued by the hospital on Wednesday said she “remains critical but her vitals are stable”.

She also underwent “second debridement and dressing” on Wednesday, it said. Debridement is a medical procedure to remove dead, damaged or infected tissue.

Dr. Keswani told reporters here that the initial seven days are very critical for the victim, and appreciated the timely care provided by hospital.

“The woman was fully conscious and responding, but not in a position to talk now. The condition of her lungs will be known after three or four days...All efforts are being made to save her,” he said.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier asked the police to ensure that the accused was convicted.

Meanwhile, Wardha Police on Wednesday transferred probe in the case to a special team led by Pulgaon town’s deputy superintendent of police.

“Considering the seriousness of the crime and since it is related to atrocity against a woman, the investigation in the case has been handed over to DySP Trupti Jadhav,” Wardha Superintendent of Police Basavraj Teli said.

A special team led by Ms. Jadhav will probe the case and collect all related evidence to file a charge sheet, he said.

“As per state government’s orders, we are moving an application seeking trial in a fast track court. We are also forwarding a proposal to get a special public prosecutor to represent the victim,” he said.

After the incident on Monday morning, the accused Vikesh Nagrale (27), tried to escape but he was nabbed at Butibori industrial suburb in Nagpur within four hours, he said.

Vikesh Nagrale (27), an acquaintance who was harassing the victim for quite some time, has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 326-A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc) and sent in police custody till Friday, he added.

Police were now recording statements of various people, including eye-witnesses, and parents of the victim and the accused, another official said.

According to the police, Mr. Nagrale and the woman were friends till two years ago when she severed ties with him due to his “irrational behaviour”.

“Nagrale is a married man and has a seven-month-old son. He works in a firm in Balharshah. He used to stalk the woman. He had even tried to commit suicide last year,” a police official said.

The victim’s cousin Shubham Pisudde told PTI that Mr. Nagrale was harassing her for the last many years despite repeated warnings. “Her marriage (engagement) was broken last year due to Nagrale,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5w5pfu/article30748292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMTEACHER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wardha-victim-critical-but-stable/article30748293.ece

193,2020/02/06,Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte arrested for ‘threatening’ Goa BJP spokesman,"In a late night development, the Goa Police arrested Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte for allegedly threatening a state BJP spokesman.

BJP State spokesman Premanand Mahambrey had on Wednesday filed a police complaint against Khaunte accusing him of threatening him. He had also submitted the complaint to the Assembly speaker.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (Porvorim) Edwin Colaco told PTI that Khaunte was arrested late in the night. He, however, refused to give any further details.

Police sources confirmed that Khaunte was arrested after the Goa Police approached legislative Assembly Speaker Rajesh Patnekar. The speaker’s permission is required as the assembly is in session.

The budget session of the assembly will culminate on February 7.

Police in their submission before the Speaker pointed out that the accused is an influential person and an elected representative, while the complainant is a spokesman of a political party, which might lead to further troubles.

The former state revenue minister was arrested under section 341 (wrongful restrainment) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of Indian Penal Code, a senior police officer said.

On Wednesday, Mhambrey had addressed a press conference in which he had accused Khaunte of being involved in illegalities. Later, the Goa unit chief of the BJP had alleged that Khaunte threatened Mhambrey as he was “frustrated” over the latter’s press conference. Mahambrey had then filed a formal police complaint against Khaunte accusing him of threatening him on the state assembly premises.

Khaunte had been dropped from the Pramod Sawant-led cabinet earlier last year. When contacted, Khaunte had on Wednesday denied threatening Mhambrey. “I have not touched anyone. The BJP is frustrated as we are exposing them in the House, and hence they are trying to divert the attention,” he had said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/syxdh3/article30055646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23DECUFF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/independent-mla-rohan-khaunte-arrested-for-threatening-goa-bjp-spokesman/article30748213.ece
194,2020/02/06,HC orders CBI probe into CRPF jawan’s death,"The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered a CBI investigation into the unnatural death of a CRPF jawan, hailing from West Bengal, at Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh in 2015.

A Division Bench comprising Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Kaushik Chanda ordered the CBI to investigate the death of CRPF constable Suman Roy, a resident of Tribeni in Hooghly district of West Bengal, on a prayer by his mother.

‘Taken his life’

Roy’s body was found on the CRPF campus in Neemuch district on February 24, 2015.

The authorities had claimed that he had taken his own life.

The court directed CBI authorities to complete the probe within six months and submit a report before it.

‘Mental torture’

Alleging that her son was under tremendous physical and mental torture by his superior, the jawan’s mother Jyotshna Roy moved the high court seeking an impartial probe by a central agency into the death of her son, who was undergoing training at the Neemuch facility.

Her lawyer Sk. Mujibar Rahman claimed before the court that there is enough evidence to show that there were extraneous reasons for the death of Roy and as such an impartial investigation was required to be conducted into it.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-crpf-jawans-death/article30746729.ece
195,2020/02/06,Lawyers’ strike hits normal life in Odisha,"Normal life was thrown out of gear in several districts in western Odisha on Wednesday as lawyers observed a dawn-to-dusk bandh demanding establishment of a permanent Bench of the High Court in the region.

The lawyers in the western region, with support from different political parties, have been agitating for the past several years to highlight their demand for establishment of a High Court Bench in western Odisha.

Total response

The bandh evoked total response in Sambalpur, Sundargarh and Balangir districts where government offices, educational institutions, shops, markets and business establishments remained closed during the day. Vehicular movement was also disrupted in the region.

The lawyers, who were supported by activists and workers of the Biju Janata Dal and Opposition Congress, stopped trains at several locations in the region to enforce the bandh in the morning hours.

Raising slogans in support of their demand, the lawyers condemned silence on the part of both the Centre and the State government over the issue.

On the other hand, the repeated strike by the lawyers in western Odisha over the issue has also come under criticism from various quarters since it was affecting court work and putting justice seekers in difficulty.

Contempt petition

The Orissa High Court has also taken strong exception to the strike by lawyers and instituted contempt petition against 68 Bar Associations of the State, including many from western Odisha.

BJP MP from Bargarh Suresh Pujari urged the Orissa High Court and the State government to take necessary measures to establish a permanent High Court Bench in western Odisha.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lawyers-strike-hits-normal-life-in-odisha/article30746728.ece
196,2020/02/06,Tanwar hints at floating new political party,"Hinting at the formation of a political outfit, former Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Tanwar, who had quit the party ahead of the Assembly polls last year, said that no party could accommodate his large army of supporters and therefore there was a need to float a new political party.

Rally in Karnal

Mr. Tanwar was in Gurugram on Wednesday as part of his tour across the State to mobilise support for “Swambhiman Diwas” rally at Karnal on February 16 to mark his birthday. He has earlier visited several districts, including Rohtak and Jind, addressing his supporters.

Evading a direct answer to a question on the formation of the party, Mr. Tanwar said that the future course of action would be decided at the meeting in Karnal.

Addressing his supporters, mostly former Congress workers, the former Sirsa MP said he had worked hard all these years like a horse with the blinders, but would now play “smart politics” employing all tricks.

“It won’t take more than ten days to build the organisation if each worker takes responsibility of ten villages. When a few months old party can climb to power in Delhi, it can be done in Haryana as well,” said Mr. Tanwar, adding that the next government in Haryana could not be formed without them. His supporters from around 20 Assembly constituencies were present.

Without naming anyone, Mr. Tanwar said the Congress distributed tickets in connivance with the BJP and the present government was a “milijuli sarkar” (coalition government) of all the parties and the Opposition was missing in the State.

‘Divisive politics’

He also accused the BJP of playing divisive politics and said the people were looking for alternative to the BJP and the Congress.

Mr. Tanwar said he was in touch with like-minded leaders from across the country to work on an alternative to the two parties.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lmags4/article30746721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05TANWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tanwar-hints-at-floating-new-political-party/article30746722.ece

Mr. Kumar is currently undertaking a month-long march across Bihar.

The CPI leader had launched his march on January 30 from Bhitiharwa Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran and it is scheduled to culminate on February 29 at Patna’s historic Gandhi Maidan.

A group of youths shouting pro-CAA slogans pelted stones at Mr. Kumar’s convoy at Mallik Chowk in Supaul district where he had gone to address a public meeting. Mr. Kumar was on his way to the neighbouring district of Saharsa. One person was reportedly injured in the attack and windows of three vehicles were damaged.

Mr. Kumar, though, was not hurt in the attack. Ink was also thrown at him but he escaped. The CPI leader’s supporters got down from their vehicles and protested against the attack for some time at the spot.

Later, senior district police officers reached the spot and made elaborate security arrangements for the convoy to pass through the area. “No one has been seriously injured in the incident… one person suffered minor injuries and window panes of some vehicles have been broken,” said Supaul Superintendent of Police S.K. Porika. However, no one has been taken into custody yet in the incident.

Earlier attacks

Earlier, Mr. Kumar’s convoy was attacked in Saran and Sitamarhi districts too — stones were thrown at vehicles.

198,2020/02/06,Chinmayanand released from Shahjahanpur prison on bail,"Former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand was offered flowers by supporters as he walked out of prison on Wednesday, two days after being granted bail in the case in which he is accused of sexually abusing a law student.

Mr.Chinmayanand, 72, was released from the Shahjahanpur district jail after the completion of legal formalities, prison superintendent Rakesh Kumar told PTI.

The Allahabad High Court had granted him bail on Monday. But he was not released earlier as the bail papers had not reached the jail.

While granting him bail, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi also transferred Mr. Chinmayanand’s trial from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow, taking note of the victim’s apprehension that he could influence proceedings in his hometown.

The bail order directed Mr. Chinmayanand to file an undertaking that he would not seek any adjournments and be present in court.

Outside the Shahjahanpur jail, Mr. Chinmayanand’s supporters waited for him with flowers. He was then driven to his ashram, where he offered prayers before leaving for his home.

Justice Chaturvedi had also directed Lucknow’s Senior Superintendent of Police, to depute a senior sub inspector and armed constables for the security of the student and her family members during the trial period.

Charge against Swami

Mr. Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman studied, was arrested on September 20 under Section 376-C of the IPC, a charge short of rape. It is applied when someone in authority takes advantage of his official position to “induce or seduce” a woman to have sex with him.

199,2020/02/06,"M.P. Cabinet passes resolution against CAA, calls to abrogate it","The Cabinet of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, calling upon the Centre to abrogate it as it purportedly violates the basic tenets of the Constitution and the fundamental Right to Equality.

“In order to stay away from division based on religion and ensure equality before the law for all religions, the Madhya Pradesh government requests the Government of India to abrogate the law,” reads a note, passed at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

Speaking to reporters later, Law Minister P.C. Sharma said, “The resolution will be forwarded to the Centre.” So far, Kerala, Rajasthan, Punjab and West Bengal have passed such resolutions in their Assemblies. It’s unclear whether Madhya Pradesh will follow suit.

Furthermore, the State government requested the Centre to begin the update of the National Population Register only after withdrawing the plan seeking new information in order to do away with apprehensions among people.

Stating that secularism formed the basic idea of the Constitution, the note said, “Article 14 guarantees equality and equal treatment before the law to everyone...the CAA has provisions making distinctions among illegal migrants based on religion.”

After the adoption of the Constitution in 1950, it said, this was the first instance when “a law prescribing distinction based on religion was enacted. This will endanger the country’s secular and tolerant being”.

It was beyond people’s understanding why such provisions were enacted in the law, which created apprehensions in everyone’s minds, it said. “As a result, there have been vast protests against it across the country, that are continuing. Even in Madhya Pradesh, there have been continuous protests against the law that have been peaceful and attended by all sections of society,” it added.

200,2020/02/06,"Odisha notifies listing of houses, silent on NPR","The Odisha government on Wednesday issued a notification for carrying out house-listing operations, as part of the census exercise between April and September, 2020. There was no word on the National Population Register (NPR) survey.

The house-listing and the NPR are usually conducted simultaneously. The non-issuance of notification regarding the NPR assumes significance in Odisha as the Naveen Patnaik government, unlike many non-BJP governments, had never opposed the NPR before. “We have issued notification for house-listing and we cannot comment on the NPR at this stage,” said Pradipta Mohapatra, Additional Chief Secretary in charge of Revenue and Disaster Management. The State government is reportedly waiting for a clarification from the Centre on its reservation on NPR form’s 13(ii) question on date and place of birth of parents. Once the clarification is received, notification on NPR, which is dubbed as a step towards preparing the controversial National Register of Citizens, will be issued afresh.

While supporting the Citizen (Amendment) Act, Mr. Patnaik had earlier said his government would not implement the NRC in the State.

As per the latest notification, 31 questions will be asked during house-listing exercise. They include mobile number, ownership status of the census house, total number of persons normally residing in the household and the name of the head of household.

201,2020/02/06,Uddhav Thackeray for all-women police stations in every Maharashtra district,"In wake of incidents of violence against women in different parts of the State, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed the Home department to check the possibility of setting up all-women police stations at every district.

“The idea behind such police stations is to make women, who are victims of violence or discrimination, feel comfortable to register complaints and inform police about their ordeal. Chief Minister has directed to check the possibility of setting up one such police station at every district and asked the home department to submit a report,” said an official from the Home department.

The issue was discussed in the wake of two recent incidents of violence against women in Wardha dsitrict’s Hinganghat and in Aurangabad.

The issue also came up for discussion in the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday where a demand to bring a law on the lines of Disha Act 2019 in Andhra Pradesh was made. Under the Disha Act, the total judgement time in cases of violence against women has been reduced to only 21 days and it even prescribes death penalty to rape crimes where there is adequate conclusive evidence.

In the first legislative session of the newly formed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the then Home Minister Eknath Shinde had indicated that the State government was contemplating bringing out an Act on the lines of Disha.

In the discussion on Wednesday, certain reservations were also raised on whether 21 days was for investigation and court proceedings to punish the real criminal.

Meanwhile, Mr. Thackeray has directed that no sympathy be shown to those involved in crimes against women. “Any police officer or government employee who will delay the process will be facing strictest possible action.

To ensure that every case of crime against women is fast tracked, the government will give priority to set up fast track court or special courts,” Mr. Thackeray said at the meeting.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dkd5y4/article30746359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMUDDHAVTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uddhav-thackeray-for-all-women-police-stations-in-every-maharashtra-district/article30746360.ece

A curtain raiser to encourage visitors to visit Orchha was held in Mumbai on Wednesday.

The festival, which begins on March 6, will showcase music, dance, heritage walks, local cuisine, arts and handicrafts. The first day of the festival will be held at Jahangir Mahal, built in 17th Century by the then ruler Vir Singh Deo in honour of the Mughal emperor Jahangir. Mumbai-based Clinton Cerejo, known for composing ‘Madari’ on Coke Studio, will collaborate with Madhya Pradesh’s local folk and classical artistes. “Through this collaboration we aim to empower the local artists and bring them on the global map,” explained Yasmin Kidwai, festival director, Namaste Orchha.

203,2020/02/06,Chandrakant Patil hints at mid-term elections in Maharashtra,"Asserting that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government would be unable to complete its full term of five years, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit president Chandrakant Patil on Wednesday hinted at the possibility of mid-term polls.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Patil, took pot shots at the Chief Minister’s recent interview in Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana in which Mr. Thackeray accused the BJP of ‘betrayal’ that led to the Sena forming a coalition government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress.

“The people of Maharashtra are aware of who has betrayed whom. Those reposing their hopes in this [MVA] government running its full five-year course will be disappointed…if this is the way Mr. Thackeray is thinking, then the public will give him a fitting answer during the mid-term polls which is sure to follow later this year,” Mr. Patil said, in a riposte to Mr. Thackeray’s Saamana interview.

The BJP leader cast aspersions on the political designs of the Congress, accusing it of “deliberately detaching” the Shiv Sena from its Hindutva ideology in an allegedly planned manner to make way for Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) to occupy the vacated ‘Hindutva space’.

The MNS’s change of ideological direction, symbolised by its adoption of a saffron flag, has triggered intense speculation of Raj Thackeray’s party inching closer to the BJP.

However, Mr. Patil downplayed such speculation, stating: “While we are in agreement with the MNS demands that sons of the soil ought to be given jobs, we do not agree to its chauvinist stance on outsiders not being allowed to work in Maharashtra.”

The BJP State unit chief, who has openly welcomed an alliance with the Sena despite the bitter estrangement and the bad blood between the two erstwhile saffron allies, stressed that he was still the Sena’s “well-wisher”.

“It was only because of the Sena that the Marathi manoos and the Hindu community was saved,” remarked Mr. Patil.

At the same time, he said if Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was indeed serious about his party’s Hindutva credentials, his party must come out in support of the BJP over the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), while supporting the Bharat Ratna to be posthumously given to Hindutva leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.

Mr. Thackeray has said that while there is misconception regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), his government would never permit the implementation of the NRC in Maharashtra.

“If Mr. Thackeray feels that there is indeed widespread misconception about the CAA, then his government ought to stop the anti-CAA protests in the State. Further, he should support the BJP on the NRC and in fighting for the Bharat Ratna to be given to ‘Veer’ Savarkar. It should not keep silent when the Congress insults Savarkar,” said Mr. Patil.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chandrakant-patil-hints-at-mid-term-elections-in-maharashtra/article30746183.ece
204,2020/02/06,NDC criticises railways for defacing heritage train station with murals,"The Nilgiri Documentation Center (NDC) has written to the general manager of Southern Railways criticising them for what the NDC termed to be “the wanton mutilation” of the front of the Heritage Ooty Railway station, which was recently painted with murals depicting the lives of tribal communities in the Nilgiris.

Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director of the NDC, said that heritage railway station across the world are preserved as close to their original architecture and look.

“That is what heritage is all about. Can one paint the Victoria Terminus or the Southern Railway Headquarters?” wondered Mr. Dharmalingam, in a statement.

In a statement he said that the NMR was a world heritage site and had to be preserved for the benefit of heritage enthusiasts across the world. “Every enthusiast expects to relive the history and flavour of the original site. Snowdonia in Wales has the only other running mountain railway line built by Roman Abt, the architect of NMR. In comparison to NMR, its significance is negligible. Yet, the whole town protects and preserves the rail line as their treasured heritage,” he said,

While commending the railways for their initiatives to promote tourism along the NMR, he said that the NMR stations themselves have been transformed “unimaginatively.”

“The changes are doubly regrettable. By trying to glorify the tribes depicted in the graffiti [sic] on the face of the building, the Southern Railway has in fact denigrated them. Tribals and indigenous people are not objects of public display or publicity. It betrays a lack of sensitivity on the part of your officials.

205,2020/02/06,Gudalur bus stand to be renovated at a cost of ₹ 4.5 crore,"The Gudalur bus stand, is to be finally be expanded and renovated at a cost of Rs. 4.5 crore, officials confirmed.

Speaking to The Hindu, top officials from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and the Gudalur municipality said that the present 50 acre bus stand serves as both a bus terminus and also a bus depot. The facility needed a face-lift and expansion urgently for the last few years due to the increase in the number of buses plying to the town.

“The present facility is split into two halves, with one half being used as a bus terminus and the other being used as a depot,” said a TNSTC official. The new plans, pending town planning approval, aims at moving the bus depot to a plot of land, around an acre in total area, below the existing bus stand.

“The existing bus stand will also be extended, from around 50 cents to around 80 cents, which means that where only six buses could find space to be stopped at the bus terminus at any particular time, there will now be space for between 12-15 buses,” said the official.

The municipal administration is to undertake the construction of the facility before it is handed over to the TNSTC. “We expect the work to commence in around two month’s time,” added an official.

S. Sivasubramaniam, general secretary of the Gudalur Consumer Protection Association, welcomed the news of the bus stand’s expansion and modernization. “The Gudalur bus stand has been in need of urgent expansion for many years. During peak hours, traffic essentially comes to a standstill within the town, caused in part due to the bus stand being too small to accommodate more than a few buses at a particular times. We urge the authorities to expedite the construction of the bus stand, so that it can be ready by the summer tourist season in 2021,” said Mr. Sivasubramaniam.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/us905n/article30747608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB06BUSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/gudalur-bus-stand-to-be-renovated-at-a-cost-of-45-crore/article30745659.ece
206,2020/02/06,‘Town of Export Excellence’ recognition for Pollachi,"The Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry has classified Pollachi as a ‘Town of Export Excellence’ for coir and coir products, according to a communication dated January 29 from the Ministry.

“The tag itself is a brand that Pollachi will benefit from,” said S. Mahesh Kumar, president of the Coir Pith Exporters' Association.

Export turnover

According to Pollachi Member of Parliament K. Shanmugha Sundaram, the annual coir and coir product export turnover of the town is more than ₹ 1,000 crore. The recognition is one of the long-pending demands of the coir industry in Pollachi. Nearly 28,000 containers of coir products are exported out of Pollachi every year.

Inland Container Depot

With the recognition, Pollachi can get an Inland Container Depot (ICD) or container stuffing facility. The town will be listed in the Ministry’s portal. This will enable overseas buyers identify Pollachi to source their coir needs. Further, nationalised banks will also be willing to lend more to the sector.

Mr. Mahesh Kumar added that there are certain common facilities that the industry cannot invest and develop without government support. Pollachi is now recognised as a town that specialises in coir and its byproducts. With this it can have more cluster programmes and common facilities such as testing laboratory and ICD. Not only coir product exporters, but the domestic industry will also benefit from this. They can look at developing new products and have common infrastructure.

The coir and by-products industry in Pollachi will look at developing an industrial park with integrated facility. If the government can allocate land for the project, all the required facilities can be developed.

Rail transport

On the need for ICD, he said the exporters now send consignments by road to Thoothukudi or Kochi. If there is rail transport facility from Pollachi, the logistics cost will reduce and make the products competitive in the international market, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/town-of-export-excellence-recognition-for-pollachi/article30745653.ece
207,2020/02/06,Corporation to commission 3.6mW solar power plant,"Coimbatore Corporation will soon commission a 3.6mW solar power plant, Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath told reporters here on Wednesday. Though the deadline for commissioning the ₹ 17.8- crore plant was June, the Corporation hoped to complete the work by February or March.

The plant would take the total power the civic body generated to 5.6mW, as it had already two one mW plants in Ukkadam and Kavundampalayam.

The Corporation had proposed to use the power generated at the plant to offset the power it consumed to run the water treatment plant at Velliangadu, just as it was using the power generated from the Ukkadam 1mW plant.

Mr. Jatavath said the Corporation chose to use the solar power generated to offset the consumption at the water treatment plant because the charges the Tangedco levied for the HT line at the plant was higher than it charged for LT consumption.

With the 15 lakh units a month the Corporation generated, the civic body had saved around ₹ 45 lakh in power consumption. If it had offset the generation against any LT consumption, the savings would have been less, he explained.

If the Corporation had any surplus power left to offset from the 3.6mW plant, it would use the same for other HT consumptions like sewage treatment plant.

Mr. Jatavath said the Corporation recently won an award from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for its solar projects because it not only invested in renewable energy but also used a land that was reclaimed to commission the plant.

The land reclaimed was earlier a sewage farm, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/o84gxn/article30747581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB06SOLARPOWERPLANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-to-commission-36mw-solar-power-plant/article30745642.ece
208,2020/02/06,Apartments oppose Corpn.’s directive on waste management,"Federation of Coimbatore Apartments has taken up with Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani the civic body’s move to stop collecting waste at door step.

In its representation, submitted a couple of days ago, the Federation said the Corporation treating flats differently from houses to stop collecting waste was discriminatory.

The waste generated in flats was as domestic as those generated in houses. But the Corporation treated the flats differently by asking the apartments to manage their waste. It appeared as if the flats were commercial enterprises.

The Corporation had told them that they could process in-house the waste or engage a service provider. Many apartments had engaged such service providers and the engagement came with a cost. While the apartments were ready to segregate at source the waste, it was unfair of the Corporation to treat the apartments different, the Federation argued.

The Federation's petition has come close on the heels of the statement made by Justice (retd.) P. Jyothimani, Chairperson, State Level Monitoring Committee of NGT for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu.

He had said that apartments could not cite the payment of property tax to argue that the Corporation must extend the waste management service. It would be in contravention of the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 wherein the Government of India had clearly said that apartments generating over 100 kg a day would be classified bulk waste generators to manage their waste.

Commenting on the development, Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said if the apartments did not want to engage service providers with a fee they could look at in-house solutions like installation of bio-digesters or biogas plants.

The service providers charged a fee from apartments to collect and transport the waste to the designated micro compost centres.

The Corporation would not get into the service providers’ fee issue and leave it to the market.

Mr. Jatavath also said the Corporation had started with those apartments that generated over 100kg a day. It would next move to those apartments that generated over 50 kg a day, as mentioned in the Rules.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tmg2j2/article30747537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB06APARTMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/apartments-oppose-corpns-directive-on-waste-management/article30745624.ece

Mahmudul Hasan Joy rose to the occasion with a 100 off 127 balls, helping Bangladesh overcome the 212-run target in 44.1 overs.

After losing the openers cheaply in the chase, Joy paired up with Towhid Hridoy (40) first before teaming up with Shahadat Hossain (40 not out) to share a 101-run stand for the fourth wicket and fashion a resounding win.

New Zealand had recovered to make 211 for eight after being 74 for four at one stage, courtesy an unbeaten 75 off 83 balls from Beckham Wheeler-Greenall.

212,2020/02/06,Jofra Archer out of IPL with stress fracture,"Top England fast bowler Jofra Archer was on Thursday ruled out of the upcoming Indian Premier League due to a stress fracture in his right elbow.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that Archer, who plays for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, will also miss England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka. He is expected to be out of action for three months.

“Archer underwent further scans on his injured right elbow yesterday in the UK which confirmed a low grade stress fracture,” said the ECB in a statement.

“He will now commence an injury rehabilitation programme with the ECB medical team with a view to be ready for the international summer campaign starting in June against the West Indies in a three-match Test series,” it added.

Archer experienced discomfort in his right elbow during the series in South Africa in December when he could only play the Boxing Day Test.

The 24-year-old Barbados born pacer has represented England in seven Tests and 14 ODIs, taking 30 and 23 wickets respectively. He has also played a T20 International.

His absence is a big blow to Rajasthan Royals ahead of the IPL beginning next month.

In 21 IPL games, Archer has picked up 26 wickets at an average of 23.69.

214,2020/02/06,India eyes improved batting show against England,"India Women will have to address its batting woes when it takes on England Women in a crucial league match of the T20 Tri-series here on Friday.

A mid-innings slump led to India’s four-wicket defeat in its previous match against Australia. This was after beating England by five wickets in the tournament-opener last week.

Except for opener Smriti Mandhana (35) and captain Harmanpreet Kaur (28), the Indian batters showed a complete lack of application on a pitch offering extra bounce at Canberra. India lost the last six wickets for 21 runs to concede the match with seven balls to spare.

The Indian batters, especially in the middle and lower-order, will need to produce a much-improved show against England to brighten their chances of reaching the final.

216,2020/02/06,No impact of T20 drubbing on ODI unit: Henry Nicholls,"New Zealand batsman Henry Nicholls on Thursday said the One-Day International squad did not carry the baggage of the T20 blanking by India and that reflected in its highest run chase in 50-over cricket.

Riding on Ross Taylor’s 21st hundred, the hosts chased down their highest total in ODIs on Wednesday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. The second ODI will be played here on Saturday.

No pressure

“We didn’t feel it as part of the group coming in. So I wasn’t feeling any pressure and there is no need to prove anything. It was a small ground and a big chase, so it was nice we were able to do that,” Nicholls said on Thursday.

“It was great, our biggest chase ever in ODI cricket and it was good to be able to contribute in it. In the past, playing India in India, we have had a couple of chases around the 300-mark and others we got close. It was nice to do that again at home, and to actually win the game, it was great,” he said.

Taylor smacked an unbeaten 109, with Tom Latham knocking 69 off 48 balls. Their partnership broke India’s bowling strength in the middle overs. Nicholls paid rich tribute to the two senior batsmen.

More than just runs

“Having someone like that at number four, especially with Kane Williamson not being there as well, the experience he brings is immense. It is not just about the runs, because batting with him in the middle, you keep having those conversations that help your batting too.

“The dimensions of the ground helped us and he certainly likes batting there. It was a great partnership and great knock from him. Ross being there till the end to be not out and win the game was immense for us,” Nicholls said.

On Lathham’s knock, he said: “Tom and I have played together for a long time, so I have certainly seen him play like that before. He is very versatile and adaptive to the game scenario and conditions. The way he started, well it was slow, 2 off 10 balls or something.

“But he managed to put the pressure back on Kuldeep (Yadav) and their other spinners. Being captain he led from the front and that partnership changed the game for us,” he said.

Seddon Park’s dimensions came into sharp focus, as a shorter boundary on one side benefitted the chase. The second ODI will be played at Eden Park which has still shorter boundaries.

“The short boundary proved to be really important for us. There was some breeze as well in the evening. So whenever they bowled through the middle, or bowled short, we pushed back with boundaries.

“Their attacking bowlers couldn’t bowl with the bigger boundary and it played into our hands. Ross managed it pretty well and again for Tom to come to the crease, and attack the way he did, it really changed the game.

Credit to bowlers

“On a short ground, the credit goes to our bowlers who realised it could be a 360-370 score. But they kept it to a smaller score which could be chased down. For us as a batting unit, we know we can chase high scores on that small ground,” said Nicholls.

He said he would continue to open as long as the management wanted, despite suggestions that Latham could move up top given his form.

“Opening is not too different. I am used to batting in a few different spots. I was opening a bit for Canterbury coming into this series. So I am trying to form a new partnership up top with Martin Guptill, and get those platforms in.

Confident

“I was disappointed to get out after a good start. But with Ross there and the way Tom started, I was confident we could get the chase done. In the end we only needed run-a-ball and it was the biggest factor for us to finish the game,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7346d6/article30754842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07LATHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-impact-of-t20-drubbing-on-odi-unit-henry-nicholls/article30754843.ece
217,2020/02/06,It hurt me after I was dropped for the last game: Vignesh,"Before the second innings, K. Vignesh had a below-par performance this season with just 10 wickets to show from 10 innings. He was dropped from the side in the last match against Railways and even in the first innings, failed to step up to the plate.

But come the second innings, a return to his old expressive approach and a short pep-talk from Dinesh Karthik helped the 25-year-old turn things around on Thursday.

“I just wanted to come back and do what I was capable of. It hurt me badly after I was dropped for the last game,” said Vignesh.

“Dinesh Karthik spoke to me for just five minutes, telling me how I used to bowl and asked me to just go back and do that. Even on flat tracks, I used to hit the deck hard and make things happen, which I have not been able to do this season. He noticed that and pointed it out to me.

“I wanted to have a go at the batsmen and make them uncomfortable. It changed the perspective of what I need to and I want to build on from this performance.”

Tamil Nadu coach D. Vasu was a happy man with his side’s all-round performance.

“It was a crucial toss to win and we did well to bowl them out for 174. Abhinav and Suryapprakash played well and have been giving us good starts in the last three matches. Vignesh, with his back to the wall, delivered in the second innings which is good for Tamil Nadu cricket,” said Vasu.

The coach also praised the sporting wicket, saying, “the red soil wicket has got turn, bounce and there are runs to be made as well. These are the kinds of wicket we should be playing on for the betterment of the game.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/it-hurt-me-after-i-was-dropped-for-the-last-game-vignesh/article30752923.ece
218,2020/02/06,Ranji Trophy | Comprehensive victory for Tamil Nadu against Baroda,"For the second match in succession, Tamil Nadu secured a comprehensive victory with a bonus point, defeating Baroda by an innings and 57 runs on the third day of their Group B Ranji Trophy match here on Thursday.

Led by pacer K. Vignesh’s five-wicket haul, Tamil Nadu needed just two sessions to bowl out Baroda for 259, after taking a 316-run lead on the second day.

The victory keeps Tamil Nadu’s slim hopes of qualification alive and it will need another big win in the next match against Saurashtra at Rajkot.

The Motibaug wicket always has something in it for the pacers in the first session and M. Mohammed struck in the third ball of the day, removing opener Ahmadnoor Pathan caught at gully.

Kedar Devdhar and Vikram Solanki did well to survive the next hour before the home team imploded.

Vignesh then turned things around for the visitor with a fiery spell during which he claimed three wickets to peg back Baroda.

He bowled with great intensity, hitting the deck hard and extracting good bounce from the surface. Right from the first over, he was willing to test the batsman with bounce and it paid rich dividends.

The pacer removed Devdhar, caught at slip with the extra bounce, and then had Deepak Hooda mistiming a pull, giving an easy catch to deep square-leg.

He then accounted for Yusuf Pathan, who was brilliantly caught diving forward by Abhinav Mukund at deep point.

At the other end, Sai Kishore bowled Vishnu Solanki and when he had Swapnil Singh caught at silly point, Baroda was reduced to 62/6.

Baroda skipper Krunal Pandya (74) changed gears and went after the bowlers. He first hit Vignesh for two sixes over midwicket before smashing Sai Kishore all over the park for five boundaries across two overs.

In the post-lunch session, Krunal and Atit Sheth (70) continued to play with freedom and slammed quick half-centuries.

Vignesh came back to dismiss Krunal, caught in the deep point region before sending back Anureet Singh caught behind to complete a five-wicket haul.

Mohammed, who set it up for Tamil Nadu with a seven-wicket haul in the first innings, fittingly finished the job with a yorker to remove Sheth.

220,2020/02/06,Shaw has earned his spot back,"The selectors had to make two, perhaps, three tough calls before naming the 16-member squad for the two-Test series in New Zealand.

The wise men had to get their opening combination right in the absence of the injured Rohit Sharma, who had taken flight as a Test opener. And the selection of Prithvi Shaw ahead of the in-form K.L. Rahul suggests the selectors do not want to lose the gifted Shaw, who has come through a demanding phase marked by suspension and injury.

Impressive record

In his three Test innings so far, all against the West Indies at home in 2018, Shaw’s scores were an impressive 134, 70 and 33 not out.

It is fairly certain that Shaw will open with the secure Mayank Agarwal in the first Test in Wellington, beginning on February 21. The ball will dart around and a sound start is essential.

It is also clear that Shubman Gill, an elegant, free-flowing batsman, is being seen as a reserve opener, who can also step in at No. 3 or 4, if required.

Shubman opens for Punjab but his recent scores of 83 and 204 not out for India-A against New Zealand-A at Christchurch came at No. 4. Rahul has to add solidity to flamboyance, tighten his defence for the longest format.

Left-arm chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav is unlucky to miss out. After all, his last Test performance outside India was a five-wicket innings haul against Australia in Sydney.

But then, the opportunities for this skilful spinner would have been limited with R. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja around.

Not all about seamers

Actually, the spinners have had their moments in New Zealand; it’s not all about seamers. Since 2013, the Kiwis have won five out of their nine matches at Wellington’s iconic Basin Reserve, drawn two and lost two.

The two defeats came against Australia and South Africa with Nathan Lyon and Keshav Maharaj playing dominant roles.

Bowling against the rough winds at the Basin Reserve is a physically demanding task in itself but the spinners with control can lock one end up — the pacemen can attack with the wind behind their back — and strike too, since they will achieve dip and drift.

Rishabh Pant’s selection — he is value for money outside the sub-continent because of his aggressive batting and less work standing up — cannot be faulted. The fast and efficient Navdeep Saini justifies his place too.

Different force

New Zealand could be a different force in Tests. Swing bowlers Trent Boult [if fit] and Tim Southee, battering ram Neil Wagner and the effective Colin de Grandhomme can be quite a proposition if the pitches are seamer-friendly.

But then, this Indian team, bolstered by Jasprit Bumrah’s return, can hit back too.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2ax1z2/article30745922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06SHAW,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/shaw-has-earned-his-spot-back/article30745923.ece
221,2020/02/06,In pursuit of rasa,"It was a gathering of dance practitioners, aspirants and academicians on a cold afternoon at the Mysore Association, Matunga, to hear Shatavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh speak on ‘Vibhava and Anubhava’ in the first of the lecture series of Chaitanyalahiri, hosted by Revathy Srinivasaraghavan and Dr. Suman Badami.

Welcoming and introducing the erudite speaker, Suman said, “It is our endeavor to extend beyond classroom learning.”

“Describing rasa is like describing taste. It is anubhuti, experiential not inferential,” said Dr. Ganesh. In Vibhava, artiste uses body for articulation. In a solo performance, Aharya establishes external ambience with minimum expense.

“Only a person rich in emotion can bring it out,” averred the speaker. Using the emotion as raw material, the sthayi bhava, the state of a permanent mood is sublimated towards the finished product ie., rasa. Attendant emotional conditions, vibhava, anubhava, vyabhichari bhava are the combined catalysts for rasa. Now named as sanchari, the dance interpretation is like the sangati, musical variations.

The dancer should keep the aesthetic distance that is involving without involving.

Adding to the clarity of his statements, he cited scenes from Shakuntalam, to describe Alambana, the hero and the heroine, determinants and Uddipana, the excitants, support of heroine’s friends — Anusuya and Priyamvada. Vyabhichari bhava are transitory influences supporting the sthayi bhava, the primordial emotion.

Extending beyond the subject, the speaker offered titbits that came as subsidiary information: Instant rasas are hasya, veera, rowdra, bheebhatsa and bhayanaka. Purusha is a gender neutral. Kama stands for finer aspects of mind. Kamasutra lists the 64 arts and one of them is dance. Art is connected with chitta vritti, not mere body. Lyricist for dance should know basic classical music and dance.

He quoted Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam who advocated that body has to be trained to forget itself. “Importance of anga shudhi, grace of the body is more important than physical beauty,” he said.

“Sringara rasa is like the drawing room of a home and other rooms offer sustenance. Nritta, pure dance, is non- referential and pleasing embellishment. Sringaram in vernacular means beautification.”

Dr. Ganesh listed the different interpretations of Shoka rasa.

When a commoner speaks he is exact and functional while dancers elaborate. Their narration is vivid, and intensified in communication.

Avadhana is concentration and every true dancer is an avadhani, who connects with the musicians of the orchestra, the lyrics, the presentation and with the audience.

Dance presenter make a flow chart. Dancers have it in their hardware: the universal emotion of the world past, present and future. So much of emotion can be shown only through dance. An honest artiste’s attempt always reaches the viewer.

Every performer is a researcher. Research done with awareness becomes robust. Individuality is good but commonality is needed to reach larger audience.

“Kalidas is contemporary and eternal,” he said. Classical is constantly evolving as per the situation and context.

Sastras are encoded documentation of collective observation and experiences, said Dr. Ganesh, highlighting the necessity of looking at Sastra as a ready reckoner, capsuled reference providing the missing links and importance of Sastrakaras who assimilate information from all corners, codify them and establish the truth.

Shastra is not for scrutiny and validation but for aiding us to enhance the experience that we get by observing them in our daily life. Shastra is not an unnecessary appendage.

Bharatha is not prescriptive but descriptive; shelf life of Bharatha is as long as human existence.

The informed speech of Dr. Ganesh for close to three hours was extempore, simple and scholarly, and an appetiser for aspiring artistes. The talk was an impetus to dancers to fortify themselves with theoretical knowledge to accentuate presentations with skilled precision, whereby the spectator is emotionally absorbed into the art with pure joy of rasa experience.

This effort of Chaitanyalahari, at “demystifying shastras” as indicated by Suman proved that “the more rooted we are, the more we are able to fly.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/k38s0d/article30751411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07frShatavadniGaneshjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/in-pursuit-of-rasa/article30751412.ece
222,2020/02/06,Etiquette takes backseat in concert halls,"“The podi idlis are flying off the plate — like Alarmel Valli!” I effuse over the nimble numbers at Chennai’s famous restaurant. Such is Valli’s impact that her style has rather become synonymous with the lithe. Few things I recall as vividly as the first time I saw Valli dance, at the Hyatt Regency Chennai’s Bee Festival in 2012. Those were days when one could actually see the artiste, hear the music, without a zigzag of outstretched clicking/filming mobiles thrust into your line of vision, or suddenly bleating during the recital.

Last year, at The Music Academy, where I have attended the celebrated Music & Dance Festival since 2012, in a moment of excessive zeal I compared an illustrious young dancer to the incomparable Valli. A veteran lawyer chided me, “Valli at that age was pouncing around the stage.” I immediately regretted the comparison. More so the next day when during her guru Malavika Sarukkai’s show the said dancer sat right before me WhatsApping away furiously through the performance. I habitually tick off my neighbours, “Your phone is disturbing”, but could I reprove a well-known dancer? Besides, I was astonished that an artiste could disrespect not only viewers but also the venerated guru. Yet when a small-time Kuchipudi dancer went on remorseless WhatsApping, I smote, “You are disturbing me!”

Food, phone, fan

After five seasons of sustained mediocrity, this year the Dance Festival displayed an exhilarating, avant-garde modernity. But commensurate with the new-found excellences was the libertinage with phones, food, fans and photography equipment within the auditorium. Remarkably, it was the first time one wasn’t requested before each performance to switch off mobiles, refrain from bringing food and drink into the auditorium and videoing/photographing recitals. The consequences were baneful. Through most of Apsaras Arts Dance Company’s ‘Alapadma,’ I saw only half the lotus unfold, the other half being obstructed by a large exotic fan suddenly thrown open and swayed about wildly by the lady in front of me.

Bijayani Satpathy’s consummate Odissi solo, crafted, witty, ingenuous, was slashed and gashed by raised mobiles clicking or filming away, whilst a camera the size of a cannon stationed in front of me obliterated Praveen Kumar’s tremendous acrobatic feats. Only Valli’s comeback concert elicited a little more reverence. Even Sanjay Subrahmanyan’s great appeal didn’t deter my neighbour from scouring the net for recipes. Concerts have been reduced to a frenzy of mobiles ringing or oinking messages, plastic crackling, tiffin boxes clanking, mouths yapping, chomping, glug-glugging and the fat man next to you snoring.

My complaints have been as tenacious as the disruptions, the excuses for indiscipline as intriguing, including “This is India.” How encouraging. Moreover, a committee member revealed that The Music Academy had dispensed with the request to switch off mobiles, not film/photograph because nobody heeded. Signs still prohibit food and drink in the auditorium, which has notwithstanding turned into a picnic spot — a prominent doctor from Apollo Hospitals was swinging a coffee thermos up and down in front of me whilst an old lady opened a tiffin with idlis, sambhar and chutney, their odour permeated the auditorium…

This year saw a stupendous rise in foreigners attending, some of whom commented on the unusual etiquette within the auditorium. The rigorously disciplined Japanese, Germans and Singaporeans were especially stupefied. Indians come across as savages. Why aren’t regulations firmly enforced within the auditorium and disruptive elements politely removed? Last year there was the fear that were stricter norms slapped the already dwindling crowds would altogether disappear (which the prosaic performances deserved). This year the concerts were throbbing so the excuse was that it would be “too rude” to enforce discipline.

I fail to fathom the Indian tenets concerning courtesy and propriety. Surely, it is rude to disturb others. It is not rude to be asked not to disturb others.

To quote this year’s ‘Nrtya Kalanidhi’ recipient Priyadarsini Govind, we need to “preserve and protect” for posterity what is of value. Notably as The Music Academy, once the prerogative of the more rarefied strata of society, is now ushering in a wider audience (as it should if classical art must survive what Govind called the perpetual “state of emergency” of modern times) and newcomers shouldn’t think this is an institution where permissibility is permissible.

Already The Music Academy, where concerts were once punctual as a Shinkansen, has slipped into a temporal bagginess, whilst standards are becoming as flabby as some of the unwieldy dancers amidst murmurs that they should confine themselves to teaching.

Thrilling space

On a commendable note, this season saw the dance discourse pirouette into a thrilling, intellectually challenging space. Apoorva Jayaraman’s audaciously, unconventionally secular concert made for change. Thank God the inexorable Krishna padam at every Bharatnatyam show ceded to novelties. The inaugural Renjith & Vijna Bharatnatyam, apotheosising in a thunderous Maha Kali piece, exemplified further evolution with the provocative interaction of Kali and the asura: from the suggestive as in the yearning expressions of a Valli exploring the ambiguity between the sacred and the sexual, classical dance was fox-trotting with overt choreography into the blatantly sensual. And then, Valli interestingly danced to a Telugu poem on flowers as sentient creatures that suffer at our plucking of them. She called the poem “powerful” and yet her head was flower-laden. Knowing Valli, was this deliberate, asking has art really the power to transcend tradition?

Mark Van de Vreken, the Belgian Consul General to Chennai, said, referring to fusion art, that mixing dosa and chocolate mousse doesn’t make for the finest amalgam. Precisely why it was exciting to see innovations and evolution within the scope of the classical form. Of course, it might do well to give the masala in the dosa mousse-like finesse and make the dosa itself so ethereal that it flies off your plate — like a Valli. But for that you need technique and few dancers today are endowed with it. Because to hone technique you need discipline!

Outside India, Indian classical art forms seemingly survive with more rigour. Dare I say that the Singapore-based Apsaras Arts Dance Company’s ‘Alapadma’ was a far more accomplished performance than anything I have seen on the Kalakshetra stage recently and few Indian dancers exhibit the perfection of the lovely young Nikita Menon who stole the show.

If the next season promises to be as enthralling, let’s hope the audience will conduct itself with discipline and dignity. After all, if you spend your entire time filming or photographing a performance, maniacally dispatching instagrams “in a state of emergency,” how do you enjoy the subtleties, nuances, intellectual stimulation and poetic flights of a concert?",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/cigu8e/article30750913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07FRCover,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/etiquette-takes-backseat-in-concert-halls/article30750914.ece
223,2020/02/06,Ghalib and an untold love story,"The warm glow from the lanterns lights up the stage. A large chandelier and sets with intricate jaali work recreate the ambience of the royal court. Opulent silk costumes lend an old world charm. The timeless and eloquent verses of a celebrated poet and the delicate, sensuous moves of a well-known courtesan bring alive an untold love story.

Dancer-choreographer Manjari Chaturvedi’s ‘The Legend of Nawab Jaan and Mirza Ghalib’ is a beautiful blend of history, literature and the performing arts.

Manjari conceived the production last year as a tribute to Ghalib on his 150th death anniversary. “Whatever be the mood or emotion, it is in his verses that we find the best expression. So it bothered me that nothing much was being done to remember his unparalleled contribution to literature. As part of my ongoing Courtesan Project, which has turned the spotlight on the exquisite artistry of tawaifs (courtesans), I stumbled upon the story of Nawab Jaan, an ardent admirer of Ghalib. And I decided to look at Ghalib through her eyes,” says Manjari.

The production is set in the backdrop of the Mutiny of 1857. Nawab Jaan was a singer-dancer in the court of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. She would perform to Ghalib’s ghazals and developed a great liking for the poet.

Actor Ekant Kaul as Ghalib

“It is said that Ghalib has mentioned her in his letters to friends. Though he doesn’t mention the name of the courtesan, Nawab Jaan is how I refer to her in this theatrical production. She is called Chaudhvin in the 1954 Sohrab Modi film on the poet’s life. But not much is known about their relationship, whether the admiration was mutual or if Nawab Jaan eventually became Ghalib’s muse.”

Manjari has woven the story around documented and oral history. “It was an era when much was left unsaid in romance. Letters were written in secret and a world of dreams was built in the heart. In keeping with the spirit of the time, I have used my imagination to show the bonding between the two. I convey the essence and emotions through Ghalib’s ghazals and the expressive moves of Darbari Kathak,” explains Manjari.

‘The Legend of Nawab Jaan and Mirza Ghalib’ opens with Ghalib hearing his ghazal Ishq par zor nahin, hai yeh woh aatish Ghalib Jo lagaye na lage aur bujhaaye na bane! (One can’t control love, it’s such a flame that can neither be ignited nor extinguished) being sung melodiously by Nawab Jaan when he enters her mansion. When he asks her who has written it, she tells him it’s her favourite Ghalib and that she is praying to Allah to make him the most popular.

The production concludes with Ghalib rushing to meet Nawab Jaan after being honoured with the title of Dabir ul Mulk in the Mughal court only to know that she has died thinking of him. It is said, informs Manjari, that he went to her grave and offered his favourite dushaala (shawl).

Dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai…Akhir is dard ki dava kya hai (What has happened to my heart; what is the cure for this pain?)

The Courtesan Project has been an exciting journey, says the dancer. “It has opened my eyes to precious aspects of art and literature, which I would have missed out on had I not ventured on the trail of these women, who faced social rejection, yet defined Kathak with their passion and creativity.”

224,2020/02/06,Resourceful Hanuman,"Valmiki captures the many facets of Hanuman’s unique capabilities, such as his resourcefulness, courage, demeanour, speech, etc, that are reflected in the many ways he deals with people in various contexts. It is fate that the truths Hanuman expresses in Ravana’s court that reveal his genuine concern for Ravana and for Lanka’s future, sound most distasteful to the rakshasa king, pointed out Damal Sri Ramakrishnan and Srimati Perundevi in a discourse.

Having fulfilled his prime mission, namely handing over Rama’s signet ring to Sita and also obtaining the Chudamani from her to be given to Rama as proof of his having seen Sita, Hanuman destroys the lovely groves and gardens to attract Ravana’s attention. As expected, when the rakshasa warriors attack him, he easily overpowers and kills them. Finally he allows himself to be bound by the Brahmastra aimed by Indrajit, which incidentally takes him to Ravana’s presence. Without mincing matters, he proudly announces himself as the messenger and servant of Sugriva and Rama; that he is a monkey by birth and has come as a monkey and is not anyone in disguise as Ravana and others suspect. He has seen Sita in captivity and he warns Ravana that it is not right for him to detain another’s wife.

Ravana’s wealth and virtue have been gained through practice of austerities. Virtue is lost when one becomes unrighteous. Having enjoyed the good accruing from his virtue the time has come to reap the consequence of the sin of coveting Sita. He warns him that Sita, held captive, spells disaster to Lanka. She has already consumed Lanka with her moral power. If only Ravana should ponder on this without bias, and realise that none can withstand the heat of Rama’s wrath, he could choose to give back Sita.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/resourceful-hanuman/article30754971.ece
225,2020/02/06,High Court allows minor rape victim to terminate pregnancy,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed termination of a 24-week pregnancy of a minor rape victim following a report of a medical board set up by Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital.

The report stated that there was a significant risk to the girl in continuing with the pregnancy.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru held an in-chamber discussion on the medical report with the 16-year-old girl and her parents before delivering the order in the open court. The doctor, who was present in court, said the risk associated with the procedure, including surgery, has been explained to the victim and it can be carried out within a few hours of receiving the order.With the directions, the High Court disposed of the plea filed on behalf of the girl.

The High Court had on Tuesday had ordered RML to set up of a medical board to examine the condition of the six-year-old girl and submit a report on whether continuing the pregnancy will pose any risk to her health or not.

The Union Cabinet had last month approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which provides for enhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women, like differently abled and minors.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/high-court-allows-minor-rape-victim-to-terminate-pregnancy/article30755488.ece
226,2020/02/06,Shaheen Bagh shooter to be questioned to ascertain any political conspiracy: Delhi Police,"The Delhi Police told a court on Thursday that Kapil Baisala, arrested for firing in the air in Shaheen Bagh during an anti-CAA protest, was associated with a political party and the agency needed to interrogate him to ascertain if the alleged incident was part of any “political conspiracy”.

The probe agency further told the court that Baisala did not do it in a rush of blood and it was a “well-thought-out” incident.

The submissions were made before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur who extended the police custody of Baisala by two days.

“I am of the opinion, two days further remand of accused Kapil Baisala is necessary at this stage for proper investigation of present case in order to identify supplier of alleged pistol and for purpose of further investigation of the case,” the judge said.

Police had said on February 4 that Baisala was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party and he and his father had joined the AAP in early 2019.

Additional Commissioner of Police Manoj Pant sought three days remand for custodial interrogation of Baisala on the ground that the accused was misleading the probe agency in locating the arms dealer and his laptop which has crucial evidence.

“He did not do it in a rush of blood. It was a well-thought-out incident. He raised slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” and “hamare desh me aur kisi ki nahi chalegi, sirf Hinduon ki chalegi [only Hindus shall have a say in our country, no one else] to mislead everyone. He fired two rounds in the air. He had purchased 13 cartridges in total. He is also not giving us the location of the other cartridges,” the police said.

The police said Baisala belonged to a family which has a political history.

“Accused has revealed his association with a political party and investigation of any possible conspiracy in alleged incident required to be probed. Time and place of the incident clearly indicate use of firearms at that particular place [Shaheen Bagh] seems to be a part of a larger conspiracy.

“During investigation, it has emerged that accused has political ambitions and active in politics. He belongs to a family which has a political history. Accused is to be further interrogated as to whether the incident is part of any political conspiracy. Whole conspiracy behind this is to be unearthed,” the agency said in its reply submitted before the court.

It further said Baisala’s father and brother have also been issued notices twice by the police for interrogation but they failed to come.

“He is not giving the complete address of one Sachin Tiwari, who allegedly supplied arms to him. Tiwari is a resident of Bihar and he needs to be taken to Patna to locate and identify the arms dealer. He is misleading the probe agency.

“His father and brother have not joined the investigation and deliberately avoiding it. Their phones are switched off too. We need to interrogate his friends too... Accused has to be taken to his relatives residing in Greater Noida, Meerut in search of them and thereafter they will be subjected to joint interrogation with the accused,” the police said.

It said that further custody was required to confront Baisala with several chats, conversations, call records found in his phone.

“Data stored in the phone is voluminous and complete scrutiny will take more time,” it said.

Mr. Pant added that the accused was not giving the agency the passwords of his phone, his Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok accounts.

When the judge asked Baisala where the rest of the cartridges were, he claimed he used them in marriages before.

“I have given them the password. My phone was open. The police locked the Facebook account,” he said.

The police said the accused was associated with different groups on WhatsApp whose members were being identified at his instance.

“Some have been interrogated. Others need to join the investigation. They need to be interrogated at his presence... Call data records of Baisala’s mobile phone is being scrutinised and he need to be confronted with it.

“He also need to be confronted with frequent callers and other suspects being identified and examined. Some mobile numbers are switched off and some are also not available at their residence,” it said.

Advocate Akhil Rexwal, appearing for Baisala, vehemently opposed the police remand and said the accused has given all information to the police, including the mobile numbers of his father and brother.

“If they can’t locate him, it is not his fault. He is ready to cooperate with the police and join the investigation as and when called. He will give his laptop and all other materials required.

“This is a not a political issue. He himself had given to the police the form he filled when he joined AAP. He had joined the AAP long back. The police is harassing him,” the lawyer said.

The police had earlier told the court that investigation has revealed that his WhatsApp account was purposely deleted.

“With an open mind, I am inviting Amit Shah for a debate in front of the people of Delhi to strengthen democracy,” Mr. Kejriwal said, while addressing a press conference.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal had challenged the BJP to declare a chief ministerial face and said that he was ready to debate with the particular leader.

“I want to tell the BJP that the people of Delhi want the BJP to declare a chief ministerial face. I am ready to debate with the person. The debate can be at any place,” Mr. Kejriwal had said and given time till 1 p.m. on Wednesday to the BJP.

“Since Amit Shah has been at the forefront, I would like to challenge him to a debate on any issue of his choice. The people of Delhi have a lot of questions that need to be addressed. Issues like abrogation of Article 370 and Ram Mandir are national issues. People have already voted for you [BJP] at the Centre based on these issues. But what did the BJP do for Delhi?

“If he is an AAP member, then give him double the punishment,” he added.

When asked whether his party is inquiring into the matter, he said: “Why do I need to inquire? The police are there to do the job.”

229,2020/02/06,‘Evict illegal occupants of govt. accommodations’,"The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to vacate illegally occupied government accommodations in the Capital within the next 15 days.

The High Court also pulled up the Ministry for failing to vacate about 575 illegally occupied government accommodations in the city by retired officials and former MPs, some of whom have been overstaying for over two decades now and have racked up dues of over ₹95 lakh.

“If someone is overstaying in government accommodation, you do not need a five-year plan to vacate them. Have you given them notices for recovery of dues?... Some are overstaying since 1998,” a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar remarked.

“This casual and lethargic approach indicates connivance by your officials and connivance for such a long period amounts to conspiracy under the IPC,” the Bench remarked while warning about the possibility of lodging FIRs against the officials concerned.

The High Court’s direction came after perusing an affidavit filed by the Ministry, indicating that 11 government residences were illegally occupied by former MPs, who had together racked up dues of around ₹30 lakh.

The illegal occupants include nine former Lok Sabha MPs — A.P. Jithender Reddy, Murali Mohan Maganti, Ranjeet Ranjan, Dhananjay Mahadik, K. Gopal, Veena Devi, Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, Manohar Untwal, Udit Raj — and two Rajya Sabha MPs, K.C. Ramamurthy and Sanjay Sinh.

According to the affidavit, 244 out of the 575 units that were illegally occupied by retired government employees were ‘type-II accommodations’.

The court gave two weeks time to the Ministry to file an affidavit indicating if any recovery notice has been issued and if yes, their status.

The Bench also directed the Ministry to evict within two weeks all those illegal occupants who have not obtained a stay from a court or tribunal against their eviction.

“If no stay, put their belongings, bag and baggage on the road within two weeks, if they do not vacate on their own,” the High Court said while posting the case for further hearing on February 27.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/evict-illegal-occupants-of-govt-accommodations/article30746598.ece

232,2020/02/06,Shaheen Bagh protesters hand over burqa-clad YouTuber to police,"A woman YouTuber was detained on Wednesday at Shaheen Bagh here after anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters caught her asking “too many questions”, the police said.

The woman, who was donning a burqa, was identified as Gunja Kapoor, they said.

Ms. Kapoor described herself as the curator of a YouTube channel, ‘Right Narrative’, on her official Twitter handle. She is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.

The police said that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh turned suspicious after the woman started asking them “too many questions”. Shaheen bagh is the epicentre of protests against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act. She was handed over to the police by the protesters here.

The police also said that the women was caught by some of the women protesters after they identified her as “YouTuber Kapoor”. The incident led to a commotion at Shaheen Bagh, a senior police officer said.

“She was taken to Sarita Vihar police station police station where we questioned her. She said she was there to make videos for her online channel. She was released after few hours. We had received no complaint in the matter,” an officer said.

Some of the protesters also alleged that Mr. Kapoor was recording videos on her mobile phone.

In a statement, issued after the incident, Ms. Kapoor claimed that on Monday, when she had gone for a TV news debate at Jamia Millia Islamia, they were chased out in less than 20 minutes and people were not willing to talk to them.

‘Manhandling’

Ms. Kapoor alleged that after a journalist of a new channel was recently “manhandled” at Shaheen Bagh, she decided to don a burqa assuming that “they [protestors] become more comfortable to speak to her”. “However, once my identity was revealed, they manhandled me,” she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gdzvb9/article30748478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9lf2D8Vh400x400jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-protesters-hand-over-burqa-clad-youtuber-to-police/article30746550.ece
233,2020/02/06,Detained Punjab farmers join Shaheen Bagh sit-in,"A day after it was reported that a large group of farmers from Punjab, who arrived in Delhi to join the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, were detained by the Delhi police, the group was allowed to join the protest on Wednesday.

A large group of farmers arrived in the city on Tuesday night in around ten buses and were heading towards Shaheen Bagh when they were intercepted by the police merely 3 km away from the site. They were moved to different gurdwaras in the city where they spent the night, with policemen stationed outside.

On Wednesday, a delegation of farmers and protesters at Shaheen Bagh approached the Delhi police and following negotiations, the farmers were allowed to come to the protest site at Shaheen Bagh where they were greeted with hugs and smiles.

The police, however, said that when the farmers arrived in the city in buses, they were stopped due to “security reasons”.

234,2020/02/06,"In Tri Nagar, it’s Team Tomar at work","On a chilly morning, a group of around 25 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers took out a march in north-west Delhi’s Lok Vihar for the party’s Tri Nagar Assembly constituency candidate.

At first glance, it seemed like any other campaign march with several AAP flags, Arvind Kejriwal’s photos, chants of “lage raho Kejriwal”, and requests to the onlookers to vote for jhaadu (AAP’s poll symbol).

But there was one marked difference: the AAP candidate, Preeti Tomar, was not the one leading the march or asking for votes through a handheld microphone.

Instead, it was her husband Jitender Singh Tomar, the sitting AAP MLA from Tri Nagar.

“Kaam karne wale ko vote dena [Vote for the one who works for the people],” Mr. Tomar told onlookers.

As the AAP MLA waved and shook people’s hand, and asked them to vote for the party, Ms. Tomar — a few steps behind — flashed victory signs at the people.

During the one hour that The Hindu followed the march, Ms. Tomar came to the forefront just twice or thrice.

On January 14, AAP had declared Mr. Tomar as its Tri Nagar candidate for the polls.

‘False declaration’

But on January 17, the Delhi High Court set aside the 2015 election of Mr. Tomar, for allegedly giving false declaration regarding his educational qualification in his nomination papers. Following this, the party decided to field his wife from the constituency.

During the march, pamphlets were handed out to voters, and posters were pasted on walls, that bore three faces: Mr. Kejriwal, Mr. Tomar and Ms. Tomar.

“These were printed earlier. The new ones have only Ms. Tomar’s face,” said Mukesh Verma, 55, a party worker who had come to the march wearing a white T-shirt and a white muffler — both bearing the image of Mr. Tomar as the candidate.

“We are asking for vote in the name of work,” Ms. Tomar told The Hindu. “Vikas, vikas, aur vikas... Jaise ab vikas hua hai, aage, isse bhi zyada hoga,” said Ms. Tomar when asked about what she was promising to the people if elected.

As the march crossed B-Block, 72-year-old Ramakrishna Kurup, a retired air force officer, said: “Under them [AAP], schools and hospitals have gotten better and they have a chance of coming to power. But they won’t get as many seats as they got in 2015.”

When asked about his preference, Mr. Kurup said: “My vote is for the BJP. Narendra Modi has done a lot for the country... and country comes first.”

Twenty-four-year-old Aarti Rakwar, who had come out to see the march with her five-month-old child, said that AAP has the upper hand. “Our electricity and water are free and also bus rides. There is a lot of support for AAP,” she added.

K.P. Malkana, 66, a retired CAG deputy director, who was out on a walk, said that schools and hospitals have improved and AAP has a “good chance of winning”. His friend, however, said he would “vote for the country”.

“The BJP’s stress on the CAA and NRC will only make the voters who are already committed to the BJP more committed. It will not make much of a difference to neutral voters,” Mr. Malkana added.

As Mr. Tomar stopped to shake a voter’s hands, one of the volunteers called out “Bhabiji... Bhabiji” and signalled Ms. Tomar, who was a little away, to join the conversation. After a brief stop, the march continued.

“Preeti Tomar zindabad... Jitender Singh Tomar zindabad,” chanted the supporters.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hllbc/article30746526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6DETOMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-tri-nagar-its-team-tomar-at-work/article30746527.ece
235,2020/02/06,"Nirbhaya case convicts will be hanged soon, says Law Minister","Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has assured the Lok Sabha that convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape case will be hanged soon.

He said that the culprits were trying to delay punishment by using legal provisions despite their mercy petitions having been turned down by the President as well as the Supreme Court.

Mr. Prasad was responding to several members, especially women MPs, across party lines who have raised the issue of attack on women in various parts of the country.

Expressing deep anguish over such incidents, he said, “I have deep concern in this regard.”

“As far as hanging of convicts in the Nirbhaya case is concerned, the Supreme Court has already sentenced them to death. We are very strict... justice will be delivered. The convicts will be hanged soon,” the Minister said.

On January 7, the trial courts had issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar jail on January 22, but the same was deferred as one of the convicts filed a mercy petition.

The subsequent date — February 1 — was also put off as all the legal remedies were to be exhausted by the convicts.

236,2020/02/06,5-yr-old girl raped in Chanakyapuri,"A five-year-old girl was raped, allegedly by her neighbour, in the quarters of an embassy in Chanakyapuri, the police said on Wednesday. The 25-year-old accused, who is a driver by profession, has been arrested, they added.

Child out of danger

The incident took place on February 1 and a complaint was lodged by the girl’s family members on Sunday, the police said, adding that the child was admitted in a hospital and is currently stable and out of danger.

On the statement of the victim’s mother, a case of rape was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, a police officer said.

The police said that both the victim and the accused live in an embassy quarter.

The child’s father works as a housekeeping staff at the embassy. The accused’s father is an employee at the embassy and the youth stays in the quarter with his parents. The girl used to visit the residence of the accused often as they were neighbours, a senior police officer said.

On the day of the incident, the child was playing outside her house when the accused, on the pretext of playing games on a mobile phone, took her to his residence and raped her.

His parents were not present in the house at that time of the incident.

The girl later returned home and complained to her mother about discomfort and irritation in her private parts, he added.

When the victim’s mother questioned her, the girl narrated the incident after which the mother approached the police and lodged a complaint, the officer said.

The child was taken for a medical examination after which the doctor confirmed penetrative sexual assault, the police added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5-yr-old-girl-raped-in-chanakyapuri/article30746473.ece
237,2020/02/06,Balancing local and national issues,"BJP leader Vijender Gupta, a sitting MLA from the Rohini Assembly constituency, began his last full day of campaigning with a party meeting in Sector 8 at 7.30 a.m. on Wednesday. Over the next 12 hours, Mr. Gupta’s itinerary included five more party meetings and as many padyatras in addition to four nukkad sabhas and the same number of jan sabhas.

The MLA is a familiar face to local residents and businessmen alike in Rohini – one of the BJP’s traditional bastions. The former Delhi BJP chief, who has led a minuscule Opposition of four MLAs in the Delhi Assembly for five years, talked about local developmental projects delivered by him as well as the ongoing situation in Shaheen Bagh.

“This election is very important... it is not limited to Delhi but the whole country. We are contesting on development. The BJP is synonymous with development... from garbage dumps to issues related to societies and rural pockets, the BJP has solved each problem and will continue to do so,” Mr. Gupta told the residents of Yadav Market, located amidst the bustle of Naharpur village, one of the many rural-turned-semi-urban pockets in his constituency.

“We wanted to contest on the issue of development but the Opposition did Shaheen Bagh. They [the protesters] have shut the gateway to an important National Highway for months. It is where they are hatching a conspiracy to break the country into pieces. They are afraid of the development agenda of (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ... Your vote [for the BJP] will stop more roads and junctions from becoming Shaheen Bagh,” he added.

Apart from the BJP’s national pitches of abrogating Article 370, the construction of Ram Temple, and Centre-sponsored schemes such as ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahin Makan’ or the in-situ rehabilitation of slum clusters – promised to as many as 10,000 of his constituents, Mr. Gupta’s vision for the coming five years, according to his constituency-specific mini-manifesto, includes significant local issues.

These comprise reconstruction of internal roads and facilities such as guard rooms and local gyms, better maintenance of street lights at cooperative residential societies, in addition to solving issues related to parking and vehicular congestion in Rohini.

The BJP has held sway over the seat for over a decade; except for the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections when the party’s Jai Bhagwan Aggarwal lost to the Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajesh Garg by close to 2,000 votes. The subsequent election, in 2015, saw Mr. Gupta claiming close to 50% of the vote share with 59,867 votes polled in his favour compared to the AAP’s C.L. Gupta’s 54,500 votes.

Work plus nationalism

“Naare ko na naam ko, vote Vijender ke kaam ko (Neither on a slogan nor in someone’s name, vote for Vijender’s work)” blared a loudspeaker installed on an e-rickshaw tracing the steps of Mr. Gupt’s padyatra through Sectors 6 and 7, which primarily consist of independent, mostly multi-storey, homes.

Shopkeepers and senior citizens watched from balconies before welcoming him into their shops and offering him sweets amid chants of “Modi Zindabad” and “Jai Shri Ram”.

“Look at the support, do not take anyone’s word for it. This is real goodwill from real residents; not like [Delhi Chief Minister Arvind] Kejriwal’s army of people from outside given the task of creating support for him out of thin air,” said Subhash Garg, a local resident.

“Shaheen Bagh and [U.P. CM] Yogi Adityanath’s entry into the fray in Delhi have turned things around for the BJP over the last few days. Along with traditional loyalty of the local voter here, the nationalist narrative has made the chances brighter for the BJP,” said another resident, a property dealer by profession, not willing to disclose his identity.

While some residents – especially the elderly – said their “lives had been made better” through recreational centres set up by Mr. Gupta through his MLA fund, others claimed their MLA had remained missing in action over the last five years.

“Just showing your face during election time once in five years is not enough,” said Ashima Jain (name changed on request). “He has come to Naharpur village not more than twice in the last five years – this time and the last time there were elections around the corner,” claimed Bhola Mishra, a local shopkeeper.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4n0c0/article30746415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6DEGUPTA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/balancing-local-and-national-issues/article30746416.ece

Stating that “confidence building” mechanisms were also under way in the constituency, Mr. Singh said that paramilitary forces will also be present in the area along with local police personnel.

A total of 516 locations, including 3,704 polling booths, have been identified as critical, the Delhi poll office said.

Addressing the media before the February 8 Assembly elections, the CEO said that over 2,600 people have already cast their votes by availing the postal ballot provision made this year.

“Out of 2,917 senior citizens and PwD voters who had registered for the postal ballot system, 2,691 have cast their votes. Mobile teams were sent to their houses and the process has ended. We are happy that there was a 92.25% turnout. The postal ballot system was rolled out for senior citizens, PwD candidates and essential services,” said Mr. Singh.

“Those who did not avail the service but had registered for the postal ballot service will not be able to cast their vote on February 8,” added Mr. Singh. He further said that 30 FIRs were registered against the Aam Aadmi Party for defacement of property and violation of Model Code of Conduct; the count for the BJP and Congress were five and nine respectively.

Additionally, the poll office has received around 600 registrations for the pick-up and drop facilities, the CEO said.

“The booking for the facility had started on January 25 and was supposed to be on till January 31. But we extended the last date till February 5. Around 600 people are booked so far,” Mr. Singh said.

“I welcome this decision. It is a good thing and I congratulate the people of the country,” he said, adding: “Some people are questioning the timing. There is no timing for good work. It should be announced any time.”

Meanwhile, during a public meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Kejriwal said that he would make BJP leaders and supporters recite the Hanuman Chalisa so they can “find peace and improve their language”.

Mr. Kejriwal had recently recited the hymn during an interview with a TV channel.

This revolution will solve the problem of unemployment in the country, said Mr. Gandhi during election rallies in Kondli and Matia Mahal.Mr. Gandhi asked people to vote for the Congress so that Delhi could be turned into a manufacturing hub that will employ the youth. He added that the world was looking towards India to become an alternate manufacturing hub to China but when they look towards India, they see a country filled with hate and violence that is being propagated by Narendra Modi at the Centre and Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi.

“Mr. Modi and Mr. Kejriwal have been in Delhi for only five years, and they have come to power with lies and false promises. The Congress has a family bond with the people of Delhi and I cannot lie to my family,” Mr. Gandhi said He added that when colonies were being established across Delhi, the Congress did not ask for registration charges or ask people which religion or caste they belonged to. The Congress saw everyone as Indians and set up colonies, said Mr. Rahul.

Launching an attack on Mr. Kejriwal, the Congress leader said that the Aam Aadmi Party had come to power on an anti-corruption plank but when in power could not prove any of its allegations against the Congress.

Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra hit out at BJP leaders, saying their character can be defined by the kind of slogans they raise.

“Their slogans tell their character. Ye desh jodne wale nare hain? (Are these slogans in favour of bringing the country together),” Ms. Vadra said at a poll rally in Chandni Chowk.

“No one can get freedom in this country without Hindu-Muslim unity. If there was no unity among religions, the Britishers would still have been here. The country cannot progress with their policies, they want to divide people and do not address the real issues,” she added.

The 67-year-old retired bureaucrat, Mohammed Shaffiquzzaman, filed a PIL petition in the HC, praying that rejection of permission for public meetings, delaying permission till the last minute or imposing restrictions on rallies be declared a violation of the Constitution. He requested the court to direct the State government and the police department to adhere to Section 30 of the Police Act of 1861 and Section 22 of Hyderabad City Police Act 1348 Fasli while dealing with public meetings.

The government cannot insist on police permission in all cases of public meetings or processions on public roads, the petitioner said. The police should be instructed to ask meeting organisers to apply for permission only in the likelihood of breach of peace, he stated in the petition.

The retired officer requested the court to direct the police department to take a call on the application of meeting organisers at least seven days before the scheduled event. He also asked the court to instruct the government not to impose ‘unreasonable or irrational conditions’ on holding public meetings.

Mr. Mohammed Shaffiquzzaman sought an interim direction from the court directing the DGP and the Hyderabad Police Commissioner to place before the court all applications relating to public meetings and processions and the action taken during the January, 2020, and December, 2019.

Owing to changes enforced midway in construction, the terminal station of Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS) at Imlibun has become interchange station for passengers to change routes to Corridor One or Red Line (L.B. Nagar to Miyapur).

MGBS is said be the biggest metro station in the country (142/60 mts) where Green Line is atop the Red Line before it snakes towards L. B. Nagar. The station has levels with each again split into two, as one corridor has to pass over the other.

Interestingly, for metro trains’ maintenance, all the three corridors are connected again through extra overhead lines. Blue Line is connected to Green Line through a one km viaduct between Gandhi Hospital and Bhoiguda through Padmaraonagar-Chilkalguda without stations to enable trains to be taken towards Uppal depot.

Another 224-metre-long viaduct was built at MGBS to connect Red Line to Green Line for trains to be moved to Miyapur depot for maintenance. “Two extra elevated lines are built because the 17-acre Falaknuma depot could not be built as the project is halting at MGBS,” points out HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy.

Therefore, a reversal of about 600 metres can also be seen extending beyond MGBS station towards Falaknuma for trains to ‘reverse’ and return. Green Line also facilitates second entry/exit for Secunderabad railway station through Secunderabad West station though there is no connecting skywalk into the station.

“Completion of all three corridors marks the beginning of an era of seamless and hassle-free commuting in Hyderabad and increase the number of passengers significantly,” says L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad MD & CEO K.V.B. Reddy. As HMR races against time to get footpaths and other civic infrastructure underneath the stations ready, the heightened expectation is of the Chief Minister announcing the next phase.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wy1c1p/article30755188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HYMETROJBSPARADEGROUND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-to-open-green-line-of-hyderabad-metro-on-february-7/article30755189.ece
247,2020/02/06,"TS, AP officials to meet today on Schedule IX institutions","The two Telugu States — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — appear to have initiated definitive steps to resolve the long-pending differences between them on the division of assets and liabilities of Schedule IX institutions.

Senior officials of the four institutions listed under Schedule IX are expected to meet at the new Secretariat, BRKR Bhavan, on February 7 to discuss and resolve the differences relating to bifurcation of these institutions. The meeting, to be held under the supervision of State Reorganisation Affairs secretaries of the two States — K. Ramakrishna Rao and L. Premachandra Reddy — will be attended by representatives of the Scheduled Caste Cooperative Finance Corporation, Khadi and Village Industries Board, Goats and Sheep Federation and Medical Infrastructure Development Corporation of the two States.

The development comes in the backdrop of the meeting of the Chief Secretaries of the two States held here recently at which it was resolved to iron out the differences through consultation and mutual consent. The close-to-six-hour meeting of the Chief Secretaries reportedly decided to ensure discussions on the institutions where differences had persisted so as to arrive at a consensus on their bifurcation.

It assumes significance in the light of the AP government’s request to the Centre to treat the recommendations made for de-merger of the Schedule IX institutions by the expert committee headed by Sheela Bhide as one lot as against the Union Home Ministry’s direction to the two States to give their views and counter-comments in respect of institutions on which there are disagreements so that such cases can be considered on a case-to-case basis by it.

Of the 91 institutions listed under Schedule IX, the Telangana government gave its acceptance to the recommendations on de-merger of 68 institutions made by expert committee headed by retired bureaucrat Sheela Bhide and orders relating to majority of institutions were issued accordingly. The Andhra Pradesh government gave its nod to recommendations pertaining to de-merger of 53 institutions.

The Central government had been asked to resolve the differences pertaining the Singareni Collieries Company Limited and the State Finance Corporation. “The meeting is expected to resolve several issues provided the two sides adopt proactive approach,” a senior official said. More such meetings would be convened in the coming days so that the two States could amicably resolve the differences.

The Telangana government was firm that the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 and the orders given by the Union Home Ministry be adhered to by the two States.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-ap-officials-to-meet-today/article30753748.ece

251,2020/02/06,City traffic police assure proper precautions during breathalyser tests,"Amid novel coronavirus outbreak fears, Hyderabad police said that they follow standard procedure while conducting drunk driving checks as no positive cases were reported in the State.

“We always take proper precautions during the drunk driving checks. A straw once used to check the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) is not repeated for another driver,” Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Kumar told The Hindu.

He said that so far not a single case of coronavirus was reported in the city and the drive will not be suspended as no positive case was reported in the State.

“There is no need to panic. We always follow the standard procedure and take the necessary precautions,” Mr. Kumar said.

Recently, Vaada NGO founder Suresh Raju requested city police commissioner Anjani Kumar to temporarily suspend the breathalyzer tests for drunk drive checks as coronavirus can spread during the testing procedures.

Mr. Raju, who claimed that he is a teetotaller and an advocate of the checks, said that when people blow into the equipment, their droplets of saliva fall on it which can be one way in which nCoV can spread.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.

“It is important that everyone practises good respiratory hygiene,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/city-traffic-police-assure-proper-precautions-during-breathalyser-tests/article30746008.ece

Samples collected from them were sent to Gandhi Hospital’s virology laboratory to test for presence of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV).

Of the nine suspected cases, five persons were admitted to Gandhi Hospital and the remaining, including the two Chinese, to the Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital) at Nallakunta.

Officials said that the two Chinese citizens complained of cold and cough and their samples were sent for tests.

Meanwhile, samples collected from four persons tested negative for nCoV. Till date, none of the 25 nCoV suspects from the State tested positive.

10-bed ICU

A 10-bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU), exclusively for nCoV positive cases, is being set up at Gandhi Hospital.

Though the hospital has a 65-bed ICU, another facility was established as the nCoV positive cases cannot be treated along with other patients.

Director of Medical Education (DME) K. Ramesh Reddy said that they arranged for the 10-bed ICU as a standby. “Coronavirus suspects will continue to be attended to at the isolation wards of hospitals. We have organised basic ICU facilities such as mechanical ventilators, oxygen pipelines and monitors, in two rooms at the Emergency Block of Gandhi Hospital,” Dr. Ramesh Reddy said.

The Health department officials have placed order for more disinfectants, which would be used in areas like lifts or corridors through which the nCoV positive patients would be taken.

253,2020/02/06,Newly-elected Mayors get on with the job,"It was a formal meeting of sorts for the newly elected Mayors in the State to focus on their new responsibility as the first flush of excitement over their win gives way to their responsibilities and how best to address the issues of their constituents.

Telangana’s First State Finance Commission (SFC), which is in the process of finalising its recommendations to the State government on the devolution of funds to the local bodies based on their needs and to strengthen them, invited the newly elected Mayors to spell out the major issues in their corporations and requirements of funds.

Many municipal corporations are newly upgraded ones from the erstwhile municipalities with some gram panchayats merged into them and are in dire need of roads, drainage, garbage disposal mechanisms, said Mayors bringing the problems also to the notice of Member Chennaiah and Ms. Pankaja, Regional Director, Municipal Administration, who attended the meeting.

SFC Chairman G. Rajesham Goud explained that while the Finance Commission would do its job in forwarding recommendations to the State government, he had quite a few suggestions for the Mayors.

They should make a mark with innovative ideas to mobilise resources to be self-sufficient and streamline collection of existing taxes. More importantly their role in taking forward State government’s programmes on improving literacy through ‘Each one teach one’, greenery and sanitation through segregation of garbage and recycling of dry waste. These programmes would go a long way in improving quality of life for people, he said.

His advice to Mayors was: First fix the lacunae in your corporations in collecting taxes, getting funds due from departments, check unauthorised layouts for planned growth and monitor the functioning of line departments in your corporations for better education, health, roads, welfare schemes.

‘Willing to pay taxes’

Bodangpet Mayor Parijatha Narasimha Reddy served as sarpanch for five years and worked as a trainer for sarpanches, says: People are willingly to pay taxes if their money is spent on development. Tackling drinking water problem is her priority as also drainage and prevention of mosquito menace.

Mr. Mahender Goud, Mayor of Bandlaguda Jagir, said it became a municipal corporation directly from a gram panchayat. The corporation with over 300 colonies has several problems with drinking water being a major problem.

He sought start up grant for new corporations for taking up basic development activity, including construction of a proper office for the corporation. As the two tanks in the corporation are polluted with domestic sewage, his priority would be for proper drainage and sewage system to improve sanitation.

Nizampet Mayor Neela Reddy sought founds for roads, street lights, drainage system, dumpyard, and take over problematic government lands and develop them into parks in the corporation with high density of population. She says her focus will be on streamlining tax collection.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w0pgeb/article30745954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06FINANCECOMMISSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/newly-elected-mayors-get-on-with-the-job/article30745956.ece
254,2020/02/06,CID finds prima facie evidence in solar power project fraud,"After identifying key persons involved in the fraud of bio-gas plants, Crime Investigation Department (CID) sleuths are turning their radar onto the alleged misappropriation of funds meant for solar power projects in the State.

Preliminary probe indicated prima facie evidence of fraud in solar power projects as well.

“In Adilabad and Karimnagar undivided districts, over 110 solar power plants (for each of which ₹90,000 subsidy was given) are non-existing,” CID officials, unwilling to be named, told The Hindu.

For both the bio-gas and small solar power projects, funds are released by the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). While the entire subsidy was borne by MNRE for bio-gas plants, in case of solar plants, both the Centre and State governments contribute ₹45,000 each towards subsidy for a single unit.

Auditor report

A statutory auditor appointed by the Centre smelt rat while analysing accounts of solar power projects installed in Telangana for the years of 2014-15 and 2015-16. Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation (TSREDCO) was the nodal agency for this project along with bio-gas plants.

“Statutory auditor observed that at least 30% of solar plants were bogus and did not exist,” the CID sleuths said. Close to 2,000 small solar power projects (of 1kWp capacity) were sanctioned for Telangana.

Inquiry

A subsequent inquiry conducted by the TSREDCO reportedly found that 91 out of the 200 solar plants and 21 out of the 100 solar power plants in Adilabad and Karimnagar district do not exist.

Investigators suspect the number could be high and similar fraud was conducted in all other districts. The number of non-existing solar power plants was high in Rangareddy and Hyderabad districts, the investigators believe.

Already, the CID officials summoned four top officials of TSREDCO who worked during 2014-16 for questioning.

“In bio-gas plants, there were at least photos of beneficiaries, though of fictitious persons. In solar plants, not even photos of beneficiaries were attached,” the investigators said.

More arrests likely

The CID sleuths are identifying persons who supplied solar panels to the projects. There are no numbers of series of the solar panels supplied by them to ascertain facts.

“Arrest of solar panel suppliers and employees of the TSREDCO cannot be ruled out,” the investigators said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cid-finds-evidence-in-solar-power-project-fraud/article30745976.ece

256,2020/02/06,"SCR gets ₹6,846 cr. budgetary allocation","South Central Railway (SCR) has got a substantial budgetary allocation of ₹6,846 crore for the year 2020-21 with high grants to new lines of ₹2,856 crore, doubling, third line and bypass works getting ₹3,836 crore and ₹152 crore for traffic facilities, informed General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Wednesday.

Giving details of the precise allocations for the zone following submission of the ‘pink book’- a compendium containing details about the infrastructure and other works tabled in the Parliament, Mr. Mallya told a press conference that Telangana projects grants is about ₹1,850 crore, 30% more when compared to last year.

Flanked by his top officials, the GM explained that new doubling works were sanctioned for Dharmavaram – Pakala – Katpadi for a distance of 290-km. at an estimated cost of ₹2,900 crore, Guntur – Bibinagar of 248-km at ₹2,480 crore and Akola – Dhone via Purna, Mudkhed, Secunderabad, Mahabubnagar (excluding Purna- Mudkhed & Bolarum – Mahabubnagar already in progress) of 626-km. at ₹6,260 crore.

However, there is nothing much for suburban rail projects for the twin cities with Mr. Mallya pointing towards pending payments from the Telangana government to the tune of about ₹400 crore “but we are going with our work.” This year, about 40 crore was allotted for MMTS Phase II and work of Moula Ali – Ghatkesar and Malkajgiri- Bolarum-Medchal sections is nearing completion.

About ₹10 lakh has been allotted for Ghatkesar – Yadadri (33 km) extension of MMTS phase-II and it has a revised estimate of ₹412 crore with the State government agreeing to fund 2/3rd cost. The proposed Cherlapally terminal got ₹5 crore but more funds are expected as the works progress. Same goes with the wagon repair unit at Kazipet as soon as the land acquisition is completed, he explained.

Ongoing projects

Among the ongoing projects, the fund allocation is: ₹54 crore for Akkannapet – Medak new line project nearing completion, ₹75 crore for Mudkhed – Parbhani doubling project, ₹235 crore for Manoharabad–Kothapalli new line, with first phase of Manoharabad – Gajwel (32 km) nearing completion, ₹240 crore for Munirabad–Mahabubnagar new line project with Jaklair – Makthal (11.06 km) and Krishna - Maganur (18.34 km) in progress.

257,2020/02/06,Uber Eats lays off 220 employees from city office,"Restaurant aggregator Uber Eats has laid off over 220 employees from its Hyderabad office.

According to sources, the lay-offs came into effect on January 21.

Several employees in different teams and in diverse roles, including team leaders and senior team leaders, the equivalent of restaurant account managers, analytics, and those who handle complaints and issues on social media platforms, were informed of the lay-offs on the same day.

The sources said that the lay-offs came in the wake of Zomato’s acquisition of Uber’s food delivery business reportedly for $300 million.

“Around 10 people had joined on January 20. This means they were asked to leave on their second working day. Some thought that a prank was being played on them. When they realised that this was not a joke, everybody was shocked,” said a source who did not wish to be identified.

Another source, who said that while no explanation was given to them about the lay-offs, they were assured of severance packages and remuneration in line with their tenure at the organisation.

The source also added that post lay-offs, internal job postings in Uber’s taxi aggregation vertical are on the anvil. To mitigate the situation, those who have been retrenched, have the option to either apply for these openings, or accept severance package. However, details on what is being offered as a part of this package were unavailable.

Several food delivery personnel, who Uber Eats describes as ‘delivery partners’, too are likely to be affected. A one time ‘appreciation’ pay-out has been arranged for them and all the remaining dues have purportedly been cleared.

Responding to a query from The Hindu on the recent lay-offs, an Uber spokesperson said, “Some variable and expense related pending payments of former Uber Eats support staff in Hyderabad are being processed and will be cleared very shortly.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uber-eats-lays-off-220-employees-from-city-office/article30745917.ece
258,2020/02/06,War of words on social media over biryani,"A war of words and opinions is being waged on social media about biryani.

It didn’t begin innocuously when a journalist called it a scam comparable to 2G and then went on to praise Lucknow version calling it fragrant, delicate tasting and delicious. Food critic Vir Sanghvi took a sideswipe with his bit about eating Kerala biryani everyday and Hyderabad biryani once every two months.

It turned into a hot-button issue once Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, stepped in with his comment: “The best biryani in world is Thalassery fish biryani from Paris restaurant. It’s made using short-grained local rice with white aikora or kingfish also known as king mackerel in Thalassery (Kerala). It’s awesome & beats all other biryanis by miles (sic).”

This was provocation enough for MA&UD Minister K.T. Rama Rao to reply: “All bragging rights on best biryani in the world belong rightfully to Hyderabad Amitabh Ji. Dare I say that the rest are only poor imitations. Even UNESCO recognised our gourmet culture recently & conferred the title of ‘creative city of gastronomy’.”

The relation between Mr. Kant, Thalassery and Kerala goes to the time when he began his career in the civil services in the 80s as the sub-collector of what was then called Tellicherry, and is later credited with coining the slogan “God’s Own Country” to promote Kerala tourism. On the other hand, Mr. Rao has helped Hyderabad navigate its way to the high seat of global cuisine by making its case at Unesco Creative Cities Network.

By evening on Wednesday, Indians across the country got into a debate by calling the version cooked in their cities the best. It included good-natured ribbing like: “Call it the best fish pulav in the world but not biryani.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/r4hh6b/article30745909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-BIRYANI-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/war-of-words-on-social-media-over-biryani/article30745902.ece
259,2020/02/06,ICRISAT unearths State’s agriculture heritage,"Archaeologists from Cambridge University and scientists from the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have teamed up to discover the archaeological heritage of agriculture in Telangana and Punjab.

The study is part of a larger project (TIGR2ESS) Transforming India’s Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable Food Supplies. “We are looking at the archaeological and historical evidence over a 5000-year period to understand water use in the region and diversity of crops and cropping patterns,” informs Cameron A. Petrie of Cambridge University.

“We have discovered that the tank irrigation system predates the Kakatiya rule. Prior to the Kakatiyas, tanks were built by elites and kings in the region. The Kakatiyas just scaled up the enterprise,” says Adam Green, another researcher for the project, who uses historical cartography and GIS information for the research.

The study is an important facet of food security as mono-cropping of water intensive crops like wheat and rice are being blamed for extreme water depletion in most parts of India. “The research will help us understand aspects of the archaeological and agronomy evidence over the historical period to a more modern period. Wheat, barley, millets and pulses were cultivated earlier but now there is a reduction in crop diversity,” says Mr. Petrie.

The researchers discovered that the control and management of tanks was left to the community though the water bodies were commissioned by the rulers. “We have noticed a huge reduction in the number of tanks and water bodies over the past 100 years. We are trying to find maps and archaeological evidence to find out the location of those water bodies. Late 19th century maps have information about including maximum tank size and minimum tank size,” says Mr. Green. “We are trying to create a systematic map of all the tanks, different types, sizes, chronology and locations. We want to put a number to how many tanks might have been lost. We want to understand the scope of rejuvenation of these tanks which is the goal of Mission Kakatiya,” he adds.

The researchers are also trying to understand impact of soil scooped from the tank beds and used as topsoil in agricultural fields as part of Mission Kakatiya. “Though we are getting reports about positive impact on agricultural output, we are carrying out soil or silt analysis to find a scientific explanation for rise in productivity,” say the researchers at ICRISAT.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/x0gsx/article30745826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-TANKS-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/icrisat-unearths-states-agriculture-heritage/article30745819.ece
260,2020/02/06,TRS steps up its attack on Arvind,"The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) stepped up its attack on Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind, accusing him of deceiving the people of Nizamabad on the Turmeric Board, and now securing a ‘useless’ regional centre of the Spices Board of India. The focussed attack on Arvind Dharmapuri started from New Delhi where TRS MPs K. Keshav Rao, Nama Nageshwar Rao, Joginapally Santosh Kumar and Banda Prakash said farmers of Nizamabad never demanded a spices board but the Turmeric Board that Mr. Arvind promised during the election campaign.

The MPs said that Mr. Arvind had changed his stand and was welcoming the Spices Board regional office that would serve no purpose, and it was a mere eyewash to divert the strong backlash expected from the farmers, they said.

The MPs said they had earlier met Union Minister Piyush Goyal and got a written assurance on setting up a turmeric centre and a turmeric cell. Now, instead of upgrading it to Turmeric Board, the BJP has started a drama with a regional office of Spices Board, they alleged. Armoor MLA A. Jeevan Reddy at a press conference here criticised Mr. Arvind stating that he promised biryani but served stale food. People of Nizamabad have seen through his misleading tactics and they will teach him a lesson, he said. Mr. Reddy claimed that the former MP of Nizamabad K. Kavita had made best of efforts to get the Turmeric Board during her tenure but the BJP government was unwilling to sanction it. In fact, she even moved a bill in Parliament on the same issue, he said.

He said the desire for a Turmeric Board in Nizamabad existed since 1986 and he had even held a padayatra on this issue much before he was elected as a MLA. “What is the use of Spices Board office when six such boards exist in the country,” he asked. Mr. Arvind should stay for four years in New Delhi only and get the Turmeric Board sanctioned, he demanded.

She was accompanied by Sindhu Suchethan on the violin, Vishnuvardhan or the mridangam, and N.S. Krishnaprasad on the ghatam.

Vijayalalitha opened the concert with a varnam, ‘Intha Chowka’ by Mysore Sadashiva Rao in raga Kamavardhini and went on to sing the kriti, ‘Gam Ganapathe ..” by Mysore Maharaja in a rare Durvanki raga and as the purport of the composition, she conveyed devout feelings very well. The next rendition too was Mysore Maharaja’s ‘Durga Devi Samrakshamaam’ in Dharmavathi raga. She explored the raga with earnestness. The extemporising variations, the adherence to rhythm, the bhava was pleasing. The violinist strode along in full support matching the tempo and phrases very well.

Thyagaraja’s ‘Nenarunchinaanu annintiki nee daasuda’ in Malavi raga was the next item which was rendered well but the musician’s voice got drowned in improper balancing of microphones. The way she sang out the phrase ‘Chidaatmudai veluga’ sparkled. When the import of the lyrics become clear, it connects well with the audience.

The next one was ‘ Kaddanuvaariki’, a kriti by Thyagaraja sang in Thodi raga. Sri Bhadrachala Ramadasa’s “Bhaliraa vairagya mentho baagai unnadi, chanchalamaina naa manasu nischala mai unnadi” in Kalavathi raga saw her in her full elements. Her voice emoted the sentiment in a befitting way. “ “Smariso sarvada”, a devaranama by Purandaradasa in Hamirkalyani raga was catchy and colourful, as she delineated the raga in all its beauty. Kannada lyrics sounded as though rendered by a native tongue.

“Paalayamaam vibho paripaalayamaam Srikanthesaa”, Maharaja Swati Tirunal’s kriti in Khamas was pure delight.

Even though Vijaya Lalitha performed with complete involvement and sincerity, the overall energy was low in places, as though the connection between the vocalist and the percussionists went awry. But for these minor points, the performance was fine.

The youthful vigour and enthusiasm of the mridangist came to fore in his thani avarthanam. He received due applause. Ghatam too matched in every sense and their perfect sync was obvious.

***

Vidwan Vishnudev Namboothiri’s vocal concert, was enthralling. He was supported by Vid.Achyuth Rao on violin, Vid.B C Manjunath on mridangam and Vid.Guruprasanna on khanjira. When a musician can create camraderie in the team, combined with pleasant stage manners, complete control over technique and music to showcase skill and virtuosity, the concert becomes a consummate one. This describes Vishnudev’s concert aptly.

As a protege of the renowned musician P.S. Narayanaswamy, he infused mastery and vigour in his performance in a special way that celebrated his vocal output . His very first rendition Sri Mahaganapati, a composition of Muthuswamy Deekshitar in raga Gowla, Misrachapu tala, was eloquent and mellifluous.

‘Katha Sravanamaado’ by Puranadadasa came next in Reetigowla with kalpanaswaras on ""Harikatha"" and the enunciation came as a fresh breath of air when he sang the swara segment. Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer’s “Paridanamichite” in Bilahari raga was the next rendition with kalpanaswaras on Pallavi that were full of grace and grandeur.

Vishnudev’s raga elaboration in Thyagaraja’s ‘Naradaguruswamy’ rendered in raga Darbar was so powerful and passionate as he stressed on ‘Sangita Yoga.., as though he got completely immersed in that Sangita Yoga..

‘Krupaya palaya’ – a composition of Swati Tirunal in Charukeshi raga in Misrachapu -with raga elaboration, neraval and kalpanaswaras at “Thapaneeya Nibha Chela” and tani avartanam followed. The percussion proved to be an asset adding richness to the performance. The well-conceived manodharma elicited rousing applause from the audience.

With his well trained voice, execution and continuation of gamakas and microtones touched the audience to the fullest. Despite his technical knowledge, he did not sound technical or cerebral but sounded mellifluous and magical. A sure sign of creativity and lucidity.

Violinist Achyut Rao’s fine knowledge, aesthetics, command and judgement were laudable. The percussion proved to be an asset adding richness to the performance. Vishnudev wound up his performance, with Sadasiva Brahmendra’s “Pibare Ramarasam”, and Lalgudi G. Jayaraman’s thillana and mangalam.

The axiom is ‘ Sruthi maatha, Laya pithaa’ - Vishnudev paid his regard to both. Flawless vocal technique with good selection of songs made the concert a treat.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/qnth32/article30752260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGFVISHNUDEVNAMBOOTHIRI-VOCAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pleasant-and-flawless/article30752261.ece
262,2020/02/06,Decoding lineages,"Everyone speaks about gharanas of music. But does this everyone have the same thoughts about the gharana when they refer to it? Is it uniformly defined and practised among all practitioners of music? What forms its core – is it a style, or is it an individual? Is it tradition, and is that tradition unchanging? The khyal or the bandish which forms the central component of a gharana, how did it originate? How does each gharana treat it? Questions such as these constituted the two days of presentations and discussions in a seminar, “Khyal and Allied Forms”, organised by ITC-SRA, Indian Musicological Society, Music Forum and NCPA, Mumbai. Conceived by the renowned musician and senior guru, Pt. Arvind Parikh, the seminar had leading musicians and scholars making presentations.

The way we understand and consume Hindustani music today has largely been influenced by historical and socio-political changes. The changing patronage, performance spaces, nature of taalim and several other factors. In the opening session on dhrupad, Pt. Umakant Gundecha in his presentation about this ancient form, spoke of decisive moments in its evolution and how it impacted khyal music. According to him, the form took a different path with the introduction of verse and meter, chanda and prabhandha respectively. It not only brought in a new idea of circularity into the form -- the return of the swara, the kaala and the shabda trajectories to a fixed point -- but in the later years, came to influence the structure of khyal. Listen to Ustad Amir Khan’s music, Umakant Gundecha said. “He reduced the speed by a couple of notches and gave khyal a dhrupad dimension. The bada khyal’s laya was that of the dhrupad. In fact, practitioners of Agra and Jaipur gharanas also did this.” This was true of founders of several gharanas, they lived in proximity with dhrupadiyas and it impacted their khyal music.

If the nature of music changed it was because Mughal invasion had a huge influence, and also music moved from the temple into the nawab’s durbar. The spiritual acquired contours of the erotic, explained musician and musicologist, nonagenarian Pt. Vijay Khichlu. “The spiritual was not lost, but it also acquired this new dimension and expression,” he further added. The way the gharana acquires its character is a long process. “It is often misunderstood to be tradition/sampradaya. It however is a method of training. Gharana is also formed by how an individual responds to that training,” he said, taking the examples of Pt. Krishna Rao Pandit and Pt. Kumar Gandharv. “They did path-breaking work, something that was never done before. Yet it was considered part of the gharana. It is therefore also a language developed by a certain practitioner.”

“Kumar Gandharva was entirely his own, his music was so totally beautiful. Gayaki is a better word than gharana, it is more expansive. Gharana in fact, is like a foundation, you have to build your palaces on it,” said the Gwalior exponent Pt. Vidyadhar Vyas, at once putting into perspective the enormous diversity and variety that was there in the gharana. In conversation with Snehal Majoomdar, he discussed the features of the Gwalior school, among the oldest gharanas of khyal. In its “ashtanga” (eight fold) characteristics, four were dedicated to structure, and four to embellishment. The deployment of voice almost always is dictated by the demands of the gayaki, as also its influence. For instance, the khadak-bijli taan came into the gharana because of the influence qawwali had on it. The gharana is also called sunke gharana, since one of their chief learning principles was, “sun sunke tayar ho na” (listen and learn). Later, in a performance, Pt. Vidyadhar brilliantly rendered the composition varieties of the Gwalior gharana.

Iqbal Ahmed Khan of the Delhi gharana laid out the richness of his gharana. The Delhi Gharana takes its lineage back to the times of Amir Khusro, to Hassan Sawant and Bula Kalawant who were qawwals in the service of the famous Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi. Iqbal Ahmed Khan made a grand exposition of the repertoire of his gharana, he presented varieties of Bahar. He said the gharana practised 40 prakars of Bahar and made a remarkable presentation of some of them such as Adana Bahar, Shahana Bahar, Ramkali Bahar, Hindol Bahar and Jaijaiwanti Bahar. The style, denouement, intricacies were rare and mellifluous. One could see that aesthetics was among its chief philosophies, even when it came to rendering complex taans. It was particularly evident when he presented the taan prakar bandish in Sughrai Kanada and Gurjari Todi, a speciality of the gharana.

Though the founder of the Jaipur gharana, Ustad Alladiya Khan was born in Uniara, he called it the Jaipur gharana, said the acclaimed musician Ashwini Bhide Deshpande and Milind Malshe, who made a joint presentation on the Jaipur gharana. Alladiya Khan’s family was full of musicians, but he was interested in studies. It so happened that after his father’s demise, he was forced to take up music. He had problems with his voice, and that prompted him to make several changes to the gayaki, and yet, the most brilliant expositions of khyal gayaki was that of Alladiya Khan’s.

To give a taste of the gharana’s approach, Ashwini Bhide began her presentation with the iconic bandish of the gharana, “Ye Pyaree Pag Hole” in rag Bihagada. The deployment of Komal Nishad, she demonstrated, gave it a touch of Khamaj. However, the more austere practitioners – Kishori Amonkar and Mallikarjun Mansur – sang the Ek Nishad Bihagada, “Raina Bairana”. The duo followed it with a demonstration of Khokar, which is Bihagada with Khamaj ang. Ashwini and Malshe argued that the raga, as it expresses itself in the Jaipur tradition, is not a monolithic structure, but a spectrum which moves from ek nishad to do nishad to rag Khokar. It is guided by the aesthetic principles of the musician, and this, often referred to as “authenticity” led to enmity between different branches of the school. The other major point they made during their presentation is that how the gharana sang the same bandish in two different layas. For instance, the bandish “Mero Piya” in Nayaki Kanada was sung in both rupak and teen tal, and “Malaniya Layi Ja Re” of Bhoopnat was rendered in teentaal and jhaptal. Ashwini spoke of the bandish in rag Kedar which she learnt in teentaal, from her mother who was a disciple of Alladiya Khan, whereas Malshe learnt the same bandish in rupak taal from Pt. Ratnakar Pai. The gharana, they said, had very few drut bandishes. Since there was already a lot of ‘taankriya’ in their renditions, they saw no purpose in rendering a drut bandish. They too, like Prof Vidyadhar Vyas, traced the word khyal to khel, referring to the “Evolution of Khyal”, art critic Madhukar Vasudev Dhond’s work.

“The Agra Gharana is considered among the oldest gharanas, revered for the galaxy of artistes it has nurtured both from within and outside the family, and the multifaceted gayaki that it represents,” said N. Jayavant Rao, making the presentation on behalf of the Agra gharana musician, Lalith J. Rao The original Agra Gharana was dhrupad based and Ghagge Khudabaksh brought the khayal aspects into the gayaki via the Gwalior maestro Natthan Peerbaksh. “However, the gayaki as it exists today is a confluence of two gharanas - the Agra and the Atrauli Gharanas, which merged due to numerous intermarriages over three generations,” he explained.

The colossus of the gharana, Ustad Faiyaz Khan’s impact was so great that many later musicians fashioned their gayaki after his. He was the first to introduce a full nom tom alap, murkis, khatkas and also rhythmical patterns used in instruments like the been, detailed Jayavanth Rao, speaking of the gharana’s features. The Gwalior and Agra gharanas do have some common components, but how it is put to use, depends on the voice and temperament of the performer. The presentation was rich and interesting, as each of the points were illustrated with audio clippings from the maestros of the gharana. As concluding remarks, he said: “No artiste exhibits all the characteristics of a gharana. But, in each artiste’s gayaki, some of the characteristics that form the bedrock of the gharana will be recognisable.”

Pt. Ajoy Chakrabarty, a stalwart of the Patiala gharana trained under Munawar Ali Khan and Pt. Jnan Prakash Ghosh, spoke emotionally about the contribution of the great masters.

He stressed on sadhana, simplicity and search for truth in music. A representative of the Bade Ghulam Ali Khan’s school of gayaki, Ajoy Chakrabarty spoke of his other influences, and gave a detailed account of his relationship with Pt. D.T. Joshi.

263,2020/02/06,Vasudha Ravi enlivened the audience with her rendition at a recital in Kerala,"Endowed with a mellifluous voice, Vasudha Ravi captured the attention of the audience with her impressive vocal recital at Palghat Fine Arts Society at Tharekkad, Palakkad.

Vasudha’s judicious selections and rendition enhanced the impact of the concert, which commenced on a bright note with a brisk ‘Chalamela Jesavayya’ in Nattakurinji, a varnam of Srirangam Rangaswamy Pillai. Swathi Thirunal’s popular kriti ‘Deva Deva Kalayamithe’ in Mayamalavagowla came with a lively niraval and swift swaraprastharas at Jatha Rupa. The delectable alapana of Ananda Bhairavi, followed by ‘Marivere Gathi’, a composition of Shyama Sastri, rendered in a leisurely pace, was soothing. A swift ‘Thamadam Thakathayya’ (Mohana Kalyani — Lalgudi Gopala Iyer), embellished with a breezy chittaswaram, was a welcome choice at this stage.

Thodi, a major raga, offers scope for elaborate treatment. Vasudha explored it at length, dwelling on every swara. Moving effortlessly in all the octaves with elegant akaaras and gamakas, she unfolded the complete bhava of the raga, revealing her musical acumen. Further, Vasudha did the ‘sruthi bedha’ in Mohanam with subtle sancharas, which was received well. She then chose Muthuswamy Dikshitar’s ‘Sri Subrahmanyam’, perhaps not heard much in concert platforms in recent times. A lucid niraval, followed by a cluster of innovative swaraprastharas, was sumptuous, particularly the lengthy swaras suffixed with “sa” deserve special mention.

The meaningful Tamil virutham was soulful. The sweet sketches of Simhendramadhyamam, Kapi and Ranjani paved the way for the evocative ragamalika song ‘Nambungal Sivanai’ in Ranjani, Niranjani, Sri Ranjani, Janaranjani, Srutiranjani and Sivaranjani ragas, which was composed by Neelakanta Sivan and set to tune by vocalist Baby G Sreeram. The concluding piece of the concert was a thillana of TK Govinda Rao in Sindhu Bhairavi. However, it was surprising that such an accomplished vocalist did not take up a pratimadhyama raga in her concert, though Vasudha did give contours of Simhendramadhyamam, Ranjini and other ragas in the virutham and the succeeding number. She could have chosen a pratimadhyama raga as a sub-main or RTP, which, incidentally, was conspicuous by its absence.

Trivandrum Sampath on the violin was outstanding. His raga and swara versions were steeped in tonal melody. Ghatam artiste SV Ramani sparkled in his new role as a mridangist. Ramani enlivened the concert with his spirited display, though he was too aggressive at times, particularly in the muthaippus. Manjoor Unnikrishnan on the ghatam provided competent support. Their well-crafted thani in Adi tala was laudable.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/cmsrk4/article30742458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvfVasudhaRavi1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vasudha-ravi-enlivened-the-audience-with-her-rendition-at-a-recital-in-kerala/article30742459.ece
264,2020/02/06,Kalamandalam Harish Marar and Nandini Varma talk about their unique percussion act,"As the chenda beats build up, reaching a crescendo, hearts race. Listening to a thayambaka amid a crowd of chendapremis (afficianados) at a temple festival in Kerala is an utterly sensorial experience.

The thayambaka is a solo chenda concert that showcases the player’s mastery over the instrument. In a double thayambaka, two artistes perform, often in friendly competition with each other.

Kalamandalam Harish Marar and his wife Nandini Varma have created an unusual, and alluring format in their double thayambaka. At a recent performance in Ernakulam Siva temple, the couple held the crowd captive for two hours straight. Heads nodded vigorously, hands went up and feet tapped to the rhythm as the couple performed, complementing each other.

The two have been performing together for seven years, calling their gig a “dambathi thayambaka”. They found a place in the 2015 Limca Book of World Records for being the first couple to do so.

“The thayambaka is different from the panchari melam, as here the finer nuances of the art form are on display. It showcases how well you can improvise and your finesse and skill,” says Harish. While the panchari melam is a percussion ensemble comprising the chenda, ilathalam (cymbal), kombu and kuzhal, (wind instruments used in a melam), the thayambaka often has only accompanying chenda and ilathalam as supporting instruments.

Students usually learn the chenda when they are around eight or nine years old. The basic beat is taught with the help of a short stick cut from a tamarind tree and a slab of stone. It is only when the student turns 14 to 15 years that he or she is taught to plan on the actual instrument, as this is when the wrist bones fuse. Learning the basics alone could take about a year.

Harish has been a performing artiste for over 25 years, and also teaches Kathakali chenda at the Kerala Kalamandalam. The Kathakali chenda is considered one of the most challenging; as he or she has to play as accompaniment for the Kathakali performance. “It demands complete concentration,” says Harish.

When he married Nandini in 2012, she had also created a space for herself in thayambaka. She is one of the first professional female thayambaka artistes in Kerala.

Traditionally performed by men, the thayambaka demands physical stamina. Nandini, a practising Ayurveda doctor, started learning at an early age of 13. “The chenda weighs about 7-8 kilos minimum to start with and is slung across the left shoulder while performing. Only if you are really passionate about it can you sustain interest in it,” she says. She has been performing for 18 years, taking a break only during her pregnancy.

The thayambaka evolved as a temple art, but grew in popularity and is now performed in other venues such as cultural events. While women were not encouraged to play the chenda earlier, the situation has changed and today temples are open to women performers. “The reason why women don’t pursue thayambaka seriously could be because performance venues are most often temples across the State, so travelling is a must. It is usually performed in the evening, not earlier than 7 pm. For women managing families, this schedule could be a challenge,” says Nandini.

Since the two enjoyed playing the chenda together, they considered performing together as well. “Initially, we sat together and worked out several routines. Our individual styles are very different, so it took time to find a common pattern and build on our repertoire,” says Harish. They have performed in temples and venues across Kerala and outside the State as well.

Son of panchavadyam maestro Annamanada Parameswara Marar, Harish learnt under Mattannur Sankarankutty Marar, before joining the Kalamandalam for higher studies. He also trained under Pookkatttiri Divakaran Poduval and Kalloor Ramankutty Marar. Nandini, started learning from Tripunithura Gopikrishnan Thampuran. She then trained under Sankaramkulangara Radhakrishnan and later, received advanced training in thayambaka under Porur Unnikrishnan.

Harish and Nandini perform with an ensemble of 10 to 12 performers, who accompany them (four on the ilathalam (cymbal), and six on the chenda).

Harish and Nandini say they feed off each other’s energy during a performance. “We are used to each other’s techniques and can often predict what the other person would play next, however surprises do pop up during manodharma (improvisation),” says Nandini.

The grammar of thayambaka is based on counts and precision is paramount. “If you miss a single count, you lose track of the entire sequence. The brilliance of an artiste lies not just in the flexibility of his or her wrists, but also how fast he or she can make mental calculations,” says Harish. The thayambaka structure, he adds, is based on four thalams (counts) – chembada, chemba, panchari and adantha. “You can build on the base and bring in your own subtle improvisations,” says Nandini.

The two rarely get time for vacations. “For the sake of our daughter Thrayee, we now plan breaks. Ultimately it is about striking a balance,” says Nandini.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/harish-marar-and-nandini-varmas-dambathi-thayambaka/article30751374.ece
265,2020/02/06,Crossover Project brings together five artistes for an evening of creative evolution,"“Carola and I? It’s more than a friendship. I don’t know how to describe it, honestly,” mridangist Charu Hariharan admits. Drenched in musical lineage and prowess, she met Spanish vocalist and clarinet player Carola Ortiz at Kolkata’s International Guitar Festival over three years ago and since then, there’s been no looking back.

Collaborating on albums and previous tours, they’re bringing together Charu’s vision in the upcoming Crossover Project, which has the female artistes joined on stage by flamenco guitarist Santhosh Chandran, vocalist and Charu’s brother, Sreekanth Hariharan, and keyboard artiste Bhuvanesh.

The Project, conceptualised by Women of Rhythm director Sonia Acharya, evolved from a chance conversation.

“Charu was telling me about her and Carola’s amazing connection and how they complement each other and wanted to do an India tour together. I realised that we needed a proper set of artistes, which was when we brought Santhosh into the mix,” Sonia says.

The six-city tour is a first for Women of Rhythm, which aims to give female artistes a meaningful platform to showcase and improve their talent while engaging in collaborations with male artistes that put them on an equal playing field.

Santhosh, of course, is no novice to the artistes, having collaborated with Charu and Sreekanth under the Music Mojo banner in 2016. With over a decade of collaborative experience under his belt, he says this tour is just as challenging and exciting as his previous artistic explorations.

The aim explains the involvement of Sreekanth, who Charu jokingly says she’s been collaborating with “since we’ve known what music is.”

A playback singer with hits like the recent Bigil track, ‘Unakaaga’ under his belt, Sreekanth says The Crossover Project is special in more ways than one.

“Having been born and brought up in Chennai, as well as participating in Super Singer here, I’ve seen firsthand what it means to have an experienced audience in a place that has so much music. Playback is fulfilling in its own way, but this project brings together our diverse backgrounds and musical persona,” he shares. Featuring original compositions by Charu, Carola, and Santhosh, the artistes say they hope to represent their respective styles of Carnatic, Catalan, and Flamenco as authentically as possible in one, cohesive performance.

“It’s a perfect fit, the three of us, especially given Santhosh and my shared roots in Spanish music with our love for Indian melody. What I think is most enriching, though, is how much I feel I individually grow from a collaboration and how much it impacts my sound, my style, and my music,” Carola shares.

For keyboardist Bhuvanesh, the project marks his foray into collaborative performance and, well, he couldn’t be more excited.

With shows completed in Pune, Baroda, and Mumbai, the tour makes a stopover in Chennai before wrapping up with shows in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram later this month.

266,2020/02/06,Vikku Vinayakram on a relentless spiritual quest,"It was an emotional moment for the ghatam maestro Vikku Vinayakram, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the AKP Fine Arts Festival last weekend at Vani Mahal, Chennai.

Looking back at his journey, he said, “I dedicate every single performance and honour to the Mahaperiyava. The Grammy was the highpoint and I placed the award at His alter. It is with His blessings that I have been able to make the modest ghatam an integral part of prestigious national and international concerts.”

From accompanying the inimitable M.S. Subbulakshmi at the United Nations to joining the celebrated Shakti band, festuring the likes of Ustad Zakir Hussain and John McLaughlin, Vinayakram’s passion for rhythm remains unquestionable.

At the AKP festival, he was delighted to receive the award from Thavil vidwan Haridwaramangalam A.K. Palanivel. On the occasion, violinists Ganesh and Kumaresh were also honoured with the ‘Kala Sigaram’ title for their collaborative works and experimental approach to music.

M. Balasubramaniam, Director, South Zone Cultural Centre, conferring the award on the brothers said that the cultural zone loves to associate with accomplished artistes.

Others who offered felicitations to the artistes were V.K. Sundaram, chairman, Sudarsan Group of Educational institutions, Deccan Murthy, president, Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha, Cleveland V.V. Sundaram, and musicologist B.M. Sundaram.

B.M. Sundaram said that Vikku Vinayakram has raised the ghatam to immeasurable heights. He recalled the contributions of other ghatam greats such as Palani Ghatam Krishnayyar, Kodandarama Ayyar, and Alangudi Ramachandran.

About Ganesh and Kumaresh, Sundaram said that they have come up with a distinct style.

While thanking the organisers, Ganesh and Kumaresh remembered how they, along with Vikku Vinayakram and A.K. Palanivel had toured remote villages of the State for concerts.

The festival featured many concerts, including the veena recital of Tirupati Srivani Yalla, who performed on the last day.

This Vainika uses the vocal style, making the melodies flow in an elegant and unhampered manner.

Her raga essays (Behag and Vagadeeshwari) were embellished with sweet notes. Accompanists Kumbakonam A. Saravanan (mridangam) and Adambakkam K. Sankar (ghatam) played one of the most sophisticated tanis.

Beginning with ‘Niravati Sukhada’ (Ravichandrika), Srivani went on to play an enchanting Behag alapana and Swati Tirunal's ‘Smara Janaka’.

The Vagadeeswari raga was enriched with phrases encompassing all the octaves.

A meditative 'Paramatmudu' ended in fast swarakalpana. Srivani concluded the recital with ‘Saravana Bhava’ in raga Pasupatipriya.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/yq84oq/article30751012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07frAKPAward2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vikku-vinayakram-on-a-relentless-spiritual-quest/article30751016.ece
267,2020/02/06,Pt. Chhannulal Misha: For the love of thumri,"“Abhi hum pooja ke liye chandan ghis rahe hain …”, (I’m preparing the sandal paste for worship right now), Pt. Chhannulal Misha, answers the phone call with his disarming simplicity.

Mishra takes every performance as a prayer and the ‘manch’ (stage) as a temple. He explains, “One watches drama or listens to a lecture on a stage, but the proscenium theatre becomes a temple when music is rendered there. He quotes sage Narada to underline his point: “Naham vasami Vaikunthe, Yoginam hridaye na cha/ Madbhaktah yatra gayanti tatra tishthaami Narada.” It means God Himself confessed to Narada: “I don’t live in heaven nor in the hearts of the Yogis, I live where my devotees sing.”

A scholarly musician, Mishra revels in educating his audience about musical matters during his performance. Right from the beginning, during the ‘alap’ of a raga, he deciphers the four components, sthayi, antara, sanchari, abhog or while singing the composition shows the application of sthayi-bhanjani and rupak bhanjani, one would have read about in the musical treatises only. The khatka, murki, gitkiri and zamzama remain not just the defining verbs but a reality when he demonstrates each one of them during his engaging performance.

The secret of his popularity is perhaps his rich background of sahitya and sangeet as a versatile Kathavachak or a story teller. On one hand he can promptly cite verses from Surdas, Tulsi, Kabir, Raidas to even Urdu couplets to enhance the rasa-bhava, as and when required and on the other hand he has an eclectic repertoire that includes a diversity of genres from Khayal to Tappa, Chaturang, Thumri, Dadra, Kajri, Chaiti and Barahmasa to name just a few. His devotion soaked rendering of “Kevat Prasang” from Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, for instance, can wet many eyes with the emotion choked ‘Swara-Sangatis’ of Kevat’s devotional dialogues interspersed with similar sahitya, adorned with Sur-Laya-Sangati, wherein he uses the swara combinations or the rhythmic pace or patterns that would add to the intended impact.

A staunch devotee of Lord Shiva, Mishra maintains, “Laya or the rhythm is Shiva and Shruti, the melody, is Parvati. Together, they constitute music. “A good musician is supposed to maintain a perfect balance between the two.” ‘Shiva-Mat’, he proclaims, is the oldest and the most authentic system of music comprising all three, the ‘swara, laya and sahitya’.

He believes that earlier there were just dhrupad and thumri. Quoting from the Ramcharitmanas, he says, “Gaavahin Guni-Gandharva sab, karahin Apsara Gaan”. It means, the wise sang Dhrupad and the Apsaras sang thumri which was an amorous ‘shringar-pradhan’ style. “The khayal came much later as an amalgamation of both the genres.”

Citing the Manas, “Bharadwaj Rishi basahin Prayaga…”, Mishra connects his gotra and family legacy to this lineage, hence his ancestors lived in Prayag and later shifted to Benaras. He does not believe in gharana but ‘khandaan’, the family tradition. He has been trained under his father Pt. Badri Prasad and Ud. Ghani Khan of Kirana Gharana, but his family tradition has given him the sanskar of shastras and knowledge of Veda-Parayan to the Upanishads, Bhagwad Gita, Ramayan and the Sutras of Panini, the great Sanskrit grammarian who explained through his Sutras, the different jatis of laya.

Coming back to thumri, he explains there is also thumri ang khayal, apart from more than fifteen varieties of thumri such as ‘Bol-Banav ki thumri, Bol-Bant ki thumri, Ghanaakshari thumri where each alphabet has a particular swara for itself and promptly demonstrates with an example, “Saanvare ne Jamuna tat chheeno mero haar….”

Mishra is not satisfied with the present state of thumri and its propagation. He thinks it should be made a compulsory subject in school colleges, but then wonders, “who is going to teach them. There are hardly any thumri singers left.” He doesn’t hold any grudge against the government. “To understand its nuances, the yearning should come from within. It is a challenging gayaki that demands the knowledge of not only the melody and rhythm but also the sahitya and our culture to understand the rasa-bhava. I can only wish, pray and contribute at my own level, but it needs an enthusiastic ‘andolan’ (revolution) to bring thumri back to the mainstream….”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/giom00/article30750931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07DFR-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pt-chhannulal-misha-for-the-love-of-thumri/article30750932.ece
268,2020/02/06,Dover Lane Music Conference wears glamour and exuberance,"Even at the ripe age of 68, the Dover Lane Music Conference wore the glamour and exuberance of a 20-year old in 2020 – with a blend of superb and substandard music funded by a host of sponsors for four night-long sessions dedicated to the centenary of Pandit Ravi Shankar and to the memory of the late Ramakant Gundecha. It also saw sarod maestro Aashish Khan receiving the Sangeet Samman of the year.

As in the past, Kolkata’s Nazrul Mancha, the venue of this much-awaited winter soiree, remained the most sought-after rendezvous for musicians and socialites from all over the globe. The latter come here to be seen, to socialise and to make a fashion statement! It becomes possible because apart from the classical music inside the huge several thousand-capacity auditorium, exotic food and beverages remain available all through the night in the stalls, nicely lined up outside the hall. Any disappointing recital would spill out foodies and boost up the sales of these inviting stalls.

And sure enough, it worked out that way with constant commotion in the hall and in front of the stage, except perhaps, on the final day! The packed to capacity hall witnessed Pandit Jasraj, a nonagenarian young man, staging the grand finale in the wee hours with élan. The radiance of his rendition in ragas Charukeshi, Gurjari and Miyan ki Todi scaled melody-dipped spiritual heights when he sang ‘Allah jaane’ before closing with a bhajan extolling Lord Krishna.

In sync: Pt. Bhajan Sopori and Abhay Rustum Sopori

Earlier, the evening began with a scintillating recital of Pandit Bhajan Sopori and Abhay Rustam Sopori, the father-son duo epitomising the age old Guru Shishya Parampara. Their alap in raga Bageshri remained rooted on dhrupad’s majestic nuances such as long sustained notes, emotive oscillation, deliberate meends, heavy gamaks, merukhand-based ornate phrases – having shades of bold and soft lilts. Discerning listeners responded heartily to this unusual feat achieved by them on an instrument like santoor. Encouraged, they stretched the rhythmic journey of jod-jhala segments longer than usual and crafted umpteen varieties of dancing melodic designs with the inspired, dramatic support of Rishi Upadhyay (pakhawaj) and Abhijit Banerjee (tabla). The gatkari in raga Kausi Knada showcased their grip on different talas. It was no less thrilling than a percussion quartet replete with sawal-jawab and saath-sangat.

Another father-son team arrived next, but this time Armaan Khan, the junior, was a teenaged beginner as compared to Ustad Rashid Khan and yet he won hearts with his steady support based on long, peaceful notes while his guru, apparently terribly off mood, fiddled with chromatic Gandhars and Nishads (a strict ‘no’ in Indian classical music) and jumped from octave to octave to touch the ati mandra shadja in almost every melodic sentence. As such the intrinsic pathos of Jog Kauns – a raga which almost always unfurls its inner beauty once touched by Khan’s loving, intoxicating voice, remained frigid despite the reassuring presence of Vijay Ghate (tabla), Murad Ali (sarangi) and Vinay Mishra (harmonium). In comparison, his interpretation of Basant (Lagi un sang preet) was beautiful and so was his thumri. Undoubtedly, his magic captivated all!

Carnatic rhythm

Next, the Carnatic rhythm ensemble, featuring such greats like Vikku Vinayakram (ghatam), V Swaminathan (mridangam), Selva Ganeshan (khanjira) and Umashankar Ganeshan (morsing), actually inspired the audience to keep the rhythm instead of dozing off during a post mid-night session! This was a blessing for a comparatively young but extremely competent sarod exponent Amaan Ali Khan. His version of Nandkauns came with a short auchar and gatkari at around 2:30 am. His next choice was an elaborate Todi, followed by a less heard raga, Anand Bhairav with a beautiful composition, steeped in gayaki anga, from the treasure trove of his illustrious gharana.

Other highlights of the festival were dhrupad maestro Uday Bhawalkar (Yaman); khayal maestros Ajoy Chakrabarty (Ahir Lalit), Ashwini Bhide (Khem Kalyan) and Venkatesh Kumar (Maru Bihag). Sitar maestros Shujaat Khan (Sampoorna Malkauns) and Kedia Brothers (Manoj and Mor Mukut - (Chandranandan)).",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jzsgu3/article30750624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/on-a-rhythmic-journey/article30750626.ece
269,2020/02/06,Remembering Jiddu through music,"Chennai’s Vasanta Vihar is a sanctuary, of sorts. A quaint, white building, filled to the brim with the works of philosopher J. Krishnamurti and a serene campus that imbibes the values he so proudly practiced, walking through its doors even today carries his inimitable spirit on its grounds.

It’s no surprise, then, that his 125th birth anniversary celebrations will begin at this very campus where Krishnamurti preferred to stay and give lectures during his visits to Madras over 80 years ago.

“We celebrate with an exhibition that, we hope, acquaints a new generation with the life and teachings of Krishnamurti. Essentially, the spirit of his teachings have been interprerted in a physical, spatial and material manner, all of which will result in a truly unique viewing experience,” shares S.P. Kandaswamy, secretary of the Krishnamurti Foundation, India.

A conglomeration of a variety of events, the celebrations will feature a unique concert, bringing together artistes Monali Bala and Vedanth Bharadwaj to celebrate the elements of mysticism, philosophy, and nature.

It’s their first on-stage collaboration and yet, it seems the artistes’ association has been a fitting prelude for what’s to come.

“We’re extremely encouraging of each other and invested in each other’s music, so this performance will be a reflection of that. We’ll have organised, rehearsed elements as well as spontaneous improvisation ,” says Bala. “Our aim — or rather, the artistes’ aim — is to present a concert steeped in a love, compassion, and sensitivity that transcends religious and linguistic boundaries. The performance seeks to capture the essence of that through a selection of songs that carry lessons for humanity, even today,” says Kandaswamy.

Monali Bala

Though the artistes won’t divulge all of what we can hope to hear, they give us a glimpse into what’s to come.

“We plan to present multilingual, multi-genre mystic poets’ music. Let’s put it that way,” Bala smiles.

The line up, she says, will be a mix of familiar works with some original compositions, tying together the writings of popular Sufi and Bhakti-movement poets with the philosophical writings of modern-day poets.

Of course, the influence of Krishnamurti himself will be undeniable. Paying homage to his own fondness for musical engagement and growth, Kandaswamy says, can only be done through a concert such as this.

“He really believed that singing brings people together and has the extraordinary potential to help us reflect on the external world as well as the one inside of us all,” Kandaswamy smiles.

Presented alongside the exhibition that makes its home in Chennai for a week before travelling to Benares, the concert holds a special place in guitarist Bharadwaj’s heart.

“I did my final years of schooling in Rishi Valley — in fact, it’s where I decided to become a musician. So for me, this concert is a tribute to the resilient spirit that KFI harbours — one that is free of expectations and fear; a spirit that is ready to pursue one’s passions whole-heartedly and completely,” he smiles.

‘Music of the Mystics’ takes place at Vasanta Vihar on February 7 (6 p.m). All are welcome.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/uwptet/article30750523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07frvedanthJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/remembering-jiddu-through-music/article30750524.ece
270,2020/02/06,I did not seek assistance to write dialogues for ‘Jaanu’ : Kiran Kumar Reddy,"It will take at least a week to get a genuine response from movie-goers and the market for Jaanu, the remake of the Tamil movie 96 which has attained a status of a cult classic among movie-goers.. The Kannada remake of the same tanked. Not paying heed to a lot of suggestions against remaking it in Telugu, producer Dil Raju bought the rights, roped in the original director C Prem Kumar and made it in Telugu.

So have all the dialogues been translated verbatim? “ Translation is not the right word. For instance some say ‘ethhuku randi’ (lift it) and some ‘teesukurandi’ (bring it). There is a difference in both,” explains dialogue writer Kiran Kumar Reddy, popularly known as ‘Mirchi’ Kiran . Director Prem Kumar apparently told him , that it is important to understand the film as it is multi-layered. Kiran says, “There is a backstory of the two characters and something comes up in a while, all of which is interconnected. I must have watched 96 a zillion times.” He had internalised the film so much that he was sitting in the preview theatre and humming the background score. Kiran did not seek any assistance to write dialogues for Jaanu.

How did he bag this movie? “I acted in F2. While doing that, I enquired about who would be writing the dialogues for Jaanu . Nothing had been decided then and so Hari, the writer of Maharshi, referred me to Dil Raju. Many are of the opinion that the film is slow paced, but that is where the beauty of the story lies and it allows space for the audience to peep into the lives of Ram (Sharwanand) and Jaanu (Samantha). The producers are very happy and confident.” Kiran reiterates that there isn’t much scope for change. Nevertheless, the childhood episode is picturised in Vizag and the rest of the film in Hyderabad.

Jaanu is Kiran’s third film as a dialogue writer, the first two being Majnu and 118. He has written for many other films, without taking credit. He shares, “Most people work as ghost writers for scenes. We go for writing sessions, they take our ideas. Sometimes it is in bits and pieces because we all are a group of people in the discussions, including the director, assistant directors, writers et al. Everyone pitches in with ideas. When the director feelssomeone deserves credit, he gets it. Patience and talent will always get an opening.”

Kiran worked as a sound engineer for an FM channel and started getting creative ideas. He began writing the promos and creatives. One programme called ‘Babu Baga Busy’ became popular because it was about movie people. They would call him and tell him to talk about their film, good or bad, because it struck a chord with listeners and was great promotion.

Kiran watches a lot of films and has got books on screenplay, and learnt the film grammar along the way, given his passion for movies. He signs off, “All technicians someday want to be a director. The kick you get while telling a story is different. I hope Jaanu will be my big ticket [to become a director]. I might be getting into direction soon.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/dh55hg/article30749754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym07kiran,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/i-did-not-seek-assistance-to-write-dialogues-for-jaanu-kiran-kumar-reddy/article30749755.ece
271,2020/02/06,Three-day seafood show at Bolgatty,"Governor Arif Mohammed Khan will inaugurate the 22nd India International Seafood Show here on Friday.

The three-day show is being hosted by Kochi after a gap of 12 years, said K.S. Srinivas, Chairman, Marine Product Export Development Authority (MPEDA). The inauguration is scheduled for 11 a.m. at LuLu Bolgatty International Convention Centre.

The event will highlight India’s commitment to safe and sustainable seafood production for export and offer opportunities for the exporters and importers of the country’s marine products. The theme is ‘Blue Revolution: Beyond production to value addition’.

Mr. Srinivas said the MPEDA had joined hands with the Seafood Exporters’ Association of India for the event, which will help prepare a roadmap for achieving the export target of $10 billion by 2022.

The seafood show will be a platform for all stakeholders to come together and deliberate on the various aspects of the seafood industry. India exported 14.37 lakh tonnes of seafood during 2018-19. The exports were worth $6.70 billion as per the provisional figures.

The target for seafood exports in the future will be helped by sustainable fishing methods, value addition, stricter quality control and increased aquaculture production through diversification, Mr. Srinivas said.

273,2020/02/06,Schools in district gear up for academic fests,"With exams round the corner and arts and cultural fests having receded to the background, school campuses in the district are now gearing up for ‘academic fests.’

Launched last year by the General Education Department covering Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools, the concept of academic fest has twin major objectives — students exhibiting their academic skills before society in a festive atmosphere and thereby attracting more students, especially to those schools facing shortage of students.

No competition

“This year the fest is being planned in a wider scale and cover upto Class 9, and students will don the roles of both organisers and participants,” said George Bastin, district coordinator, Kerala Education Rejuvenation Campaign.

The idea is to create a platform whereby students can exhibit their acquired knowledge and skills independently and interact with the larger society.

Guidelines for the academic fest strictly direct that it should not be an exam-centric initiative and that students should not be compelled to mug up or undergo constant training. It should neither be a competition nor a platform to compare students.

“Every school will observe a day as academic fest day when various experiments and programmes based on languages and subjects acquired by students will be held in corners either on the school campus or outside. They will strive to convince parents and society that they have in-depth and solid knowledge going beyond the mere need of performing well in exams,” said Mr. Bastin.

Preparations are under way under the aegis of Samagra Shikhsa Kerala to turn academic fests, set to begin in the second week of the month, into popular people’s fests.

An organising committee comprising local self-government members, academic experts and representatives of panchayat education committees, school management committees and parent-teacher associations have been formed for the purpose.

Training for the fest got under way at 15 block resource centres in the district on Wednesday. Apart from a 35-member resource group, a module has also been created for the organisation of the fest.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/schools-in-district-gear-up-for-academic-fests/article30748580.ece
274,2020/02/06,"13 years on, dark day still haunts evictees at Moolampilly","Thursday will mark the 13th anniversary of the Moolampilly eviction.

It was on February 6, 2008, that the first batch of 10 families were forcibly evicted from their homes at Moolampilly for the rail and road connectivity of the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam (ICTT). The day before, another 12 families had to step out of their homes.

Shortly thereafter, the affected families under the aegis of Moolampilly Coordination Committee, staged a popular protest at Menaka Junction.

It was called off on March 19 that year after the then government notified the Moolampilly rehabilitation package.

That hope proved short-lived as what ensued was a long-drawn-out protest to get that package implemented, including the sit-ins and hunger strikes staged on festive occasions like Onam and Christmas.

“Only six out of the forcibly evicted families have been properly rehabilitated as per the package whereas the rest had to either find refuge in what little of the plot was left after the eviction or arrange temporary shelters,” said Francis Kalathungal, general convener of the Moolampilly Coordination Committee.

Altogether, 316 families were evicted for the rail-road connectivity of the ICTT from Mulavukad, Kadamakkudy, Chernalloor, Eloor, Kadungalloor, and Edappally North and South villages. So far, 46 houses have been built in the rehabilitation plots spread over seven locations.

Permission have been denied to many allotted plots in Mulavukad and Kadamakkudy villages on account of the Coastal Regulation Zone norms. Plots allotted at two locations at Thuthiyoor were found unfit for construction of houses as they were filled-up land while sketches fixing the boundaries of the plots had also not been provided, said Mr. Kalathungal.

So far, 29 persons have died before rehabilitation. Mr. Kalathungal said that the government had neither returned the 12 per income tax levied on the compensation nor fulfilled the promise of a job to a member each from the evicted families.

Also, the monthly allocation of ₹5,000 towards rent till the rehabilitation had not been paid since 2013.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uzhuke/article30748576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05KI-MOOLAMPILLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/13-years-on-dark-day-still-haunts-evictees-at-moolampilly/article30748577.ece

278,2020/02/06,"Love, in the time of the Mughals","“Dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai, aḳhir is dard ki dava kya hai?” recites kathak dancer, and founder of the Sufi Kathak Foundation, Manjari Chaturvedi over a phone call on a languid afternoon. With a gentle voice, and a frenzied passion for Mirza Ghalib’s poetry, the dancer recreates the atmosphere of Ghalib’s writing, that continues to resonate 150 years after his demise. Chaturvedi in collaboration with Aviv Learning, is keen on protecting Ghalib’s poignant prose in an evening of song and dance at The Royal Opera House. Through historic stories about the revolt of 1857, the Mughal Durbar, and his own romantic legends, the Urdu and Persian poet is an integral figure in understanding India’s secular values.

The Legend of Nawab Jaan and Mirza Ghalib, is about the torrid romance between the poet and a tawaif dancer in his court. The woman protagonist has featured in numerous letters penned by Ghalib, but has always remained nameless. Over decades, the identity of this mysterious woman has been explored in multiple films and plays, including Gulzar’s 1988 television drama series about the renowned writer.

“I believe that Nawab Jaan was responsible for popularising Ghalib, since their courtship was widely performed and sung about. Through this concert, I’d like to trace the creative relationship that exists between a performer and a poet, and not only focus on the aspect of a muse,” explains Chaturvedi. While Chaturvedi, will play Nawaab Jaan, actor, Ekant Kaul from Srinagar, will embrace the persona of Ghalib. Apart from ‘Dil-e-nadan’, renditions of ‘Nukta-cheen ai gham-e-dil’ will also feature in the 90-minute theatrical dance production, which is the second staged performance after a debut show in Bangalore, in November last year.

Unsung artists

Chaturvedi has done extensive research for The Legend of Nawab Jaan and Mirza Ghalib since two-and-a half years, as part of her nine-year old, Courtesan Project. The latter traces the journey of women artistes who were never given the recognition they deserved, and were often written-off as naachne walis. “Why should these women remain unnamed? The fact that they inspired art, obviously means that they were worthy of more than just generic titles,” shares Chaturvedi. In a recent show titled, ‘Begums and Baijis of Bollywood,’ the dancer shed light on the forgotten female stalwarts of Indian cinema, through stories of Jaddan Bai, Mukhtar Begum, Jahanara Kajjan and Begum Akhtar. “They were often equated with prostitution, and bracketed as mere entertainers instead of artists,” elucidates the dancer.

Chaturvedi knows what discrimination can feel like, having been the recipient of it in January this year. The performer says that her qawwali performance was “deliberately” stopped midway by officials during a dinner hosted by the UP assembly speaker for a conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. “I heard the officials coming from the side of the stage, and saying - ‘yahan qawwali nahi chalegi’ (qawwali will not be played here),” she says. The claim has been denied by the state’s Cultural Department.

Chaturvedi says that she has been at the receiving end of complete silence from state officials. The artiste lives in hope though, overwhelmed as she is by the solidarity extended to her once story went viral. “These are strange times, but I guess we’re all finding our own ways to resist against divisive politics,” she asserts.

279,2020/02/06,Memories bring it back,"“Theatre competition by BharathaYatra Kendra (BYK) was like a world cup in theatre for us. Students across colleges looked forward for its announcement year after year and prepare tirelessly. We at Vijaya College would get a professional theatre person to direct for us,” reminiscences Vallabh Suri, Co-ordinator, Ranga Sourabha which started out as a student troupe in 1999.

Many actors, directors, technicians in the theatre, film and television industries today, have sprung from this platform including Rishab Shetty, Sharath Lohitashwa, Balaji Manohar and Pramod Shetty. “Today’s actors in those days competed against each other as they belonged to teams from different colleges,” quips Vallabh adding, around 50 colleges participated in the competition and Ravindra Kalakshetra would be overcrowded with theatre enthusiasts.

Organising troupe Ranga Sourabha celebrates its 20th anniversary with the reinstitution of Sourabha Theatre Competition.

It has over 13 productions to its credit in the last 20 years, including Gangavatarana and Mysuru Mallige which have completed 100 shows.

Although the widely-known competition ran for almost three decades, it had come to a halt since a couple of years. “How could we do away with a fest that acted as a milestone in the career of so many? It was nostalgia for us. Also, we wanted to see young talent from across colleges on stage every year. All this led Ranga Sourabha to restart the competition with the support of BYK,” he explains.

Theatre personalities Mallikarjunaiah, Shobha Venkatesh and Sharath Parvathavani will be the chief guests of the theatre competition this time. “The judges will provide their comments and valuable advice at the end of each performance. The certificates of this competition is valued in most cultural institutions and universities,” he adds.

What other than theatre?

Around 16 teams from various degree colleges in Bengaluru will be participating in the theatre competition. Apart from theatre, the festival also accommodates essay writing, quiz, debate and dance competitions. Registrations for events other than theatre will be on the spot.

Painting competition that was held on February 3 gave opportunity for students, most of whom are post-millenials, to depict the Bengaluru of the 80s and 90s.

The debate competition was to raise awareness among the youth regarding superstitions. The students debated on ‘should there be a ban on blind beliefs and superstitions’ on February 5.

280,2020/02/06,“Kusur” deals with prejudice,"On the surface, “Kusur” (The Mistake) gives the impression of a thriller, but as it unravels it opens a window to state violence and deeply disturbing communal prejudice in public psyche. A sense of moral guilt permeates the production. There is no preaching tone or violent dramatic clash on the stage. A whole gamut of human emotions and psychological complexities are depicted with utmost restraint.

Based on Danish film “Den Skyldige”, the adapted version in Hindi is written by Sandhya Gokhale, who has also co-directed the play with Amol Palekar. Structurally, the play is taut with economy of dialogue. There is unity of place. The entire action takes place inside the control room of a police station in a metropolis. There is also unity of action which takes place in the night and ends within a few hours. A significant aspect of the production is the innovative use of a number of telephones which projects the sense of locales outside the control room through the distressed voices requesting police assistance.

The loud and clear voices are interspersed with some incoherent utterances of an alcoholic and bewildered voices of men lost in the vast concrete urban jungle on a rainy night. The persistently poignant voice of a mother in apparent danger to her life occupies the sole attention of the retired assistant police commissioner Ashok Dandvate (Palekar) who has volunteered his services at a police control room. It appears that the woman is the mother of two children who is being taken away by force by her husband in a car. There is the voice of a lonely kid in the grip of panic, desperately talking about his little sister in the next room. He is forbidden from entering that room.

Socially conscious

Palekar is one of our most sensitive and socially conscious theatre and film director and actor. Though there is little interaction of performers on the stage, the main character keeps on moving from one space to another, attending telephone calls, one after the another, with alacrity, giving instructions to another police station to take urgent action to provide relief to the person in distress. These voices betraying fear and danger to life create a tense emotional atmosphere on stage, with a layer of suspense.

Little Bunty's terrifying conversation with his mother and Bunty's telephonic conversation with the retired police officer are deeply disturbing, exploring the relationship between, the mother, father, Bunty and his little sister. The revelation jolts the conscience of Dandvate and opens before him a new perspective on good intentions, truth and justice.

There is another layer to the plot – the utter public apathy of the people towards soldiers after retirement. There is another element that forms the backdrop to the action. It relates to a case of murder against the official which he thinks he committed with the right intention. All these threads are neatly woven and lead to an implosive climax.

Sound design by Mandar Kamalapulkar produces the right effect. Gokhale's set design creates a realistic ambience for a police control room located in the midst of skyscrapers.

Palekar as the retired assistant police commissioner acts with restraint, evolving his own pace and rhythm to reveal the inner turmoil of his character with intense dramatic force.

281,2020/02/06,Amol Palekar: The sound of the comeback,"It has been a hectic week for Amol Palekar. With two shows of ‘Kusur’ (The Mistake), his latest play, in Delhi and one in Chandigarh, the reclusive actor-director is busy like never before. A social thriller that deals with the prejudices we carry knowingly or unknowingly, the play was the opening act of the ongoing 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav.

With the sound of azaan playing in the background, Palekar got a standing ovation when he walked down the stage of Kamani Auditorium, something the veteran will cherish for a long time.

Next morning, when we meet at the India International Centre, Palekar is sipping warm water to nurse his vocal cords. He admits, at his age, performing the 90-minute play, is “extremely demanding, not just physically but also emotionally.” But the response from the young audience keeps him fresh. “I am an unknown entity for most of them as far as theatre is concerned. They know me only through my work in films. When they say they would cherish the play for the rest of their lives, it gives me goosebumps.”

An adaptation of the Danish film “Den Skyldige” (The Guilty), the story of one night centres on retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Ashok Dandvate (played by Palekar), who volunteers to work in the emergency control room. He gets many calls but the one that catches his attention is that of a woman called Kaveri, who is presumably trapped in a life-threatening situation in a moving car being driven by her husband. She seeks help and wants Dandvate to take care of her son who is alone at home with his younger sister. As the drama unfolds, Dandvate, who has a murder charge against him, starts questioning his bias. Mounted with his wife Sandhya Gokhale, Palekar describes “Kusur” as a theatrical experience that has not been tried in any Indian language.

Rising above differences

“In our day-to-day life, we refuse to go beyond our preconceived notions. The play is about how we look at our social space only in terms of caste, language, and religion. If we are ready to accept that — oh! I never realised that I had this bias — things will change automatically. This is a simple thing which as a protagonist I could relate to,” explains Palekar.

The soliloquy towards the end where Dandvate regrets he didn’t know that it was a crime, reflects the essence of the play. The play is relevant to the times we live in, as the prejudices are growing. “It is for each one of us to look within and find an honest answer,” says Palekar. “What I feel very nice from the response to the play is that it lights a spark. People come backstage and say they would introspect,” he adds.

Sound design plays a crucial role in “Kusur” not only because Dandvate is in conversation on phone for most of the duration of the play but also because Palekar and Gokhale have consciously used it to add to the tension and create a claustrophobic atmosphere on stage. Be it the sound of boiling water, or Dandwate clearing his nose, the audience could feel the little sounds and meaningful silences. “ “In theatre, and to some extent in films, we have neglected sound as an entity and as a character,” says the actor-director.

Significance of sound

In theatre, he says, the value of sound is limited to the actor’s spoken word and background music. “In films, it has reached to such a stage that there is not even a single moment of silence. I feel we are scared of the silence because it poses a number of questions. It poses a question to the actor that if he is not able to hold that silent pause, people might leave the theatre. That’s why the director slips in some music, some sound.”

Palekar says he was always fascinated by the role of sound. “When I directed Mahesh Elkunchwar’s ‘Party’, I took a conscious decision that we will not use any recorded sound. In tense moments, we used the sounds of clinking of glasses, the opening of a soda bottle. We played on all such sounds as part of the sound design to deal with the silences and the spoken word. And it worked!” he fondly remembers.

The play is a “gift” from his wife on his 75th birthday. “A year ago, while holidaying with our daughter we watched this Danish film. Suddenly, Sandhya asked if she adapted this into a play , would I like to be the protagonist,” recalls Palekar with a glint in his eyes.

It took Sandhya, who apart from her achievements in the creative field, is also a competent lawyer, six-seven months to convince the producers and director-co-writer Gustav Moller to grant the theatre rights of the film. “When we watched it, the film was not much heard about but by the time she contacted them, the film became big. It was the Danish entry for the Oscars in the Best Foreign Films Category. Moreover, Hollywood also got interested in buying the rights,” says Palekar.

Having practised in the U.S. for 10 years, he says, Sandhya could handle it. “They respected the fact that we were the first ones to approach them. Another little hurdle was that they wanted word-to-word translation. Sandhya was not interested in that as European sensibility is different. She said she would be faithful to the spirit but wanted to adapt it to the Indian context. She also offered to send what she wrote. They were so happy that they gave us the rights to adapt it to any Indian language.”

The rights come for a price. “The royalty that we are paying is quite high but Sandhya says that it is her gift to her beloved husband,” gushes Palekar

Few know that Palekar, an alumnus of JJ School of Arts, started as a painter and is known for his abstracts. Usually, creative people move from realism to deeper layers but Palekar moved the other way round.

Beyond the words

“The moment you say abstract people tend to think it is not their cup of tea. But, if you think a little more, emotions and feelings are abstract. What is love? It is so abstract that one can find any number of layers of complexity in that,” he elucidates, adding abstraction doesn’t mean being obscure.

Sandhya, who has observed him closely, says, “His career, in theatre, films and visual arts started at the same time. During the first eight years , he was doing all the things simultaneously but abstraction is his first preference. Even in scripts, he tries to find much more than it is on paper. He is always interested in what goes on beyond the words.”

“Paheli” which he directed, she continues, “is the epitome of the mainstream: songs, dance and Shah Rukh Khan. Still, if you watch it closely, it takes you to abstraction.”

Palekar reminds of “Thoda Sa Roomani Ho Jaye”, his much-loved musical, where he used dialogues in verse. “I wanted to use all the elements to my advantage without having any preconceived notion to seek answers to my questions,” he analyses.

And how did he justify Ram Prasad and Laxman Prasad, his most popular and loved characters, to himself? “People actually forget the actual character who is playing the two protagonists. You always keep talking about the double role. It is actually three. The original boy, whose name nobody remembers, is playing Ramprasad and when he gets entangled, he starts playing Laxman Prasad. But both are role-playing. Again, looking for that core, is what I have been trying to do,” signs off Palekar. That everyman’s smile is still intact!

Capital memories

The standing ovation that Amol Palekar got in Delhi had a different meaning for him. “I have seen over the years how the Delhi theatre fraternity looks down upon Bombay theatre. To a great extent, they are justified also. The kind of theatre productions that come to Delhi from Mumbai are commercial and maybe mediocre,” says Palekar.

It was way back in 1971, recalls Palekar, that he first performed performed at the Kamani. “I was a young artist, full of oneself, as all of us are at a young age. My guru Satyadev Dubey was being felicitated by the Sangeet Natak Akademi when we staged Mohan Rakesh’s “Adhe Adhure”. At that time, Dinesh Thakur (who later worked with him in ‘Rajnigandha’) used to perform the part of Ashok in Delhi. There were lots of comparisons and discussions which was very nice.”

However, according to Palekar, the most memorable outing was when he got to perform in front of Indira Gandhi. “I still remember we performed Girish Karnad’s “Hayavadan” at the AIFACS (All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society. On the morning of the performance, we were told that Indira Gandhi would be attending the performance. So, there was a lot of excitement. Just before the performance, we were told that Ms Gandhi would leave after about half-an-hour. When (Satyadev) Dubey ji heard this message, he turned to me and said if she sits up to the interval, he lays a bet that she will not go. The person who brought this message didn’t believe him. As it happened, she didn’t get up till interval. And when her security staff rose to leave during interval, she decided to stay on till the end. I still cherish that moment.” While Palekar played the part of Devdutt, Kapila was played by Amrish Puri and Kali Mata was played by Dina Pathak.

“People keep asking me about my association with Utpal Dutt and Dina Ben. My association with them was through theatre. With Utpal Dutt, I had had such wonderful moments when I watched him rehearse in Kolkata. He used to come and watch my productions in Mumbai. We knew other through our theatre journey. Working with them in ‘Golmaal’ was a culmination of all these things. The chemistry took shape on stage!” he chuckles. He will soon return to Capital as Bookmyshow is bringing “Kusur” to Delhi.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/6ryoo3/article30750596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHA2761,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/amol-palekar-the-sound-of-the-comeback/article30750597.ece
282,2020/02/06,Of change and continuity,"Spring and Bharat Rang Mahotsav (BRM) have become synonymous in Delhi for the past few years. This year also, National School of Drama’s 21st BRM promises an enthralling mix of national and international plays.

The international segment of BRM has a total of ten plays selected out of a total of 71 entries received from 14 countries across the globe. The selected plays include five from Asia and five from Europe and the United States.

But numbers matter little! This small bouquet of international plays represents a wide spectrum of content: classics, mythological, historical, contemporary, and satire. It, however, is remarkable to note that while Asian countries are trying to focus more on the problems faced by these societies today, the Western countries are trying more to reinterpret history and mythology in their plays.

Bangladesh’s play “Tragedy of the Polashbari” (Bangla) is one example. Polashbari is a place in Dhaka where a building of an export-garments factory had collapsed in 2005, killing dozens of workers. The other presentation of Bangladesh, “Mrityu Ghar” (Bangla), is an adaptation of Dea Loher's play “Olga’s Room”. Published in 1992, it is the story of the life and struggles of Olga Benario, the German-Brazilian communist leader who was gassed by the Nazi Germany.

“Kumari and the Beast” (English) from Nepal is the only Asian play which delves into the religious traditions. It tells the story of Kumari Devi – the Goddess, wherein a young prepubescent girl is chosen as Kumari. The conflict between her love and her duties compels her make a difficult choice! Does she have a right to love and be able to make personal choices as any other normal girl? The play debates this question in a society still steeped deeply in customs and traditions.

The other entry from Nepal, Mannu Bhandari’s modern political classic “Mahabhoj” (Nepali) narrates the tale of ordinary humans forced to act as puppets in the vicious grip of the system. It also captures the revolt against the status-quoist tendencies.

“Grease Yaka Returns”, the only play from Sri Lanka, looks at how easily distrust can be sown between various groups in society through the aggregation of relatively small event and incidents. It holds a mirror while giving a warning to the society.

“Live Nukes” from the US is the only Western play that deals with today’s society of the West. It depicts two government lackeys who launch a nuclear weapon and go through metaphorical and literal hell to stop it. “Conference of the Birds”, the other play from the US, is inspired by the epic poem of Farid-ud-Din Attar. Hailing from Nishapur in the north-eastern parts of Iran, Attar was a twelfth century Persian Sufi poet. This play was presented in last year’s BRM also by Nepal as “Charaharuko Sammelan”,

Czech Republic’s play Shakespeare’s “Richard III” (English) is a riveting portrayal of the politics of power, both personal and political, at their most devious and bloody. Director Guy Roberts says, “It is a story that plays out time and time again, and, if anything, has become even more relevant now, over four hundred years after it was written, with corrupt leaders doing absolutely anything to achieve and maintain power.”

“Djyrybyna, the Warrior Woman” (Russian) and “The Trojan Women” (Russian), both the plays from Russia, depicting the conflict and destruction mounted by the political authority mad with power, take their inspiration from ancient tales. “Djyrybyna” is an ancient Yakut legend from the eastern parts of Russia, and presents ethnic narrating tradition Olonkho, which is a series of heroic epic tales of the Yakut people living in the Siberian terrain of Russia.

“The Trojan Women” is based on the play by Euripides with the same title. “This performance is an effort to understand tragedy as seen today, and to make the ancient text contemporary, but at the same time trying to keep traditions of ancient tragedy intact”, says director Vasilisa Tapliakova.

283,2020/02/06,"Three prominent Koodiyattam artistes talk about their new-found confidence, challenges and possibilities","Nangiarkoothu, a sub-genre of Koodiyattam, is perhaps one art form that has made huge strides in the last three decades or so. What was once a temple ritual has moved on to the performance stage with vigour and variety. Female roles in the old texts are being re-imagined and redefined, while new texts and characters are being developed. Talented new actors too have emerged on the Nangiarkoothu stage who have breathed fresh life into it.

While Koodiyattam is Sanskrit drama featuring male and female actors, Nangiarkoothu is a solo performance by women. It is almost entirely based on abhinaya, with hardly any nritta element. Koodiyattam has two major segments — nirvahanam, or retrospective, which is a solo act retelling past events, and the play itself that comprises dialogues and multiple characters.

At a seminar in Guruvayur, three prominent artists — Indu G, Aparna Nangiar and Kalamandalam Sindhu — spoke about various aspects surrounding women’s role in Koodiyattam. They agreed on the marginalisation of women on the Koodiyattam stage but offered different perspectives on the opportunities and challenges before them. While Indu believes that even the small roles of women in Koodiyattam plays offer potential for an artiste with imagination and experience, Aparna says it is the solo acts that offer women artistes the biggest canvas. Sindhu wants female artists to be more imaginative in dealing with the existing texts and be more creative with new choreographies.

Indu felt that the most prominent space for women in Koodiyattam is perhaps Kalpalathika’s retrospective in Subhadradhananjayam. Kalpalathika, the companion of Krishna’s sister Subhadra, recounts the story of Krishna in Sreekrishnacharitham. It is significant that hundreds of years ago, Koodiyattam gave 217 slokas and 55 hours of acting on stage to women, Indu pointed out.

However, later this became infrequent for several reasons, including the paucity of women actors, male dominance and other societal factors. But it is a historical fact that Sreekrishnacharitham remained in acting manuals and survived as ritualistic dance practices in certain temples. Even when we talk of bias against women, we must remember that such a big text was written solely for and performed solely by women centuries ago, reminded Indu. While Koodiyattam plays offer very few words to the actress, there are spaces and potential that she can discover and tap into, the artiste said.

Indu recounted her experience in the play Ascharyachoodamani through its different acts from Lalita in Parnasalankam to Sita in Agnipravesankam, the last Act. Indu recalled something she improvised that she hadn’t planned while acting as Sita. When Sita sees Lakshmana, she is reminded of her cruel words to him before she was kidnapped. “I happened to recall the lines from Kumaran Asaan’s poem Chintavishtayaya Sita, which says ‘O Lakshmana, please forgive me for the harsh words I uttered to you.’ This is not in the play or in the acting manual, but I instinctively introduced this in my act.”

The playwrights created roles for women that were certainly inadequate in time and space; yet these roles are challenging too. Without fully comprehending the intricacies and emotional weight of the role, it would be difficult for an actress to perform as, say, Sita in Jatayuvadham or as Tara in Balivadham.

While limited stage time reduces the physical demands on women, their very presence requires emotional and intellectual involvement and experience. So the importance of women in such plays should not be counted based on the time allotted to them or the number of dialogues. “It is when we are on the stage that we realise it is Sita and not Rama that shines bright. It is in those moments of silence on stage that an actress experiences womanhood or is forced to address the uncertainties that surround women,” said Indu.

The Koodiyattam artiste also narrated her experience as Tara in Balivadham, a role generally considered insignificant as the scene is dominated by Bali. “Though Tara utters just a few words, being on stage with Bali subjects her to a thought process and an experience that inspired me to write a short story,” said Indu. Tara creates so much turmoil in the actress, which, of course, is not to be acted out. But what the actress experiences in these silent moments is priceless.

Multiple impediments

Aparna Nangiar argued that though there are many female characters in Sanskrit plays, there are only a few in Koodiyattam. There may be several reasons — there weren’t enough capable women who stepped forward as actresses; Koodiyattam was always a character-centric performance and anyone impeding on the main character was consciously kept away and the supposed ban on panchakanyakas (Ahalya, Draupadi, Sita, Tara and Mandodari) from the stage, though there is no conclusive evidence to prove such a practice.

Generally, in Koodiyattam plays, there are several slokas that give immense scope to male actors. But such space is hard to find for women. “I can’t entirely agree with what Indu says about Tara. The thoughts that went through Indu’s mind may help Indu the actress but won’t impact the spectator. Whatever the character of Tara does, it is Bali who is towering above all else,” Aparna said.

This is why the solo retrospective segment in Koodiyattam plays is important for women. Theoretically, while there are many opportunities for women to play these retrospective segments, the reality of Koodiyattam today is that men’s nirvahanams are performed in detail while women’s remain on paper in the kramadeepika, or production manual, opined Aparna.

What is available now is Sreekrishnacharitham and Lalita’s retrospective in Parnasalankam or Soorpanakhankam. There is evidence that Mandodari had a retrospective, a role that has been revived by Usha Nangiar with new slokas written in. It is such a well-researched piece that more possibilities emerge every time we perform it, said Aparna. Subhadra also has a retrospective in the fifth act of Dhananjayam, which doesn’t see the light of the day today. This may be the reason why we now find many women performers choreographing new nirvahanams, she added.

She is of the opinion that aside from reviving the retrospective segments within the Koodiyattam play, we must look at the untapped possibilities within the retrospective. Currently, only three slokas are detailed in Lalita’s retrospective in Soorpanakhankam, though the acting manual contains pointers to much longer and detailed performances. For example, there is a sloka where Lalita compares her beauty to Rama that offers big scope for the actress because, though she is a demoness, she appears as a beautiful woman. But in tapping these hidden segments, we must be careful to revive it without any damage to the structure and theory of Koodiyattam, pointed out Aparna.

Coming to Nangiarkoothu, Sreekrishnacharitham spans episodes about the origin of Mathura kingdom to Subhadra falling in love with Arjuna. There are slokas that, on the surface, do not offer much scope, but if we approach them with an enquiring mind and add material from the allied art form of koothu, for example, the possibilities are limitless. Dasamam Koothu, which has remained a ritualistic practice, is another area that has a lot of scope to explore and enlarge.

However, such enquiries and choreographies must begin only after an artiste gains expertise that comes with proper training and long stage experience. Otherwise, these will violate the framework of Koodiyattam, cautioned Aparna.

Female identity

Kalamandalam Sindhu, who spoke about women’s identity on the Koodiyattam stage, perhaps was the most vocal about the secondary status accorded to women.

She highlighted that the early history of Koodiyattam showed that women did perform on stage, however, they lost that space gradually. New stage techniques were used to sideline them, for instance, a lamp symbolised Sita. Male characters performed kettadal, or acted out the female lines. This was done by pretending to hear them as a Nangiar woman sitting on the stage was made to recite the lines of a female character. Only five plays remained in the performance arena and there were only two female characters. By the beginning of the 20th century, Koodiyattam had been reduced to a temple ritual, having lost its grandeur as a performing art.

The reforms in the mid-1900s, led by Painkulam Rama Chakyar, resurrected this art form and brought it out from temples on to the public stage. It became an aesthetic delight after the costumes were modernised and other changes brought in. Female roles were resurrected, acting manuals written and new plays came to light. More women took up Koodiyattam with many of them coming from outside the traditional communities. More than that women-centric plays were given due importance by male practitioners of Koodiyattam.

However, these changes did not get reflected in the content of female roles, lamented Sindhu. Not much thought had gone into the subject of female identity. Perhaps, such a possibility did not exist in the current acting manuals written by men. Language itself was a big factor in this marginalisation — Prakrit for women versus Sanskrit for men.

Even the new plays explored only possibilities of abhinaya for women, and did not give any thought to projecting female identity. The late Margi Sathi’s Sreeramacharitham is the first composition by a woman in the last century. But it has to be said that this work is not from the point of view of Sita’s identity. What should have been a look at Rama’s life from Sita’s perspective didn’t come out that way. A female perspective would even have necessitated a different title. This state of affairs can be changed only by actresses who will start thinking as Sita. The change should come from the women.

New choreographies such as Chintavishtayaya Sita and Mandodari by Usha Nangiar are the start of a change in this direction, an awareness of female identity. Another possibility is what Indu suggested as in Mayaseethankam — re-read the male-written text from a female perspective. Works of Koodiyattam guru Venu G such as Sitaparityagam and Chitrangada also offer helpful pointers, pointed out Sindhu.

True women’s identity, freedom and rights predicate a society that recognises these values and an audience that will enjoy it. What is more important is that these exercises must not be a mere assertion of female identity but must remain within the confines of the pristine highly structured tradition of Koodiyattam. That is both an opportunity and a challenge, she said.

284,2020/02/06,CPI leader criticises Rajinikanth,"Describing actor Rajnikanth as a good actor once, the CPI state secretary R. Mutharasan said on Thursday that he had been losing the sheen as a celebrity.

Speaking to reporters here, he said that the actor, like in movies, had been repeating dialogues and scripts from his acquaintances without understanding the mental agony being undergone by common man after the Centre introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Population Register, among others.

The CPI leader went to the extent of criticising that the latest movie of the actor had failed to click so that distributors had lined up before the production company seeking relief. It showed that Mr. Rajnikanth had lost the ground among the youth and his fans as well.

Tamil Nadu people were aware that Mr. Rajnikanth would never come to politics. He was speaking to the media to get some attention. The people cannot be misled, he asserted.

Regarding the expose over the functioning of the TNPSC, Mr. Mutharasan said it was very sad that the accused so far nabbed by the police were just “carriers” and urged the government to deal with them with an iron hand. It is a very serious issue as several thousands of educated but unemployed persons had been deprived of jobs through the examinations conducted by the TNPSC.

The sharks behind the scam should be held and there should not be any attempt to cover up the case.

He denied that there was any difference of opinion with the opposition parties. The unity had brought victory as the government had given up its plan to hold examinations for Classes 5 and 8.

The opposition across the country would fight against the BJP. The Centre was bent on handing over top institutions like Railways, Highways, Ports and other offices to select private sectors.

The need of the hour was to bring about a change both in Centre and Tamil Nadu, he stressed.

285,2020/02/06,Students’ relay reading moves visitors of book fair,"The book fair at VOC Ground in Palayamkottai, which is attracting a huge crowd ever since it started on February 1, saw a group of visually challenged visitors on Thursday. Even as the organisers of the event were thinking that they were going to visit the stalls where the Braille books are being sold, they quietly settled down at the enclosure meant for ‘relay reading’ and started reading books they had brought along with them even as other visitors were quite amused.

Students decided to read books round the clock at the venue from day one till the end of the fair on February 10 to highlight the importance of reading good books. A group of five girl students from Rani Anna Government College for Women in Pettai started the relay reading exercise. On seeing the students’ determination, the public too joined hands with them in taking the effort to a great finish and a world record attempt.

When Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish wanted to involve students with disability in this effort, she extended an invitation to students of Higher Secondary School for the Visually Impaired in Palayamkottai. “We’ll be much glad if you can join us,” the letter said.

Accepting the invitation, 24 visually challenged students including Plus Two students, came forward to be part of the relay reading. Of this, Plus Two students - Anas Badhusha of Surandai and Vinodh Kumar of Madurai – said they would read the books continuously for 24 hours while others decided to join them for three hours in batches.

As the students including 14 boys and 10 girls started reading their Braille books on general knowledge, great works of Bharathi, Birbal stories etc., visitors greeted them with wild cheers. Their spirit never diminished. While Mr. Badhusha and Mr. Vinodh Kumar continued their reading, others joined them in small groups even as their principal J. Kingston James Paul and other teachers were cheering them up.

“We hear that students spend most of their time on mobile phones. As smart phones are spoiling the reading habit of students, we, who can’t even see these gadgets, want to tell them that reading as many books alone can do wonders in their life. It’s really satisfying as we are here for a noble cause,” said Mr. Badhusha and Mr. Vinodh Kumar.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/students-relay-reading-moves-visitors-of-book-fair/article30754660.ece

289,2020/02/06,Court says Returning Officer can’t order recounting once winner is officially declared,"Holding that a Returning Officer cannot order a recount after issuing the victory certificate, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday allowed the petition filed by M. Devi, one of the two candidates who were declared panchayat president- elect in Sankarapuram village panchayat in Sivaganga district.

Two candidates were declared president elect to the panchayat that was reserved for woman (general) in the rural local body elections held recently. Devi and A. Priyadharshini had both contested for the post of president to the Sankarapuram village panchayat.

The petitioner, Devi, said that at about 8 p.m. on the day of the results, she was declared the winner. However a recount was done following a commotion and at 5 a.m. the next morning, A. Priyadharshini, the other candidate was declared the winner. Both were issued the certificates (Form 25).

Devi alleged that Priyadharshini was favoured as she was associated with the ruling party and sought a direction to declare the certificate awarded to Priyadharshini null and void.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran allowed the petition filed by Devi and observed that the the returning officer has no power to entertain an application for recounting under Rule 66 of Tamil Nadu Panchayat Election Rules once Form 25 was issued.

Among the most famous of the kavadi processions is the ‘Nagarathar kavadi,’ decorated in a grand manner and carried by thousands of devotees from the 76 villages of Chettinad. People walk towards Palani, all the way from Karaikudi and Devakottai region in Sivaganga district, carrying kavadis.

The procession reached Natham on Tuesday and Dindigul on Wednesday. As per the 450-year-old tradition, the procession was led by a diamond spear (vaira vel), housed in a wooden box and carried on a bullock cart. “The kavadis from the entire Chettinad belt (Sivaganga and Pudukottai district) assemble at Kundrakudi Murugan Temple on the night before we start. In the morning, after a special puja at the temple, the kavadis are taken on the shoulders and we start walking westwards,” said Mani Nachiappan, a devotee who has been doing the padayatra for the past 40 years.

“I started walking to Palani as a 15-year-old boy and it has been an annual ritual for me. The kavadis from Chettinad are grouped into two – Melvattagai and Keelvattagai – denoting the villages they come from.

At the Thiruavinankudi temple, both the groups mingle and the kavadis are offered in unison to Lord Muruga,” said Pechiappan, another devotee.

293,2020/02/06,"Forum seeks action against policemen responsible for firing on December 19, 2019","A group of Muslims under the aegis of December 19 Golibar Victims Justice Forum on Wednesday said that the State government should forthwith take disciplinary action against policemen responsible for the firing on December 19, 2019.

Talking to reporters here, Abdul Jaleel K., convenor of the forum, said that any inquiry into the police firing cannot be fair in the absence of disciplinary action against policemen. If the State government fails to take action, the forum will be forced to intensify its agitation, he said.

Mustafha Kunhi, a member of the forum, said that the State government should give ₹ 25 lakh each as compensation to the families of Jaleel and Nauseen who died in the firing and ₹ 15 lakh to those injured. A rioting case booked against Jaleel and Nauseen should be dropped, he said.

Rafiuddin Kudroli, another member of the forum, said that the police should stop booking 24 persons, who have been arrested in connection with rioting, in new cases with a view to preventing them from getting bail.

Two persons were killed and eight were injured in the police firing during the violent protests against the Citizens (Amendment) Act on December 19, 2019. Deputy Commissioner of Udupi G. Jagadeesh is holding a magisterial inquiry into the incident, while the Criminal Investigation Department’s Special Inquiry Wing is investigating cases of rioting and police firing registered by the police.

294,2020/02/06,Indian Red Cross helpdesk to come up at Wenlock Hospital,"The Indian Red Cross’ Dakshina Kannada unit will start a Red Cross helpdesk at the Government Wenlock Hospital on February 11. It has also planned to hold an exclusive blood donation camp for women.

These are among the activities planned by the district unit for the centenary year of the Indian Red Cross, said honorary secretary S.A. Prabhakar Sharma and Chairman Shantaram Shetty here on Wednesday.

In a Meet-the-Press held at the Press Club, Mr. Sharma said that the idea of starting the helpdesk was mooted by Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh, who is also the president of the district unit of Indian Red Cross Society.

Hospital’s Superintendent H. Rajeshwaridevi had also said that the two staff manning the hospital’s helpdesk found it difficult to handle queries from a large number of people coming to the hospital.

Mr. Sharma said that the Red Cross helpdesk will be run by about 50 volunteers from the Senior Citizens Association and Milagres Church. These volunteers will guide visitors in availing of facilities at the hospital. “We are training volunteers on February 7. They will start work on February 11,” he said. These volunteers will sport Indian Red Cross jacket, he added.

Mr. Shantaram Shetty said that they have planned to hold a women’s blood donation camp to remove inhibition among women about blood donation. “We will do this in association with 15 other bloods banks,” Mr. Shetty said. As women are prone to be anaemic, Mr. Shetty said, only those who have the required haemoglobin level and weight will be allowed to donate. “We expect around 2,000 women to take part in the event proposed on the International Women’s Day,” he said.

The district unit, he said, was operating from a small premises located behind the office of the Deputy Commissioner. The district administration has sanctioned 25 cents of land for construction of a new building. “We will take up construction in the next few days after getting mandatory clearances,” he said.

295,2020/02/06,New Kallianpur market yard yet to start functioning,"A year after a new market yard was constructed at Kallianpur by the Udupi municipality at a cost of ₹ 1 crore to shift the weekly market and ease traffic congestion on National Highway 66, it is yet to start functioning.

A weekly market is being held on Sundays at Kallianpur-Santhekatte here for the last five decades. People from not just Udupi but also nearby areas, including Malpe, Tenkanidiyur, Brahmavar and Kolalgiri, come to this weekly market to purchase vegetables.

Since this is a popular weekly market, vegetable sellers from different places in Udupi district and also neighbouring districts come and sell their vegetables here. This weekly market starts as early as 5 a.m. and goes on till about 3.30 p.m.

As this weekly market is held next to NH 66, some vegetable sellers sell their vegetables on the service road, leading to traffic congestion on the highway.

“At times even vans of vegetable sellers bringing vegetables from Shivamogga and Hassan block the road. This creates traffic congestion at the Kallianpur Junction on NH 66,” said Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar.

To deal with this problem, the Udupi municipality decided to construct a new market yard near a temple inside Kallianpur to shift the vegetable sellers. The area of the new market yard is spread over 17,500 square feet and it can accommodate 85 vegetable sellers.

“The construction of a water tank for the new market is on and will be completed in 15 days and inter-lock tiles have to be installed in its surrounding. We expect this market to start functioning in about a month. It will be safe for both vegetable sellers and customers,” Mr. Kallolikar said. According to the municipality, there is parking facility for about 20 four-wheelers near this new yard, but the residents think otherwise.

Damodar Ganiga, a resident, said that a lot of people come to purchase vegetables on Sundays. “There is not enough space here for parking vehicles of both vegetable sellers and customers. This defeats the very purpose of its construction,” he said.

Jaya K.N., another resident, said that the municipality should have constructed a one-storeyed structure with parking facility on the ground floor and the market on the first floor.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/v86imu/article30746151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MNUDUPIMARKET2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/new-kallianpur-market-yard-yet-to-start-functioning/article30746152.ece

Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, Principal District and Sessions Judge Kadloor Sathyanarayanacharya, who is the Chairman of the District Legal Services Authority, said 618 cases, pending in the courts, have been referred for resolution.

“Notices have been issued to more people. We will take up those cases if they come forward. Litigants can also approach us on February 8 for resolution of their cases pending in different courts,” he said.

By holding Lok Adalats, the judges and advocates in district are trying to ensure early resolution of disputes. As many as 51,000 cases were pending in the 42 courts of the district, he added.

Mr. Sathyanarayanacharya said he and 42 other judicial officers will sit along with advocates to resolve disputes. Among 618 cases that have been taken for resolution include 300 criminal cases related to compoundable offences of which some relate to alleged illegal transportation of sand.

301,2020/02/06,‘₹1 lakh-cr. infusion will enable banks cut rate’,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das responds to various queries during the post monetary policy interaction with the media:

What’s the reason behind the long-term repo window and CRR exemption for retail, MSME loans?

Basically, it is an effort to ensure better monetary policy transmission. Because we are giving it at the policy rate… so ₹1 lakh crore we want to infuse in the banking system which will enable banks to reduce lending rate.

Are you looking at a certain level of CPI inflation below which you will be in a position to cut rate?

If you see last year’s experience of the monetary policy, it was full of surprises. The unseasonal rains of October and November were completely unexpected.

Because of that, onion prices alone accounted for 328 bps in food inflation and about 200 bps in overall inflation. As it looks now, headline inflation has peaked for the current quarter.

Inflation is expected to go down further. Then we have to see how quickly the downward slope actually plays out, on the basis of which MPC will take a decision.

I cannot say at which point MPC will take action because [there are] so many other factors which contribute to and impact inflation. MPC, like in 2019, will be very very proactive even in 2020 [in cutting rates].

Will the long-term repo operation replace open market operation (OMO)?

M.D. Patra: Long-term repo operation will not replace the OMO. The idea is to some how help banks to reduce cost of funds. It also gives them some assurance of durable liquidity in their hands.

What were your objectives of Operation Twist? If you wanted to reduce rates, you could have cut repo rates?

There are several options available to the RBI. You have suggested one option, but we have decided to exercise the other option.

We are keeping the surplus liquidity for better monetary policy transmission.

Operation Twist was conducted to ensure better monetary transmission.

The corporate bonds are a benchmark to the lending rate of the G-sec segment.

So, by Operation Twist, you are able to soften the yields of government securities at the longer end, that acts as a benchmark to the corporate loan rate.

The effort was mainly for monetary transmission in the corporate bond market, not so much to manage the yield of government securities.

Why is the CRR exemption only for six months?

It is a balanced call we have taken. Too early to say if we will give an extension.

Under the FRBM Act, once the trigger is exercised, the government can also monetise the deficit with RBI. Does it concern you?

Let me be very clear, at the moment there is no such plan.

Despite the fiscal deficit number going up, the open market borrowing number for the current financial year remains the same and next year, the increase is only by ₹70,000 crore. And if it is calculated as a percentage of GDP, then it is lower than the current year borrowing.

Is the RBI concerned over fiscal slippage?

What the RBI’s concern as a debt manager of the government is, is the borrowing numbers. As I have said, next year’s borrowing increases by ₹70,000 crore which is lower as a percentage of GDP which we have in the current year. We do expect it will go through in a non-disruptive manner.

The response by the RBI staff to opt in for the specialised supervisory and regulatory cadre was not good. What was the reason?

That is an internal matter, an in-house issue. It will be resolved.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dzymbz/article30755083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/1-lakh-cr-infusion-will-enable-banks-cut-rate/article30755084.ece
302,2020/02/06,RBI extends deadline for one-time debt recast for MSMEs,"In a relief to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the deadline for one- time debt recast for these firms that are in default but have not been classified as non-performing.

An asset becomes non-performing if interest or principal payment is overdue for more than 90 days.

“... it has been decided to extend the benefit of one-time restructuring without an asset classification downgrade to standard accounts of GST-registered MSMEs that were in default as on January 1, 2020,” the RBI said,

December 31 deadline

The restructuring under the scheme has to be implemented latest by December 31, 2020. “This will benefit the eligible MSME entities which could not be restructured under the provisions of the circular dated January 1, 2019 as also the MSME entities which have become stressed thereafter,” RBI said.

The original scheme was applicable for standard MSME accounts as of January 1, 2019, while the restructuring was to be implemented by March 31, 2020.

The central bank has also asked commercial banks to link pricing of loans for the medium-sized enterprises to an external benchmark effective April 1, 2020.

Earlier, banks were directed to link the loan rate to an external benchmark for retail loans and credit extended to micro and small enterprises.

The step was taken with a view to further strengthening monetary transmission, the RBI said.

Commercial realty gains

Separately, the regulator has decided to permit extension of date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) of project loans for commercial real estate, which are delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters, by another one year without downgrading the asset classification.

The move is in line with the treatment accorded to other project loans in the non-infrastructure sector.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-extends-deadline-for-one-time-debt-recast-for-msmes/article30755078.ece
303,2020/02/06,Rates to fall despite RBI’s status quo,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided at a meeting on Thursday to keep the interest rates unchanged in the wake of a rise in inflation, but emphasised that there would be space for rate reduction.

This is the second straight policy review meeting where the rates have been kept unchanged. The RBI reduced the rates by 135 bps between February and October 2019 before pressing the pause button in the December policy review.

Thursday’s decision was unanimous among all six members of the MPC.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das acknowledged that the market had factored in status quo. “While this decision may be on expected lines, and perhaps widely discounted, it’s important not to discount the RBI,” he said. “It has to be kept in mind that the central bank has several instruments that can be deployed to address the challenges that the economy faces in terms of the sluggishness in the growth momentum.”

The central bank took two measures that could ease lending rates further. One, it opened a window to extend ₹1 lakh crore to the commercial banks at the repo rate, which is 5.15%. Second, banks have been exempted from maintaining the cash reserve ratio — which is 4% of the net demand and time liabilities now — for home, auto and MSME loans that are extended from January 31 to July 31.

“...It is an effort to ensure better monetary policy transmission,” Mr. Das said, explaining the objective behind the move.

The GDP growth for the next financial year is projected at 6%, in the range of 5.5-6% in the first half of the FY21 and and 6.2% in Q3. The growth projection for the current financial year was 5%.

The outlook for the consumer price index-based inflation has been revised upward to 6.5% for the fourth quarter of the current financial year and 5.4-5.0% for the first half of 2020-21. It’s projected at 3.2% for third quarter of the next financial year.

While holding the rates, Mr Das reminded that there would be scope for further easing. “Barring the intensification of global risks, I would like to emphasise that there is policy space available for future action. This space needs to be used appropriately and should be suitably timed to optimise its impact on growth,” he said, adding that downside risks to global growth had increased in the wake of the outbreak of coronavirus.

Markets reacted positively to the tone, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark government paper dropping 6 bps to close the day at 6.45%.

Economists said that with RBI worried about growth recovery, the next rate cut could be as early as in April - the next policy review meeting.

A Nomura report said, “The RBI delivered a dovish pause with a clear signal that its bias remains towards easing… we continue to believe the next policy move is still a cut; we expect a 25bp repo rate cut in Q2 2020, which could get delivered as early as April”.

Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank, said, “Going forward, our sense is that the central bank could take the first opportunity it gets to cut rates - as soon as the inflation optics start looking better and headline inflation comes in closer to the RBI’s target band. We now see a high probability of a rate cut (25bps) as early as Q1 FY21”.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/77nq2f/article30755074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-opts-for-long-term-repos-crr-exemption-to-lower-rates/article30755075.ece
304,2020/02/06,Air India has dues of over ₹822 crore towards VVIP charter flights,"Cash-strapped Air India, which is being disinvested by the government, has outstanding dues of over ₹822 crore towards VVIP charter flights, according to latest data provided by the national carrier to an RTI response.

In its RTI response provided on Wednesday to Commodore Lokesh Batra (retd.), who sought to know the latest data on outstanding bills of Air India, the carrier said as on November 30, 2019, ₹822 crore were pending towards VVIP charter flights.

It also said an additional ₹9.67 crore towards evacuation operations and ₹12.65 crore towards ferrying foreign dignitaries were also pending.

Under VVIP charter flights, Air India provides its aircraft to ferry the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister, for which the bills are paid by the ministries.

In addition to these dues, the carrier had also accrued bills of ₹526.14 crore towards tickets taken on credit by government officials as on March 31, 2019, according to the reply.

Out of ₹526.14 crore, ₹236.16 crore were pending for over three years, Air India said in its response.

The airlines also said it had provisioned ₹281.82 crore as an accounting charge in its account books for “probable non-recovery”.

Air India had stopped the practice of issuing tickets on credit to government agencies for the travel of their officials in December last year because of accruing pending bills.

In the RTI response, the airlines has provided a list of agencies against which bills were pending. These include the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax, Intelligence Bureau, CRPF, Department of Posts, Reserve Bank of India among others.

Mr. Batra had sought “updated (till the date of response), completed and detailed information (including dates and invoices)” on total pending dues towards VVIP charter flights and amounts owed by different public authorities towards Air India among other details.

According to a response provided by the Civil Aviation ministry on December 5, 2019, a net loss of ₹8,556.35 crore (provisional) was reported by Air India. The total debt of the airlines is pegged at around ₹60,000 crore.

On Wednesday, the Ministry had said reasons for losses reported by Air India were — high interest burden, increase in competition especially from low cost carriers, adverse impact of exchange rate variation due to weakening of the Indian Rupee, and high operating costs.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1nmpcs/article30677778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-air-india,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/air-india-has-dues-of-over-822-crore-towards-vvip-charter-flights/article30751869.ece
305,2020/02/06,"Experts hail RBI measures to boost economy, improve money supply","Economists and financial experts have welcomed RBI’s widely expected status quo on repo rate, and other announcements to spur economic growth and ensure money supplies effectively.

The RBI on Thursday kept the key policy rate unchanged at 5.15%. This follows a cumulative 135 basis points (bps) cut in repo rate since February to December 2019.

The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unanimously decided to keep the repo rate unchanged.

Bank of India CMD A. K. Das termed the RBI policy quite progressive and forward looking.

“Notwithstanding unchanged policy rates, introduction of Term Repo opens up ways to transmit the signal rate changes,” he said.

“Measures like DCCO extension for realty, MSME window expansion for restructuring and CRR exemption for incremental funding to key segments are growth oriented and promise to provide the much needed impetus to bank lending,” Mr. Das said.

According to Rajni Thakur, Economist, RBL Bank, MPC’s decision was on expected lines.

“The changes in development and regulatory policies however were a positive surprise and could potentially turn out to be a big support to the troubled sectors in the economy,” Thakur said.

Specific announcements in terms of CRR relief or long-term durable liquidity for banks push the overall credit availability in the financial system. Whether these steps manage to improve demand conditions is another question all together, she added.

The RBI has announced term repurchase agreements (repos) of one-year and three-year tenors of appropriate sizes for a total amount of Rs 1 lakh crore at the policy repo rate, from the fortnight beginning February 15.

“It is an effort to ensure better monetary policy transmission. It will enable banks to reduce their lending rates,” RBI Governor Das told reporters in the post policy conference.

Upasna Bhardwaj, Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank said very aptly, MPC has addressed the growth concerns through pushing transmission via tweaking the liquidity framework, providing long term liquidity operations and incentivising credit to select sectors.

“We expect these measures to aid transmission with the shorter end of the yield curve expected to rally meaningfully. These measures should help availability of funds at lower costs and aid sectors in stress,” Bhardwaj said.

ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar said: “The tone of the MPC’s statement was rather dovish, especially given the reiteration that policy space is available for future action.

“The accommodative stance will be maintained for as long as necessary to revive growth, in spite of the headline inflation having breached the upper threshold of the MPC’s medium term target.”

The RBI also raised upwards the retail inflation projection for last quarter of this fiscal to 6.5% citing high input cost for milk and pulses besides costlier crude oil prices amid rising geo-political tensions.

Mr. Nayar said the statement suggests the near certainty of at least one additional rate cut, even if its magnitude is modest, the timing of which will depend on how quickly inflation appears to be reverting towards 4%.

Umesh Revankar, MD and CEO - Shriram Transport Finance said the attention-grabbing aspect of the policy is marginal improvement in IIP, manufacturing index (PMI) and service index.

These numbers depict beginning of increasing activity though still under wait and watch radar to bring in any further excitement, he said.

“We believe that all the policy decisions along with pro-consumption budget corroborates that there would be better demand from the consumption side. Once that increases, automatically there will be better credit demand,” Revankar said.

The expansionary monetary policy stance was necessary and is an assurance that there will be no reversal of easing and that the RBI will not hike rates immediately, opined Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India.

Engineering Exports and Promotion Council (EEPC) Chairman Ravi Sehgal said RBI measures to provide one-time restructuring window for advances to MSMEs would help growth revival in the employment-oriented sectors.

MSMEs contribute significantly to the country’s exports.

“With global markets being subdued, exporters, particularly those in the SMEs are facing challenges. The RBI measures through loan restructuring and providing CRR incentives to the banks to lend to MSMEs would certainly help the exporting sector,” he said.

Ample liquidity with the banks should lead to lowering of interest rates as part of effective transmission of earlier reductions, he added.

Anarock Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said the extension for restructuring of project loans by a year is a major relief to the real estate sector.

It complements many of the previous initiatives by the government in 2019.

“Loans for projects that have been delayed for reasons beyond the control of their promoters have been extended by another one year without downgrading the asset classification. This is a big move and will bring the much-needed relief to the cash-starved real estate sector - and to both developers and HFCs from the liquidity perspective,” Puri said.

306,2020/02/06,Hike in deposit insurance won’t hit bank balance sheets: RBI,"Reserve Bank deputy governor B. P. Kanungo on Thursday said the five-fold hike in deposit insurance to ₹5 lakh will not have much impact on bank balance sheets.

Following the failure of a number of cooperative banks, with the city-based PMC Bank being the latest and the largest last year, the budget had permitted the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) to raise deposit insurance coverage to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh.

“The revision in deposit insurance will not impact banks’ balance sheets much,” Mr. Kanungo told reporters during the post policy conference.

The crisis at the Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank has brought to the fore the need to increase deposit insurance coverage.

The DICGC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, provides insurance cover on bank deposits.

At present, the DICGC provides ₹1 lakh insurance to a depositor regardless of the deposit amount, in case the lender fails or gets liquidated.

The corporation insured each bank depositor up to a maximum of ₹1 lakh for both principal and interest amount held by them as on the date of liquidation/cancellation of a bank’s licence or the date on which the scheme of amalgamation/merger comes into force.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qgzyg8/article30609458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/hike-in-deposit-insurance-wont-hit-bank-balance-sheets-rbi/article30749438.ece

309,2020/02/06,"Digital platforms providing freedom to storytellers, actors: Shah Rukh Khan","Free from the anxiety of delivering box office blockbusters, digital platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are providing freedom to storytellers and actors, especially youngsters, to depict the stories they want to a global audiences, according to actor and film producer Shah Rukh Khan.

“I think it’s giving opportunities...I always give this example that there was a time when only 11 players could make it to the cricket team in India. Now, with the IPL, 400 players can make it to good teams in India. It is giving opportunity to youngsters to make it to the top 11. So, I think Netflix and Amazon are really really doing that job of getting young talent...,” Mr. Khan, who is the brand ambassador for Hyundai, said at the sidelines of the launch of Creta at Auto Expo 2020.

Pointing that when someone releases a film, it is dependent on factors such as the box office and star value, making it difficult for newcomers to make a film and tell the story they want to. “With Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+, there is no restriction like that...Oh, if it doesn’t sell, then what? So you have a little more freedom to express or get innovative with youngsters… I think as a platform for new filmmakers, actors, actresses, writers...I think it’s quite a [good thing].”

While the actor himself is yet to sign something with any of the platforms, he said he would love to do so in the future. “I would 100%, but right now I have to get a normal film out. Otherwise I would have, but I will now finish a film, and maybe two years later.”

“Also some films can only be made with the help… like [Netflix’s] The Irishman. It’s expensive and it’s long. I don’t think Cinema can sometimes afford films. So maybe Netflix and Amazon can give opportunities for a film which I feel...also some films I want to make but won’t do well at the box office. There are important stories to tell.”

Asked about his favourite car, Mr. Khan said, “I can’t distinguish myself from a Santro. It is an emotional attachment to be part of the car that becomes one of the most famous cars in the country and it started along with me. Santro and my life kind of started together.” Talking about the role of brand ambassadors, Mr. Khan added that they had a limited role. “The brand ambassadors can’t do anything for a product, unless the car makers bring in something new.”

Replying to a question of whether moviemakers should be more careful when showing heroes without helmets or seat belts, Mr. Khan said, the right answer should be yes. “But I also feel that cinema is the flight of fantasy. When we are doing something, like a car stunt or a drive... in many cases I would wear the seat belt, and in the post production we remove the belt. Because sometimes we don’t want the character to have a belt.”

“Suppose I want to play a character that is careless then the discussion can go into oh you should not play a careless character... But I can assure you 90% of the time any shot done on motorcycles, scooters or cars, is either done by stuntmen or done with accessories for safety which are removed in post production. But I think we should not be very restrictive. We have lots of restrictions on films as it is.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/digital-platforms-providing-freedom-to-storytellers-actors-shah-rukh-khan/article30755218.ece
310,2020/02/06,Nippon India MF drags IRDAI to appellate tribunal,"Nippon India Mutual Fund has dragged the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging the insurance watchdog’s order that stated that the pledging of shares of Reliance General Insurance with the fund house was in violation of the law.

While the fund house has said that the pledge was created to safeguard the interests of its investors and unit holders without an intent of owning the shares of the insurance company, it has asked the tribunal to quash the order passed by IRDAI in December

It has further asked the tribunal to direct IRDAI to give it an opportunity of personal hearing as it feels that the ex-parte order is in violation of the principles of natural justice. The tribunal will hear the matter on February 11.

The matter dates back to March 2018, when Reliance Home Finance issued non-convertible debentures to raise about ₹400 crore. Nippon India MF was one of the subscribers.

The company, however, defaulted on its payment obligations, and Reliance Capital, the promoter of Reliance Home Finance, restructured the terms by providing additional collateral by pledging its 100% shareholding in Reliance General Insurance Company.

The company, however, again defaulted on its payment obligations and Nippon India MF invoked the pledge. IDBI Trusteeship, which was acting as the debenture trustee, took possession of the shares of Reliance General Insurance from the depository account of Reliance Capital.

Later, IRDAI declared this pledge ‘null and void ab initio’, which the fund house has challenged in the SAT.

“It is submitted that these orders, passed without any application of mind, ex-parte without hearing the appellants, and in such a hurried manner will have serious and market-wide ramifications affecting millions of small-scale retail investors,” stated the petition.

On January 4, The Hindu had reported that the spat between Nippon India MF and IRDAI is expected to be headed to SAT.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nippon-india-mf-drags-irdai-to-appellate-tribunal/article30755211.ece
311,2020/02/06,Indian companies in China brace for uncertainty amid outbreak,"Indian firms based in China are bracing for an uncertain month ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has brought factories and the services sector to a grinding halt.

Several company executives told The Hindu they expected the month of February — and perhaps the entire first quarter of this year — to be a write-off because of the outbreak, which has, as of February 6, infected more than 28,000 people and killed 560.

While there is little presence of Indian firms in the epicentre of Hubei province, a spreading lock-down reaching across China and limiting travel has constrained businesses, with current focus of the Chinese government on stopping the spread of the epidemic.

Most Indian companies in China are based in the south and east, in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces.

According to the Indian Consulate in Shanghai, Shanghai tops the total investment from India, and is home to IT majors, including TCS, Infosys and NIIT. Zhejiang and Jiangsu are home to manufacturing units, including Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Mahindra & Mahindra, Laxmi Machine Works, Tata Jaguar Land Rover and Sundram Fasteners.

Factory workers and employees remain largely cloistered in their home towns, where they had returned over the Lunar New Year, and face a 14-day quarantine if returning to work. Major trade fairs, including the Canton Fair scheduled for April, have been put on hold.

“Everything is at a standstill,” Madhav Sharma, who heads CII’s China office in Shanghai, told The Hindu. “Businesses are expecting to come back to work on February 10 as of now, but schools have been told to close until the end of February. While the spread of Indian companies is mainly in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and those that are into sourcing down south, their customer base is across China so business will be affected. We can, perhaps, only look at Q3 this year to get stabilised.”

Bright spot

One bright spot, he said, is that provincial authorities have been keeping foreign firms regularly up-to-date with the situation in their provinces, through English notifications sent through apps such as WeChat.

“We can see how they are using technology to deal with this, and to a large degree, people are closely following the guidelines, from wearing masks to maintaining hygiene, so there is a sense they are bringing this under control.”

Kamal Dhuper, who heads NIIT China that runs training centres and on-campus training facilities in several Chinese provinces including Guizhou, Shandong, Ningxia and Heilongjiang, said one immediate concern for companies was providing masks. Even major cities like Shanghai are facing a shortage, leaving unclear how employees will be able to come back to work on February 10.

“What most of us are doing is looking at ways to minimise risks, for instance by getting people to work from home when possible,” he said, adding that the timing over the new year was a mixed blessing since many people had already travelled back home and universities were closed.

The bigger concern is for start-ups in China that could start facing cash flow problems if the slowdown continued beyond February, said Sujit Chatterjee, co-founder of Shanghai-based IT firm Zeta-V and former head of TCS China.

Despite the concern, one long-time Indian businessman said the outbreak wasn’t as severe as SARS in 2003. “Then, for two months, people had no idea what was happening or how to deal with the outbreak unlike now,” noted Mehernosh Pastakia, who runs restaurants in Beijing. Restaurants, for instance, are still providing delivery services, although workers are being checked for their temperatures every day and food deliverers are required to write down their temperatures while making a delivery.

“Yes, the situation is bad now but not as catastrophic as people are making it out to be,” he said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/chkyuk/article30755186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THBUCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/indian-companies-in-china-brace-for-uncertainty-amid-outbreak/article30755187.ece

314,2020/02/06,"VW to focus on India, reduce exports and parts prices","Aiming to corner 3% of the passenger vehicle (PV) market in the country, Volkswagen (VW) India expects exports from its plant in Pune to come down by almost half to 30% by 2021 as part of its strategy to focus on demand in the domestic market.

Additionally, VW is also evaluating further rationalisation of spare part costs in India as it looks to shed the image of being a high-maintenance brand, Steffen Knapp, director, VW Passenger Cars India, told The Hindu.

The current capacity of the manufacturing plant is about 1.8 lakh cars annually, of which about 67% is exported to multiple markets such as South Africa and Malaysia. However, the biggest chunk of exports is to Mexico. Mr. Knapp said that while VW will continue to export under the India 2.0 project, however, the focus will be on the domestic market. “I think, in the end, we will go to 70% local, 30% exports by 2021. By then, it will be a complete shift. The focus will be on meeting the domestic demand.”

The VW Group had, in 2018, announced investments of €1 billion in India till 2021 under India 2.0 project, while giving Czech firm Skoda Auto the responsibility to take the lead to achieve a combined target of 5% market share by 2025.

VW earlier this week also announced it will be bringing in four SUVs in India in the next two years, including made-for-India Taigun.

Cutting cost

Mr. Knapp added the company had been historically perceived as a high price- maintenance brand. “But we have done a lot... we have aligned our prices in Q1 2018, by more than 15%. That was a hit to my profit but we had to do that. We also started... four-year warranty and roadside assistance... these actions reduced our total cost of ownership by 30%.” He said VW was discussing undertaking another price cut as far as parts are concerned to come out with “very competitive solutions for customers.”

“We're going now over the next step. In the end of Q2 we want again align our set-up so to come out with really very competitive solution... align means price cut.

A fast-moving electrical goods company, Havells entering the water purifiers business is the latest move of the company that in the last 10-15 years has looked beyond being a B2B entity. The first step in this direction was launch of fans and subsequently foraying into irons, small domestic appliances, water heaters, personal grooming products and water purifiers, he said.

“For us, water purification is a business of future,” he said, adding the company began with five products for the segment and in two years has 20 products. By May this year, it planned to add at least five more to address different kinds of consumer needs and water needs. Launch of IoT-enabled water purifiers, which will send out alerts regarding the machine, is also on the cards.

A release on the alkaline water purifiers that were launched said many RO purifiers process around 70% of inlet water while recovering only 30% of purified water. The water purifiers processes more than 50% of inlet water. Two variants ‘Delite Alkaline High Recovery’ and ‘Delite Alkaline’ were launched.

To queries, he said the revenue of the organised water purifier industry is ₹4,500 crore consisting of ₹1,500 crore service revenue and the rest from product sales. It is growing at 10% annually.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/havells-eyes-a-place-among-top-three-water-purifier-makers/article30753947.ece
317,2020/02/06,ArcelorMittal reports $1.9 bn net loss in Oct-Dec,"Global steel giant ArcelorMittal on Thursday reported a net loss of loss of $1.9 billion for the quarter ended December.

The world’s largest steel maker had posted a net income of $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, the company said in a statement.

The company reported a “net loss attributable to equity holders of the parent” of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter.

ArcelorMittal follows January to December fiscal year.

For the whole year (2019), the company reported a net loss of $2.5 billion as against net income of $5.1 billion in 2018.

Revenue in 2019 was at $70.6 billion as compared with $76 billion in the previous year. Its crude steel production stood at 89.8 million metric tonnes, while own iron ore production was at 57.1 million metric tonnes.

ArcelorMittal Chairman and CEO Lakshmi N Mittal said, “2019 was a very tough year, clearly reflected in our significantly reduced profitability. However, our cash generation remained strong helping to reduce net debt to the lowest ever level.”

“This demonstrates the contribution of our Action 2020 programme which was designed to ensure ArcelorMittal can be cash flow positive through all aspects of the steel cycle. We expect to make further deleveraging progress this year,” Mr. Mittal added.

Maintaining a strong balance sheet and reaching the net debt target is a clear priority for the company, he said.

With the acquisition of Essar Steel India in partnership with Nippon Steel, the company has secured a new opportunity for the group in the fast-growing Indian market, he said.

The asset is performing well and offers considerable brownfield potential aligned with the country’s ambition to triple crude steel production over the next ten years, he added.

“Although market conditions remain challenging, there are encouraging early signs of improvement particularly in our core markets of US, Europe and Brazil. With inventory levels having reached a very low level following a period of de-stocking, we are seeing customers return to the market, supporting an improved pricing environment,”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/arcelormittal-reports-19-bn-net-loss-in-oct-dec/article30750027.ece

320,2020/02/06,LIC IPO will certainly happen next year: Economic Affairs secretary,"Some “mischievous” people are terming the proposed listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) “privatisation”, said Atanu Chakraborty, secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs.

He said the Centre needed to work to frame the narrative before the initial public offer (IPO), which it hoped to complete during the next fiscal year.

He was speaking at a post-Budget interaction with industry leaders organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry on Wednesday. “LIC will certainly happen next year,” he said in response to a query about timelines for the partial disinvestment announced in the Union Budget speech last week. “It takes about eight to nine months of preparations for its accounts and what kind of legal tweakings that need to be done.”

The Centre has indicated that it may need to push through an amendment in the LIC Act, 1956 before the stake sale. Currently, the government owns 100% of LIC, the country’s largest insurer. Opposition parties have objected to the divestment plan, while LIC’s employee unions have claimed that it would be “against national interest.”

LIC stock market listing: Government yet to take call on quantum of stake sale

“This is certainly a very high value item... Some amount of narrative in the public space would need to be done because some people have, can I use the word mischievous, have put it as a privatisation of LIC,” said Mr. Chakraborty.

He noted that it was time for citizens to be able to get a “richly deserved share” in the company’s wealth if they chose to invest in it, adding that the IPO would bring more discipline to the company and bring much-needed depth to the market.

“I hope we should be able to finish it by March 31, 2021. Money of course will come through, that’s less of an issue.

321,2020/02/06,"Electric vehicles, new SUVs energise Auto Expo 2020","Electric vehicles and new models of conventional SUVs are in the spotlight at this year’s Auto Expo, being held here under the shadow of a prolonged demand showdown that has hit the industry.

Billboards greeting car buffs and industry professionals to the various pavilions feature the gleaming new motors, making it clear that these are the machines the big marques are placing their bets on. Industry data point to electric becoming the new buzzword, and SUVs, the major vehicle segment in top gear when it comes to sales.

The biggest biennial automotive extravaganza is evidently feeling the ripple effects of the demand slowdown, with the majority of two-wheeler makers and many car makers skipping the event. These include market leader Hero MotoCorp, Honda Motorcycles, TVS Motors, Royal Enfield, BMW, Audi, Toyota Kirloskar Motors, Honda Cars, Ford and Fiat.

There is a minority of two-wheelers on display, including some from Suzuki.

The mood is also dampened by the global coronavirus outbreak, with the top leadership of all Chinese participants staying away. Industry executives believe that this is likely to adversely affect the attendance at Auto Expo 2020, which will open for the public from February 7, until February 12. As the show got ready to open its doors, delegates wearing masks were a common feature on Wednesday.

The event was kick-started by the country’s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki, globally premiering its Futuro-e concept — an electric SUV with nuances of a coupe and flexible swivel travel seats. Kenichi Ayukawa, the company’s managing director, said the new decade will be marked by new trends in the automobile sector, with customers seeking unique, futuristic and environment-friendly mobility solutions.

French automaker Renault unveiled the AMT version of its SUV Triber, while South Korean manufacturer Hyundai Motor presented the 2020 Tucson.

EV concept car

Tata Motors is showing off a mix of SUVs and electrics, led by the latest version of its Harrier, along with an array of other SUVs, including Hexa Safari edition, Gravitas and a near-production version of HBX Show. It also took the covers off the Sierra EV Concept, drawing a lot of eyeballs.

Taking aim at the affordable segment under the EV banner, Mahindra and Mahindra unveiled its eXUV 100 hatchback with a price tag of ₹8.25 lakh.

The company is betting big on electric mobility with two more of its electric vehicles — the Atom, a small urban shared mobility option for last-mile connectivity, and e-XUV300, with a commercial launch of both products promised in the next financial year. The show-stopper at the Mahindra and Mahindra corner was a new concept EV named Funster, which features a convertible mode.

Kia Motors, a relatively new entrant, adds to its heft with a multi-purpose vehicle, the Carnival, with a sticker price of ₹24.95 lakh to rival similar large MUVs from other automakers. A gold coloured Kia Sonet concept made a global debut as a compact SUV, to be developed ahead of a launch in the Indian market in the second half of 2020.

Volkswagen has already announced plans to launch four SUVs in India in the next two years, and on Wednesday commenced pre-booking for two up-coming SUVs which it plans to launch in the first half of the year.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/glc6a4/article30746393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THRDNARANGCAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/electric-vehicles-new-suvs-energise-auto-expo-2020/article30746394.ece

In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review of 2019-20, the central bank also kept the GDP growth rate estimate unchanged for the current fiscal at 5% and projected a pick up in growth to 6% in the next financial year.

The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 163.37 points, or 0.40 per cent, higher at 41,306.03. It hit an intra-day high of 41,405.43.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 48.80 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 12,137.95.

IndusInd Bank was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying over 4 per cent, followed by SBI, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC and PowerGrid.

325,2020/02/06,Sebi issues performance benchmarking guidelines for AIFs,"Markets watchdog Sebi on Thursday came out with guidelines for compulsory performance benchmarking for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) as part of efforts to streamline disclosure standards.

A template for Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) in the case of these funds, which have been classified into three categories, has also been issued.

The PPM would have two parts -- a section for minimum disclosures and a supplementary section to provide any additional information.

In a circular, the regulator said it has been decided to introduce the template for PPM, subject to certain exemptions, as well as put in place mandatory performance benchmarking for AIFs. Besides, there are provisions for additional customised performance reporting requirements.

Sebi has also given operational guidelines for mandatory performance benchmarking of AIFs, including venture capital funds and the AIF industry.

The performance benchmarking guidelines “shall not apply to Angel Funds registered under sub-category of Venture Capital Fund under Category I-AIF,” the circular said.

AIFs would have to carry out an annual audit of compliance with PPM terms. It can be done by either an internal or external auditor or a legal professional.

Sections in the PPM pertaining to risk factors, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, among others, would be optional when it comes to audit.

“Performance Benchmarking shall be done on a half-yearly basis based on the data as on September 30 and March 31 of each year,” the regulator said.

The findings of the audit, along with corrective steps, if any, should be communicated to the trustee of board or designated partners of the AIF, board of the manager and Sebi.

These requirements would be effective from March 1.

Angel funds as well as AIFs or schemes in which each investor commits a minimum capital contribution of Rs 70 crore or USD 10 million would be exempted from complying with the requirement of PPM as well as audit.

Any association of AIFs that represents at least 51 per cent of the number of such funds, have to notify one or more benchmarking agencies, with whom each AIF needs to enter into an agreement for carrying out the benchmarking process.

AIFs, for all their schemes which have completed at least one year from the date of “first close”, should report all the necessary information, including scheme-wise valuation and cash flow data, to the benchmarking agencies in a timely manner.

“If an applicant claims a track-record on the basis of India performance of funds incorporated overseas, it shall also provide the data of the investments of the said funds in Indian companies to the benchmarking agencies, when they seek registration as an AIF,” Sebi said.

In any marketing or promotional material as well as PPM, where past performance of the AIF is mentioned, the performance versus benchmark report provided by the benchmarking agencies should be provided, as per the circular.

“As a first step, association will appoint benchmarking agencies and thereafter will set timeline for reporting of requisite data to benchmarking agencies by all the registered AIFs.

“In this regard, association and benchmarking agencies will ensure that the first industry benchmark and AIF level performance versus benchmark reports are available latest by July 1, 2020, for the performance up to September 30, 2019,” Sebi said.

On a monthly basis, an association has to submit a progress report in this regard to Sebi till the creation of the first industry benchmark.

In December, the regulator proposed introduction of minimum benchmarks for disclosure of performance history of AIFs and standardisation of draft document issued to investors by them.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/t0847a/article30655876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bmarr-orderAG8P71BTK23jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sebi-issues-performance-benchmarking-guidelines-for-aifs/article30751381.ece

328,2020/02/06,"A time for solidarity, not stigma","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) a public health emergency of international concern — the sixth time since this alert mechanism was introduced after the SARS epidemic. That said, we need to be measured in our response. It is not a vote of no confidence in China’s capacity to control the spread, but an acknowledgement that countries with weaker health systems may be ill-prepared for this outbreak, says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

The international repercussions are expanding fast. India is joining the U.S. in evacuating its nationals from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Air India, British Airways, and Lufthansa have suspended flights to and from mainland China. As of February 4, according to the WHO, nine countries have recorded 27 cases of human-to-human transmissions.

Rumours, fear and racism

The impact is being felt deepest in China itself. Anecdotal evidence is emerging of Wuhan families being “rejected and even hunted”. In rural areas surrounding Hubei province where Wuhan is located, vigilantes, some of them armed, are stopping ‘outsiders’ from entering their villages. In some cases, they are going door to door looking for suspected cases, and daubing homes with language that will encourage stigma.

Infections have spread through China to every province, municipality, and autonomous region. The number of confirmed cases on the mainland exceeds the global total in the 2003 SARS epidemic. For different reasons, SARS, a different coronavirus of zoonotic origin that was also traced to China, is a public benchmark by which the scale and severity of the Wuhan outbreak is being measured in the media. But convenient side-by-side comparisons are not always accurate, nor are they safe.

I experienced this as a journalist, when during SARS I saw first-hand how rumour and misinformation replaced evidence and honesty. It triggered panic and dismantled the response effort led by health workers and health authorities. This is what I fear again for the Wuhan outbreak — compounded in a digital age, where the tools we have to communicate are greater and more immediate.

Videos on social media show chaotic and distressing scenes at hospitals, patients apparently collapsed on floors, and agitated people shouting for treatment. Some of these people may be ill, but others may be drawn in by public anxiety, overwhelming exhausted health workers and putting themselves and the people around them at risk.

We can’t assume that these videos are related to the Wuhan outbreak. Many of them are posted without a date, location or source. One journalist admitted on Twitter that the footage she shared was “unverified”, a disclaimer which doesn’t prevent it from being re-uploaded as fact. Other videos showing alleged consumption of exotic wildlife have also been widely posted, suggesting a link to some reports that the novel coronavirus may have originated at an unregulated food market in Wuhan. A viral video of a woman appearing to eat bat soup in China was debunked by an article published in Foreign Policy (the woman was identified as the host of an adventurist-style travel show and the video was filmed in a different country). Words like “dirty”, “diseased”, and “virus infected” are being used to describe Chinese people. I am deeply concerned, not only because I am of ethnic Chinese descent myself, but because it evokes the painful stigma and discrimination that continues to attack people living with HIV. It is shaming and humiliating, barring them from accessing treatment, and in the case of the AIDS epidemic, contributing to significant loss of lives. This is not confined to one group — we are all interchangeable as the targets of bullies.

But there is an opportunity to turn this around. Twitter now provides a pop-up message in regions like Hong Kong and countries including Australia, which when you search for ‘coronavirus’ invites you to “know the facts” and opt for verified information provided by local sources and the WHO. The commitment to engage in accurate and meaningful information surely must be driven by everyone. As consumers of content, we can shape our knowledge by investing in health stories that go beyond the miracle cure or the current outbreak. Will Wuhan become ‘yesterday’s news’, like Ebola and the Australian bushfires before it?

The reality is that Wuhan is about the hundreds who have died, the thousands who have been infected, and the millions who continue to be impacted. It is also about the families who live in lockdown, who fear the unknown, and the health workers who risk their lives by moving to the frontlines of this outbreak. But there is reason for hope: this week, China admitted patients to two new emergency hospitals built and equipped in around 10 days. Together, they can accommodate at least 2,600 beds. Many more beds are to be made available in the sports halls and conference centres currently being converted for temporary medical use. This means Wuhan can better handle the current outbreak, and be properly prepared should it worsen.

Funding public health systems

I will finish with a memory from last September. As heads of state and government gathered at the UN General Assembly in New York, I moderated a small gathering of eminent leaders including Dr. Tedros. Together, they spoke in support of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body that tracks progress in anticipating the next health emergency, and identifies gaps in reaching that critical point.

They warned us that the world is extremely vulnerable to disease epidemics and pandemics that will not only cause loss of human life, but will destruct our economies and create social chaos. It is not a question of “if” but “when”. What unites their recommendations is a serious commitment to ensure that public health systems are adequately funded. This would ensure that we don’t react to each new outbreak as it happens, but strengthen and support systems even in the absence of epidemics or pandemics.

The Board will no doubt agree that the outbreak in Wuhan is a timely reminder that many of its recommendations must be urgently taken up at the highest levels: commitment and investment by heads of government, strengthening of coordination mechanisms by the UN, increase in funding for preparedness by development partners, and linking preparedness with economic risk planning by major financial institutions. Wuhan is also a reminder that we need vaccines and that vaccines work.

It is more important now than ever to remain calm, and allow our health workers and authorities to do exactly what they are trained to do at this time. As Dr. Tedros said: “This is a time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumours. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.”

329,2020/02/06,A litmus test for AAP,"The Delhi Assembly election will determine not only which party will govern Delhi, but also the Aam Aadmi Party’s future. Will the AAP survive as a Delhi-based party or renew its ambition to emerge as a national party?

A party like any other?

Born in 2012 out of a high profile anti-corruption movement, the AAP captured the political imagination of people of all ideological shades. But between 2013 and 2020, the party has deviated from many of its founding principles. Some would argue that it is becoming like any other political party. This is apparent, for instance, in the AAP’s list of 70 candidates for this Assembly election, which includes turncoats and tainted candidates.

The end of dynasty politics was a lofty ideal that the AAP said it stood for. It is worth recalling that after making an impressive debut in 2013 in Delhi, it was the AAP’s Manish Sisodia who said at the victory rally in Jantar Mantar that party member Kumar Vishwas could contest the Lok Sabha election against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Though Mr. Vishwas launched the anti-Gandhi campaign in Amethi in 2014, it was the BJP’s Smriti Irani who defeated Mr. Gandhi in the 2019 general election. By 2019, neither Mr. Vishwas nor the AAP was seen anywhere in Amethi.

In post-Mandal India, Arvind Kejriwal emerged as the poster boy of political protests. But now, when students, women and other citizens are taking to the streets of Delhi in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the proposed National Register of Citizens and the attacks on universities, Mr. Kejriwal is nowhere to be seen in protest sites. His muted solidarity is shown only in a few tweets and statements.

With many of the AAP’s founding members such as Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan no longer a part of the party, internal democracy, another ideal, seems to have changed. For all practical purposes, the party is now controlled by Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia, similar to how the BJP is controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. This development is worrying as the absence of internal democracy paves the way not only for a coterie who could tighten their control over the party, its agenda and resources, but also for dynasty politics.

Despite these shortcomings, however, the AAP can claim to have done some good in Delhi, especially by improving school education and providing inexpensive electricity. While it may not be able to repeat its 2015 election performance, trends suggest that AAP is not affected by anti-incumbency. This makes it a potential contender for power. But this is easier said than done in a three-cornered contest, especially since the BJP won all the seven parliamentary seats in the 2019 general election.

Also, by announcing its list of candidates ahead of other parties, the AAP showed greater preparedness compared to the other parties. Both the Congress, which continues to be a house in disarray, and the BJP do not have leaders at the State level who can match Mr. Kejriwal’s stature.

Challenges ahead

But the AAP cannot take anything for granted. The BJP is using its ultimate weapon, Mr. Modi, to secure votes and playing its politics of polarisation ruthlessly. Delhi has been the bastion of the Hindu Right since the early days of the Republic. It was the Bharatiya Jana Sangh that kept alive the flames of the Hindu Right. L.K. Advani made his career in Delhi and reshaped the BJP in the late 1980s nationally. Therefore, issues such as the CAA could resonate with many of its traditional voters who may have voted for AAP in 2015.

The AAP may also be losing some voters from the Muslim community. The Congress faces an enormous challenge in revival after the demise of former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, but looking at an analysis of vote distribution in the 2019 election, there are signs of Muslims voters returning to its fold. The Shaheen Bagh protests presented a golden opportunity for Mr. Kejriwal to cement the AAP’s connection with Muslim voters, many of whom have looked up to him ever since he took on Mr. Modi in Varanasi in 2014. But by refusing to seize this opportunity, the AAP has in some ways closed its doors to the possibility of national expansion. Its ambivalence towards secular causes is similar to the Congress’s ambivalence, and may create more space for the BJP to expand.

In 2014-2015, the AAP appeared to be emerging as a national party, but internal power struggles and the exit of prominent leaders downgraded it to a Delhi-based party. Even if it returns to power now, the AAP is unlikely to re-ignite its national dream. But if it fails to win this Assembly election, and if it loses to the BJP, the AAP might face severe challenges in survival.

330,2020/02/06,The public school possibility,"In a passage in the biography of C. Rajagopalachari by Rajmohan Gandhi, as the end of colonial rule approaches, the civil servant B.K. Nehru proposes to the veteran freedom fighter that the government of independent India set up quality schools for talented children. And the latter replies: “You want young man a new Brahmanism. This country will not take it. It wants equality, not excellence.” What was being expressed was very likely a view held by the emerging governing class, that nurturing talent is a form of elitism. In fact, the reverse could turn out to be true for, as depicted in the life of Ekalavya, nature does not favour the rich and the powerful when it comes to distributing talent. Innocent of this, a public policy obsessed with avoiding differentiation has avoided excellence in schooling. This has hurt the historically disadvantaged of this country.

Not an elitist aspiration

There is nothing that points to the inevitability of inequality when aiming at excellence in our schools. In fact, quite to the contrary, excellent public schools, which are accessible to all, can ensure that historic inequalities are levelled-off to a large extent.

Schooling is the formative stage in the life of an individual with respect to development of capabilities, gaining awareness of rights and responsibilities and moulding attitudes that matter in civic engagement. If India desires to be a successful democracy it is necessary to invest in a schooling that takes every child to the highest level in these three areas. School children must be imbued with the spirit of wanting to excel in everything they will do in the future, from their careers to their performance as citizens.

The idea that pursuing excellence in education reflects an elitist aspiration is not a view shared by the poor. Poor parents work exceptionally hard to send their children to fee-paying private schools so that they stand a better chance in life. Surveys by the educational foundation Pratham show learning outcomes in these schools to be barely ahead of those in government ones. Yet, the poor must work that much harder and tighten their belts that much more to afford them, for they consider even this slight advantage as helpful to their children.

With the times: A smart classroom at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya government school in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi. The Delhi government has been giving schools and education a much-needed makeover, including introducing modern seating modules, smart blackboards and other technology aids to make learning fun. Looking up: The stars on the ground at Rajkiya Sarvodaya Bal Kanya Vidyalaya in West Vinod Nagar. Sea of faces: Assembly held under a new roof at the West Vinod Nagar school. At play: Students in the junior section of Rajkiya Sarvodaya Bal Kanya Vidyalaya also have a well-stocked recreation room now. Right notes: Students rehearse for the zonal folk song competition at Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya. Lapping it up: The swimming pool in Rajkiya Sarvodaya Bal Kanya Vidyalaya is the first in any government school in New Delhi. Problem solved: Students at the renovated, newly designed corridor in Rajkiya Sarvodaya Bal Kanya Vidyalaya.

Encouraging signs

In one part of this country, however, the wait for an improved public school system may be beginning to come to an end. Along with an emphasis on primary health care the government of Delhi has, by all accounts, initiated the transformation of its schools. Only a detailed study can establish how far it has progressed and how deep are its roots but the signs yet seen are encouraging. First, the physical infrastructure has improved. The chosen schools have classrooms with good furniture and are smart, not only in terms of their appearance, but also in terms of IT-enabled teaching aids. There are clean playgrounds and functioning toilets, the absence of which has long meant a declining school attendance by girls across the country. Selected teachers have been given training overseas. Interviews reveal that they feel supported in their tasks by the government, which is perhaps more important for efficacy than funds. Most important, some of the government schools have recorded better Board exam results than private ones, triggering a once unimaginable reverse migration! However, innovation has gone beyond what it takes to achieve superior exam performance, important as it is. There is also an effort to spur cognitive development, essential for a child to make sense of the world. This marks a shift from the emphasis on memorising content, for long the bane of schooling in India.

It is too early to make resounding claims about the success of the schools programme of the Aam Aadmi Party. But it has demonstrated that it is possible to combine excellence with equity in India’s schools, the site where achieving excellence will yield the highest pay-off for its society.

331,2020/02/06,Course correction for the Speaker’s office,"Recently, the Supreme Court of India while adjudicating upon the matter relating to the disqualification of MLAs in the Manipur Legislative Assembly under the Tenth Schedule in Keisham Meghachandra Singh vs. the Hon’ble Speaker Manipur Legislative Assembly & Ors. made a significant suggestion. It recommended that Parliament should rethink as to whether disqualification petitions ought to be entrusted to a Speaker as a quasi-judicial authority when such a Speaker continues to belong to a particular political party either de jure or de facto.

It was of the opinion that Parliament may seriously consider a Constitutional amendment to substitute the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies with a ‘permanent Tribunal headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court, or some other outside independent mechanism. This is to ensure that such disputes are decided both swiftly and impartially, thus giving teeth to the provisions contained in the Tenth Schedule, which are so vital in the proper functioning of India’s democracy’, according to a media report. More than such advice, what is interesting is the underlying reasoning which revolves around the nature of functions exercised by the Speaker.

Range of functions; a symbol

The nature of duties of the Speaker, technically as an “arbiter” or a “quasi-judicial body” should not be limited exclusively to matters under the Tenth Schedule; rather, it extends to a range of its functions. While facilitating the business of the House and to maintain decorum in the House, the Speaker has ‘extensive functions to perform in matters regulatory, administrative and judicial, falling under her domain. She enjoys vast authority under the Constitution and the Rules, as well as inherently’.

She is the ‘ultimate interpreter and arbiter of those provisions which relate to the functioning of the House. Her decisions are final and binding and ordinarily cannot be easily challenged. She decides the duration of debates, can discipline members and even override decisions by committees. She represents the collective voice of the House and is the sole representative of the House in the international arena’.

Jawaharlal Nehru, one of the chief architects of India’s freedom and a moving force behind its Constitution, describes the position as: “The Speaker represents the House. She represents the dignity of the House, the freedom of the House and because the House represents the nation, in a particular way, the Speaker becomes a symbol of the nation’s freedom and liberty. Therefore, that should be an honoured position, a free position and should be occupied always by persons of outstanding ability and impartiality.”

Alleged bias

However, on several occasions, the Speaker’s role has been questioned on the allegation of bias. The office has been criticised for being an agent of pernicious partisan politics. Notably, the Supreme Court has observed in Jagjit Singh versus State of Haryana as “…Without meaning any disrespect for any particular Speaker in the country, but only going by some events of the recent past, certain questions have been raised about the confidence in the matter of impartiality on some issues having political overtones which are decided by the Speaker in his capacity as a Tribunal.” The reasons behind the counterproductive machinations of the Speaker are not too far to seek. As a minority view, Justice J.S. Verma in Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu And Others observed: “The Speaker being an authority within the House and his tenure being dependent on the will of the majority therein, likelihood of suspicion of bias could not be ruled out.” Currently, the extent of the Speaker’s political commitment often depends on the personality and character of the person holding the office. Howsoever desirable the proposition of neutrality may be, in the present circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect a Speaker to completely abjure all party considerations while functioning as there are structural issues regarding the manner of appointment of the Speaker and her tenure in office.

Since the electoral system and conventions in India have ‘not developed to ensure protection to the office, there are cogent reasons for Speakers to retain party membership. A member is appointed to the office of the Speaker if a motion nominating her is carried in the House. Elections are not always by consensus and there have been cases when different parties have fielded their own candidates. All political parties campaign in the constituency of the Speaker. Even if the Speaker is re-elected to the House, the office of the Speaker in India is still open for elections’, according to a paper published by The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy. Therefore, what is required is not merely incidental changes in the powers of the Speaker; rather a major revamp in the structure of the office itself is necessary. It is suggested that a scheme should be brought wherein Speakers should renounce all political affiliations, membership and activity once they have been elected, both within the Assembly and in the country as a whole.

Upholding neutrality

Reference can be sought from the United Kingdom where the ‘main characteristic of the Speaker of the House of Commons is neutrality. In practice, once elected, the Speaker gives up all-partisan affiliation, as in other Parliaments of British tradition, but remains in office until retirement, even though the majority may change. She does not express any political views during debates and is an election candidate without any ticket’, says an IPU report. Impartiality, fairness and autonomy in decision-making are the hallmarks of a robust institution. It is the freedom from interference and pressures which provide the necessary atmosphere where one can work with absolute commitment to the cause of neutrality as a constitutional value.

At a time when India’s fall in ranks in the latest Democracy Index has evoked concern, it is expected that Parliament will pay heed to the reasoning of the Supreme Court and take steps to strengthen the institution of the Speaker.

332,2020/02/06,Waiting for the winner: On Ireland polls,"Ireland’s general elections on Saturday have thrown up many paradoxes, offering few clues about the next government, or the future of the country’s three largest parties. Fianna Fáil, which has been out of power since 2011, has topped the tally. However, its 38 seats leaves it far short of the requisite 80 for a clear majority in the 160-strong Irish Parliament. Sinn Féin, the country’s Republican party has, perhaps with good reason, proclaimed itself the real winner: 37 seats, up 14 over the 2016 polls, and its best result. Yet, such a performance does not guarantee the party, with past links to the IRA, an automatic path to government in the current electoral arithmetic, notwithstanding the protestations of its leader, Mary Lou McDonald. The obverse is the position of the governing centre-right Fine Gael of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, now relegated to third place with 35 seats, down 15 from the previous election. To be sure, Mr. Varadkar earned international recognition for steering Dublin’s negotiations with London to protect the soft border with Belfast, and in turn the peace on either side of the island’s political divide. The country is also forecast to emerge among the fastest growing economies in the European Union in 2020. But this putative achievement may only have brought into sharp focus voter disenchantment with Fine Gael’s domestic record.

Ireland has experienced severe shortfalls in affordable housing and health-care delivery, potentially rendering the party’s return to government politically more delicate. All the same, it would be premature to rule it out of contention for power in any coalition. Sinn Féin is said to have benefited from the prevailing discontent. In the run-up to the polls on Saturday, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had ruled out an alliance with the left-wing Sinn Féin. But Micheál Martin, Fianna Fáil leader, has not dismissed working with Ms. McDonald even while emphasising differences over taxation policy and her party’s IRA past. She is believed to have sent out feelers to Labour, the Greens and independents to explore forming a coalition. Sinn Féin has in any case already set out its priorities, to work for the country’s unification with Northern Ireland. This stance will boost nationalist sentiment across the border, where Sinn Féin has consistently opposed Brexit. Under Britain’s EU withdrawal deal, Belfast is de facto member of the bloc’s single market. Sinn Féin’s participation in a new government would almost inevitably alter Ireland’s political configuration. But going by the 70-day stalemate in 2016, negotiations among the main parties could prove protracted. As deliberations commence, the traditional two parties must note that it is a democratic imperative now to engage Sinn Féin with an open mind.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/waiting-for-the-winner-the-hindu-editorial-on-ireland-polls/article30803726.ece
333,2020/02/06,Polarised state of union: On U.S. politics riven by partisan hostility,"The politics of the United States has rarely, if ever, been as contentious, and riven by partisan hostility, as it is at the present juncture. U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address exemplified the multiple fractures in the consciousness of the American collective psyche in this regard. His speech before both Houses of the U.S. Congress, minus some Democrat lawmakers who boycotted it, went on for more than an hour, yet there was no mention of arguably the most intensely polarising issue on Capitol Hill: impeachment. On the day before his likely acquittal by the Republican-majority Senate, the President showed restraint — possibly holding out for a victory lap after being cleared by the Upper House. This contrasted with his periodic Twitter outbursts attacking the impeachment process. However, there could be little doubt about how frosty cross-party relations are — he appeared to snub House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s attempt to shake his hand before the speech, and Ms. Pelosi ripped up a copy of the speech after it had ended, saying later that it was a “manifesto of mistruths”. Nevertheless, substantively, Mr. Trump’s annual address focused on claiming credit for a “great American comeback” on the back of a healthy economy — including historically low levels of unemployment, rising median income and unprecedented cuts in “job-killing” regulations — even though the economic recovery after the 2008 downturn began under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

However, that all is not well with the state of the American union is evident from the tenor of the ongoing Democratic nomination race. Democrats of several hues, from the more centrist, including former Vice-President Joe Biden, to the more leftist, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have focused their political attacks on Mr. Trump and less so on internal differences within their camp. Presently, the Iowa caucus, the first of a season of caucuses and primaries that will decide the ultimate nominee to take on Mr. Trump in the November 2020 election, has given Democrats renewed purpose. Yet the microcosm of the Democratic campaign process mirrors their biggest handicap on the national stage — too many aspirants jockeying for power and visibility, leading inevitably to fragmentation of their overall prospects against Mr. Trump’s incumbency advantage. Unless they quickly rally behind one tall leader — if such a person exists in their midst — they stand a slim chance of mounting a serious challenge to the 45th President. Yet, given the vastly divergent views across party lines on core issues such as the economy and climate change, there could not be more at stake for Democrats, and indeed those who, despite residing beyond America’s shores, are weary of trade wars and the relentless undermining of multilateralism.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/polarised-state-of-union-the-hindu-editorial-on-us-politics-riven-by-partisan-hostility/article30745286.ece
334,2020/02/06,Purifying water: On draft notification on RO systems,"The Environment Ministry’s draft notification to regulate the use of membrane-based water purification systems primarily concerns the manufacturers of reverse osmosis (RO) water filters but effectively bars domestic users from installing RO systems. The notification is the culmination of a legal dispute before the National Green Tribunal, which had banned RO water filter use in Delhi as the purification process wastes water. The association of water filter manufacturers challenged this order and the litigation led to this pan-India notification, where the intent is to conserve water and cut waste. In RO, the total dissolved solids (TDS) in water — which covers trace chemicals, certain viruses, bacteria and salts — can be reduced, to meet potable water standards. Home filters waste nearly 80% of the water during treatment. Second, some research has shown that the process can cut the levels of calcium and magnesium, which are vital nutrients. The resort to prohibition (to restrict home filters) may cause consumer apprehension but it is unlikely that they will be taken to task for using such water filters. For one, the notification implies, these filters are only prohibited if the home gets water supply that conforms to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for Drinking Water. Although several State and city water boards claim BIS standards, the water at homes falls short of the test parameters.

The BIS, last year, ranked several cities on official water supply quality. Delhi was last and only Mumbai met all the standards. In the 28 test parameters, Delhi failed 19, Chennai 9, and Kolkata 10. The BIS norms are voluntary for public agencies which supply piped water but are mandatory for bottled water producers. Moreover, most of the country does not have the luxury of piped water. The Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) of NITI Aayog says that 70% of water supply is contaminated. India is ranked 120th among 122 countries in an NGO, WaterAid’s quality index. The case for restricting people’s choices on the means they employ to ensure potable water is thus weak. The notification mainly deals with rules for commercial suppliers and for integration of systems that inform consumers about TDS levels — a major determinant of water quality. This is envisaged both before water enters filtration systems and after it has been filtered. The aim is also to ensure that after 2022, no more than 25% of water being treated is wasted, and for residential complexes to reuse the residual waste water for other activities, including gardening. When implemented, the notification’s primary aim should be to persuade authorities to upgrade and supply BIS-standard water at the consumer’s end. This should be done without additional costs, particularly on millions who now lack access to protected supply.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/purifying-water-the-hindu-editorial-on-draft-notification-on-ro-systems/article30745293.ece

336,2020/02/06,Building tilt in Kempapura: Residents worry about identity proof,"Many residents at G. Ramaiah Layout in Kempapura who were evacuated, after a building in the area started to tilt, are worried about the documents and identity proofs that they left behind.

Over a hundred people living in surrounding buildings have also vacated their houses as the setback areas between structures are practically non-existent.

Mamtha Devi, who hails from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, had leased a home in the tilted building. She is now worried that they do not have all their government documents in their possession.

“I do not know for how many days we will have to wait before we will be allowed to collect our documents, but we have lost all our belongings. Demolitions have begun and we are not being allowed to collect our things,” she said, worried that she may have to start afresh. “The future seems bleak and it is extremely stressful, both financially and mentally,” she added.

Bharath Kumar, who lives in the tilted building, was lucky as he was allowed to collect his documents, laptops, and wallet. “I lived on the third floor. Officials have said that it was highly unlikely that we will get the rest,” he said.

To avoid mishaps, the authorities have identified 50 metres around the tilted building as a ‘danger zone’ and nobody will be allowed inside premises. “The whole process might take around 15 days,” officials on the spot said.

Shabana Asma, who has four children and lives in the building opposite the one that tilted, spent the night at a basement in a housing complex nearby. “I have been staying here since yesterday. Though I am from the neighbouring building, I have not been able to collect my belongings,” said Ms. Asma, who works as a housemaid. “Over 30 houses have been evacuated, and we won’t be able to go back for at least 15 days, I doubt I will get paid this month,” she said.

A few residents have been provided temporary accommodation by the civic body at a relief camp at a BBMP school in Amruthahalli while others are staying with relatives and friends.

The building started to tilt on Wednesday morning when the adjacent vacant site was being excavated for the construction of a basement.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), on Thursday, started the demolition of the tilted structure.

“The BBMP, Disaster Management Cell and the Fire Department officials will be on the spot and oversee the operation and provide all the necessary support to the contractors and residents,” said a civic official.

However, Fire and Emergency Services personnel admit that it will not be easy as the building has tilted at an angle.

“All the surrounding buildings have more than three floors and there is no space between them at all. The edge of the titled building is abutting a building behind it. That is a problem,” the official said.

Pradeep K.K., Emergency Coordinator, Disaster Management Cell, Bengaluru, said that the demolition was being done from the top.

“We are testing the stability of the building and hence the fourth floor is being demolished with an electrical cutter. Heavy vehicles and machines will not be used on the fourth floor,” he said and added that they would make sure that minimum damage is caused to neighbouring buildings.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ug2ihj/article30758956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGTILTBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/building-tilt-residents-worry-about-identity-proof/article30754283.ece
337,2020/02/06,"In Bengaluru, eating out to get costlier","The Bruhat Bangalore Hotels’ Association has announced that their member hotels, which include at least 2,000 small, medium and fine-dining hotels, will hike the prices of items across the board.

P.C. Rao, president of the association, told The Hindu that the price hike will be between ₹2 to ₹5 per item and that it was “inevitable” given the rise in rates of essential commodities.

“The eating out culture in Bengaluru is growing. Bachelors, working couples, and even senior citizens are dependent on hotels, and that is why more hotels have come up as well. But it is becoming difficult to survive amidst the rising prices of milk, vegetables, gas, electricity and rent, without increasing the prices of items sold,” Mr. Rao said.

He said while some hotels have already implemented the new rates, others will follow suit. “Prices of all items have to be increased. It has been at least four years since they were increased. We were trying not to burden the customers, and were bearing the extra cost. But now, to survive we will have to do this,” he added.

The decision to increase prices was a unanimous one, association members said, adding that closing hotels was not an option owing to the large number of employees.

Small hotels are expected to increase rates first, followed by the medium, and the fine-dining ones. The new prices of items on online food delivery portals will reflect immediately or subsequently, they said.

There are reportedly around 18,000 hotels in the city, including star hotels and bars and restaurants.

Hotels across the State will also follow suit. Karnataka Pradesh Hotels and Restaurants’ Association president Chandrashekar Hebbar said its 5,000 members will also be hiking prices as the price rise of essentials, such as milk, ghee and curd (KMF hiked prices recently), refined oil and gas, were across the State.

“So coffee which was being served for ₹10 may cost ₹12 now. Our rates are lower compared to our neighbouring States and it has been nearly a decade since since we hiked rates. Even street vendors are selling at higher rates. People want quality and hygiene and we are not increasing prices drastically,” he said.

“Earlier, we would be able to balance one price rise with another. For example, if onion prices were up, vegetable prices were lower, or we would just reduce the amount of onions in dishes that require them for taste. Now, the prices of almost everything are up,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tr5dxf/article30758932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGCOFFEEPRICES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pay-more-for-eating-out-in-bengaluru-now/article30754161.ece

As 2020 also marks 125 years of the birth of cinema, several world classics by the likes of Ingmar Bergman, Charlie Chaplin, Akira Kurasowa, Buster Keaton, Sergei Eisensteinm, Vittorio De Sica, Jean Luc Goddard, and Satyajit Ray, among others, will also be shown.

“The festival will screen over 200 films from over 60 countries with competitions in the Asian, the Indian, and the Kannada sections. The films selected for the competitions will be announced by February 15,” said Sunil Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy.

While the opening ceremony will be held at the Kanteerava Indoor Stadium on February 26 evening, the chief guest is yet to be finalised. The closing ceremony will be held at Banquet Hall, Vidhana Soudha, on March 4 evening.

Apart from Orion Mall in Rajajinagar, films will also be screened at three other locations in the city this year – Navarang Theatre, also in Rajajinagar, Suchitra Film Society in Banashankari, and Kalavidara Sangha in Chamarajapet.

However, all interactions with filmmakers and workshops will take place only at Orion Mall, where films will be screened in 11 screens.

Registration of delegates will be online only and registration can be done on bookmyshow.com, the official partner of BIFFes. The process began from Wednesday.

The delegate pass costs ₹800 for the public and ₹400 for students, film society members, senior citizens and for those from the film fraternity.

Identity cards will be issued at the academy office in Nandini Layout, Information Department on Infantry Road, and the Suchitra Film Society in Banashankari from February 22.

Mr. Puranik also announced that the Karnataka Film Directors’ Association is hosting a Directors’ Film Bazaar. But the programmes listed under the bazaar are workshops for filmmakers and not designed as a platform to help sell films or find producers.

“This is an attempt at preparing Kannada filmmakers for the global market,” said N. Vidyashankar, artistic director, BIFFes. Claire Dobbin, Script Advisor/Editor from Australia will hold a script lab.

BIFFes seeks international recognition

The Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy has begun taking steps to get BIFFes internationally recognised, said its artistic director N Vidyashankar.

“Film festivals across the world are given accreditation by the International Federation of Film Producers’ Associations. We recently held meetings with their representatives at the Cannes Film Festival and have made an application seeking accreditation. Florence Girot, Director of Film Festivals at the Federation from France is visiting the Festival this year as one of the foreign delegates,” Mr. Vidyashankar explained.

Meanwhile, chairperson of the Academy, Sunil Puranik said he was keen to establish a film festival directorate within the academy, a longstanding demand for better organising of the festival.

“The key to getting international recognition is consistency in the calendar. We will try to announce the calendar of the next edition of the festival on the last day of this edition,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xas66r/article30758949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGBIFFES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-to-celebrate-125-years-of-cinemas-birth/article30753803.ece

340,2020/02/06,Just ₹1 crore sanctioned for suburban railway project,"Citizens are disappointed over the allocation of funds for the much-delayed suburban rail project, as yet again, the South Western Railway Pink Book has allocated only a token amount of ₹1 crore for 2020-21.

In the Budget, the Centre announced that it would provide 20% of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost for the suburban rail network that is estimated to cost ₹18,600 crore. On Sunday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said the 148-km rail network would be completed in three years.

In the Pink Book, the sanctioned cost for ‘Bengaluru Suburban - Construction of elevated/ at grade corridors for augmentation of line capacity’ is ₹11,546 crore. However, the amount allocated for 2020-21 is only ₹1 crore.

Transport expert Sanjeev Dyamannavar of the advocacy group Praja said since the project has been pending before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs and there are no funds, it is likely to get delayed by another year. “We were hoping that the Union government will allocate more funds so that the project will be implemented soon. The government has neglected Bengaluru once again,” he said.

When contacted, a senior official of the SWR said the necessary approvals are yet to be received. “Once the DPR is approved, funds will be made available,” the official said.

341,2020/02/06,Residents and neighbours wake up to a nightmare,"Ramchandra Kumbar, an engineer, who resides on the ground floor of the opposite building, heard a commotion around 7.30 a.m. on Wednesday. He had moved to the house a just a few days ago.

“I started hearing talk of cracks developing in the opposite building, but we didn't take it seriously and I left for work. In a little while, my wife called in panic saying the opposite building had tilted and I rushed back. Some people apparently jumped out of the building in fear. We are clueless about what we should do now and we’re all outside waiting and watching what will happen,” he told The Hindu.

The incident has left the residents of the tilted building — which houses paying guest accommodations — in the lurch. Bharath, a private firm employee, said all their belongings were inside the building and they were clueless about where to go or what to do.

“I have been staying here for a year. All of Wednesday, we have been eating out and staying at friends’ places. We don’t know when we can go back to work as all our things are inside and there is no clarity,” he said. He also pointed out that if the building is demolished, they will be on the back-foot financially as they have just paid the rent for February.

Ajay Kumar, a B.Com. student, was called back from college. “There are eight houses in five floors. We are just standing outside waiting to know what will happen to the house and our belongings,” he said.

“There is no gap in between houses. The road is very narrow. No place even to take up even rescue operations. The fire and emergency services vehicle also can’t come in,” said another resident.

Tension prevailed among residents of neighbouring buildings too as the building in the narrow lane stands dangerously tilted towards the road. Many of them have also left their buildings fearing the worse and are awaiting action from the officials.

343,2020/02/06,"Chennai Corporation to track properties violating civic rules, impose fine online","﻿

The Chennai Corporation has decided to launch a computerised system to link property tax records with the penalty imposed by the civic body for violation of civic rules.

Property owners who have violated civic rules will soon have to start paying fines online through the new system.

The Chennai Corporation held a meeting this week to regulate the system of collection of fines from violators through the development of a software. “The new system will help us track the violators using the property tax database. All property owners who have let sewage in stormwater drain will be tracked using the system. Those who dump construction debris will also be regulated. The fine amount can be paid online,” said an official.

Currently, conservancy inspectors who have the power to impose penalties for civic violations are unable to track the violators. After the launch of the new system in April, the fine amount will be added to the half-year property tax automatically after every violation of rules by the property owner. So the total fine amount will be collected along with the property tax every half year.

“The fine amount for violation of civic rules in any of the 200 wards can be checked by higher officials on a daily basis. The fine payment can also be made at the 196 common service centres. A final decision on this will be taken shortly,” said an official.

Chennai Corporation has a database of 12 lakh property tax assessees in the city. After the successful implementation of the system, the civic body is planning to link other database such as trade licences with the system.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oid99n/article30749580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06FEBTH-CONSTRUCTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-track-properties-violating-civic-rules-impose-fine-online/article30749581.ece
344,2020/02/06,"Liver transplants should be done in more centres, expert says","It is important for high-end surgeries like liver transplants to be performed in more centres that are geographically distributed, said Mohamed Rela, renowned liver transplant surgeon, on Thursday.

Addressing the media regarding a successful liver transplant performed for a 67-year-old woman at the Dr. Rela Institute and MS (RIMS) Hospital in Padiyanallur, he said that this was the first time a liver transplant has been performed at a hospital in North Chennai -- an area that did not have many high-end hospitals.

“It is not just about performing liver transplants, but having such a facility means that patients with different types of liver diseases in different stages can be managed here without them having to travel far to other parts of Chennai,” he said.

Eswari Chandran, the patient, who had liver cirrhosis, received a liver from a brain-dead donor from Government Stanley Hospital in the first week of December.

Dr. Rela said that running a facility in this part of Chennai would also make the cost of the transplant significantly lower. “We can do the transplants for adults at around ₹18 lakh,” he said.

Regarding the location being away from the airport particularly when organs need to be transported from other parts of the State, he said that it should not be an issue for the liver which can be kept for eight hours. “Moreover the road infrastructure is continuously improving,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/liver-transplants-should-be-done-in-more-centres-expert-says/article30749488.ece

348,2020/02/06,Raise awareness on assistance: activists,"Following the verdict in the Aynavaram sexual abuse case, child rights activists have stressed on the need to create more awareness about the eligibility for interim compensation under the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Rules, 2012, as well as the timely release of funds.

While a special court on Monday convicted five sexual offenders to life imprisonment, an interim compensation of ₹1.5 lakh was ordered to be awarded to the survivor and her family in consideration of the physical and mental trauma they had undergone as well as other factors surrounding the occurrence, expenses incurred towards travel and immediate expenses.

“Rule 7 of the Pocso Rules clearly states that there is an eligibility for interim compensation to meet the immediate needs of the affected child for relief and rehabilitation based on the FIR. Why was the child awarded an interim compensation only during the verdict when it should have been given much earlier?” questioned Vidya Reddy of Tulir. She said that awarding the interim compensation at the time of the verdict indicated a lack of understanding about what the Pocso Rules state and how important it is for these funds to be released early into the investigation.

In 2018, information obtained by an activist from 11 districts in the State indicated that the number of cases that have been committed to court and victims who have been awarded an interim compensation were extremely low. From November 2012 to September 2018, victims in only 47 cases received compensation.

Virgil D’Sami, Director of Arunodhaya, said that while there are several positive steps taken by the police and various departments to ensure the safety of women and children, there needs to be more awareness to guide parents or guardians of the children on how to apply for interim compensation. “In several cases where the child has been abused, the parents or guardians are unaware that they can appeal and use this compensation for their legal as well as as other expenses they might incur during the course of the investigation,” she said.

She said that they are now working to get interim compensation for a child to complete her education. “The child had to be taken away from her family and she has been admitted into a children's home. We’ve appealed for an interim compensation as financial assistance is needed to ensure that she continues her education,” she added. While the interim compensation might be needed in this case for the education of the survivor, there are several other factors the fund might be used for. This ranges from legal expenses, travel expenses or for any additional or sustained medical attention needed through the course of the case. Efforts are being taken to increase awareness about the Pocso Rules among the women police as well as about the eligibility for compensation.

""While the police or the child protection officials might be aware of the rules, there is often confusion about how to go about fulfilling the requirements needed to apply for it. Lawyers should also be well equipped to explain this to the parents or guardians,"" said Andrew Sesuraj, Convener of the Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/raise-awareness-on-assistance-activists/article30746419.ece
349,2020/02/06,"SPB, Sangakkara share stage at grand awards night in Colombo","“I have not received an honour like this,” said playback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. It seemed a surprising remark, coming from an ace playback singer with several coveted national and international honours.

But it was not merely the grandeur of the awards ceremony organised by Sri Lanka’s Kamban Kazhagam that moved him. The singer, whose “greatest passion after music” is cricket, got to share the dais with one of the most admired icons of the sport – Kumar Sangakkara.

Bringing the two icons – of film music and cricket – together, with other accomplished Sri Lankans, was the Kamban Kazhagam in Colombo.

“Only 10 % of this [Kamban Pugazh] award must go to me. The rest of it is meant for the innumerable instrumentalists who played with me, the composers and lyricists who gave me these songs, the recording artistes and most of all, all of you who listen to it,” said SPB, an artiste with a record of over 40,000 songs, and a huge, fan base among Sri Lankan Tamils. In 2016, he performed live to a large audience in Jaffna.

“I have no qualms saying this on stage, I haven’t seen an audience as receptive to Tamil art and culture in Sri Lanka, anywhere else in the world,” the singer said at Tuesday’s event, held at the sea-facing Ramakrishna Hall in Colombo’s Wellawatte area, a predominantly Tamil neighbourhood.

“I am so thrilled to be here with Sangakkara. You’re a great human being and one of the finest ambassadors of Sri Lankan culture,” SPB told the cricketer on stage. That was also why the organisers decided to honour Sangakkara, who received a spontaneous standing ovation from the audience.

Founded by 'Kambavarithy' Ilankai Jeyaraj 40 years ago in Jaffna, the organisation’s Colombo chapter is celebrating its silver jubilee. Essentially a forum for debate and discussion on Tamil literature and culture, the Kazhagam has been honouring prominent Sri Lankans from different fields and ethnicities every year. “From 2009, when the war ended, we strongly felt that we must honour at least one Sinhalese person every year. Sangakkara, as an icon who stands for ethnic harmony, was a natural choice for our committee,” Mr. Jayaraj told The Hindu. The other awardees were Tamil parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran, Supreme Court Judge S. Thurairaja, writer A. Muttulingam, bureaucrat V. Sivagnanasothy and scholar A.M. Nahiya.

“I am humbled,” said Mr. Sangakkara, currently president of the MCC, calling for harmony in diversity, and emphasising there was “no room for exclusivity or suspicion”.

He was reiterating a message that he powerfully expressed at his famous MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s in 2011. Kamban Kazhagam deemed it fit to play excerpts of his speech there, with a Tamil translation. His reference in the video clip, to his parents sheltering Tamil friends during the gory 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, and his message saying: “I am Tamil, I’m Sinhalese, I’m Muslim & Burgher. I’m a Buddhist, I’m a Hindu, a follower of Islam & Christianity. But above all, today and always I will be a proud Sri Lankan,” drew thundering applause from the audience, on what was also Sri Lanka’s Independence Day.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j9rpie/article30746372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/spb-sangakkara-share-stage-at-grand-awards-night-in-colombo/article30746373.ece
350,2020/02/06,A mammoth classical feast,"This Sunday, Thiruvanmiyur saw over 700 musicians performing together. The musicians performed three songs, including Thyagaraja’s Entharo Mahanubhavulu, which was the common thread connecting a Kuchipudi dance session with 1,183 dancers and a Bharathanatyam session with 436 dancers.

Carnatic vocalist Sudha Raghunathan, who led the band, said that the musicians were first instructed that they would not sing the swarams but only the sahityam (lyrics) of the songs. “It was everybody’s event and we ensured that all participants, vocalists and instrumentalists, knew the lyrics. All of them sang or performed in unison. Everyone including senior vidwans P. Unnikrishnan, T. V. Gopalakrishnan and A. Kanyakumari joined the effort,” she said.

Thyagayya Charitable Trust organised the event to encourage youngsters to take up classical music and dance. Saxaphone vidwan E.R. Janardhan, founder of the trust, said that it was also their offering to Thyagaraja. “We explained the lyrics of Entharo Mahanubhavulu and the greatness of its composer Thyagarajaswamy to those who had gathered. At least 50 dance schools along with their teachers took part in the event,” he said.

351,2020/02/06,Delayed Vandalur flyover to be ready by mid-March,"The 711-m-long flyover in Vandalur, on GST Road, will be completed by mid-March. Construction of the bridge portion of the ₹55-crore work is over and the Highways Department is currently constructing approach ramps.

“We have already started filling up the ramps with flyash and have been ramming it down. Black topping, painting and road sign installation will simultaneously be taken up,” said an official. The Department had earlier completed work on construction of stormwater drains and formation of service lanes on either side.

On completion, the flyover, at the ‘T’ junction of the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road and the GST Road, will allow traffic through, with no need for waiting for the signal. Work on the six-lane flyover began in September 2016, and took more time than what was planned initially due to delay in land acquisition, labour issues, non-availability of sand, round-the-clock plying of vehicles on the National Highway and an increase in the prices of cement. The contractor got the land for the project about eight months later than planned.

Bridge planned

Keeping in mind the thousands of visitors to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur every day, the Department has planned to construct a foot overbridge to facilitate easy crossing of the GST Road for pedestrians. It will come up in between the flyover and the zoo gate. Several times, pedestrians just run across the road that has very heavy traffic, causing accidents. Kannagi Nagar resident Priya, who visited the zoo, welcomed the idea of a pedestrian facility.

The Chola-period temple was renovated at a cost of ₹75 lakh, ahead of the ceremony, during which Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, AIADMK spokesperson Vaigai Selvan and other VIPs were present.

The proceedings began with the priests carrying pots containing water in procession, after the aaravadhu kaala puja. By 9.45 a.m., the water was poured on the kumbas atop the various vimanas, the rajagopuram and other gopurams, and by 10.15 a.m., on the idols of Marundeeswarar, the presiding deity, his consort Thirupurasundari Amman, and the other idols. This was followed by the Mahabhishekam.

In the evening, idols of Sri Chandrasekarar and Sri Thyagesar were taken out in a procession in the four mada streets.

The station, part of the Phase II project, will be located on Whites Road, and will be a part of the corridor that will link Madhavaram and SIPCOT.

The station will be connected to the Thousand Lights Metro station, which is now functional.

According to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) officials, they have identified land on Whites Road, where the station’s entry/exit points will be located.

From the station, commuters will have to walk just a few minutes to get to the theatre. Phase II will connect several stations across the city, and moviegoers, who currently drive down to the theatre or take cabs, will then be able to take the Metro to reach the theatre, officials said.

“The station falls between Gemini and Royapettah Government Hospital, as part of the stretch between Madhavaram to SIPCOT. It will be an underground station with two entry/exit points. The station is located close to the existing Phase I’s Thousand Lights Metro station, so we are thinking of having a travelator too, so that commuters can easily walk from one station to the other, if they want to switch lines and travel from the Phase II network to Phase I, or vice versa,” an official said.

Walkway facilities

CMRL plans to improve pedestrian walkway facilities near the station to help commuters walk to the station from nearby areas.

The station will be built first, as it is part of the stretch from Madhavaram to Taramani, for which CMRL has already called for tenders to begin construction.

He and his students’ team have managed to bring sparrows to nearly 70% of the 1,000 nests, distributed across localities, including Royapuram and Tondiarpet, over the past eight months.

It all started during his college days, when he developed an interest in environmental projects, and his professor T. Murugavel guided him on sparrow conservation measures.

“Sparrows have lived closely with people. They are an important part of the food chain and feed insects to their offsprings. They are a help to the farmers too,” said Mr. Ganeshan, who found that some parts of north Chennai were still home to sparrows.

Listing out some of the reasons, he said changing urban architecture, mobile tower radiation and depleting food sources led to a fast decline in the sparrow count in urban areas.

“I started visiting homes in north Chennai to spread awareness on the importance of sparrows and shifted to Royapuram two years ago. But I couldn’t cover many people. I initially bought sparrow nests that were costly. Then I started purchasing wood and other materials and learnt to make nests,” he said.

The initiative picked up pace after he approached Dhanalakshmi Higher Secondary School, Royapuram, last year. He conducted workshops for students on nest making.

During weekends, students assist him in making nests. Mr. Ganeshan has distributed free nests to students from five schools and residents through his organisation, Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating.

Besides holding workshops regularly, he also led a rally in north Chennai recently. A sparrow conservation club and a nest bank were also inaugurated a the Dhanalakshmi school to enrich knowledge about birds and develop students’ interest in wildlife photography.

356,2020/02/06,Parents arrested,"Three, including a husband and wife, were arrested under the Pocso Act, in different parts of the city on Tuesday.

The Kilpauk All-Women Police arrested a man for reportedly sexually harassing his daughter and assaulting her in Anna Nagar on Tuesday.

According to the police, the man residing in Anna Nagar is married and has three children. As he used to drink regularly, there used to be frequent quarrels between him and his wife. On Tuesday morning, when his second daughter came home, he reportedly sexually harassed and assaulted her. She called and informed her mother about the crime and she informed the police. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.

In a different case, the Guindy All-Women Police arrested a 48-year-old man from Velachery for sexually assaulting his daughter, and his wife for abetting the crime.

The girl, a Class XI student, was abused by her parents for over a year.

357,2020/02/06,8 arrested after students clash,"The police arrested eight students on Wednesday in connection with a clash between two groups of students inside the campus of a deemed university in Kattankulathur on Tuesday. The Chengalpattu district police have directed the university to enhance security.

A video doing rounds on message-sharing platforms shows three youngsters walking inside the campus. Suddenly, one of them tries to attack another student, who walks towards them with a sharp weapon. The youngsters start exchanging blows.

The 19-second video, reportedly shot by a student, ends with a beard-sporting youngster chasing his rival, who manages to dodge an attack with a billhook.

After the video was widely circulated, the police rushed to the institute and started an investigation. “There was a clash between two groups of students on Monday and what happened on Tuesday was a retaliation to it,” said a senior police officer.

Following this, the group that attacked was identified and summoned for inquiry. “Initially, there were rumours that one of the youngsters was carrying a gun, but it was a cigarette lighter in the shape of a firearm. The sharp weapon was taken from a food joint,” added the officer.

The police said that they registered an FIR based on the complaint given by the attackers. “Those who were attacked were absconding. Our team has traced them and has brought them back. We arrested eight students and later released them on bail,” said a police officer.

The police have instructed the administration to check every vehicle that enters the institute.

“Only those with identity cards will be permitted inside the college. The security staff have been advised to maintain a visitors’ log,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8-arrested-after-students-clash/article30745887.ece
358,2020/02/06,Fashioning the framework of a New India,"The Indian economy is going through a severe crisis: a slowdown as well as a structural crisis. In the words of the former Chief Economic Adviser, Arvind Subramanian, it is headed towards the ICU. Almost all sectors of the economy are in decline: the rate of growth of the national GDP has declined to 5.0%, and may go down further; the construction sector, one of the fastest growing sectors so far, is growing at 3.3% this year; agriculture is growing at 2.1% while the auto sector is declining continuously in absolute terms.

The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector too has declined, in turn raising the burden of non-performing assets of the banking sector as well as non-banking financial institutions. Also, exports have been declining in recent years, raising the crisis of current account deficit. Credit from banking and non-banking sectors has been declining in the last few years; the Financial Stability Report of the Reserve Bank of India (2019) says that it is unlikely to increase in the next nine months.

Impacting the poor

These developments have had an adverse impact on the bottom 30%-40% of the population. The incidence of absolute poverty, which has been falling since 1972-73, has increased to 30% (4% jump). As the Human Development Report (2019) has shown, more than 44% of the Indian population is under the multi-dimensional poverty line. The poorest 50% population at present owns only 4.1% of the national wealth, while the richest 10% people own 73% of the total wealth in India (Suisse Credit 2019). India has 15.2% population malnourished (women 15%) as against 9.3% in China. And 50% of the malnourished children in the world are in India. India’s global hunger rank has gone up to 112 while Brazil is 18, China is 25 and South Africa, 59. In the field of education as per a UN report (2015), overall literacy in India is 74.04% (more than the 25% are totally illiterate) against 94.3% in South Africa, 96.6% in China and 92.6% in Brazil. Almost 40-45% population is either illiterate or has studied up to standard 4. Given the quality of education in India, the overall population is very poorly educated, with the share of ‘educated unemployment’ rising by leaps and bounds.

It needs to be realised that when exports are declining, the economy will have to depend on domestic demand for growth. It is no more feasible for the top 20-25% population to continue growing without depending on the demand from the bottom 40-45% population. There is thus a strong reason now for the economy to increase effective demand of this bottom 40-45% population at least to continue growing — to reach a $5-trillion economy by 2024.

Sub-optimal use of labour

However, this crisis needs to be viewed differently: a major reason for the crisis is that the growth process has marginalised the bottom 40-plus% of the population in the sense that they do not get a fair share of the economic growth, and are more or less deprived of productive employment with a decent income. These people have been treated as beneficiaries to whom some cash/kind grants are thrown at, but they have not been used as active participants in the growth process. Their potential has not been promoted.

Though the bottom population depends on the government for basic health and elementary education (and also for access to higher educational opportunities), the government spends just 1.4% of GDP on health (against the norm of 4-6% of GDP) and 3% of GDP on education (against the norm of 6-8% of GDP). As a result, these people are left hardly literate and sick, with poor nutrition and high morbidity. They are incapable of acquiring any meaningful skills or participating actively when new technology is spreading in the rest of the economy. This sub-optimal use of the labour force in the economy is not likely to enable India to achieve optimal growth with proper use of the national resources — the labour force.

All-encompassing growth

One important lesson for policymakers is this: a major solution to the present crisis is to go in for inclusive growth. Here, inclusive growth does not mean only including all sections of the population in the growth process as producers and beneficiaries; it also means “shared prosperity”. Since India has already committed to sustainable and inclusive growth at the UN General Assembly, India is definitely obliged to implement inclusive growth. This should be our “New India”.

Under the “New India” the main requirements are as follows: To start with, to improve the capabilities of the masses as well as their well-being by expanding productive employment opportunities for them. The main steps to expand productive employment for all in the economy should be made up of: a process of inclusion — expanding quality of basic health for all and ensuring quality education to all, which will by itself generate large-scale employment in the government; having a well-educated and healthy labour force will ensure high employability; such people will be able to participate actively in the development process; having a well-educated labour force will help start-ups and MSMEs, in turn triggering a cycle of more productive employment in the economy.

This will also improve the global competitiveness of our production units. Employment guarantee schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) will also increase employment. Following the economic logic of R. Nurkse and A.O. Hirschman, assets generated under MGNREGA will expand capital formation in the economy, thereby raising the labour-absorbing capacity of the mainstream economy.

Such a strategy has multiple advantages: First, it will raise incomes and the well-being of those who need it most urgently. Second, it will raise effective demand rapidly, which is so badly needed in the economy today to raise economic growth. Third, growth will be equitable and sustainable.

The discussion had important implications for the Union Budget: need to raise expenditure on health to at least 5% of GDP and expenditure on education to at least 6% of GDP; to push up infrastructural development to enhance capabilities and opportunities of the masses and not just to promote corporate units; to promote agriculture by raising investment in agriculture and not just cash transfer (cash transfer provides relief to them no doubt, and does not raise productivity of agriculture which needs large public investment); and to facilitate credit flow particularly continuous working capital, to labour intensive sectors. Unfortunately, these steps are missing in the recent national Budget.

Public investments

Finally, how does one raise resources to increase new public investments in the selected sectors mentioned above, especially when public revenue is declining and the claims on public resources are rising? One major strategy is to raise direct taxes, both capital tax and wealth tax. Our experience in the past has shown by following crony capitalism, i.e. providing tax cuts and extra incentives and concessions to the corporate sector, exports increased and also our national GDP no doubt. But this growth does not much percolate to the poor. This is because during the growth process due to special treatment to corporate sector, the political economy radically changed in favour of the rich who are never willing to be taxed to raise government revenue to a level that it is enough to promote the capabilities and the well-being of the marginalised and the excluded.

On the other hand, the unholy alliance between the government and the corporate sector also does not allow them to worry about the poor. Consequently, taxing the rich has to be a major strategy to raise government revenue. Second, if the public expenditure on raising capabilities is treated as social investment rather than social welfare, policymakers will be willing to spend on this capital formation. And, finally, there was no sound economic reason to control fiscal deficit ratio. Sound macroeconomics never supports this.

I feel that as of now, there is no big three. Only the big two, Novak and Rafael Nadal. Federer, my favourite, appears to be losing steam if one judges his serves and strokes. He is still good enough to reach the quarters, but thereafter, it becomes the familiar thus far and no further. But all three are great because of their persona off court.

360,2020/02/06,No public exams,"Thank heavens for extinguishing hell-fire (Page 1, “Govt. withdraws plan to hold public exams for Classes 5, 8”, February 5). Nature has given children the gift of inquisitiveness. Playing through learning or learning through playing should be the norm in every school curriculum on various subjects.

Unfortunately, the cut-throat competitive spirit now prevalent appears to be affecting children too.

Even educationists feel that such examinations would impose an unnecessary burden on children and parents who now struggle to help their children in their studies. Public exams even kill the very joy of learning.

361,2020/02/06,Bidar case,"First, with reference to the action taken by the police against the school in Bidar, Karnataka, there was no reason for the police to dramatise the issue as there was no violence either within or outside the campus (Editorial, “Punish the police” and “More Bidar school students questioned”, both February 5).

Second, this being India, a school crawling with police personnel might affect its credibility and reputation in the public eye. Third, it is a mystery how the right-wing activist came to know about the school programme, unless he himself is a parent. If so, why could he have not protested in the first instance with the school authorities?

Equally, it is injudicious on the part of the school authorities to have thought of involving young children to enact something as serious a national issue as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Police personnel in India need exposure and training about the freedom of speech and personal liberty.

E.S. Chandrasekaran,

Chennai

Every time when we conclude that we have seen the nadir of intolerance by an authoritarian regime, we are proved wrong. The police “excesses” in Bidar are an example of the absolute mockery and abuse of the law. The name of the school might have caused the authorities to have a closer look at its activities. The infringement on the right of expression and speech has breached new lows in Karnataka, but with a certain party in power, it does not spring a surprise.

G.B. Sivanandam,

Coimbatore

The framing of sedition charges against a parent and teacher is disproportionate application of a law that was meant to remove threats against public order. The action of the police fails on two counts: reasonableness of restriction and proportionate action. The schoolchildren concerned might fear to express their thoughts and opinions freely in the future as a result of the trauma they are sure to have undergone. Their ability to think critically could be limited due to this. The case is also symptomatic of a larger issue. There seems to be a gradual erosion of secular and democratic values from institutions that should be democratic and secular.

Nirmal A.P.,

Thaliyil, Kannur, Kerala

The play only reflected contemporary reality — ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the country. It is a laughable contention that it posed a threat to the security of the state; it is irrelevant to use a colonial-era law against primary schoolchildren enacting a play on current affairs. The police have disrupted the lives of the children, their parents and teachers.

362,2020/02/06,Rhythmic ensemble marked by stroke of brilliance,"In Kerala’s musical tradition, generally, rhythm dominates melody. In serpent worship, the Pulluva woman beats the string of her musical instrument called the ‘kudam’ to mark rhythm rather than to produce melodic tones. Only percussion instruments are employed in the prelude called ‘melappadam’ to Kathakali. The ritualistic music called ‘kottippaatisseva’ (service by drumming-cum-singing) is characterised by the single accompaniment namely, the edakka, the so-called ‘sacred singing drum of Kerala’. Similarly, in Thayambaka too rhythm has pride of place.

‘Thaayam’ in old Malayalam means ‘a move in a game such as dice’ or ‘a system’; ‘paka’/ ‘vaka’ may mean ‘variety’ or ‘surprise’ (from the phrase pakachchu nilkkuka). Thayambaka, therefore, may connote ‘a surprising variety of moves’ or ‘a system of variation’.

The structure of the Thayambaka recital is believed to have developed from a symbiosis of classical Carnatic music predominant in Tamil Nadu and the percussion tradition reigning over central Kerala.

Thayambaka performed on the chenda crystallised as a male-dominant ritualistic temple art presented to propitiate the deity. It involved artful exhibition of a veteran chenda player’s skills while his fellow drummers on bass (valamtala) chendas and huge cymbals (ilathaalam) kept the rhythm. In due course, double or treble Thayambaka also came into vogue depending on the number of leading chenda players. Subsequently a handful of female artistes also have entered the arena.

It was mizhavu maestro KN Narayanan Nambiar, who, along with his disciple Kalamandalam Eswaranunni, successfully experimented with performing the Thayambaka on the mizhavu. In due course, it was tested on instruments such as the edakka, villu (bow) and jalatharamgam also. There are specific stages in Thayambaka which showcase its semiotic relationship with the ‘taniavarthanam’ in Carnatic music concerts.

On the beat

Kalamandalam Rajeev and Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan recently showcased their mastery on the mizhavu and the edakka respectively in a 90-minute- recital of mizhavu-edakka Thayambaka in the capital city.

The performance commenced with the slowest conceivable tempo (pathikaalam) with eight beats. Before its conclusion there was a charming display of panchaari nata. The next stage showcased the complexity of atantha: three and four (takkitta, takadhimi). The final stage was irikita in the mid tempo (itakaalam). Vertical beats (neerkool) like thunder bolts raised the drumming to its crescendo along with the rise of heart beats of the audience. And the performance came to a close resembling the sudden stopping of a torrential rain.

Kalamandalam/Margi Sajikumar and Kalamandalam Rahul supported on the mizhavu. Puthukkatu Gopkumar kept the rhythm on the bass chenda. Puthukkatu Balakrishnan and Attoor Madhusoodanan handled the cymbals.

The mizhavu player has to create patterns of rhythm by means of just his fingers, thumbs and palms unlike the chenda player whose strength is enhanced by the stick(s) he wields. The edakka is one of the softest among drums. To employ these instruments to shoulder the work load usually undertaken by the chenda is a formidable task. But Rajeev and Unnikrishnan took on the challenge and came out on top.

During a brief interaction with the audience, Rajeev explained various aspects about innovations in the venture. The programme was held under the aegis of the Kutiyattam Centre of Sangeet Natak Akademi at the Vivekananda Cultural Institute.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/daoj6h/article30749501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvfthaayampaka2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/mizhavu-edakka-thayambaka-recital-in-thiruvananthapuram/article30749502.ece
363,2020/02/06,Titans and master musicians of Kathakali showcase their acumen at fete in Kochi,"A five-day Kathakali festival at Changampuzha Park, Edappally, was noted for the scrupulous selection of plays, actors and musicians all of which entranced spectators who sat through each recital from evening till almost midnight, with avid attention.

Kottayathu Thampuran’s Kalakeyavadham, staged on the opening day of the fete, had Kalamandalam Balasubrahmanyan in the role of Arjuna. Arjuna’s stately appearance with the slow-paced padam ‘Salajjoham...’ (I am ashamed) in Adantha tala (56 beats) was preceded by Lord Indra sending his charioteer Mathali to Kailasa to invite his son Arjuna for a visit to his kingdom in heaven.

While Kalamandalam Radhakrishnan as Indra and Kalamandalam Arun Warrier as Mathali were specific and tidy in the execution of the gestures and expressions, Balasubrahmanyan’s mastery over the angikabhinaya, rhythm and the tempos was clearly perceptible. Arun Warrier could have instilled a little more joie de vivre into the character. Slow-tempo padams pose a challenge even to veteran actors donning the role of Arjuna in this play. By the time Balasubrahmanyan moved on to the ashtakalasam (executed in slow tempo chamba tala of 40 beats) for the line, ‘sukruthikalil mumbanayi...’ (first amongst the virtuous), he seemed to be a wee bit exhausted and Arjuna’s expression of untold delight was missing.

Kalamandalam Babu Namboodiri and Vinod gave exceptional vocal support in the first part while Kalamandalam Balasundaran’s chenda enlivened the sequences and the characters with dense strokes.

On the second evening, Sadanam Krishnankutty came on stage as the invincible Hanuman preparing himself for crossing the ocean to Lanka as the messenger of Rama. For this effervescent actor, the role and the context proved to be a boon.

Through the actor’s actions and expressions, the viewers could experience the expansiveness of the ocean, the fishermen throwing nets and catching fish and Hanuman’s leap across the sea denoted by Adantavattom (change in beat). Krishnankutty persuasively portrayed Hanuman’s encounters with demons like Surasa and Simhika. The tone of Hanuman’s gesture to the mountain Mynaaka who rises up from the ocean requesting him to rest for a while was visibly impolite.

Kottakkal Nandakumaran Nair as Ravana tersely enacted the meaning of the acclaimed sloka ‘Himakara himagarbha’, revealing Ravana’s longing for Sita. While Nandakumar revelled in Veera rasa (heroism) as Ravana, his meeting with Sita did not have the requisite amount of Sringara rasa (romance).

On the following day, Kalamandalam Gopi captivated the audience as King Nala adoring Damayanthi soon after their wedding. Right from the line, ‘Kuvalayavilochane’ (Nala addressing his beloved as lotus-eyed), set to slow tempo (56 beats) Adantha tala, the veteran actor spontaneously navigated the contours of Sringara rasa, anchoring on the sthayi bhava (enduring expression) and switching to the sanchari bhavas (transitory expressions) apposite to each and every metaphor. He exhaustively used his ‘upangas’ (eyes, lips and eye-brows) to portray several shades of ‘thrapa’ (shyness) in the line, “Eniyo nin thrapayonne enikku vairini manye”.

Thespian’s interpretation

Decoding poetic images into the language of Kathakali is no mean task. For the padam, ‘Dayithe Kel’, too Gopi laid emphasis on emotive acting with minimum movements of the body and the limbs. Margi Vijayakumar as Damayanthi supported him well. While Kalamandalam Hari R Nair presented Kali compellingly, Kalamandalam Shanmukhan portrayed the character of Pushkara convincingly. As Nala II, Kalamandalam Srikumar efficaciously articulated the character’s heroism during his encounter with Pushkara and the intensity of anguish when Nala had to eventually desert his consort in the wilderness.

Pathiyoor Sankarankutty’s singing carefully adhered to the visual semantics. Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan’s playing on the chenda and Prakasan’s fingering on the Maddalam was gracefully attuned to Gopi’s idiom.

On the penultimate day of the festival, Irayimman Thampi’s Utharaswayamvaram was staged with Kalamandalam Krishnakumar as Duryodhana and Peesappilly Rajeevan as Brihandala. The highlight of Suyodhana’s sringara padam was ‘ekalochanam...’. Duryodhana, while addressing Bhanumati invites her attention to a pair of cuckoos perching on a tree. One of the Chakravaka birds (mythical bird) mistakes the face of Bhanumati for the moon and fearing a separation looks at the queen angrily with one eye and simultaneously looks at his partner sorrowfully with the other eye. Krishnakumar, with an extraordinary theatrical fervour, presented this piece much to the delight of the audience.

Kottakkal Devadas as Thrigartha, with his imposing presence and profound articulation, enraptured the audience. He did lots of improvisation some of which enhanced the glow of the character. For instance while entering the kingdom of Virata, Thrigartha notices a half-lowered flag on the mast and he attributes this as homage to Keechaka whom Bhima in the guise of Valala had smothered to death. The scene involving the stealing of the cows was but a bit too protracted. Peesappilly Rajeevan as Brihannala did a pithy presentation along with Kalamandalam Adityan as Uttaran. They complemented each other in their impromptu conversation.

Kottakkal Madhu renditions enthralled his fans. Kalamandalam (Margi) Krishnadas and Venu Mohan empowered the movements and expressions of all the major characters on the chenda and they were ably assisted on the maddalam by Kalanilayam Manoj and others.

The festival concluded with Sriramapattabhishekam, by artists of Unnayi Warrier Smaraka Kalanilayam Kathakali troupe.

364,2020/02/06,Turkish delights,"Few new eateries in Mumbai, manage to elicit a sigh at first sight. But the high ceilings in Hurrem’s, a Turkish baklava and confectionary store and café on DN Road in Fort, manages to do that just.

A visit to the large store is not less than a sensory experience. The large glass counter neatly and luxuriously showcases over 15 different types of baklavas, Turkish sweets, and colourful Turkish delights. A large kitchen behind the counter also whips up savoury treats such as a delicious zaatar cheese bread (₹240) or cheese pide, which you can enjoy with a cup of Turkish coffee (₹275) which is prepared at a beverage bar. Working hard to deliver on his promise of an experience, Farid has also included a nut bar, where you can purchase a variety of dryfruits and nuts, ranging from goji berries to pecan nuts. This one is a treat for home cooks and lovers of food.

Founded by Ahmed Farid, Hurrem’s looks opulent and austere all at the same time. “Today, consumers are seeking experiences out of the ordinary. While a lot of global cuisines have found their way to the consumer, we identified a gap in the Indian market for 100% authentic Turkish baklava and were keen on catering to this requirement without any compromise,” says Farid.

The architects who worked on Hurrem’s are Turkish — Özlem Kulaç and Berkay Kars. And there are not one but two Turkish chefs who have packed their bags and come to Mumbai to give us an authentic experience. Chef Sefa Sülüker is in charge of the baklavas and chef Mehmet Cam of the savoury items, both have been trained in Gaziantep, Turkey. Farid tells us that in addition to hiring Turkish chefs, his team took several trips to Turkey to get all small details right. All recipes used by the café, have been passed down for generations.

Guests can choose from some classic varieties of baklavas, including Fistik Baklava (four pieces for ₹560). You can also order single pieces and make an assortment box or the 80-layer filo pastry stuffed with sweetened pistachio. Other options include Kaju Baklava, Walnut Baklava, and some special varieties including Havuc Dilmi (a large piece that costs ₹430 each), Midiye (pistachio baklava with an addition of clotted cream, is ₹200 per piece), and Chocolate and Hazelnut Baklava. Each baklava we try is rolled to perfection, the filo pastry is exceptionally delicate but tough enough to not crack under pressure of its rich dry fruit stuffings. The Turkish Delights, which are available in a range of delicious flavours are light and easy to gobble.

365,2020/02/06,This Chennai restobar serves chicken pani puri,"Chubby cherubs sit huddled on bar stools. Behind them is a white bust of what looks like a Roman hero. In another corner of the room, shiny red horses leap out of virulently orange and blue pillars. These are recurring themes at Trippin Town — one of the newest restobars in the city.

The space, spread over 10,000 square feet and two floors, is a weird mix of colours, décor and patterns. Some sections look like the aftermath of a Holi party. But weird is wonderful, believes the team. The words are even written in bold letters across one of their smoking rooms.

“When people go out, primarily, they want a lot of pictures. We wanted to create an Instagrammable bar with 200 décor pieces and vibrant colours. It was a conscious decision to stay away from the regular colours. We didn’t just want to give food, we wanted to offer an experience,” says Raj Thiru, who started the place along with Karthik Ramesh and Vijay M. That explains the cherry blossom tree, around 100 planters overflowing with greenery, birds, rhinos on walls... oh and a grand bronze throne replete with a dignified lion’s face that looks unamused with some of the people’s poses. “Trippy things,” laughs Raj.

Trippin Town’s penchant for the unusual reflects in its menu. Case in point: the chicken pani puri. Before you recoil in horror, let me tell you it is addictive. The puris are crisp, the pani is tangy and shredded chicken adds an interesting texture.

The menu has sushi, well-stuffed burgers, pastas, pizzas and popular bar food. Also a winner is the mutton galouti kebab redolent with distinctly warm notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, mace and cardamom, all infused in the smooth kebab served on crisp, biscuit-like roti base.

Wrapped in rich flavours, the beef Thai green curry too has everything going for it. However, things go awry with the little spheres of Andhra baby potato fry that look like minions on a plate. They are fiery, but lack any other flavour.

The Malay mutton rendang dumpling has an excessively doughy exterior and minced mutton filling with hardly any trace of coconut milk or galangal. This borders on mediocrity as well. That’s when the vegetable biryani steps in, like the redeemer. With balanced spices and fresh diced vegetables, it ensures that even those who declare that biryani without meat is just vegetable rice, eat humble pie.

To end the meal, we opt for cocktails over dessert. One look at the bartenders — wrapped in the golden glow of the dramatic island bar — furiously concocting various infusions (like betel piper with betel leaf-infused tequila, litchi juice, Irish caramel and lime juice; and hot desi jalapeño spicy tequila with cucumber and green apple nectar), and you can tell that Trippin Town takes it cocktails seriously.

The cocktail sales are better than the beer sales here, I am told. “Clients want something new,” says one of them, handing me a bulky glass of BBC. A delicious combination of Baileys, bananas (caramelised), and coconut crème with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, it takes care of your sweet tooth and is heady enough to send you spiralling to the dance floor.

366,2020/02/06,"Simple, seasonal and sustainable: Review of food at Narchuvayagam","A nutty fragrance welcomes me into Seeragam Native Store. “That’s the chekku kadalai ennai (traditional wood-pressed groundnut oil),” smiles Gowri Madhu, one of the proprietors. As we walk into Narchuvayagam, the eating area, a member of the kitchen staff is busy packing a takeaway in biodegradable bags. Gowri walks over to ask why the customer hasn’t brought his own dabbas.

Later she explains, “Even though packaging is 100% biodegradable, it’s still going to add to waste. We don’t want to do that.” However, when the customers are patients/attendants from the healthcare centres around them, she says one can’t do anything. “They want something that is homely and healthy. And they don’t always have dabbas.”

As we speak, Deepa from the kitchen plonks a plate before me. There’s a generous heaping of rice (thuyamalli, Gowri informs me) on the banana leaf and two katoris of kootu and poriyal. She then leaves a carrier with sambhar, rasam and kara kuzhambu so that I can help myself. A tomato rice vadam fresh from the kadai finishes the meal.

Gowri laughs when asked how the eatery began. “We were cooking food for our staff when a couple of people from the offices around asked if they could buy lunch from us. Some of our customers would often tease us ‘What about feeding us?’” After some thought, Gowri and her partners hired the space right next to the store and opened Narchuvayagam. The space can seat around 15 people and is well lit naturally. One wall has replicas of Indus Valley seals while another shows a rural scene with women buying and selling produce.

By now I’ve begun digging into the food: simple and tasty. The kara kuzhambu and rasam are flavourful, and the buttermilk is made of fresh curd. The taste of the dal dominates both the sambhar and kootu. The best part is the carrot and beans poriyal — you can actually taste the vegetables instead of the overpowering onion and coconut. The lemon pickle is a stand out with the mild spiciness offset by the sour lemon and sweet onion. Apart from this, Narchuvayagam also offers chapathi with the kootu of the day and a variety rice (either tomato, coconut, coriander or curd) with a rice appalam. “Three times a week, we also offer ragi kali,” says Gowri.

Though they began with lunch, Narchuvayagam expanded to offer breakfast, dinner and evening snacks. Idli and dosa are available for both breakfast and dinner but, on alternate days, there is an either pongal or puri at breakfast. At dinner, there are a few extra items: chapathi, idiyappam, millets adai, alu paratha, paniyaram made of cholam...

In the evening, the vada is a permanent fixture but the ingredient changes: plain urad, masala or ragi. Sweet and savoury kozhukattais and aval perattal are other options. Chukku kapi is the only drink on offer now. “We’re planning to add flower-based and herbal teas and panagam for the summer,” says Gowri. If the supply of milk is regular, buttermilk too will become a feature of the menu.

Narchuvayagam has very clear rules: The ingredients for the menu depends on the stock available at the store. “So regulars may find themselves eating the same vegetable for a couple of days. Also the rice may change, as we use only native varieties.” Their decision to use seasonal items also causes a few problems. “It limits choices but when we explain to customers, most people are okay with it.”

Info you can use Breakfast is available from 8.00 to 10.15; lunch from 12.30 to 3.00 pm; snacks from 4.30 to 7.00 pm and dinner from 6.45 to 9.30 pm

The cost varies depending on what is chosen but is very reasonable. The unlimited ela sapadu, for instance, is ₹85.

Packaging charge will be extra for takeaway.

Since they make only a limited quantity of food, customers have to call and book a place.

367,2020/02/06,The fish you didn’t know Chennai eats,"There is a reason the karapodi or kaaraipodi fish is called silverbelly. It glistens silver-white not only when fresh out of the water, but also when scaled and simmering in rich tomato gravies, inside the traditional Tamil Nadu kitchen. Though fished aplenty this time of year, the species is not commonly consumed in Chennai: most restaurant-goers are unaware of it.

“The rural halibut is another fish we expect to see this time of year, along with the tongue sole. Sardines are also common, and used only in particular preparations,” says Chaitanya Krishna of In Season Fish, adding that there are many such species found in plenty locally, but used only to a limited extent. It is one of the reasons why InSeason Fish is taking Chennaiites on a ‘fishploration’ walk through the city’s Nochikuppam, this weekend.

“The fish in India are very diverse, and the fisherfolk catch all this diversity. We want the people to see this for themselves,” says Chaitanya. A similar event is also being held in Mumbai, as part of In Season Fish’s years-long attempt to educate the country about endemic species, breeding seasons and conscientious consumption.

Adds Chaitanya, “Traditionally, in the fishing community, it is the men who catch the fish and the women who sell them. At Nochikuuppam, the men head out for fishing trips that are three to four hours long, starting before daybreak and returning by 7.30 am. We plan to be there when they return to the shore.”

He also adds that while the men undertake the task of fishing, it is the women here who are storehouses of information about each species. They are the ones cleaning them, dicing them, selling them and also taking them home to cook. “So if you notice any species that you cannot identify or have not seen or cooked before, all you have to do is ask them,” he says, adding that the transfer of recipes and culinary traditions is another thing they are hoping to achieve through these walks.

Since InSeason Fish has conducted such informal walks before, the fisherfolk are used to them, says Chaitanya, and have come to expect questions and queries. “We will also be there to facilitate the interaction,” he says.

Participants are also encouraged to carry bags with them and buy from the fisherfolk directly. “Usually, there are many interfering middlemen that come before the consumer. This is a good opportunity to ensure that the fishermen get the full price for their catch, themselves.”

The fishploration walk is being organised by InSeason Fish and Marine Life of Mumbai on February 9.

368,2020/02/06,"Hermans, the vegan restaurant in Stockholm, presents a buffet like no other","When in Stockholm recently, at least a half a dozen people recommended Hermans Vegan Restaurant.

As I stepped into the restaurant at Fjällgatan for lunch, I was stunned by its location. Perched atop a hill, it overlooks the harbour and has a spectacular panoramic view of the city. The place was packed, and I had to wait for 30 minutes before I found a table.

The buffet table was plentiful and lavish. I paid my 220 Swedish Krona at the counter, and received my plate. As the focus is on upcycling, plates and cutlery are sourced from second-hand shops, which explains why they are in different sizes and shapes.

Soup, bread, four types of salad, two types of dressings, two types of sauces, four types of pickles, curry, stew, pasta, rice, lasagna, and spinach potato bake were all in the buffet... it also has one Indian rice dish and lentil-based salad each day. On weekends, they boast a live vegan grill station.

“The multicultural nature of the buffet is the reflection of our kitchen staff, who are from different parts of the globe,” says Malin Orthagen, service manager. As Indian vegetarian cuisine naturally adapts well to vegan cooking, the influence seemed inevitable — that day, they had chickpea salad, vegetable stew and coconut rice pulao.

She adds that the restaurant sources vegetables from the organic farming community in nearby Jarna. She also mentions that their menu is changed according to the seasonal vegetables.

Rice, chickpea and lentils, however, are imported, as are greens during the winter months. The staff grow kale and edible flowers in the restaurant garden.

In 1992, Herman Ottosson started Hermans as a small vegetarian canteen, catering exclusively to the staff of the building where it functioned in Fjällgatan. Hermans was an instant hit, with its popularity growing by word-of-mouth, and in a few years, it evolved into a restaurant and café.

In 2006, he sold it to the young couple Leo and Omer, who continue to run the place. The couple shifted completely to vegan food about four years ago, going big on soy and coconut milk, oats (grown locally), coconut oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, margarine, vegan butter, and peanut butter. The lasagna I tasted was excellent: a fusion of Italian and Indian, with the aroma of coconut and Italian spices.

Guests clear their plates and cutlery in designated bins, and throw food waste in another bin. Food waste is processed in-house and converted into biofuel, while vegetable waste is composted and used for the kitchen garden. Staff T-shirts and aprons are made of organic cotton and bamboo.

Hermans’ vegan desserts are popular. Pastry Chef Devi Prasad Nair said that when she joined a year ago, it was a challenge to find vegan ingredients for every dessert she wanted to bake. Every ingredient is prepared in their kitchen. Devi did a course in baking at the De Pastry School in Kochi, followed by a certificate course in cake decoration in Stockholm.

Last year, she attended a week-long masterclass at Vegan Gastronomy Culinary Academy, Spain. Hermans offers an enormous spread of vegan desserts, but the most popular on the menu are the cheesecakes, mango delights, muffins, pancakes and Belgian chocolate cakes.

Desserts are not part of the buffet, but can be bought separately. Only in December, does the Julbord Buffet include one dessert.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/6oxzau/article30751198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MPFMLHermansjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/let-peas-prevail/article30751202.ece
369,2020/02/06,"Tiger Lily Bistro, Hyderabad: chicken and waffles, spicy enchiladas, indulgent desserts","“You will see only Audis and Mercs parked outside,” a friend reminds me. But I still brave taking my little nine-year-old Maruti Suzuki to this fancy place, all for the sake of good food. Sure enough, there was a row of gleaming luxury sedans.

Tiger Lily Bistro is the first ‘child’ of Sripriya and Aditya Reddy. Their travels to different corners of the planet fuelled their long-lived dream of opening their own restaurant. When the decision became final, they came across a home in Jubilee Hills and Sripriya recalls the owner was sceptical about their plans to convert the space into a restaurant.

Tiger Lily Bistro Where: Road Number 10, Jubilee Hills

Hits: Truffle fries, chicken and waffles, O Promo Lily

Misses: Paneer enchiladas, mushroom filo parcels

Cost for two: approx ₹1500 incl drinks

What could have been a design conundrum turned out to be a design centrepiece, starts interior designer Sripriya. “That tree,” she says, pointing to the behemoth trunk behind the countertop, “was already in the front garden. We did not want to remove it so we built the restaurant around it. Hence the faux greenery coming down from the ceiling above the booth seating.” Sripriya’s design fetish lives on through the marzipan pinks of the interior along with the imported Spanish tile that makes for a great flat lay background.

Down to the food

The seating at Tiger Lily Bistro is always full, though mostly with younger people who would prefer to keep an eye on their wallets while still having a good meal out. Weekends are especially busy. Chef Delzad Khurshad Avari heads up the culinary team with chef Chary as his secondary.

What is common across all these customers is that they are quick to order the truffle parmesan fries. I order one too and it comes quite quickly, emanating a heavenly fragrance. The fries are golden and crispy while the parmesan flakes are carefully proportioned. Dig into a few and you will find yourself tempted to order another... and another... and maybe yet another.

Before I can go truffle-crazy, Sripriya recommends the paneer enchiladas. I maintain my poker face despite the abhorrent thought of paneer in enchiladas but she urges me to give them a go. “One of our chefs had a Mexican roommate for a while,” says Sripriya, “and he learned how to make enchiladas the authentic way, right down to right black beans and the base sauce.” When two enchiladas arrive, draped in fluid cheese, I spoon some out and am surprised by how true-to-form they are, paneer aside. I would, though, opt for the chicken option if you are able.

Next, come the mushroom filo parcels, a light yet flavourful snack: not for everyone but I would suggest giving them a chance.

If you are feeling like you want just one big meal, do give the chicken and waffles a good go. The waffles are crisp and not oversweet, complementing the fried chicken. This is proper soul food, if you would like to try American Deep South classics. The fresh greens of arugula, rocket and lettuces break up the spice-meets-sweet profile.

The drinks at Tiger Lily Bistro are virgin but they offer swathes of hydration and variety. The O Promo Lily is a welcome treat of pomegranate and citrus notes, and people often order this in plural. The craft coffees are also recommended as are the machine-brewed.

Go ahead and secretly unbutton those jeans (but do not be indecent about it) to make some room for desserts. I would opt for the chocolate dome, which comes with that melting theatric of hot chocolate sauce poured over a neat white chocolate half-sphere. It is not too sweet and worth a visit on its own.

370,2020/02/06,How the rise of restaurant takeovers is great for both professionals and patrons,"Each year, the F&B industry goes through some interesting trends. One such is that of restaurant and bar takeovers. Chefs as well as bartenders and mixologists are opening up to the idea of another professional coming in to takeover the burners and bars, for a set number of days. The result has been some interesting collaborations.

At the recent takeover of O Pedro in Mumbai, Chef André Magalhães of the famed Taberna da Rua das Flores in Lisbon, offered diners a culinary journey: Finding Lisbon in Goa. The idea was to present the influence of Portuguese culture on Goan cuisine. In preparation, Chef Andre and executive chef of O Pedro, Hussain Shahzad, spent a few days together in Goa, visiting local markets, eating at places known for their Portuguese rendition of Goan dishes, exchanging notes with local chefs.

“The beauty of such takeovers is to see how chefs step into someone else’s kitchen and create something new,” states Hussain. “Most of these events are dictated by what is happening in the restaurant and the city at that time. It’s amazing to see how chefs can riff off each other and create new things that are seasonally relevant and apt for the situation.”

Prateek Sadhu, executive chef and co-owner of Masque, Mumbai, talks about the creation of a poached barramundi and millets dish from the 8 Hand Dinner at Masque, a takeover that had chefs Ivan Brehm (Nouri, Singapore), Trevor Moran (The Catbird Seat, Nashville) and Matt Orlando (Amass, Copenhagen) coming together. “It was the first time we had so many head chefs in one kitchen. The four of us were bouncing ideas off one another on how to use the fish — one decided to use the skin in a crispy salad, the flesh itself was poached, and then someone else thought to cook down and purée the bones and head, add starch, and make noodles out of them. Every part of the fish was used across the menu. It began as a conversation about how to use the fresh seafood we had just got, but I think each chef had developed this zero-waste instinct in their cooking that kicked in in creative ways.”

Such takeovers offer everybody involved something. Ishaan Sarkar, Director – Hospitality and F&B, The Whitefield Arms (TWA), Bengaluru, says, “Restaurant or bar takeovers are spike events that attract millennials and are hits on social media. This gives the place a differentiator.”

Ishaan recalls the time when Chris Moore of London’s famed Coupette had taken over TWA. Besides creating a compact cocktail menu that infused local ingredients in high-end spirits, they also got a little adventurous with cocktails, using sparkling wine and liqueurs. Chris brought in some signature British humour in his interaction with guests and also taught the team some tricks of the trade.

1Q1 Kitchen & Bar, Bengaluru, has, on occasion, experimented with having two guest bartenders working together. Teams tend to form and guests begin cheering for their bartender, turning things into a friendly competition. “Takeovers are unique and exciting. For venues, it is an opportunity to collaborate and the ideal platform to showcase and promote themselves in a more interactive manner,” says Anirudh Kheny, Partner, 1Q1 Kitchen & Bar.

Building fraternities

Prathik Shetty, Founder-Partner, The Reservoire, Bengaluru, wants to encourage a bartending culture in the city. For World Cocktail Day, the pub invited seven bartenders and mixologists to a panel discussion and got them to make their signature cocktails for guests. “The highlight was the bonding between bartenders as a fraternity, which though tight-knit, rarely gets to meet up. Through such takeovers, bartenders get to know of the culture at The Reservoire vis-a-vis the bar they are working at, learn new techniques, and share theirs,” Prathik says.

Internationally, takeovers have been happening regularly, but the trend is relatively new in India and promises to be a great way for experts to exchange knowledge. It also means that guests will constantly have something to look forward to.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tidg3s/article30749997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07mpPrateek-and-Ivan-Brehm,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chef-andr-magalhes-prateek-sadhu-ivan-brehm-trevor-moran-matt-orlando/article30749999.ece
371,2020/02/06,Sheena Bora murder case: Bombay High Court grants bail to Peter Mukerjea,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted bail to former television executive Peter Mukerjea, an accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, but stayed its execution for six weeks to give the CBI time to appeal.

A Bench of Justice Nitin Sambre said there was prima facie no evidence against Mukerjea. The court took note of the fact that the statement of Mukerjea’s driver Shyamvar Rai, an accused-turned-approver, was recorded multiple times, indicating that he was tutored.

It said Mukerjea’s objection to his son Rahul’s relationship with his wife’s daughter Sheena did not suggest a criminal intention. He was not in the country at the time of the murder. Justice Sambre granted him bail on a surety of ₹2 lakh and asked him not to contact his children Rahul Mukerjea and Vidhi Mukerjea and other witnesses.

He was lodged at Arthur Road Jail since November 19, 2015, and was rushed to J.J. Hospital on March 16, 2019, after he complained of chest pain. An ECG carried out in the jail suggested some abnormality and he was shifted to the Hospital where he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

He had suffered a mild heart attack. There were four blocks in three main arteries, and the report had suggested that he should undergo either a bypass surgery or an angioplasty at the earliest.

He has been charged under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (punishment for murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

On November 24, 2016, the same judge rejected Mukerjea’s bail petition and said, “There is enough material in the investigation to prima facie infer that the applicant [Mukerjea] was not in support of Rahul’s relationship with Sheena.”

As for Rai, the same Bench had then recorded, “At the outset, it is required to note that the statement of co-accused Shyamvar points the finger at the applicant as regards his involvement. The statement of adopted daughter Vidhi also speaks of disapproval of the relationship between Sheena and Rahul by the applicant. The statements of other witnesses also point the finger at the involvement of the applicant to the crime in question.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4m826d/article26614083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMPETERMUKERJEA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sheena-bora-murder-case-hc-grants-bail-to-peter-mukerjea/article30751625.ece
372,2020/02/06,TISS students’ union wants FIR dropped,"The students’ union of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has demanded that the FIR against Urvashi Chudawala, who identifies as Kris Chudawala, be dropped and has condemned the maligning of the institute and its students who participated in protests.

“On February 2, an FIR with charges of sedition was lodged against TISS student Kris Chudawala for raising slogans at Azad Maidan during Mumbai Pride 2020. In a judgement of the Supreme Court, it is held that raising slogans cannot constitute sedition unless there is an implicit threat of violence. Using these charges to curb the dissenting voices of the oppressed is highly condemnable,” a statement by the students’ union said.

Sedition, an “outdated colonial law”, was still used as a political tool against minorities, human rights defenders, civil rights activists and other dissenters, it alleged.

“By targeting one student and one institute, it is clear that this FIR is part of systematic and continuous attacks on student voices across the country,” the statement said. It also condemned the sedition charges against Akhil Gogoi, Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Sharjeel Imam and students of Shaheen School in Bidar.

It further said in the face of resistance, fascist forces in the country were trying to delegitimise struggles by questioning students’ nationalism and allegiance to the country. “In the same pride gathering, Kris also read out the Preamble, which was witnessed by all the people present there, thereby negating all claims of them being anti-national,” the statement said.

The union has also criticised the media for being completely queer exclusionary and failing to remain mindful in reporting issues involving queer individuals. “Most of them violate privacy of individuals, share pictures and misgender them, which cause permanent damage to the person’s life,” the statement read.

The statement had been endorsed by most TISS student groups such as the Adivasi Students Forum, the Ambedkarite Students Association, Muslim Students Forum, Muslim Youth Voices, Northeast Students Forum, Progressive Students Forum, Spaceless Collective and Queer Collective.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k7gil6/article30756166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07bmKris-Chudawala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tiss-students-union-demands-fir-against-kris-chudawala-be-dropped/article30750470.ece

Mr. Ahmad, who stays in Nallasopara, is the State president of SIO. He had given a speech against the CAA and NRC on February 1, allegedly urging all Muslims to fight the two laws. After sections of his speech were circulated on social media, the police booked him for promoting enmity on grounds of race and religion.

Crime Branch officers said the Nanded police sought assistance in apprehending Mr. Ahmad, and Unit V was assigned the task. “We ascertained that he was at the SIO office in Vinoba Bhave Nagar, Kurla and picked him up from there,” an officer said.

Calling it a witch-hunt, the SIO released a statement condemning police action against Mr. Ahmad. “His speech has mischievously been taken out of context and edited to present a distorted version. Full clarification regarding its content is already available in the public domain. The media trial he was subjected to and the case registered against him is nothing more than an attempt to delegitimise and silence peaceful democratic protests.

374,2020/02/06,Injured jackal rescued on Palm Beach Road,"An injured jackal was rescued on Palm Beach Road on Tuesday by the Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) after a passerby spotted it.

The rescue operation began at around 10 p.m. after Gautam Kumar, the passerby, informed RAWW. Pawan Sharma, founder of RAWW said, “A respondent team of wildlife volunteers, Forest Department officials and a wildlife rescue organisation called Bhumi Jeevdaya rushed to the site. The animal was taken to Bhumi Jeevdaya in Navi Mumbai.”

Mr. Sharma said since the rescued animal was limping, it could have suffered several fractures. The animal’s exact condition will only be known after a thorough medical examination that would include an X-ray and other physical examinations.

“The jackal is in a state of trauma and needs to undergo major surgery. The call for the surgery will be taken tomorrow if it is stable through the night,” he said.

Mr. Kumar, who spotted the jackal said, “I was returning from work last night when I saw that a bike hit the jackal in the left leg, and the animal was limping to a safer place as a reflex action. At first, I thought it was a stray dog but on looking closer, I discovered it was a jackal.”

Hemant B. Karande, round forest officer of Vashi , Sagar Savla, founder of Bhumi Jeevdaya and Jyoti Nadkarni, RAWW volunteer, were among the rescue team. Mr. Savla said they found the animal trapped near the mangroves opposite Delhi Public School.

“It took time to find the animal and the operation lasted one-and-a-half hours. It was difficult to get it because the bushes were dense and we needed torches in case of any snakes.”

Ms. Nadkarni said, blamed the destruction of the animal habitat and resting ground that left the animals with no choice but to search for food in human settlements. “A demarcation on the periphery has to be made and growth should not be at the cost of destruction of habitats. These animals are not trespassing but searching for their lost homes.

375,2020/02/06,Ayushman Bharat ties up with NCG for standardised cancer care,"Ayushman Bharat is closely working with the National Cancer Grid (NCG), a network of major cancer centres across the country, to ensure that those offering cancer surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation therapy and other procedures for cancer under the scheme follow a protocol.

“NCG has tied up with the Ayushman Bharat and we are working on treatment protocols for various cancers. The idea is to tie up the reimbursements with adherence to guidelines,” said Dr. C. Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) and convenor of the NCG.

The NCG identifies itself as a union of cancer centres in the country which could provide uniform and high standards of cancer care, follow uniform evidence-based guidelines for management of patients, develop human resource adequately trained to fulfil the cancer healthcare needs of the entire nation and conduct collaborative clinical research of a high standard. According to Dr. Pramesh, work is on to create a software for the purpose. “This effort will ensure uniform cancer treatment for patients across the country,” he said.

Dr. Shripad Banavali, director, academics, and professor of paediatric and medical oncology at TMH, said the collaboration of NCG with Ayushman Bharat is a win-win for all.

“Centres like TMH which are overburdened with patients may get some relief as patients start getting rational and standard care at other centres.

376,2020/02/06,Mumbai Bagh stares at sabotage,"A day after political participants of the Mumbai Bagh protest declared that they would be withdrawing support to it by Thursday evening, attempts to discourage the core protestors from staying on began on Wednesday.

Called Mumbai Bagh because it is being held on the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protests, the protest began on the night of February 26 outside the Arabia Hotel on Morland Road in Mumbai Central. Late on Monday night, a delegation of political leaders involved with the protest met State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, after which it was decided to call it off on Thursday. The protestors, however, are adamant on continuing it and Thursday is expected to be a day of reckoning for Mumbai Bagh.

Several of the women protesters who have been involved since day one told The Hindu on Wednesday the supply of drinking water, which was being offered by scores of volunteers all through the day, has gone down to a trickle.

“It is not like we were dependant on what they had to offer but the stark difference just a day after the development is hard to ignore. It’s the same case with food. Hundreds of parcels of packed food were being passed around for the past 10 ten days but today, that quantity has dropped significantly,” one of the protesters said.

Another protester said a group of women claiming to be from a religious organisation were seen going around telling women that free sewing machines were being offered to those who withdrew from the protest.

“They came at around 3 a.m., when the number of protesters is at its lowest, but left quickly when we started asking too many questions,” the protester said.

On Wednesday, film director Anurag Kashyap visited the protest site and addressed the protesters. “The battle is a long one and we are facing a bunch of stubborn people. All we have to do is to see the battle to its end in a peaceful manner rather than causing any damage,” Mr. Kashyap said.

Women continue to constitute the majority of the protesters, carrying it forward on a relay basis. School and college students are seen visiting through the day, with many youngsters sketching placards and little children milling around.

377,2020/02/06,nCoV: 4 more quarantined in Maharashtra,"Four people — three in Nagpur and one in Mumbai — suspected to have been exposed to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) were quarantined on Wednesday. Their samples were sent to the newly upgraded nCoV testing facilities at Nagpur’s Indira Gandhi Medical College and Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital.

While the samples were sent to Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) so far, State health officials said the laboratories were upgraded so the load at NIV could be reduced.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed that samples of a 29-year-old man were tested at Kasturba Hospital’s laboratory. The patient, who works in the shipping industry, had travelled to Nantong in China on January 22 and returned on February 2. “He has already tested negative. But since this was the first test at Kasturba Hospital, we will be sending samples to NIV for reconfirmation,” Mr. Kakani said.

As many as 12,799 travellers were screened at the international airport in Mumbai till Wednesday, of which 119 are from the State. Of these, 21 were quarantined and discharged after testing negative. The State has also completed the mandatory follow up of up to 14 days for 40 people while the rest are being followed up every day.

378,2020/02/06,Court denies bail to TISS student charged with sedition,"The city Civil and Sessions Court on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail plea moved by a student of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Urvashi Chudawala, who was booked for sedition for raising slogans in support of arrested Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam at the LGBTQ march, ‘Mumbai Pride’.

Sessions judge Prashant Rajvaidya said the case was of a serious nature, and that the accused needs to be questioned in custody to get to the root of the matter. “The statement uttered by her in support of Imam, prima facie attracts the ingredients of the charges of sedition under Section 124 (a) (Sedition) of the Indian Penal Code, which attracts life imprisonment,” said the judge. “I cannot find anything at this stage that the utterance of the slogan for two seconds by the applicant is not required to be considered as serious.”

The court refused to give Ms. Chudawala any relief to approach the Bombay High Court.

Ms. Chudawala’s lawyer Vijay Hiremath had argued that the charges of sedition cannot be applied, arguing that there has to be a call for violence between two communities, and that his client had not mentioned any word of violence.

“Her protest against Imam’s arrest may be wrong but cannot be sedition,” Mr. Hiremath said. Ms. Chudawala had also contended that the prosecution has just taken part of the slogan and has not considered the names of either Rohit Vermula or Payal Tadvi.

Mr. Hiremath also claimed that the guidelines set by the HC in the case of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi have not been followed. However, chief public prosecutor Jaysingh Desai said, “Freedom of speech is not an issue. Who are you supporting? A person who is against the state.”

Mr. Desai also said the accused had deleted all her posts after she was booked in the case. He said Ms. Chudawala wanted to destroy evidence.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-denies-bail-to-tiss-student-charged-with-sedition/article30746592.ece
379,2020/02/06,Will Fort heritage mile meet its March deadline?,"Most Mumbaikars do the South-for-work, North-back-home routine in a clockwork manner, dodging a hawker here, a road divider there, day after day. But almost every overstretched Mumbaikar will tell you that they have paused more than once to take in the beauty of the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco masterpieces in the Fort area.

The area got its name from a fort that the British constructed in the 17th century to protect the city from invaders. The fort was demolished in the 1860s, but the name stayed.

According to the Urban Design Research Institute’s Fort Management Plan, “The delineation of the Fort precinct is based on the historical extent of what was originally the fortified town. The area encompassed in this fashion is literally the ‘Fort area’.”

However, it says, once the fortifications were removed, the limits were expanded, new public buildings were built in the area “integral to the precinct” : they were designed to physically and visually reinforce the original settlement.

“These buildings (Crawford Market, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Metro Cinema), besides being consistent in terms of architecture and urban design qualities, are integral to the visual image of the Fort precinct when approached either from the North or from the South.”

The precinct is thus rich in colonial history, art and architecture, and in 2018, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Restoration in progress

In May that year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) took up the Fort restoration project. The greatest challenge before the BMC was uneven footpaths, unplanned billboards, overgrown trees, bus stops, stalls and illegal hawkers that blocked a view of the heritage buildings.

Restoration of the corporate district, art district, Oval Maidan, the heritage mile, civic node, tourist district and banking district are all part of the plan. The BMC will spruce up footpaths, re-design bus stops and de-clutter streets. It also plans to bring in an arborist to trim trees.

As a first step, the BMC will focus on the heritage mile, the 900-m stretch of M.G. Road from Flora Fountain to Regal. This part of the project has a March 2020 deadline, which the corporation is not likely to meet.

M.G. Road was chosen as it consists of an ensemble of neo-Gothic and Art Deco architecture: the National Gallery of Modern Art, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahlaya (formerly Prince of Wales Museum), Esplanade Mansion, Mumbai University and even residential buildings.

The project will be replicated in the entire Fort area, making it worthy of the UNESCO Art Deco precinct tag.

When the BMC conceived the project, though, its bids found no takers. But in January 2020, the corporation finalised a contractor for ₹7.51 crore, who will also maintain the precinct for three years after the project is completed.

Under the pilot project, street lights, signages, trees, bus stops and billboards in the area will be changed. For example, bus stops will be replaced with heritage lookalikes using transparent and toughened glass, while billboards of restaurants and corporate offices will be standardised.

Overgrown trees will be pruned to uniform height to offer a clear view of the heritage structures, footpaths will be made more pedestrian-friendly by using in-situ concrete [the concrete is poured on site and cast in place. The other method uses pre-cast concrete, wherein concrete blocks are created in a closed environment, transported to site and kept in place].

Other works include changing the look of of dustbins, tree gratings, benches and flower beds, removing encroachments and displaying information plaques on heritage buildings. Footpaths will also be made disabled-friendly.

“About 70% work on base preparation of the footpath outside the National Gallery of Modern Art is done. While working on this footpath, we re-aligned several stalls and in doing so, had to restore their electric connections,” said an officer from the BMC’s Heritage Cell.

Ducts under the footpath will ensure it will not be dug up for utilities in future, the officer said. The footpath outside Mumbai University will continue to have its basalt stone flooring.

The new bus stop design is minimalist and ensures there are no horizontal hoardings above. Instead, advertisements will an be placed vertically at eye level of the person standing at the bus stop, without hindering the view of the buildings. “We also conducted a comprehensive exercise to find out redundant signages and poles to declutter the Mile. The ward office has been asked to act on it immediately. Several of these signages or poles have been lying here for decades despite not serving any purpose,” the officer said.

The street lights in the area, he said, illuminate the road but not the footpath. “That is why we want two-way street lights to promote pedestrian traffic.”

Challenges

Standardising shop signages may not be cakewalk for the BMC; it will involve organising several meetings with shop, store and restaurant owners of the area.

The BMC is yet to write to shop owners in the area to ask them to standardise their signboards. “We will be holding meetings with shop owners to tell them about the project. They will have to adhere to a particular size of signboard, but we may allow them to retain their font and colours,” said Ashutosh Salil, Deputy Municipal Commissioner in charge of the project. “The rule will apply to every single one of them. Hopefully, we will not have to use the law,” he said.

The BMC is also yet to finalise its agreement with an arborist. The corporation’s Tree Cell is in talks with one to trim the trees and look after them for several years.

The other roadblock the project may come up against is realignment of the hawking pitches and removing unlicensed hawkers. Only licensed hawkers will be allowed to function on the stretch and they will have to adhere to the allocated space in a single file, a move that might meet with opposition.

The BMC is thus hoping to complete the work by May, missing its March deadline.

Conservationists have appreciated the project, but arer concerned about the slow pace of work. “This is a good project if implemented properly but its progress is slow,” said Rajan Jaykar, convenor of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.

“There are standardised signs on D.N. Road in Fort but not on M.G. Road. M.G. Road was neglected despite having heritage buildings like Esplanade Mansion,” said Mr. Rajan.

The BMC should also try and relocate hawkers, and put up illuminated plaques with information of each heritage building, he said.

Whether the BMC can pull all these off given its tight deadline is unclear, although the city will be richer with the restoration.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/73n24w/article30746586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMPAVEMENT2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-fort-heritage-mile-meet-its-march-deadline/article30746589.ece
380,2020/02/06,"PMC Bank scam: 12,000-page second charge sheet filed","The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police on Wednesday filed a second charge sheet into the ₹6,670 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case.

The charge sheet, which goes beyond 12,000 pages, names seven former directors and auditors, including Rajneet Singh, the son of former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Sardar Tara Singh. The charge sheet gives details of the irregularities at the bank and how the directors and auditors ensured that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not get to know about them.

Apart from Mr. Singh, directors Jagdish Mookhey, Trupti Bane and Mukti Bavisi have been booked in the case, along with auditors Jayesh Sanghani, Ketan Lakdawala and Anita Kirdat . They have all been charged for cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, common intention under the Indian Penal Code and under provisions of the Banking Regulation Act.

The directors all knew about the loan accounts of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and had deliberately overlooked the irregularities to further the interests of its promoters Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan.

The EOW in its first charge sheet had described how the bank officials including managing director Joy Thomas and ex-chairman Waryam Singh had connived with others using 20,149 fictitious bank accounts to dupe the bank of ₹6,670 crore. The charge sheet said the directors and other officials of the bank unlawfully handed out loans to HDIL and its entities between 2008 and 2019.

In September 2019, the Enforcement Directorate had registered offences against HDIL, it directors and group companies under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The FIR named eight firms linked to HDIL.

An initial probe by the RBI had revealed that directors of PMC Bank had replaced 44 suspicious loan accounts linked with the HDIL with fictitious bank accounts whose individual balances were low. According to EOW, the banking software was tampered to ensure this was left virtually hidden from the care banking system.

HDIL accounted for nearly 73% of PMC Bank’s total loan. Of the ₹4,355.46 crore loans under scanner, ₹2,145.78 crore were transferred to accounts held by the Wadhawans.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yq6qq1/article30746565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMRAJNEETSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pmc-bank-scam-12000-page-second-charge-sheet-filed/article30746567.ece
381,2020/02/06,"Fire in Mumbai's Malabar Hill building, 18 rescued","Eighteen people were rescued after a fire broke out in a Malabar Hill highrise late on Wednesday night. The building’s firefighting system was found to be non-functional and the narrow lanes leading up to it also posed a challenge .

One fireman Rahul Kawle has been admitted to G.T. Hospital’s ICU for suffocation.

The fire broke out on the fifth floor of Las Palmas building on Little Gibbs road around 8.08 p.m. By 8.26 p.m. the fire was declared level 3 (medium) and eight fire engines, and seven jumbo tankers were deployed.

Fire brigade officials said, the fire broke out in Flat Number 52 on the fifth floor of the building and gradually started spreading to the staircase lobby and the upper floors. At least 18 people were rescued from the building and no casualty was reported among the residents. By 10.30 p.m. the fire was brought under control but the cause of fire was yet to be ascertained.

Chief Fire Officer Prabhat Rahangdale said the fire had covered the entire staircase lobby on the fifth and sixth floor. “People were stuck on the fifth floor and above. Those on the lower floors had managed to escape but those on the upper floors could not find their way out. We managed to control the fire from spreading above the seventh floor and people in that severely affected area were assisted with breathing apparatus,” Mr. Rahangdale said.

“Some residents, including a senior citizen, were on the terrace. We stationed a fireman with them and let them stay at the top till we finished dousing the fire. Some others were rescued by using ladders,” he added.

The building is at a dead end and the sea breeze was fuelling the fire. The narrow entrance of the old building also made it difficult to deploy water tankers. The fire fighting system too was not working, Mr. Rahangdale said.

Shirin Mirchandani, a senior citizen living in the adjacent Flat Number 53, said, “I was at home along with my neighbour when another neighbour came and alerted us about the fire. We waited till the firemen came and led us out of the building.”

Surendra Yadav (24), a house help, said he and his friend climbed down from the seventh floor through a water pipe.

“We first tried to run through the stairs but the staircase was covered in smoke and we were not able to see anything. We stepped out of the window and climbed down through a pipe,” said Mr. Yadav adding that the owners of the house were later rescued by the firemen.

382,2020/02/06,"No NRC in Maharashtra, asserts Uddhav","While claiming that there was no need to fear the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray clarified that his government will not allow the proposed National Register of Citizens to be implemented in the State as it would impact people of all religions.

Mr. Thackeray on Wednesday also announced that he would be travelling to Ayodhya on March 7 and later go to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He was reacting to the Centre’s decision to set up a Ram Temple Trust to build a Ram temple at Ayodhya.

“I can say with confidence that the CAA is not meant to throw Indian citizens out of the country. But, the NRC is going to impact Hindus as well,” said Mr. Thackeray, in the last of a three-part interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana.

While he said that the CAA is not to throw anyone out of India, he also launched a sarcastic comment on the CAA when he said, “When they come here, will they get homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana? What about employment and education of their children? All these issues are important and we have the right to know.”

“As Chief Minister, I should know where will these people be relocated in my state. Our own people don’t have adequate housing. Will these people go to Delhi, Bengaluru or Kashmir, since Article 370 is now scrapped?” he wondered.

“However, the NRC will impact Hindus and Muslims and the State government will not allow it to be implemented,” he said.

Congress expresses reservations

Latching on to his remark that the CAA is not meant to throw Indian citizens out of the country, the Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asked him to declare open and clear support to the controversial act facing opposition from certain quarters. “He should now declare open and clear position of supporting the CAA,” state BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said in a statement.

Congress however expressed reservations over the CM’s statement. Maharashtra Power minister Nitin Raut said that the Congress has passed the resolution to not implement CAA and therefore the issue of implementing it in Maharashtra does not arise. “The issue will be discussed in the coordination committee meeting of the three parties,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-nrc-in-maharashtra-asserts-uddhav/article30746504.ece
383,2020/02/06,All urban bodies in State to get STPs,"The Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to set up sewage treatment plants (STPs) in all urban local bodies in the State.

The total amount of sewage from the 391 local civic bodies is 9,758.53 million litres per day (MLD) and the current sewage treatment system has a capacity of 7,747.24 MLD. “Even though the State has the capacity to treat around 79% of the sewage it produces in urban areas, the National Green Tribunal has mandated it to set up plants to treat increase its sewage treatment capacity by 2,011 MLD. The State Cabinet sanctioned the project on Wednesday,” an official from the urban development department said.

Most major cities like Mumbai, Nasik, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Pune either already have STPs or are constructing them. The first stage of this scheme will involve setting up the sewage treatment capacity in urban bodies, the cost of which is estimated at ₹2,820 crore.

The money for this initiative is likely to be raised from the Centre’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and/or the State sponsored Golden Jubilee Urban Renewal Mega Mission.

384,2020/02/06,"Cash-strapped BMC needs urgent reforms, new funding sources","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) appears to be in the red with Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi dipping into its reserves to withdraw ₹4,380 crore to finance the ₹33,441-crore budget for 2020-21, which was presented on Tuesday. This step ensured that the civic body met the statutory requirement of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act of not showing a budget deficit.

The financial capital’s civic body, which once boasted a rich cash flow, is now grappling with finding new sources of revenue. If the BMC continues to dip into its available reserves of ₹52,286 crore in every budget, the reserves are sure to run dry in about a decade with the civic body’s increasing expenditures. The BMC has another ₹26,382 crore in its reserves which cannot be dipped into even in emergency situations as it has been allotted for committed liabilities like provident fund, pensions, gratuity and other deposits.

It is important to understand why the BMC’s revenue has come under such stress. There are three major factors contributing to this fund crunch.

Firstly, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) two years ago, hit the BMC badly with octroi being discontinued. Octroi’s daily collection method ensured cash inflow, taking care of the BMC’s urgent needs. On the other hand, the GST compensation is a fixed amount given on a fixed date, forcing the civic body to borrow from banks during emergencies. The situation further depends on the State’s own finances, i.e. if finances worsen, the State will not be able to fulfil its commitments.

Secondly, with the discontinuation of octroi, which is now estimated at ₹9,800 crore, the BMC has had to depend largely on property tax as its revenue source, which makes up 22% of its income. However, the collection of property tax is riddled with issues: there are pending litigations and few people and establishments comply, given the lack of strong laws against non-compliance. To add to these problems, in 2019, there was confusion over exempting houses less than 500 square feet from property tax. The actual property tax collected till December was only ₹1,810 crore, making up only 36% of the annual collections in the first three-quarters of the year. The real estate slump also contributed to a steady drop in the income from ‘premiums’.

Thirdly, the 74th Amendment Act recognised municipalities as the third tier, and its 12th Schedule puts down 18 functions to be performed. Only 12 of the 18 functions have a corresponding finance source.

In this budget, the city’s financial planners are seen scrounging for scraps to project revenue in 2020-21. Increasing lease, rent and premiums of all vacant land tenancy properties, providing conditional FSI to regularise areas like flowerbeds and deck lifts, and emphasis on property tax collections are a few steps proposed.

While these steps may help in small ways, serious financial reforms need to be introduced to fix this issue permanently. This can be done through a fixed fund like a city GST that is drawn up based on indicators, so that a share of the GST is mandatorily passed on to cities. The crux lies in reimagining the allocation of funds from the Central government. There will also need to be a fresh thinking on replacing a buoyant tax like octroi with an equally robust source of income for all municipalities.

The replacement cannot be given by the State in the form of a dole or compensation. Some taxes could be passed on to cities and innovative revenue generation methods could be drawn up. There is huge pressure on Mumbai to perform as both a megacity and India’s financial capital.

For now, the city needs help to financially stand. The Central government needs to step in to redefine fund allocation and roles of municipal bodies if it wants Mumbai and other cities to retain their richness and spirit for the years to come.

385,2020/02/06,70 PAPs detained briefly for staging protest in Waghivali,"After a group of project-affected people (PAPs) of the Navi Mumbai airport staged a rasta roko on Tuesday and 70 of them were briefly detained, CIDCO on Wednesday promised them a joint meeting with the Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to resolve their issues.

The PAPs had a held a 38-day protest earlier, which was called off only after a meeting with Mr. Thackeray and Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, who promised them a joint meeting with CIDCO officials.

“We were told no work would be done till the meeting but on Tuesday they took up work at Waghivali village and the angered villagers staged a rasta roko,” Umesh Khandekar, a resident of the village, said.

Contractors assigned by CIDCO had taken up electric line work in the village. “Waghivali comes outside the core area. It won’t have the airport but the electric wires that will provide power supply have to go through the village,” a CIDCO officer said, adding that the PAPs were detained by the police on bandobast duty.

“Close to 70 PAPs were detained and left after we held a meeting with them. We made them understand to not take law in their hands,” senior police inspector Tanvir Shaikh from NRI coastal police station said.

Meanwhile, Ramchandra Mhatre, who represents Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha from Raigad and led the protest, said, “The detention happens on the orders of contractors for whom we are a problem since we are raising our voice. We met CIDCO MD Lokesh Chandra and he has promised that he will soon have a joint meeting with us and CM and get the issues solved.”

Among the main demands of the PAPs are compensation to fishermen who would lose their livelihood to the project, increase in construction aid from ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 per sq.ft. and reconsidering the decision of ‘zero eligibility’ of PAPs for resettlement.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5lroyq/article30746443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMPAPPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/70-paps-detained-briefly-for-staging-protest-in-waghivali/article30746444.ece
386,2020/02/06,Road safety auditors to monitor black spots,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will appoint road safety auditors to ensure safety on major roads. There are as many as 39 black spots on the city’s roads that see a high number of accidents due to their poor design.

Between October 2015 and September 2018, a total of 890 accidents took place at 58 black spots in the city. They resulted in 188 deaths and left 898 people injured.

These 58 black spots have been identified by the traffic police, while the BMC has identified at least 39. Some of these black spots include SV Road in Bandra, Nepean Sea Road, Charni Road junction, and Alfred Talkies junction.

Of these, 17 black spots are on municipal roads and the civic body wants to remove their design flaws to reduce the risk of accidents. The BMC is in the process of inviting proposals for appointing road safety auditors who will survey the spots, prepare detailed reports on the cause of accidents and provide design solutions.

Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal said, “The auditor will conduct a detailed survey of these spots and suggest solutions to eliminate the risk of accidents. We want to do a comprehensive audit of these roads from the point of view of road safety.

387,2020/02/06,"Woman set ablaze in Aurangabad, accused in police custody","A local court in Aurangabad on Wednesday remanded a 40-year-old man in seven-day police custody for assaulting and setting ablaze a 50-year-old woman from the Dalit community in Sillod tehsil.

The incident, which occurred in Andhari village on February 2, came to light in the wake of a similar incident in which a 25-year-old college lecturer in Wardha district’s Hinganghat was set ablaze by a stalker earlier this week.

According to the Aurangabad rural police, one Santosh Sakharam Mohite (40), who runs a liquor shop in the village, was arrested late on Tuesday night and produced before a local court on Wednesday which sent him to police custody.

Mr. Mohite had attempted to barge into the lady’s house late on Sunday night. “The woman, who is married and has two daughters, apparently lived alone in her house and was sleeping when Mohite tried to storm into the house around 11.30 p.m. on Sunday night and assault her. After she tried to resist him, the accused doused the lady in kerosene and set her ablaze. He then locked the door from outside and fled,” said a police official from Sillod, adding that the accused and the victim apparently knew each other.

On hearing her cries, the woman’s relatives residing nearby broke into the house and took her to a local hospital. She was later shifted to a government hospital where she is battling for her life.

According to hospital authorities, she has suffered over 90% burns, is on oxygen support and right now is extremely critical.

The police have booked Mr. Mohite under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code

He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the police said.

“The crimes against women that have occurred in Aurangabad and Wardha distircts are extremely shocking and painful… It is my opinion that those who have dared to commit such heinous acts against the victims must be swiftly awarded the death penalty. Our government has taken serious note of these incidents and we will be fast-tracking both cases to ensure speedy justice,” said State Women and Child Development Minister Yashomati Thakur.

Meanwhile, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in Mumbai said that the police were conducting further investigations in the Aurangabad case, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chitra Wagh slammed Mr. Deshmukh for his alleged insensitivity in hinting that the lady was set ablaze after a relationship between herself and the accused went sour.

Hitting out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for failing to rein in the sharp surge in crimes against women in the State, Ms. Wagh demanded that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray must step down from his post.

388,2020/02/06,Two held from Punjab for cheating 21 people,"The Economic Offences Wing (Unit II) of the Navi Mumbai Police has arrested two men from Punjab for cheating 21 people by promising them jobs abroad.

Narendra alias Navneet Sukhpal Singh (32) was nabbed from Amritsar, while Hira alias Happy Nishan Singh (25) was nabbed from Gurudaspur. They have been remanded in police custody till February 10.

The duo along with Mandeep Singh, who was arrested in August 2018, had started Yash technology and ICS technology at Sector 3 in Kharghar. The police said ICS technology was a popular company and the accused gave the name to their firm to mislead people.

The accused then approached people on Facebook and put up advertisements of jobs for painters, site engineers, security guards and electricians in Russia and Thailand.

“The victims got in touch with the accused, paid the charges and received forged visas. The accused then switched off their cell phones, shut the office and fled,” assistant police inspector Kishore Mekle said.

In August 2018, Hridayanand Madheshya, a resident of Panvel, filed a complaint against the trio. Later, 20 others came ahead and filed similar complaints. “The 21 victims were cheated of ₹6 lakh. We are investigating if more people are involved in the case,” said senior police inspector Vijay Waghmare.

The accused were charged under Sections 420 (cheating) and 465 (forgery) of the Indian Penal Code and under the Immigration Act. “We suspect that more people could have been cheated by the accused in the State and outside it,” Pravinkumar Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-held-from-punjab-for-cheating-21-people/article30746366.ece
389,2020/02/06,5 arrested in Kurar shooting case,"The Kurar police have arrested five men who were allegedly involved in an incident where shots were fired outside a jewellery store in Kurar on February 1.

A police team has been formed to nab the main accused in Vasai and Virar areas. The five accused are associated with the gang of Uday Pathak, who is lodged in Arthur Road Jail for killing a youth in 2011.

The accused have been identified as Nikhil Rokde (30), Vikas Pandey alias Pillu (23), Jitu Garasiya alias Chitlya (30), Suraj Sagre (28) and Pravin Prakash Baviskar (22).

Deputy Commissioner of Police D.S. Swami said the accused were part of the conspiracy. They helped the main accused in his shooting practice near Sanjay Gandhi National Park and did a recee of the jewellery store.

The Kurar police said they found two witnesses based on technical analysis of the CCTV footage. With the help of the witnesses, the police determined the identity of the shooter. Mr. Rokde was arrested from Parel and his interrogation led the police to the other accused.

The arrests of the remaining four accused were made by the detection branch of the Kurar police. The accused told the police that they were promised ₹10,000 each per month for the task.

Mr. Swami said, “The firing was done to show their power and to establish the supremacy of the gang over the traders and with an intention to extract ransom from them.”

Of those arrested, only Mr. Sagre has a criminal record. He has been booked under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons and means.

390,2020/02/06,"₹5,000 crore proposed for bullet train in 2020-21","The Railway Board has allocated ₹5,000 crore to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project through extra-budgetary resources, according to its pink book released for the financial year 2020-21.

The project has been in the midst of a political storm ever since the Maha Vikas Aghadi came to power in Maharashtra. The revised outlay for the project for 2019-20 has been pegged at ₹1,000 crore, most of which, senior railway officials said, has gone towards land acquisition.

The corridor will have a length of 508.17 km, with 155.76 km in Maharashtra and 348.04 km in Gujarat. “In Gujarat, most of the land required for the project has been acquired, but in Maharashtra, only 50% of the required land has been acquired, most of which is government land,” a senior railway official associated with the project said.

In Maharashtra, the project has seen stiff resistance in Palghar, where 109.06 km of the corridor has been planned through several tribal villages.

‘White elephant’

Calling the project a “white elephant”, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said a decision on moving forward with the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project will be taken only after he is convinced it will boost the State’s industrial development.

The ₹1.08 lakh-crore project is being financed with the help of a tied loan from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, which is financing 80% of the cost, with ₹10,000 crore being borne by the central government and ₹5,000 crore each being provided by the Gujarat and Maharashtra governments.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pphj7k/article29463329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUMBAI-AHMEDABAD-BULLET-TRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5000-crore-proposed-for-bullet-train-in-2020-21/article30746300.ece
391,2020/02/06,Dedicated underground utility corridors to be set up,"For the first time, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed to design and build new roads above 60 feet with dedicated underground utility corridors to prevent frequent trenching. The civic body has set aside ₹137 crore for constructing the corridors and shifting utilities. Tenders have been invited for the project.

Over the years, the BMC has failed to maintain flawless roads and engineers have blamed large-scale trenching for the poor quality of roads. They claim that trenching leads to water seepage and surfacing of potholes. Former municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta had even created a trenching policy, which stipulated that agencies should undertake trenching work at the same time to avoid inconvenience to commuters. There are 17 types of utilities in Mumbai.

A senior civic officer from the roads department said, “Sometimes even private agencies cannot help it when there is an emergency. That is when we realised that shifting the utilities to a single underground corridor could be a good option. In that case, whenever they need to be repaired, the entire road will not have to be dug up. The utility will be accessed through this corridor.”

In some western countries, all utilities run inside these ducts which have entries at regular intervals. However, these ducts have sophisticated mechanisms such as CCTV networks, ventilators and fire safety measures.

The five roads, covering 8.7 km, selected for this project are 90 feet road at Ashok Kedare Chowk in Bhandup (West), Aarey Road on the Western Express Highway to Marol toll naka and Filter Pada toll naka, DP Road from Goregaon check point to Hindu cemetery, Cama Estate Road and MG Road extension.

The BMC officer said, “The idea is that once a road is built, there should be no need to dig it up unless the road itself is being repaired. However, designing the ducts will be the biggest challenge since they will have to accommodate the needs of every department. For example, the lines of piped natural gas and electricity cannot be next to each other. They have to be at separate levels. Also, the water department will face an issue as the water mains will have to be carefully placed. If a pipeline bursts, it can flood the duct.” Shifting the utilities to the new corridors will be the next challenge for the BMC.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/75znbb/article30746270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMEASTERNEXPRESSTHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dedicated-underground-utility-corridors-to-be-set-up/article30746271.ece
392,2020/02/06,Rail projects under MUTP get ₹555 crore,"Suburban railway-related projects under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) have received a proposed budgetary allocation of ₹555 crore for the financial year 2020-21. The Railway Board on Wednesday released its proposed allocations to railway-related works and projects across the country including for works being undertaken by Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) and the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC), which is executing the MUTP projects.

The Railway Board has provided an allocation of ₹200 crore for MUTP 2, which includes three key projects — the fifth-sixth line between Thane and Diva, the fifth-sixth line between Kurla and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and the sixth line between Mumbai Central and Borivali. The long-pending Thane-Diva line is expected to be commissioned later this year, railway officials said. Altogether ₹5 crore has been allocated for a few pending works related to the project to make the Harbour Line compatible for 12-coach trains.

MUTP 3 picks up pace

The ₹10,947 crore MUTP 3 has received an allocation of ₹300 crore for the next fiscal, up from ₹283.78 crore in 2019-20. The project includes the construction of two key corridors — Virar-Dahanu quadrupling and a new corridor between Karjat and Panvel, for which land acquisition is under way. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank had approved a loan of $500 million last year for the same project.

The ₹33,690-crore MUTP 3A has received an allocation for ₹50 crore, with the MRVC working to appoint the general consultants for the communication based train control, a state-of-the-art signalling system, later this year.

The second phase of the Seawoods-Belapur-Uran line has received ₹100 crore, among the major allocations received for CR. The first phase of the corridor between Nerul and Kharkopar was inaugurated in November 2018.

The other major allocations went to the third line between Karjat and Kasara and the proposed coach manufacturing unit in Latur, both receiving ₹55 crore for the next fiscal year. Two key road over bridges at Vikhroli and Diva have received an allocation of ₹3 crore and ₹7 crore respectively. The proposed coaching complex at Panvel Kalamboli, which will serve several Konkan Railway trains, has received ₹8 crore, while a token allocation of ₹1,000 has been made towards converting CSMT into a world-class museum.

A new terminal at Jogeshwari station has been allocated ₹1 crore in 2020-2021. The project to reduce the travel time between Mumbai and Delhi has received a token allocation of ₹1,000, and the final estimates are being worked out. The project is expected to cost around ₹11,000 crore and is proposed to be financed through external sources. The ₹12-crore project towards the heritage restoration of Bandra station has received ₹4.24 crore. Tenders for the project had been called last year, after the consultancy report was approved, and work is expected to start this year.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xam302/article30746252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMRAILBUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rail-projects-under-mutp-get-555-crore/article30746253.ece
393,2020/02/06,BMC road projects: external auditors back in favour,"Following the road scam in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had decided to do away with third party auditors, who had proved to be negligent in work.

However, in a new announcement, the BMC has decided to appoint quality assessment groups to oversee the maintenance of roads within the guarantee period. The payment to the contractor will be released only after these assessment groups approve the quality of the road construction.

Deferred payments

In another experiment to tackle the poor quality of roads, the civic body has introduced a system of deferred payments to road contractors. For new contracts, 80% of the payment will be made after the completion of work, while 20% will be during the guarantee period. Some road projects will be awarded based on a 60:40 formula.

The deferred payments are meant to ensure that the contractors fulfil their responsibility of maintaining the road within the guarantee period. If a road develops potholes during this period, it will be the contractor’s responsibility and not the BMC’s to fix them. The system has been brought in as the BMC received a large number of complaints from residents about potholed roads and civic officials had to follow up with the contractors to get the roads repaired.

From now on, to assess if the contractor is properly maintaining the road during the guarantee period, the BMC will select quality groups through global competition. “The payments shall only be released to the contractor if the quality group can validate that the road is as per the quality mentioned in the contract,” Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said in his budget speech on Tuesday.

The Municipal Commissioner said the quality groups will comprise auditing firms or individuals with technical audit experience.

Vijay Singhal, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of roads, said, “We are also discussing including public representatives in the committee. So far, contractors were not serious about maintaining roads during the defect liability period, which led to poor roads. With staggered payments, a contractor will be paid 80% of the amount upon completion, while the rest will be paid during or at the end of this guarantee period. There has to be accountability.”

False reports

The Municipal Commissioner said the money will be released after completion of work every year in the defect liability period. A charge sheet in the road scam had revealed that two auditing companies had given false reports to protect the contractors’ shoddy work.

The police had arrested 42 people from the two auditing firms, besides contractors and civic officers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mwx0vw/article30746238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMEASTERNFREEWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-road-projects-external-auditors-back-in-favour/article30746239.ece

Both the accused were produced before the Special MCOCA court and have been remanded in police custody till February 15.

In January, the Crime Branch had arrested Mr. Lakdawala from Patna on charges of extortion and threatening a developer from Bandra. He was arrested after his daughter Sonia and elder brother Aquil were arrested in the case. There are 31 cases of extortion against Mr. Lakdawala and 80 written complaints have been lodged against him.

While producing Mr. Lakdawala before the MCOCA court, the Crime Branch said his custody was needed to find out the trail of money which he had received through the extortion racket, and where he had parked the money. The agency also said it wanted to know the means of communication Mr. Lakdawala used to engineer his extortion racket. The officers said his custody was necessary to gather technical evidence.

395,2020/02/06,BJP likely to remove Lodha as Mumbai city chief,"Barely six months after being appointed as the BJP’s Mumbai unit president, developer Mangal Prabhat Lodha is likely to be replaced. According to party sources, Mr. Lodha’s performance has come under a cloud over the past three months. The leadership is also believed to have received complaints against his style of functioning.

The high profile MLA from Malabar Hill was appointed the city unit chief in July, 2019, replacing Bandra MLA and senior leader Ashish Shelar. With an estimated net worth of over ₹30,000 crore between him and his company Macrotech Developers (formerly Lodha Group), Mr. Lodha is among the most successful developers in the country.

Among those who are being tipped to replace Mr. Lodha are Atul Bhatkhalkar (MLA from Kandivali) and Parag Alavani (Vile Parle MLA). Both have a reputation of being approachable and accessible while they have been found actively giving time to party workers, party sources said.

“It is more an issue of finding time for Mr. Lodha rather than his style of functioning. He is just too busy to dedicate himself full time to the party. The high command is aware that under his leadership we won more than 80% seats in the Assembly elections. So this is certainly not about performance alone,” said a BJP leader.

After being appointed city chief, Mr. Lodha had set for the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance a target of winning all 36 Assembly seats in Mumbai.

Mr. Lodha had also set the tone of the campaign by raising issues of nationalism and identity politics with regards to illegal immigrants in the city. He was subsequently served a show cause notice by the Election Commission (EC) for his remarks during a rally at Mumbadevi in which he had claimed explosives for the 1991 Mumbai blasts were manufactured in the bylanes dotted with minority homes.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3pm0b3/article30746175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMLODHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-likely-to-remove-lodha-as-mumbai-city-chief/article30746176.ece

In a memorandum to the Speaker, nominated legislators belonging to BJP, V. Saminathan, K. G Shankar and S. Selvaganapathy said as per section 18 of the Act, the Legislative Assembly was empowered to enact laws on matters enumerated in the State and Concurrent lists. The subject of Citizenship falls under the domain of the Central list and hence the Assembly has no power to discuss the issue, the memorandum said.

“Consequently, any discussion on CAA exceeds the legislative powers of the Assembly and must not be permitted in the Assembly. Any discussion on CAA will be a violation of Constitution of India under which all of us have taken oath and pledged to uphold the constitution,” the memorandum said.

398,2020/02/06,Puducherry CM Narayanasamy demands for more excavations in Arikamedu,"Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has stressed the need for more archaeological excavations in Arikamedu.

Speaking at the three-day international conference on Tamil culture on Thursday, the Chief Minister said the site has not been fully explored to find the remnants of a bygone era. The excavations that took place led to the unearthing of priceless ancient structures and artefacts.

Recalling his tenure as Union Minister during UPA- 2, the Chief Minister said the Ministry of Culture had sanctioned ₹60 crore for further excavations and development of Arikamedu. But not much progress was made during the last few years, he said.

Acknowledging the contribution of writers in promoting Tamil language in the Union Territory, he said if not for the diaries of Ananda Ragapillai, the present generation would not have been able to understand the rich history of the region. It continued to be a window into the political, administrative and social mileu of the French rule and era before, the Chief Minister said.

He also bestowed ‘Ulaka Tamil Mamani,’ award to 23 eminent personalities from the literary field.

Vice-Chancellor of Pondicherry University Gurmeet Singh in his inaugural address said the establishment of a Centre for Tamil Literature would pave the way for translation of major Tamil classics into several Indian languages. The setting up the Centre was in an advanced stage, he added.

Addressing a press conference here, Puducherry Assembly AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan said all indications signal the government’s intent to present a vote on account like in the past.

The government was aware of the fact that the Centre had increased the grant for the Union Territory by 10.22 per cent for the fiscal 2020-2021. Quoting the Union Budget, he said the allocation has been increased to ₹1,703 crore from ₹ 1,545 crore. When the Central allocation was clear, the government could easily present the budget by taking into account the anticipated revenue through internal mobilisation, he added.

The Chief Minister cannot make excuses for presenting a vote on account. The government has enough time left to present a full budget before the financial year. The Lt Governor who is the Chairman of the State Planning Board should immediately intervene to present a full budget, he added.

400,2020/02/06,Pondicherry University students begin indefinite protest against fee hike,"Hundreds of students of Pondicherry University on Thursday boycotted classes and marched towards the administrative building on the campus, to mark their protest against the fee hike and transport fees introduced for day scholars.

The students, belonging to various departments, assembled on the campus at around 10 a.m. responding to a call by the Students Council to ‘Occupy Admin’ block till the fee hike was withdrawn.

Parichay Yadav, president of Pondicherry University Students Council alleged that academic fees for most of the courses were increased disproportionately last year. In addition, transport fees of ₹4,000 per annum were introduced for day scholars. The previous Students Council had opposed this fee hike and some amount of fees in MBA, MCA, MSc. Computer Science and PhD programmes were reduced. Though the Vice-Chancellor constituted a grievances committee to look into the demands, the committee gave false promises and deviated from the demands, he alleged.

Mr. Yadav said that the Students Council consistently followed up the issue but the administration was adamant in not accpeting their demands. This attitude of the administration clearly demeans the ongoing students struggle that strives to make education accessible and affordable, he said.

The Students Council, along with day-scholar students, not only questioned this newly introduced ‘transport’ fee but also provided factual data to show how there has been an increase of even 225 % in some departments, he pointed out. However, the administration chose to go forward with the anti-student, anti-marginalised section move, he alleged.

The hike in fees will deny a larger section of society access to a Central university, said V. Kuralanban, secretary of the Students Council.

401,2020/02/06,"Awards presented to SPB, Sangakkara","“I have not received an honour like this,” said playback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. It seemed a surprising remark, coming from an ace playback singer with several coveted national and international honours.

But it was not merely the grandeur of the awards ceremony organised by Sri Lanka’s Kamban Kazhagam that moved him. The singer, whose “greatest passion after music” is cricket, got to share the dais with one of the most admired icons of the sport – Kumar Sangakkara.

Bringing the two icons – of film music and cricket – together, with other accomplished Sri Lankans, was the Kamban Kazhagam in Colombo, named after the 12th century Tamil bard who penned the celebrated ‘Kamba Ramayanam’, a take on the Ramayana in Tamil verse. His writing has inspired many spanning centuries, leading to a body of work marked by high scholarship and literary appeal. Today, there are Kamban Kazhagams world over, organising literary festivals.

“Only 10 % of this [Kamban Pugazh] award must go to me. The rest of it is meant for the innumerable instrumentalists who played with me, the composers and lyricists who gave me these songs, the recording artistes and most of all, all of you who listen to it,” said SPB, an artiste with a record of over 40,000 songs, and a huge, fan base among Sri Lankan Tamils. In 2016, he performed live to a large audience in Jaffna, in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province.

“I have no qualms saying this on stage, I haven’t seen an audience as receptive to Tamil art and culture in Sri Lanka, anywhere else in the world,” the singer said at Tuesday’s event, held at the sea-facing Ramakrishna Hall in Colombo’s Wellawatte area, a predominantly Tamil neighbourhood. The hall was packed, forcing organisers to provide impromptu, additional seating along the aisle adjoining the auditorium. And yet, there were many more, watching the ceremony standing behind.

“I am so thrilled to be here with Sangakkara. You’re a great human being and one of the finest ambassadors of Sri Lankan culture,” SPB told the cricketer on stage. That was also why the organisers decided to honour Sangakkara, who received a spontaneous standing ovation from the audience.

Founded by scholar 'Kambavarithy' Ilankai Jeyaraj 40 years ago in Jaffna, the organisation’s Colombo chapter is celebrating its silver jubilee this year.

Essentially a forum for debate and discussion on Tamil literature and culture, the Kazhagam has been honouring prominent Sri Lankans from different fields and ethnicities every year. “From 2009, when the war ended, we strongly felt that we must honour at least one Sinhalese person every year. Sangakkara, as an icon who stands for ethnic harmony, was a natural choice for our committee,” Mr. Jayaraj told The Hindu.

The other awardees were Tamil parliamentarian and senior lawyer M.A. Sumanthiran, High Court Judge Justice S. Thurairaja, writer A. Muttulingam, senior bureaucrat V. Sivagnanasothy and research scholar A.M. Nahiya.

“I am humbled,” said Mr. Sangakkara, currently president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) , calling for harmony in diversity, and emphasising there was “no room for exclusivity or suspicion”. He was reiterating a message that he powerfully expressed at his famous MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s in 2011. Kamban Kazhagam deemed it fit to play excerpts of his speech there, with a Tamil translation.

His reference in the video clip, to his parents sheltering Tamil friends during the gory 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, and his message saying: “I am Tamil, I’m Sinhalese, I’m Muslim & Burgher.

Sivakolandhu bestowing power to appoint SEC with the elected government.

The Committee has decided to question him once again as he had “failed” to give a convincing reply during the first inquiry on January 27, said a member in the committee.

“During the inquiry, the Chief Secretary agreed to give a written reply in five days on the reasons for issuing the advertisement. So far, he has not submitted the reply. So, on Wednesday, the committee sent a notice asking him to appear on Monday,” the member told The Hindu.

L-G takes objection

Questioning the rationale of serving show-cause notice on the Chief Secretary when the judiciary was seized of the issue, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi, in a WhatsApp message, to reporters said, “This matter is under very active consideration of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court and being heard most expeditiously. And the Centre is defending its own decision in the court through Additional Solicitor General.”

Mr. Kumar was under instruction from the Government of India to comply with its directions to appoint SEC in a “fair” manner. “Serving such notices on the senior most civil servant may cause distraction in the day-to-day administration.

407,2020/02/06,Govt. to develop three schools as model institutions: CM,"The government has decided to develop three of its schools as model institutions under the corporate social responsibility programme, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said here on Wednesday.

Participating in a conclave on “Evolution of new age teaching — challenges and opportunities,” organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Chief Minister said the Education Department would work in tandem with CII to develop model government schools. Two would be in Puducherry and the other one in Karaikal.

Complimenting the Education Department for the steps taken to improve the academic performance of children, the Chief Minister said the pass percentage in Class 10 and 12 had increased in the last two years. While the pass percentage in 2018 was 88, it was 95 last academic year. In Plus Two, the pass percentage increased from 73.7 to 85.6 during the same period, he said.

Hits out at L-G

Taking a dig at the Lt. Governor, the Chief Minister said the government was able to achieve much in all fields despite hindrances from certain quarters. “Several industries want to set up factories. But when we sought sanction from the Lt. Governor to transfer land, she referred the matter to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs causing unnecessary delay,” he said.

Minister for Agriculture R. Kamalakannan said the responsibility of teachers was to prepare children face a competitive world.

408,2020/02/06,Modi govt. afraid of youth: Aishe Ghosh,"Accusing the Narendra Modi government of being fearful of the opinionated youth of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh has said the students would resist any attempt to dismantle public education.

She was addressing ‘We are One,’ a protest gathering organised by the Kerala University Union in solidarity with the students of various universities protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), at the Gandhi Park here on Wednesday.

“During election campaigns, they would woo the youth telling them that they are the strength of India. But when the youth question their wrong policies, they tell us that we are kids, who should not speak about these things. The youth are threatened and attacked for asking these questions. The youth have to understand that we have to be vocal about policies, especially those concerning the education sector,” she said.

Constitution’s vanguard

She said the youth who looked up to Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar and Savitribai Phule would not cow down before the foot soldiers of Golwarkar and Savarkar, who wrote apology letters for fighting the British.

“Bhagat Singh was a youth, like us protesting students, when he was hanged for raising questions and demanding independence. Now the government is acting similarly, slapping UAPA and sedition cases on youth. They are giving tags like ‘tukde tukde gang’ to these students. We are the vanguard of our Constitution and we are not going to move an inch back,” said Ms. Ghosh.

Fee hike issue

About the fee hike in the JNU, which fuelled a major student protest, she said education was not a commodity for sale, but wat is something which should be provided free by the government for all.

“When marginalised students think about the JNU, they do not think about the tuition fees. They think about how they can crack the entrance examination, which is not the case in private institutions or even IITs. Thousands of students from many universities came together because they understood that this government is exploiting students and trying to privatise our spaces. The onslaught now is against the education sector, evident from the poor allocations in the budget, which is why the recent Delhi High Court verdict that the government has to fund public education is important,” she said. Ms. Ghosh thanked the people and students of Kerala for being the first to express solidarity with the students of the JNU when they faced a murderous attack from ABVP, and for the sustained protests against the CAA and the NRC.

More than a month later, he is now in quarantine in a government hospital here, since the Health Department here is leaving no stone unturned in maintaining vigilance against the virus.

According to sources, he had left home in the last week of December, with Sri Lanka being his first pit stop. Later, he travelled to Delhi and Bengaluru, from where he arrived in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. However, since he came from the country from where the virus originated, hotel owners in Thampanoor were not keen on accommodating him.

Later, he went to the Police Commissioner’s office, and the police personnel lost no time in informing the General Hospital, where he is now being kept in quarantine for three weeks.

411,2020/02/06,Case against petitioner in idol theft case,"Srirangam Police have registered a case against Rengarajan Narasimhan – a petitioner in the case relating to alleged theft of idols from the Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple- for having allegedly posted photo of the temple’s processional deity Sri Namperumal without holy clothes and ‘kavachams’ in the social media recently.

The case was booked on Wednesday based on a complaint preferred by the temple’s Joint Commissioner / Executive Officer P. Jayaraman. Mr. Jayaraman had lodged a complaint addressed to the Commissioner of Police, Tiruchi and the Srirangam Police. A complaint was earlier given to the Joint Commissioner signed by ‘Archakas’, ‘Arayars’ and ‘Parisaaragal’ earlier.

In the police complaint, Mr. Jayaraman had stated that Rengarajan Narasimhan had posted the photos of the processional deity without holy clothes and ‘kavachams’ in the social media for “self publicity” and with the intention to tarnish the reputation of the temple. The act of Rengarajan Narasimhan was against the temple’s ‘sampradhayam’, Mr. Jayaraman said.

Mr. Jayaraman in the complaint further stated the ‘kavachams’ of the processional deity would be removed using seven screens as a cover. Barring the priests none could see the idol at that time and this was an age-old practice that was being followed.

He further said that the photo could have been taken by someone stealthily during ‘Swarna Bandhanam’ (patch work made on the idol with gold) to remove some minor defects and the photo had been posted by Rengarajan Narasimhan in the social media.

The idol without holy clothes and ‘kavachams’ could not be seen by anyone barring the priests, he said adding that ‘kavchams’ would be removed once a year during the ‘Jestabhishekam’ of Sri Namperumal and ‘Ekaantha Thirumanjanam’ performed for the deity.

Mr. Jayaraman said the posting of photos in the social media by Rengarajan Narasimhan had shocked the priests and devotees who had expressed their feelings of regret and anxiety. He sought appropriate action against Rengarajan Narasimhan for spreading defamatory news to create confusion in the mind of the devotees and public and sought appropriate action.

Police sources said the case was booked under IPC sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295 (A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and section 67 of the IT Act.The accused was yet to be arrested, said the sources.

413,2020/02/06,BDU opens its doors again for distance education programmes,"After a gap of few years, Bharathidasan University has called for applications for making calendar year admission for distance education programme, by virtue of being accredited at A+ Grade by National Assessment and Accreditation Council.

The admission notification has been issued in anticipation of approval by the Distance Education Board of University Grants Commission, it is learnt.

BDU does not figure in the updated list of higher educational institutions brought out by the Distance Education Bureau last November under category - 1, that are entitled to offer programmes through Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mode.

According to official sources, BDU had applied during December for DEB approval of UG, PG and professional courses, to be offered through its Centre for Distance Education for the calendar year 2020.

The CDE, in its recent notification for calendar year admissions had invited applications for B.A. - Economics, English, History, and Tamil, B.Com, B.B.A, B.Sc. - Physics, and Yoga for Human Excellence, and B.L.I.S.(One-year programme); M.A. - History, English, Tamil, M.Com, M.Sc. - Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Physics, and Yoga for Human Excellence; and M.B.A. and M.C.A. (lateral entry).

The notification states that the last date for submission of filled-in applications is February 28.

“There were time constraints for calendar year admissions. Our application is under process and we are hopeful that the approval of the DEB could be obtained over the next couple of weeks,” Director In-Charge of CDE A. Ilangovan said.

The BDU qualifies for offering distance education by virtue of having secured A+ ranking in the third cycle with a score of 3.32 on a 4-point scale as against the minimum requirement of 3.26 specified by the UGC for the purpose, Prof. Ilangovan said.

Also, the BDU was ranked 60 in university ranking in the India Rankings 2019 of National Institutional Ranking Framework.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bdu-opens-its-doors-again-for-distance-education-programmes/article30754203.ece
414,2020/02/06,Bio control agents to control virulent fungal disease in banana undergoing field tests,"A consortia of bio control agents developed by the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi to control the invasive fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Foc TR4) disease in banana is undergoing field tests and has been showing promising results.

Disclosing this here on Thursday, S. Uma, Director, NRCB, said the field tests were under way in Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. “Incidence of Foc TR4, which devastates banana plantations, has been reported in the States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and can spread to other States through planting material, soil, irrigation water and bunch stalk. Effective quarantine of diseased plants is highly important as Australia has demonstrated. We are advocating an integrated approach to manage the fungal disease and the measures have to be taken on a war footing. The bio control agents developed by NRCB will be available after the field tests,” Dr.Uma said.

The virulent strain of the fungal disease has been reported in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Australia, and other countries. India accounts for 27% of the global banana production and produces about 29.3 million tonnes of banana from a cultivated area of about 8.03 lakh hectares across the country.

Addressing a press conference here to brief the media on an international conference on banana and a national banana show to be hosted jointly by the NRCB in association with Bioversity International in Tiruchi from February 22 to 25, Dr. Uma said a satellite international workshop on Foc TR4 would be held as part of the conference. National and international scientists working on the fusarium wilt in banana would conduct a brainstorming session to come up with global mitigation strategies.

Besides, an international training programme on Foc TR4 has also been lined up as part of the event to sensitise researchers, farmers, tissue culture companies, students and quarantine officials on prevention and control of the dreaded disease threatening banana plantations across the world, she said.

In Tamil Nadu, the Grand Naine variety of banana grown in Theni has been widely affected by a different strain (TR1) forcing many farmers to switch over to red banana and nendran varieties, which are resistant to the disease, Dr. Uma said and added that scientists attending the conference would also undertake a field trip to Theni.

The conference, Dr.Uma, said would focus on Innovations in sustainable production and value chain management in banana. The way forward in exporting Indian bananas would also be discussed in detail. The meet would provide an inter-disciplinary forum for researchers, entrepreneurs and stake holders to discuss the opportunities and threats faced by the banana industry. About 600 scientists from India and abroad are expected to participate in the three day conference.

On February 23 and 24, a national banana show, featuring about 300 banana varieties from across the country, including many traditional varieties and those from the North East, would be showcased. Value added products of banana and machines for producing the same would also be on display.

415,2020/02/06,Farmers in Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts in a fix due to lack of equipment for the paddy harvest,"A large number of farmers in Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts claim that they were unable to harvest the crop due to non-availability of harvesting machines. Some others allege that delay in opening of (DPC) direct procurement centres has forced them to stock the harvested paddy in the open.

Farmers say that paddy ready for harvest still remains on several thousands of acres of farms in Tiruvarur and Thanjaur districts as the number of harvesting machines available was inadequate to meet the demand for such machines.

Claiming that harvesting has been hit due to non-availability of harvesting machines, Kaliyamoorthy of Thenodacheri and Raj of Kaanur in Tiruvarur district, said that unable to bear the weight of the grains, the crop had lodged at several places which might result in lesser yield.

Further, farmers were forced to shell out more to hire machines from private parties as they were demanding no less than ₹1,000 in addition to the charges fixed by the District Administration, they added.

Expressing anguish over the situation, S. Sundaram of Maharajapuram in Thanjavur district said that though some of the farmers were even ready to pay higher charges to engage harvester machines, the shortage of machines has left them high and dry. The officials should chalk out some plan to help ryots facing this piquant situation, he demanded.

Pointing out that most of the harvester machine service providers in the delta region were not the real owners of the machines, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association secretary S.Vimalanathan said the government officials should come out with a plan to eliminate the middlemen and help farmers establish a direct link with the original owners of these machines who are residents of other districts in Tamil Nadu and from borders areas in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

As a long-term measure, the government should come forward to extend subsidies to farmers for purchasing hand held harvesters or mini-harvesters as in the past when officials had motivated the farmers to purchase nursery planting and thrashing machines through subsidy, said Mr. Sundaram.

Meanwhile, a group of ryots led by R. Senthilkumar, secretary, Ammapettai Union, CPI staged a road roko on the Thanjavur-Nagapattinam Road at Pallavaroyan Pettai alleging that paddy had not been procured for the past 15-days at the Pallavaroyan Pettai DPC.

They raised slogans condemning the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation for not procuring the paddy harvested by the ryots. They had also alleged that the farmers were being turned away by the DPC staff at several places citing various reasons though adequate gunny bags were available at the centres.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/n7d5g8/article30753898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY07HARVESTTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/paddy-is-ripe-for-harvest-but-no-harvesters-in-sight/article30753900.ece

The usually introverted Messi caused a stir by criticising his former team mate Abidal on Tuesday, saying in a post on Instagram that the club's hierarchy, not the players, should take responsibility for sacking Ernesto Valverde last month.

Abidal had told newspaper Sport that he had sensed that “many players weren't satisfied or working hard” under Valverde. Messi responded by saying Abidal should name which players he had in mind so as not to tarnish the image of the entire squad.

Messi's intervention dominated the front pages of Wednesday's sports newspapers: Sport said his reaction had caused a 'tsunami', Marca declared the Argentine had delivered 'a knockout blow', while AS headlined their edition 'FC Chaos'.

Setien said he had spoken to the players about the disagreement for around a minute and that they were only concerned about their upcoming matches, beginning with Thursday's Copa del Rey quarter-final tie at Athletic Bilbao.

“I will do everything to ensure this does not affect the team, all I'm interested in is tomorrow's game and the obligation to get through to the next round. I can't control anything else and won't waste my energy,” he told reporters. “This situation doesn't affect me, all I can do is give the players the tools they need to make the most of their talent. Every single club has its problems but there are things I can't control, so please, only talk to me about football.”

Messi's criticism of Abidal came on the same day Barca learned that winger Ousmane Dembele had ruptured his hamstring and would miss the rest of the season, adding to their shortages in attack while Luis Suarez recovers from knee surgery.

Setien said that he was more concerned about Dembele's injury than Messi's musings on social media, adding that the club's all-time goalscorer was in good spirits and did not need to be reminded about his responsibilities.

“Of course I believe he is as motivated as ever, he's smiling, he looks well and he loves coming here to train. He's the same as yesterday or the day before,” Setien added. “Messi has enough experience and ability to know what he needs to do, I'm not going to get involved in his life or anyone else's. I'm not the father of any of these players, all I have to do is get them to train. The rest isn't part of my job.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/75didl/article30748442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-SPAIN-FCB-LVTREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/messi-hits-back-at-club-director-who-criticised-barcelona-players/article30748444.ece
419,2020/02/06,FA Cup: Son clinches Tottenham's 3-2 win over Southampton,"Son Heung-min’s late penalty secured Tottenham’s progress in the FA Cup on Wednesday, clinching a 3-2 victory over Southampton in a fourth-round replay.

Son was awarded the penalty despite going down under minimal contact from goalkeeper Angus Gunn, and converted it himself in the 87th minute. Tottenham will host another Premier League club, Norwich, in the fifth round in the first week of March.

Tottenham took the lead fortuitously after Tanguy Ndombele’s off-target shot was diverted into his own net by Southampton defender Jack Stephens in the 12th minute.

Danny Ings hit the crossbar for Southampton before the visitors did manage to level in the 34th.

Nathan Redmond found space in Spurs’ penalty area to send in a low shot that goalkeeper Hugo Lloris could only parry into the path of Shane Long, who knocked in the rebound.

There was a blow for Southampton when midfielder James Ward-Prowse was carried off on a stretcher with a knee injury. But Southampton took the lead in the 72nd following a superb break by Redmond.

The winger picked up the ball on the edge of his own area after Southampton cleared a right-wing cross Serge Aurier before setting off downfield.

Redmond skipped past two Tottenham defenders before knocking it past a third to run clear into the home side’s half. He slid a pass into Ings, who cut inside Japhet Tanganga and curled into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.

The lead lasted just five minutes, though, thanks to Lucas Moura’s strike. The Brazilian weaved his way towards the edge of the penalty area, played a one-two with Dele Alli, and fired into the bottom corner.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/loegbp/article30748217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1204289521,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fa-cup-son-clinches-tottenhams-3-2-win-over-southampton/article30748219.ece
420,2020/02/06,Mueller shines as Bayern squeeze into German Cup quarter-finals,"Thomas Mueller weighed in with a goal and an assist as holders Bayern Munich squeezed past Hoffenheim 4-3 on Wednesday to reach the quarter-finals of the German Cup.

Mueller's golden run continued at the Allianz Arena to leave him with seven goals and nine assists in the 14 games since Hansi Flick replaced Niko Kovac as coach last November.

Not to be outdone, Mueller's forward partner Robert Lewandowski claimed two goals in the third round tie.

However, Hoffenheim's Israeli forward Munas Dabbur caused Bayern a few nervous moments with two late goals as the visitors came back from 4-1 down.

It was Mueller who had calmed Bayern's early nerves, forcing an own goal from Benjamin Huebner to equalise after Bayern defender Jerome Boateng had turned the ball into his own net.

Mueller then gave Bayern a 2-1 lead before Lewandowski netted either side of half-time to extend their lead before Hoffenheim's late fight back.

Bayern are the biggest name into the last eight after RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund both crashed out on Tuesday to Eintracht Frankfurt and Werder Bremen respectively.

After Lewandowski had an early goal disallowed for offside, Hoffenheim threatened an upset when Boateng turned a shot by Hoffenheim winger Ihlas Bebou into his own net on eight minutes.

However, the lead lasted just five minutes.

Canadian winger Alphonso Davies crossed to Mueller in the middle, but the ball clipped the knee of Huebner and looped into the net.

Bayern were 2-1 up on 20 minutes when David Alaba's cross found Mueller and the Germany star fired home from close range.

Lewandowski then pounced when Hoffenheim goalkeeper Philipp Pentke failed to claim a high ball under pressure from Mueller.

The Poland striker was on hand to head the stray ball into an empty net on 36 minutes and settled the matter with a well-taken fourth goal after the break.

Lewandowski has scored in all four of Bayern's matches so far in 2020 and leaves him with a season tally of 35 goals in 29 games in all competitions.

Union Berlin are also through after seeing off minnows Verl from Germany's four tier with a 1-0 win thanks to a late goal by midfielder Robert Andrich.

A goal by Argentinian striker Lucas Alario helped Bayer Leverkusen to a 2-1 win at second division side VfB Stuttgart.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hnfzzs/article30747912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THTHOMASMUELLER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/mueller-shines-as-bayern-squeeze-into-german-cup-quarter-finals/article30747913.ece
421,2020/02/06,Scientific temper to the fore at INSPIRE-MANAK expo,"Students from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagram districts showcased their scientific temper, with 383 innovative projects being disaplyed at the three-day Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) and Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge (MANAK) Science Exhibition 2019-20, which began here on Wednesday.

The students from government and private schools explained about their projects to the visitors. The models focussed on environment-friendly methods, water conservation, women safety, road safety among others.

Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao inaugurated the exhibition at SFS School in Seethammadhara.

‘Fingerprint Voting System’

G.N.V. Pradeep and M. Jeevan Pranay, both students of GVMC High School, Anakapalle, exhibited a model on ‘Fingerprint Voting System’. “The idea is to showcase a design that can prevent rigging of votes by using finger print technology. Our project is based on the use of Arduino Uno, a micro-controller board. First, it will enrol the fingerprints of voters. When they come to the booth, the machine will scan their fingers and match it with the enrolled prints. The voter can exercise their franchise only if the fingerprints match,” explained Mr. Pradeep.

His project partner Jeevan added that the machine can prevent voters to exercise their franchise twice. “Our project prevents voting by the same person multiple times,” he said, adding that it took several months to ready the project with the help of their guide. He put the equipment cost at around ₹6,000.

N. Vijaya Lakshmi from Bhargavi Vidyamandir, Visakhapatnam has exhibited a model of “Speed checker for highways”, using sensors. A student from KGBV, Bheemili, N. Rama made a project on “Women Safety and Tracking system”.

S. Hima, a student from ZP High School, Payakaraopeta, has come up with an idea of preparing compost using household wastes, which can be used to grow plants and vegetables.

According to District Science Officer (DSO) K. Prasad, as many as 3,286 projects were sent by the students from Visakhapatnam district alone, of which 319 projects were approved and funded by the government.

State-level expo

“The government has given six themes for the exhibition—Digital India, Make In India, Skill India, Swachha Bharat, Swastha Bharat among others,” he said.

A 15-member jury will select the best 40 projects and those will get a chance to be displayed at the State-level competitions, scheduled to be held from February 11 to 13 in Kadapa. “The students selected in State-level expo will get a chance to display their projects in the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/pnxfai/article30745772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VZ2INSPIRESCIENCEEXHIBITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/scientific-temper-to-the-fore-at-inspire-manak-expo/article30745774.ece
422,2020/02/06,"Youth arrested, 41 kg hashish oil seized in Chintapalle","The excise and prohibition officials arrested a youth on charge of preparing hashish oil, a potent psychedelic drug extracted from ganja, at Boddaputtu of Chintapalle mandal in Visakhapatnam district on Tuesday late night. The officials have seized 41 kg hashish oil, with an estimated market value of ₹20 lakh. The officials also recovered 240 kg dry ganja and the machinery allegedly used to prepare hashish oil.

The accused has been identified as G. Chinna Rao (24) from Boddaputtu village in Chintapalle mandal.

Acting on a tip-off, a team of excise officials led by Chintapalle division Inspector S. Simhadri, with the support of the local police, raided a house at Boddaputtu, approximately 14 km from Annavaram. Officials said that the youth allegedly had been procuring ganja from farmers and extracting hashish oil.

Meanwhile, police investigation has revealed that the accused had learnt the process of preparing hashish oil a few months ago and started his own business in the village. The accused reportedly confessed that it was his first consignment. “He had received orders from smugglers in Kerala. It takes 50 kg ganja to prepare a kg of hashish oil which has a market value of ₹50,000. Usually, smugglers from Kerala and Karnataka order the oil,” said an excise official requesting anonymity.

424,2020/02/06,Hard-fought campaign for Delhi Assembly ends,"A hard-fought election campaign that kicked off with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asking voters for a second term based on his government’s performance ended on Thursday with Mr. Kejriwal calling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders “fake Hindus” for running an “abusive” campaign.

The pitch and tenor of the campaign changed drastically in the last two weeks with political parties warring over who can be called a true patriot. The BJP deployed U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Minister Anurag Thakur and West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh among others to assist Home Minister Amit Shah, who was spearheading the BJP’s campaign in the absence of a chief ministerial face.

Banned for vitriol

Mr. Thakur and Mr. Sahib Singh were both banned by the Election Commission for 72 hours and 96 hours respectively for their controversial statements, leading the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to say that the BJP had no development to show nor any vision for the capital, and was resorting to spreading “hate” and running a “divisive” campaign. Mr. Sahib Singh was served with a second ban on Wednesday for making “vitriolic statements” against the Chief Minister.

Mr. Kejriwal, on the other hand, said he was seeking votes for delivering on his free water and electricity promise, and the work done in the field of education, health and measures to ensure safety of women.

Protests against the Citizenship (Ammendment) Act (CAA), which found a focal point at Shaheen Bagh, turned into a major election issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking voters to vote for the BJP in order to prevent similar protests and the blockade of main roads during an election rally. Mr. Kejriwal, however, maintained that the BJP was using Shaheen Bagh as an election issue and that the road would be cleared by the Central government immediately after the election.

Congress evokes Sheila

The Congress, enthused by its performance in 2019 Lok Sabha election, in which it was placed second after the BJP in five of the seven Lok Sabha seats, ran a campaign reminding voters of the development that took place in Delhi during the 15-year Sheila Dikshit government and promised to continue all-round redevelopment with a focus on job creation for the youth.

Rahul Gandhi, in his four election rallies, spoke of developing Delhi into a manufacturing hub so that jobs are created. He blamed the BJP and the AAP for practising politics of hate, which was turning away investors. In its manifesto, the Congress promised to pass a resolution in the Delhi Assembly, if voted to power, demanding the Centre drop the CAA as it was against the basic spirit of the Constitution.

70-member Assembly

A total of 672 candidates are in the fray for the February 8 election for the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

A total of 1,47,86,382 persons are registered to vote at 13,750 polling stations and results will be announced on February 11.

Later addressing a road show in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar constituency, seeking votes for party candidate Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, Mr. Shah said: “Remember that a year ago, there was a terrorist attack in Pulwama and our forces took revenge by conducting an air strike. You all know that the people of Delhi as well as the whole nation was saluting the valor of the army, but do you know who was the most sad? First Rahul Gandhi, second Arvind Kejriwal and third was Imran Khan sitting in Pakistan.”

428,2020/02/06,Delhi HC rejects plea by 11 Independent candidates against nomination rejection,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday declined to entertain a plea by 11 Independent candidates against rejection of their nominations for the February 8 Assembly polls.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar dismissed the candidates’ plea, which had also sought to set aside a single-judge order dismissing their petition against the rejection of their nominations.

The returning officer (RO) had rejected their nominations on January 21, the last date for filing the same.

The plea challenging the rejection was dismissed on January 28 by a single-judge Bench of the High Court on the grounds it was not maintainable, and that under the Representation of People Act, only an election petition was permissible and it would have to be filed after the results were declared.

The petitioner candidates had contended that the single judge’s order “was passed erroneously and disregarding the facts and material placed on record” by them.

The plea had alleged that the single judge had wrongly denied restoration, protection and enforcement of their constitutional and legal rights to contest elections from the New Delhi seat.

They had also sought a direction to the Centre, Election Commission (EC) and Chief Election Officer (CEO) to forthwith inquire into the manner in which their nominations were rejected.

The 11 persons, in their plea before the single judge, had sought to contest the upcoming Assembly elections from the New Delhi seat. Their nomination forms were allegedly not accepted by the RO despite them arriving at the election office within the stipulated time.

The petition, before the Division Bench, had contended that the petitioners had arrived at the election office at Jamnagar House here early in the morning on January 20 with their duly-filled forms and required documents. Since there were several candidates already waiting at the office, the returning officer issued them tokens and based on their respective token numbers the forms were to be accepted and scrutinised.

However, due to paucity of time, all the people who were issued tokens could not be attended to, the plea had said, adding that the RO asked the petitioners to come the next day. The RO also told them their tokens were valid for the next day and their turn would come before that of others, the petition has claimed.

When the petitioners reached the election office the next day, they found that instead of tokens, the names of the applicants were being recorded on a sheet, the petition said, claiming that once Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal arrived there to file his nomination, he was directly taken inside to allegedly facilitate his filing.

Their plea had also claimed that due to the “wrongful, illegal, arbitrary, unconstitutional and malafide actions/inactions of Respondent 5 (RO), the petitioners were illegally and unconstitutionally deprived of exercising their constitutional right of participating in the democratic process of government formation.”

The petitioners had sought directions to the Centre, EC, CEO and returning officer to initiate measures which would help them to file their nomination forms for contesting election from the New Delhi seat against Kejriwal.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/2hr0ez/article30751244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRADELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/delhi-hc-rejects-plea-by-11-independent-candidates-against-nomination-rejection/article30751245.ece

431,2020/02/06,Barnes Noble suspends reissues of classics with multicultural cover images,"Barnes & Noble is withdrawing a planned line of famous literature reissued with multicultural cover images that has been met with widespread criticism on social media.

“We acknowledge the voices who have expressed concerns about the Diverse Editions project at our Barnes & Noble Fifth Avenue store and have decided to suspend the initiative,” Barnes & Noble announced in a statement Wednesday.

The author Adriana Herrera had called the books, scheduled to be launched this week, “the classics in blackface.”

""Diverse Editions,” a joint project between Barnes & Noble and Penguin Random House, featured 12 texts, including Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” and L. Frank Baum’s “The Wizard of Oz.” The words are the same, but on the cover, major characters are depicted with dark-skinned illustrations by artists of “different ethnicities and backgrounds,” according to Barnes & Noble.

""Diverse Editions” was announced at a time when the publishing industry is already facing scrutiny over the novel “American Dirt” and its depiction of Mexican life and culture. “Absolute TONE-DEAF decision-making,” Mexican-American writer David Bowles, a leading critic of “American Dirt,” tweeted about “Diverse Editions.”

The decision also comes in February, which is Black History Month, an annual celebration of past and present achievement.

To much disbelief online, the organizers of “Diverse Editions” had said they used artificial intelligence in reviewing more than 100 older books and determining whether the race or ethnicity of a character is specifically stated. Few would argue that Alice from “Alice in Wonderland” or the title characters of “Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” are fitting for a tribute to black history.

“They could have Googled, chosen a dozen books by actual Black authors that are classics & sent those out with fresh covers & a big event,” author Mikki Kendall tweeted. “Add in bringing in contemporary Black authors to discuss these works & the whole thing is a win. They didn’t do the easy or logical thing.”

In its statement Wednesday, Barnes & Noble acknowledged that the new covers were “not a substitute for black voices or writers of colour, whose work and voices deserve to be heard.

""The booksellers who championed this initiative did so convinced it would help drive engagement with these classic titles,” according to the bookstore chain. “It was a project inspired by our work with schools and was created in part to raise awareness and discussion during Black History Month, in which Barnes & Noble stores nationally will continue to highlight a wide selection of books to celebrate black history and great literature from writers of colour.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/v75uta/article30748368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBARNESampNOBLE-BOOKSWITHDRAWN,https://www.thehindu.com/books/barnes-noble-suspends-reissues-of-classics-with-multicultural-cover-images/article30748369.ece
432,2020/02/06,The power of money,"Bill Maurer, Dean of the School of Social Sciences at University of California has authored a book titled, “A Cultural History of Money,” In the beginning, before there was money, if I had something that you needed, I would approach you with that thing and see if you had anything that I needed. And we could basically barter on the spot. The problem with barter is it really does depend on us each meeting each other's needs in that moment. And so the origin story of money that we have is that humans invented money essentially to be a mediator in these sorts of exchanges.

Barter requires something called a double coincidence of wants. The double coincidence of wants means that in that moment, I've got what you need. You've got what I need. There's a coincidence of our needs in the instance. And that rarely happens. So the idea here is that humans wizard up this kind of third thing, money, this magical substance that can put all things on one scale of value and use that as sort of their measuring stick, then, to make these kinds of transactions.”

Archaeological record

Maurer continues, “When we look around the world and in the historical and archaeological record of this kind of direct barter, we don't find it. We find, instead, systems where people are taking some kind of object - let's take a kind of a big shell valuable in the highlands of New Guinea - and using it to mark relationships…that serve as a kind of indicator of enduring obligations that people have to one another. It's kind of like an open-ended IOU, for everyone around us that. We have a relationship that will essentially allow us to have a flow of goods between each other and between our families. It signifies to everyone around us that we have these ties of enduring obligation and responsibility. It's really a memory device to indicate an ongoing, enduring relationship, an ongoing set of obligations.”

Maurer says all gifts and gift giving fall into this category, “The early anthropologist Marcel Mauss wrote about this quite explicitly, saying that in the gift, there's the obligation to give, there's the obligation to receive but then also the obligation to reciprocate.”

Clay tablets

In The Smithsonian, Maurer came across clay tablets used 5,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. “They were used to keep records of obligations. But as human societies grew larger, people needed a way to systematically keep track of who owed what to whom. So to make money work, you need something that is both that system of reckoning and record keeping but also an authorizing power that says, in effect, this is the way that we keep our records here. And that's essentially what we have with modern money still today. We don't necessarily think of it that way, but basically money is a unit of account that, in our case, is authorized by the state.…”

Therefore, says Maurer “unbelievable power” comes to the state and to the moneyed and thus makes patterns of relationships too.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/the-power-of-money/article30750797.ece
433,2020/02/06,Not just Premchand’s wife,"In the Hindi literary world, Shivrani Devi is known as the writer of the unique book “Premchand Ghar Mein”(Premchand At Home) and as the woman who fiercely guarded her independence and self-identity and never allowed her immensely famous husband to overshadow her. In fact, it was she whose critical opinion and advice Premchand regularly sought, respected and followed.

The re-publication of “Kaumudi”, a collection of her short stories originally published by Saraswati Press in 1937, after a gap of 83 years offers us a chance to familiarise ourselves with another aspect of her creative personality. “Premchand Ghar Mein”, a veritable feminist document,too had been unavailable for a long time. Now, Nayee Kitab Prakashan has republished both these books and well-known Hindi fiction writer and translator Sara Rai, daughter of Premchand’s eldest son Sripat Rai, has edited and written new introductions for both of them.

Premchand was married in 1896 when he was a student of ninth standard and barely 16 years old. This was an incompatible marriage and within a very short period, his wife returned to her parental home. It is doubtful if their marriage was ever consummated. After a while, he decided to get married again but only to a widow. This was a revolutionary decision in those times.

In 1905, he chanced upon a matrimonial advertisement given by one Munshi Devi Prasad, resident of district Fatehpur in U.P. for his daughter who was a child widow.

According to Amrit Rai, Premchand’s younger son whose biography of his father titled “Kalam Ka Sipahi” (Soldier of Pen) can be compared only with that of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan written by his historian son Sarvepalli Gopal, it was published in a small newspaper edited by an Arya Samajist Shankarlal Shrotriya of Bareilly.

Premchand promptly responded to it and asked for a photograph of the girl, another unusual thing in those days. Yet, Munshi Devi Prasad complied with it and also sent a booklet titled “Kayasth Bal Vidhwa Uddharak Pustika”(Booklet for the Uplift of Kayasth Child Widows) along. He himself had penned it. However, Sara Rai in her introduction to “Kaumudi” says that the matrimonial advertisement was a part of the booklet. In 1906, Premchand married Shivrani Devi. She died on December 5, 1976 but her date of birth is not known.

Sara Rai underlines the fact that Shivrani Devi had to face a three-fold erasure and her identity as a woman permeated all the three. Her primary identity was that of a woman who was also a writer. And her third identity was that of the wife of a literary colossus like Premchand. Things have not changed much over a century as many women writers even today face such charges—sometimes levelled explicitly and sometimes through innuendoes and insinuations — that their works have been written by their husbands or male friends.

Many people alleged that Premchand was the actual author of the short stories that were published in Shivrani Devi’s name. Things came to such a head that Premchand himself had to issue a contradiction. Sara Rai quotes Banarasi Das Chaturvedi who, while paying his tribute to Shivrani Devi, wrote that Premchand issued a contradiction, written in English, to say that Mrs Premchand was a warrior whose fighting spirit was speaking in every line that she wrote. He also added that a man of his peaceful nature could never think of such fighting plots involving women.

The story titled “Tarka” offers a textual proof as its characters speak to one another in Awadhi that was the dialect of Shivrani Devi’s village Salempur in district Fatehabad in Uttar Pradesh. Premchand’s mother tongue was Bhojpuri. Sara Rai also raises the question if the short stories are worth reading in their own right or simply because the writer happens to Premchand’s wife?

She finds that Shivrani Devi speaks in a creative language and tone that was very different from that of Premchand and her women characters often come through as arrogant and churlish. She was not merely a house wife who also wrote, but she actively participated in the social and political struggles of her time. On many occasions she went to jail and her husband was proud of this fact. In this respect, she was very much like her contemporaries like Mahadevi Verma and Subhadra Kumari Chauhan who had started to make their presence felt in the Hindi public sphere.

“Kaumudi” contains 16 short stories whose emphasis is more on independence and self-reliance of women and less on self-sacrifice, moral purity, sexual chastity, bashfulness, and maryada as was the vogue those days. Her women characters also look much more self-confident and courageous than men. As Sara Rai points out, even while reminiscing about her husband in “Premchand Ghar Mein”, she was crafting a ‘feminist past’. Today’s feminists can perhaps learn a few things from her.

434,2020/02/06,‘The architecture of waste’ is a thoughtful design concept by a Hyderabad architect,"It was after XII std when Aniket Rajiv Satone realised engineering was not his calling. Having always loved sketching and designing, he veered towards architecture and has not looked back since. The fact that he is one of 21 finalists from the 2019 Asia Young Designer Awards (India) edition furthers his ambition and focus. He was announced as a finalist on December 24 2019, and participated in the finals in Chennai on January 24. The contest is a flagship movement by Nippon Paint and Ethos.

Aniket’s design concept, ‘Architecture of waste: Landfill Visitor Center: Creating Hub for public engagement with trash’ sheds light on the role of architecture in the space of waste management as one of the integral solutions to improve the relationship between users and the city’s main infrastructure. He is originally from Chimur, Maharashtra, and recently completed his Bachelor of Architecture from School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada.

The completed graphic design concept ‘Architecture of waste: Landfill Visitor Center: Creating Hub for public engagement with trash’ by Aniket Rajiv Satone

“I referred to the Deonar landfill near Mumbai, a city which generates around 6,000 metric tonnes a day. This is extremely sad as most of that waste which is recyclable or reusable builds up in the landfill. My design concept is ideally to help people across all generations really get acquainted with the waste that builds up; I want researchers, artists, regular people and more to come and discuss the life journey of a waste product,” explains Aniket. “Hyderabad is a megacity doing a lot of green things but there are also a lot of waste management issues here. We need to also get the government involved to really see a potential benefit becoming a real thing.”

What does his design concept feature? “There is an interior planned as well as an exhibition centre,” he responds. He does not go into too much detail, given this is purely a design competition. Would he like to bring this to fruition? Yes, he responds, but he is well aware of the realistic obstacles — such as bureaucracy, funding, finding land — to even plan such a centre. As one of the finalists, Aniket worked closely with design experts from across the country: Swanzal Kak Kapoor of SAKA Studio, interior designer at The Orange Lane, Shabnam Gupta, Eugene Pandala of Centre for Sustainable Built and Natural Environment, Sheila Shri Prakash of Shilpa Architects Planners Designers and architect C R Raju.

“Designers, architects, city planners: these are all jobs that involve problem solving,” concludes Aniket. “And when larger companies and governments see design possibilities, maybe we will see something actually happen.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/i4jwuw/article30749429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy06-aniket,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/hyderabad-based-aniket-rajiv-satone-design-concept-finalist-for-2019-asia-young-designer-awards-india-edition/article30749433.ece
435,2020/02/06,The bird that keeps our spirits up,"In testing times where a naturalist like me is stuck at home, I find solace in the theatrics of two Oriental Magpie-Robins in my backyard, ready to pair up for the breeding season. The males sit on conspicuous perches, raising their beaks and singing incessantly.

They puff up their feathers, fan their tails and swoop down, over the females, who will also do a little dance in the air. Not that the Magpie-Robin (Copsychus saularis) is quiet the rest of the year.

The most common call is a whistle, mostly at dawn and the typical harsh hissing krrshhhhh. You might even see that the tail movement is often synchronised with its call. The species is generally distributed across the Indian subcontinent and it typically avoids dense forest and open plains. It avoids both extremes and likes the in-between of an urban garden, with sunshine and shade.

Here, it sings from the topmost boughs of garden trees in the early morning and the late evening. The Magpie Robin is one of the best songsters in the city, where singing birds are scarce.

The bird dislikes thick undergrowth and is mostly seen hopping along branches or foraging in leaf-litter on the ground for insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, ants, beetles, and insect-larvae, but may sometimes take a fancy to an occasional earthworm or gecko. In the opportunism that comes from city living, it may seize insects under street lamps at night.

The Oriental Magpie-Robin is a medium-sized robin (19-20 cm) with a broad white wing-bar running from the shoulder to the tip of the wing, and a long tail with white outer-tail feathers. Males exhibit an overall black plumage whereas females are greyish-brown with the white wing-bar being a common feature. Both sexes have brown iris, a black bill (beak), and dark legs.

One way of spotting this bird is its tail movement: It carries its tail very high over the back, will frequently lower and expand it into a fan, then close and jerk it up again over the back.

The Oriental Magpie-Robin’s breeding season lasts from the end of March to the end of July and the nest is neatly placed in holes in tree trunks, in gaps in walls and sometimes on the roofs of houses.

It is cup-shaped and is built with grasses, fibre and feathers, with a definitive lining. The depth and compactness of the nest often depends on the size of the hole.

Once the eggs hatch, the females spend their time and effort feeding the young, while the males are usually on nest watch. Their aggressive behaviour during breeding season helps them defend their territory and safeguard the area against marauders.

These birds were once kept in cages because of their singing, and were also used for fighting matches. Both are now illegal in India, and so a rare occurrence, but the avian pet trade is still prevalent in parts of Southeast Asia. The Oriental Magpie-Robin is the national bird of Bangladesh, where it is known as doyel/doel and appears on their currency notes as well.

436,2020/02/06,That little touch of star quality,"He might be a Michelin-starred chef with restaurants all over the world, but Chris Galvin talks unabashedly about his humble origins.“I was introduced to cooking or rather the basics of cooking at a very young age, helping my grandmother at home,” says 61-year-old Chris Galvin.

Growing up in war-ravaged London was not easy, let alone feeding a growing family. “We used to have war gardens, small furrows where we would grow the most basic of produce. It was a time of terrible shortage and rationing because the food convoys had stopped and we had to make do with whatever we had.”

Working with his grandmother Gertrude gave Chris his first lessons on the basics of cooking or “how to get from the farm to the plate”. “I must have been about five years old when my nan taught me how to tell if a fruit was ripe enough or how raw produce could make your belly sore. We also raised chickens,” he says with a smile.

When he grew older, Chris would help by going to the markets or to the butcher for fish, meat and poultry. “In school, we had a cooking class for boys too and I realised I loved cooking,” he adds.

By the age of 15, he was running the household and looking for a job to sustain his family. “I was on the smaller side then and no one would give me a job anywhere. Finally, it was at a restaurant I got a job washing pots. Luckily for me, the chef there, Antony Worall Thompson, was to become a celebrity restaurateur.”

Chris was eager to help around the kitchen, learning a lot during the process. “I was willing to do anything — wash up, ready the vegetables, get the starters ready, help the cook — I did it all. I worked every hour I could and then I would study,” says Chris who is a great believer in lifelong education. “For more than 20 years, I worked as a stagiare (a cook who works for free in another chef’s kitchen) in France and New York, learning from the masters.”

Thompson was impressed with his initiative and roped in Chris, who was then 26, to be the head chef in a New York restaurant. All along, he continued to study, improving as a pastry chef and taking a degree in culinary arts, food and beverage and one in HR marketing too. “I sat for every exam and entered every competition I could,” he says.

All his hard work eventually paid off and he won his first Michelin star in 2000. In 2005, Chris and his brother, Jeff, opened their first restaurant Galvin Bistro De Luxe on Baker Street. That marked the beginning of the road for the Galvin brothers who went on to open seven restaurant in seven years. Today, they have 14 restaurants in different parts of the world, including two in Dubai.

“I think we were the only brothers in Britain who both had Michelin-starred restaurants at the same time,” he says without a trace of pride.

In 2009, Chris founded Galvin’s Chance, a programme that equips youngsters for the workplace. “There are so many transferable skills within industries whether it is marketing or communication. I keep telling young people they don’t have to restrict themselves,” says Chris, who is really passionate about giving disadvantaged youth a head start.

“If I were not a chef, I may have become a teacher. I love teaching,” he says and there’s more than a glimpse of it as he prepares for the masterclass he conducted in Bengaluru.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7exbtn/article30751400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GALVIN1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/that-little-touch-of-star-quality/article30751405.ece
437,2020/02/06,Artist Rouble Nagi’s unique art initiative in Hyderabad called Misaal Hyderabad,"On a quiet Saturday morning, residents of Babu Jagjivan Rao Nagar in Film Nagar saw the arrival of unusual visitors. The group was of Mumbai-based artist Rouble Nagi and her team of volunteers, armed with colours, rollers and loads of enthusiasm; they were set to give the area an artistic makeover. Their task was a part of Misaal Hyderabad, a social welfare initiative of Rouble Nagi Art Foundation (RNAF) and Phoenix Foundation (the CSR arm of Phoenix Group). Misaal means example, indicating the initiative leads by example.

The walls that look worn out now will soon don a splash of colour. But beautification is not the only aim at Misaal. With community art as a medium, the focus is to improve the living conditions and surroundings. “Misaal... is not only about painting walls and graffiti. We promote waste management, education, sanitation, hygiene, empower women to work even from home, and skill development among youngsters,” shares Rouble Nagi.

An artist and sculptor who works in more than 30 mediums, Rouble doesn’t want to be an artist who simply auctionsher art or does commissioned works. Her passion for art also involves social activism. Project Misaal originated in her hometown, Mumbai, and was born two years ago in Dharavi. The story began when Rouble went to a slum to check on her student who had shifted there. “I have lived in Mumbai for 20 years but had never seen this slum; I was overwhelmed. Misaal Mumbai was near Sea Link and most people use it to commute,” she says.

It was to easy connect with people through art and colours. Once Rouble and her team began beautification, residents were curious about this sudden spurt of colour. Some asked if the painting is to mask their dirty houses or for a movie or TV serial shooting. The four coloured walls brought a huge change in their mindset. She recollects, “I was colouring it because I wanted them to keep their area clean. i thought ‘Even if you live in a a slum, you have a right to have a beautiful home.’ As work progressed, many residents had tears and said, ‘You brought Diwali to us in January’.

With art as a medium, the initiative also includes workshops that focus on neighbourhoods and on how to minimise the use of plastic. The cleanliness drive in Mumbai attracted teams of doctors, lawyers and those working in the fashion and music industry who volunteered to work on weekends. The colourful and vibrant scenario from Sea Link caught the attention of celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, who tweeted about it “They didn’t know it is my work, but they tweeted about it; that is how you bring in change,” says Rouble.

Art work on walls are also inspired by different themes. For World Water Day, the team joined hands with UNICEF to talk about water crisis. Involving residents to give suggestions and feedback brings in a positive change. “We ask if there is any favourite freedom fighter, sports person or colour they want to see on their walls. We want that participation from them.”

Thanks to an Army father, Rouble travelled with her family across India, meeting different kinds of people. She says, “Being a creative person, I wanted to explore and learn and knew my art is not limited to doing commissioned works. I want to use my art to bring in change.”

Besides Mumbai, the team has worked in Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, and have begun work in Delhi and have plans to go to Chennai, Gujarat and Assam. Anyone can volunteer and take part in the drive. “I want people to come out of their homes, add new colours, change their lifestyle, approach and bring joy.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/l3jwmp/article30749915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym05Art,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/artist-rouble-nagi-on-why-she-uses-community-art-as-a-tool-for-social-change/article30749926.ece
