0,23-2-20,Syrian endgame solidifies Assad’s grip,"Is there an alternative form of coalition, minus Assad, which can govern unstable Syria? It seems unfeasible, as the US and major powers involved in West Asia have seen the disasters that unleashed in countries such as Libya, Egypt, Yemen, and particularly in Iraq, after the departure of their longest-standing autocrats

The Syrian war is just going to complete nine years of devastation, displacement and a new power play in the restive West Asian region. The war that started in 2011 has witnessed for the first time the direct involvement of Russia at an equal pace against the US-led coalition. Though Bashar al-Assad has been threatened by anti-Government forces since the beginning, he has managed to survive till date. Now only the last rebel redoubt of Idlib is yet to be brought back to the fold of Government forces.

The biggest challenge is ending the ongoing civil war. It is one of the most serious humanitarian disasters in recent political history of the world, with the gravest refugee predicament since the World War II. More than half a million people have so far lost their lives. Almost half the population of Syria has been displaced. The number of refugees who have fled the country now exceeds five million, including more than 2.5 million children.

Turkey continues to host the largest chunk of refugees numbering nearly four million.

Looking at the current scenario in Syria, a completely war-ravaged nation, the worst comes for the internally displaced and for the refugees as they all would keep fighting for their survival. Normally a refugee is a person who is forced to leave his home and his country because his life and liberty are in danger. But the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees describes a refugee as one person who “owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country”.

However, this typical definition of refugees have been broadened to include people who are forced to leave their countries because of widespread violence, war and foreign occupation that has put their lives at risk in their own homeland.

As of today, the Syrian refugees have crossed over to countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, North Africa, Iraq, Egypt, the US, Canada and to large parts of Europe. And out of the total refugees those who are asylum seekers are about a million. And a large number of them are in Germany and the rest of them are spread across Sweden, Canada and in the US.

The cumulative loss to gross domestic product from the starting of the war, i.e. 2011, through the early part of 2017 has been estimated by the international agencies, including the World Bank, to an amount of $226 billion. So far there has been no definitive cost of reconstruction worked out, but the Assad regime has wishfully mentioned it as nearly $400 billion. Thus, rebuilding Syria would be a daunting task both for the Syrian Government and international aid agencies.

Today the victory of the Assad regime over the rebel forces across Syria is a reality. Mainly, the rebel-held strongholds and large swaths of territories in the southern parts of Syria have been retaken by the Government forces in recent months. The main cities under the Government control are Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Latakia, Tartus, Palmyra and Albu Kamal. And the Free Syrian Army (FSA) — a loose organisation of armed brigades — was formed in the beginning of 2011 by defectors from the Syrian Army. Also many disgruntled civilians who want to topple the Assad’s family rule had also joined the FSA. But what is striking is that since the battle of Aleppo, the FSA has been only able to retain its control over limited areas in north-western Syria. The main area that it controls is the Idlib province wherein the final battle now is between the rebels and the Government forces. On the other hand, the Kurdish forces have occupied much larger areas, than any other forces, which include Raqqa, Quamishli and Hasakah. In fact, reclaiming Raqqa from the grip of ISIS was a historic win for the Kurdish Army. After the battle of Raqqa, the ISIS has been confined to an area near Albu Kamal.

Unfortunately, these areas are surrounded by the Assad forces from the west and the Kurdish from the east. And the rest of rag-tag militias who are battling the Syrian Army for their survival are Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, Iran backed Hizbollah and the Syrian Democratic Forces, largely dominated by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units known as the YPG.

So far, more than five series of ceasefire agreements have been concluded between different parties, including the US, Russia, Jordan, Assad Government and the major rebel groups. It first started in 2016 by the UN known as the Geneva Syria peace talks. In fact by February 26, UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2268 that demanded all parties to comply with the terms of the agreement. As no single party had adhered to the terms of the deal violence surfaced once again. By the end of September 10, the US and Russia concluded deal bringing ceasefire between the Assad Government and an American backed coalition of rebel groups. Both the parties and their allies violated the deal hence the war took an ugly turn.

The third peace agreement signed between Turkey and Russia in Astana led to complete ceasefire across Syria. This effort continued despite the non-participation of the ISIS, YPG and the al-Nusra Front and constant eruptions of violent clashes in different parts of Syria.

The fourth ceasefire effort came into being on May 6, 2017, among Russia, Turkey and Iran in Astana to divide Syria into four de-escalation zones. However, some rebel groups alleged that the intention behind the truce is simply to divide Syria into several sectarian zones so as escalate the crisis. In a way, such partition would allow the Damascus to divide the anti-Government forces and pound on them separately. And by July 2017, the Trump Administration, Moscow and Amman (Jordan) made an effort to broker a peace deal in southern Syria. This agreement is valid despite continuous exchange of fire between the Government forces and various rebels.

The war in Syria is definitely going to wind down. The reason behind is that the rebels are fast losing their grounds. Among them the most powerful ISIS which is almost dying down with its leader’s death and mostly breaking down to splinter groups with diverse aims and objectives.

This is accompanied by constant reinforcements from Russia with man and material towards the Government forces. And in a situation where in America is busy preparing for the next round of presidential polls, Trump is hardly sparing anytime for a definitive solution in war-torn Syria. But the Kurdish stronghold in the North of Syria is going to continue unless there is a global understanding to either recognise their homeland or to completely vanquish them, provided Washington backs such a deal. All the anti-Government groups have now consolidated in the Idlib province. The sad part is that all of them do not have a feasible strategy to fight the Russian-backed Assad forces which might lead to a sure victory for Assad.

Finally, since the end of the Cold War, what we have seen is that ceaseless efforts lead to end of most of the wars along with warring groups laying down their arms. With other major conflicts and international hot spots rising such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Nigeria, Yemen, etc, the Syrian issue has been substantially moved to the sidelines despite having serious refugee problems spanning from the West Asian region to Europe. Besides, the efforts to bring the warring groups and major powers to the negotiation table are seemed to be stalled. What is ultimately pushing Assad to near victory is the fast rising symptoms of fractured insurgency. On the other hand, the Government forces over the period of almost nine years have regained its strength despite having major debacles in the past.

Now what lies ahead for Assad? Is he going to continue in the seat of power? Minus Assad, is there an alternative form of coalition that can continue holding onto the current level of stability in Syria? Certainly, Assad would continue for now. Simply put this seems not possible as the US and major powers involved in West Asia have seen the disasters that unleashed in countries such as Libya, Egypt, Yemen, particularly in Iraq, after the departure of their long held autocrats. Keeping this in mind, Assad must continue and his immediate removal could herald total anarchy in Syria. Clearly, no plausible alternative is emerging to Assad regime as most of the splinter rebel groups do not agree to a common agenda of governance. Their only aim is to have control over their own territory and assets, and fighting the corrupt Assad regime is just an excuse. Therefore, the brutal war may come to an end sooner or later, permanent peace seems to be elusive in Syria.

1,23-2-20,Disorientation of anti-CAA lobby is understandable,"There is little doubt that in her zeal to be wilfully outrageous, the 19-year-old Amulya Leona Noronha seriously embarrassed most of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act fraternity when she chanted ‘Pakistan zindabad’ from podium at a protest rally in Bengaluru. Certainly, the alacrity with which the stalwarts of the protest, including AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, snatched the mike from her indicated the panic.

The disorientation of the anti-CAA lobby is understandable. Since December 13 last year when the protests began, the Muslim community — which has been in the forefront of the anti-Narendra Modi stir — has been at pains to demonstrate that their opposition to the changes in the Citizenship Act is grounded in their status as patriotic Indians. The national flag, the Constitution and photographs of both Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar have been generously used in the rallies and extended dharnas. The national anthem too has been lustily sung on innumerable occasions. Under the circumstances, the teenager’s invocation of Pakistan — whatever may have been its convoluted underlying logic — was clearly outside a set narrative.

Amulya’s zindabad to Pakistan also came within a day of AIMIM national spokesperson Waris Pathan’s boast that 15 crore of Muslims have the ability to make 100 crore others tremble — a threat that most people will undeniably view as both menacing and sinister. Add to this earlier utterances by different protesters espousing either a form of sectarian separatism or praising Mohammed Ali Jinnah and it is possible to understand why many people detect a hidden agenda behind the anti-CAA protests.

Arguably, such a conclusion may be unfair. The stalwarts of the anti-CAA have been at pains to link their protests to an exalted ‘idea of India’. Someone like Owaisi has sought to reinvent himself and detach his organisation from the inheritance of the Razakars who fought against Hyderabad’s integration into India in 1947-48.

The more political of the Muslim clerics who were earlier associated with the Ayodhya stir and the opposition to changes in Muslim personal laws have carefully kept away from the front benches of the anti-CAA protests. Indeed, there has been a conscious attempt to project the stir as something that goes well beyond the Muslim community. The Christian clergy in particular and liberal Indians, not to mention radical students, have quite deliberately been visible in the protests. Some of the attempts to make the movement appear broad-based and non-sectarian have worked and the foreign media has been impressed.

However, some doubts persist. These have less to do with what Muslim politicians may or may not have said and more to do with the universal negativism of India’s self-professed liberals. Beginning with expressing imaginary and often contrived doubts over the motives behind questions that have been framed for the National Population Register and extending to criticism over the economic policy that assumes India is doomed to mediocrity, the liberals have lost all sense of national pride. Their attacks on the Modi Government have become so utterly visceral that they no longer believe that there is space for bipartisanship. The net consequence is that India appears far more polarised than it actually is.

The criticism of the CAA presents one example. As the Shaheen Bagh-type movements involving Muslim women have gathered momentum, mainstream political parties have calibrated their criticism. Today, parties such as the Congress are no longer in favour of a blanket denunciation of fast-tracking citizenship to minorities from three neighbouring Muslim countries. They implicitly acknowledge the need to tie up the loose ends of Partition. What the mainstream critics are now seeking is an extension of the amnesty to cover Ahmediyas from Pakistan and including Rohingya Muslims from Mayanmar in the list of persecuted minorities. While the case of the Ahmediyas — declared to be non-Muslims in Pakistan — is interesting, it is also notional. The fact is that no Ahmediya has actually applied for sanctuary in India. If Ahmediyas are to be included, the Government may as well extend the fast track scheme to Yezdis from Syria and Iraq. No Yezdis has, to my knowledge, applied for asylum in India.

The case of the Rohingyas is more complicated. Some Rohingyas —estimated at anything near a lakh — have already sneaked into India. Their presence has aroused fierce antipathy in both Assam and the North-east but also in West Bengal. Unlike the Hindu and Buddhist refugees from Bangladesh who have merged in effortlessly into India’s civic society, the Rohingyas stand out and create local tensions. This is recognised by the Congress and the Communist parties. Yet these parties are quite brazen in demanding their inclusion because it fits a narrative of Muslim exclusion.

The Kashmir issue is another case in point. That the fallout of the abrogation of Article 370 would present a challenge to the Government was never in doubt. Some tough action — which would be unwarranted in normal circumstances — was also inevitable. This was also the case in the mid-1990s when the Congress was in power. Yet, an attempt has been made to link the attempts to restore normalcy in the Kashmir Valley with some imaginary targeting of Muslims. The Opposition has tried and may have made Kashmir a Muslim issue.

Particularly irksome is the attempt by the Opposition to invite foreign criticism of India. This is not only deplorable but suggests an attempt to increase communal polarisation in India — in the hope that this will eventually backfire on Modi. It may but it could also harden nationalist resolve.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/disorientation-of-anti-caa-lobby-is-understandable.html

5,23-2-20,Hindi row won’t affect health services: AIIMS,"A day after an office circular of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar for use of Hindi by its employees in official work sparked sharp reactions in political and other quarters like the Utkal Sammilani in the State, the institute’s director Dr Gitanjali Batmanabane on Saturday “clarified” that the order would not have any effect on the healthcare services at the hospital.

“The circular is an internal memo which was circulated…because this is something called Official Language Act and we are supposed to comply with it. However, healthcare services for patients will remain unaffected,” she said.

On the other hand, on the day, a team comprising BJD MPs Pinaki Misra, Anubhab Mohanty, Prasanna Acharya, Amar Patnaik, Sarojini Hembram and Sasmit Patra and MLAs Sarmishha Sethi and Susant Rout met the AIIMS Director and submitted a memorandum of the State’s ruling party demanding withdrawal of the office order.

“We are the first State to be formed on a linguistic basis; and we will not allow anybody sidelining our mother tongue, particularly by any institution that is working for the people of our State. We will insist on Odia being used since our people are familiar with it and that will make their task of availing service at the AIIMS easier,” read the memorandum.

6,23-2-20,Swamy stresses on PSUs’ role for new India,"Dr Subramanian Swamy, eminent economist and Rajya Sabha member delivered the 18th edition of Nalco Lecture Series on ‘Relevance of PSUs in Shaping New India’ here on Saturday.

Dr Swamy said, “The public sectors are important for the development of India and these sectors need to be encouraged to prosper. The PSUs should be given freedom to take decisions and operate in sync with the market dynamics.”

He stressed that the public sector should move beyond profit-making and focus on multidimensional objectives. There are certain sectors that can be explored and developed by the public sectors only. The PSUs also need to be ready to compete in terms of commercial principles, he said.

“India should recognise the strength of the PSUs,” Dr Swamy added.

He appreciated the Nalco’s contribution as an integrated business entity to the Indian aluminium sector in particular and Indian economy as a whole.

In his welcome address, Nalco CMD Sridhar Patra said that as a Central PSU, the Nalco has always given priority to boost the country’s economy and serve the interest of the nation through continuous improvement in production, productivity and profitability and also works beyond profitability for promoting social and economic development through its CSR arm.

13,23-2-20,Gandhi Peace Centre unveiled in BBSR,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik inaugurated the State’s first Gandhi Peace Centre near the Khandagiri-Udaygiri caves here on Saturday.

The centre, built on a five-acre of land, is a digital interactive museum promoting Gandhian values and principles among the people, particularly youths.

The centre, set up with the support of the Aditya Birla Group, has six galleries, where memorabilia and articles used by Gandhiji are on display.

The centre will conduct a multimedia show on the Father of the Nation’s ideology of truth, nonviolence and policy of Jainism till March 15. Besides, a debate and a Bhajan programme will also be organised.

Notably, the State Government had signed an MoU with the Aditya Birla Group in 2017 for operation and management of this interpretation centre and decided to rename it as Eternal Gandhi Peace Centre. The MoU is valid for 15 years.

The Chief Minister said, “The dedication of the Gandhi Peace Centre here today in the 150th years of Gandhi’s birth anniversary assumes significance.” The centre would provide an institutionalised platform to awaken consciousness about life and works of Gandhiji and educate people to realise the deeper significance of his ideals, he said.

“India achieved freedom in 1947. By this time, nonviolence had become truly global, an identity of India-ness, and a more potent weapon than violence,” Patnaik said.

The Chief Minister reiterated his demand for incorporation of Ahimsa (nonviolence) in the Preamble of the Constitution during Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary.

Aditya Birla Centre for Community Initiatives and Rural Development chairperson Rajashree Birla said, “We felt that to set up insightful galleries in different parts of India, where Gandhiji’s imprint is more than discernible would be an act of deep homage (to him). Odisha is the right choice.”

She added, “Naveen Patnaik epitomised Gandhian values and that the Mahatma felt a kind of spiritual connect with Odisha. It was the place that he visited eight times. His tryst with Odisha began in 1921 as part of his nationwide journey to spread his ideals of Satyagraha, Swaraj and Ahimsa.

It became intense when he saw the frugal, precarious living conditions of the poverty-struck, the ill-treatment of the Harijans, and the huge unemployment.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gandhi-peace-centre-unveiled-in-bbsr.html

22,23-2-20,"SAD, AAP condemn Punjab DGP's statement on Kartarpur corridor","The Opposition SAD and AAP on Saturday condemned Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta's purported statement on the Kartarpur corridor and sought clarification from Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh within 24 hours.

The Shiromani Akali Dal said if the clarification was not issued, the party will stall proceedings of the budget session of the Vidhan Sabha on February 24.

The Aam Aadmi Party too lashed out at the DGP, terming the statement condemnable and seeking the removal of the top cop.

SAD senior leader Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that DGP Gupta told a national daily that ""Kartarpur offers a potential that you send somebody in the morning as an ordinary chap and by evening he comes back as trained terrorist actually. You are there for six hours, you can be taken to a firing range, you can be taught to make an IED"".

The DGP also reportedly said some elements based in the neighbouring country were ""trying to woo the pilgrims and making overtures to them"".

""I condemn the statement in the strongest possible words. I do not think it is the statement given by the Punjab DGP, I see this coming from the Congress headquarters because this DGP was handpicked by overlooking several senior officers,"" alleged Majithia.

Majithia also dubbed the statement a ""deep rooted conspiracy"" of the Congress to paint every Sikh pilgrim a ""terrorist"".

""As many as 52,098 pilgrims have so far paid obeisance at the Kartarpur gurdwara. Please check us and see which one of them became terrorist,"" asked Majithia, alleging that they (Congress) were trying trying to get the corridor shut.

""If the clarification is not given by Amarinder Singh within 24 hours, we will not allow the Punjab Vidhan Sabha run on February 24,"" warned Majithia.

AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Harpal Singh Cheema, sought the DGP's removal.

""The statement poses a threat to the country's unity and integrity. The CM should lodge an FIR against him (DGP), put him behind bars and remove him from his post,"" said Cheema.

Meanwhile, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee chief Gobind Singh Longowal also condemned the DGP''s statement and said the corridor gave a message of peace.

""With the DGP''s statement, sentiments of Sikhs have been hurt. So far, 50,000 devotees have offered prayers at the Kartarpur gurdwara and no such instance like what the DGP has said has come to the fore yet,"" said Longowal in a statement.

Earlier, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh too had repeatedly warned that Pakistan had ""nefarious designs"" behind the opening of the Kartarpur corridor and had also maintained that while he was extremely happy as a Sikh at its opening, ""the threat it posed to India could not be ignored"".

23,23-2-20,No religious connotation in Corridor remarks: DGP Gupta,"Punjab Director General of police, Dinkar Gupta on Saturday expressed ""shock and outrage"" over his remarks made at an event of a newspaper on February 20, being misunderstood or being willfully misconstrued.

In a statement issued here, Gupta said, “I rejoiced at the opening of the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor which has fulfilled the decades-old aspirations of millions of devotees like myself all over the world who profess their faith in Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his divine teachings. Their daily ardas for ‘khulle darshan-deedaar’ of religious shrines that remain in post-Partition Pakistan, was finally answered. It was a matter of even greater happiness that it coincided with the 550th Prakash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji”.

He said the State Government and all its agencies, including Punjab Police, worked with great devotion and commitment to successfully observe the historic event. “As the State DGP, I assure that we will continue to strive to work towards facilitating trouble-free access to the holy shrine of Sri Kartarpur Sahib, he said.

In his statement, Gupta also said that, as the DGP of the state, which is faced with continuing battle against violent extremism that continues to be funded and supported from across the border, he cannot over emphasize the need to remain vigilant.

“I only red-flagged the obvious ‘potential’ for misuse by elements notorious for their hostility towards India and their effort to exploit every opportunity, even the most pious one, to disturb peace and communal harmony”, he said.

Gupta further said that his remarks at the event were strictly pertaining to the security and safety of Punjab and India. There was absolutely no reference to any religion or community in his remarks but simply that some anti-national elements based in hostile neighborhood could misuse and exploit this opportunity and, therefore, “we” need to be vigilant to such potential dangers in the interest of peace and security of the people of the State, who, he said, had already suffered a lot in the past at the hands of terrorism promoted by our hostile neighbour.

The DGP said that he was personally there when the first pilgrim crossed the border at Dera Baba Nanak, to visit Sri Kartarpur Sahib in November 2019. In the four months since, the Punjab Police has facilitated more than 51,000 devotees. We will continue to ensure this.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-religious-connotation-in-corridor-remarks--dgp-gupta.html
24,23-2-20,"Babita narrates her father's training, Dangal movie at Playwrite","The third-edition of Playwrite, Sports Literature Festival of India here witnessed scintillating sports discussions by veterans and youth alike amidst an enthusiastic gathering of sports lovers.

The first session named Olympic Dreams was kick-started by one of the founders of Playwrite - Vivek Atray, a former IAS officer, a motivational speaker and author. The session featured the star behind Aamir Khan’s movie Dangal, Babita Kumari Phogat, a renowned female wrestler, who won the gold medal in 2014 Commonwealth Games.

While narrating the stories of her childhood to a packed audience, Phogat remarked that hadn’t it for her strict father, she wouldn’t have become who she is and perhaps, been confined to the four-walls of the home as a shy girl.

“Dangal movie wasn’t an exaggeration. In fact, in reality, I and my sisters weren’t even allowed to attend family weddings by my stringent father, if they came in between our trainings. We had nowhere to escape to, when your own father is your coach,” said Phogat.

Reminiscing her past further, she also mentioned how she would often ask her mother as to why her life’s made so difficult by father. “My mother would just reply, “bas 2 saal aur” (wait for just two more years). This continued until I reached the place where my father wanted me to.”

Babita also talked about how people in her own village would taunt her and her sisters for wearing shorts and playing amongst the boys. “However, in such times, my father would just say – ‘You just do the hard work, leave everything else on me’”.

The next session called ‘The Business of Sports” was conducted by Chitranjan Agarwal, co-founder of Playwrite and featured Joy Bhattacharjya, a famous sports quizmaster and a part of IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders since 2008.

The third session called ‘Hockey: The 70s Show!’ saw the participation of hockey legends like Ajit Pal Singh and Ashok Kumar (son of Late Padma Bhushan, Major Dhyan Chand).

The session was hosted by senior journalist Prabhjot Paul Singh. The event had a surprise guest the great Hockey Legend – Balbir Singh Sr, who managed to make it even when he has not been keeping well since long now. Ashok Kumar and Ajit Pal Singh were both part of the Indian team that won the 1975 Kuala Lumpur World Cup – the last Gold that Indian hockey team ever won.

Citing some of the reasons where Indian hockey team failed in repeating the success story of 1975, both the veterans pointed to the introduction of Astro-turf, which our players and including our authorities were not familiar with at all.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/babita-narrates-her-father-s-training--dangal-movie-at-playwrite.html

33,23-2-20,Samarpan music fest celebrates unity in diversity,"Celebrating unity in diversity and highlighting the true spirit of secularism in Indian society and culture, a three-day Samarpan music festival commenced at the Rabindra Mandap here on Friday evening. The event, exclusive to spiritual and devotional music, is being staged by the famed city-based six-decade-old Bhubaneswar Music Circle.

The inaugural evening commenced with a concert of New Delhi based ghazal, Sufi and bhajan singer Jitender Singh who hails from a cultured and educated Dogra Rajput family. Son of a classical singer, his gifted voice prompted his father to send him to Delhi for professional training after the son graduated in science from Jammu University and has opted for study of law.

In Delhi, he was groomed in Khayal singing by Pandit Mani Prasad of Kirana gharana and later on he evolved his own style of singing inspired and influenced much by ghazal maestros Mehdi Hassan and Jagjit Singh. The influence of ghazal on his style was evident from his “Sufi Musings” concert here.

He picked up Sufi songs of two iconic Sufi poets of Indian sub-continent belonging two different periods but to the same Sufi sentiments - Hazrat Amir Khusrau from 13th century and Buleh Shah of 17th century. The songs extolled how spiritualism and the essence of any faith and religion and how the temple or the mosque bear the same significance for a devotee.

Jitender Singh was superbly supported by Rahul Vishwakarma on tabla and Ratan Prasanna on Rabab while Bhabatosh Mohanty was on guitar.

Aptly titled “Music of the Soul from Bengal”, the second session of the evening featured well-known Baul artiste Parvathy Baul from Birbhum district of West Bengal. Winner of the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, her special appeal has been her solo recitals with dance in trance that she does alongside singing and playing of three instruments herself - Duggie, Ektara and Nupur - all played simultaneously.

Educated enough to explain the songs and the tradition in English, she has this added advantage of reaching out to larger audience beyond Bengal.

The evening being celebrated as Shivratri, Parvathy has carefully chosen the first three songs for Lord Shiva from the rich repertoire of Baul songs while the rest two were on Krishna and Radha respectively. As an ode to Odisha, she commenced her concert with a Charya-Geet, a song that belonged to 8th-century Odisha, followed by a song of the legendary Lalan Fakir. Another of her rendition was a 400-year-old song from poet Padmalochan of Bengal, she mentioned.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/samarpan-music-fest-celebrates-unity-in-diversity.html

He also presided over the Sobha Yatra from the temple to Paddal Mela Ground. The festivities will culminate on February 28.

Presiding over the opening ceremony of International Shivratri Fair at Paddal Ground, he said that it was vital that we respect our tradition and culture as only those societies thrives that respect and love their culture. He said that the Mandi Shivratri not only reflects the deep faith of the people of their Gods and Goddesses, but it provides an opportunity to the people for socialisation. He said that this fair has also emerged as the major fair for commercial activities.

Thakur said that in the present era of cut throat competion, people usually have little time to participate in the fairs, which was a matter of concern. He said that the state was known as Dev Bhoomi, as lives of the people of the state are deeply influenced by the local Gods and Goddesses. He said that almost all the villages of the state have their own temple and own deity. He said that Mandi town was also known as Choti Kashi as there are over hundred temples in the town.

He said the state government has spent over Rs 72 crore on providing twenty four hour drinking water supply to the Mandi Town, adding that Shiv Dham would also be developed in Mandi town, besides construction of Heliport to attract the tourists to visiting the town.

Thakur said the government was striving hard to construct International Airport at Balh area of Mandi and added that a multi storey parking would be constructed in Mandi town.

He also announced that trekker hut would also be constructed in the town to facilitate tourists visiting the town. He announced increase of ten percent in the ‘Nazarana’ of the deities participating in the Shivratri. He also announced ten percent increase in honorarium of ‘Bajantaris’ on the occasion.

The Chief Minister also inaugurated exhibition and SARAS Mela at Paddal Ground on the occasion and also visited the exhibition put up by Information and Public Relations Department, which depicted the journey of all Chief Ministers of the state. Thakur was also handed over the Baton (Torch) by the district administration regarding the campaign the administration has launched regarding ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’.

He released the ‘Shivratri Margdarshika’ a booklet on rituals and customs regarding International Mandi Shivratri. He also released the souvenir brought out by the organising committee.

Deputy Commissioner Mandi cum Chairman Mela organising committee Rugved Thakur said that about 216 deities have been invited to the event this year. He said that the fair is particularly famous as this special fair transforms Mandi town into a venue of grand celebration when all gods and goddesses, of the district assemble here, starting with the day of Shivaratri remain here for seven days till 28th of this month. He also detailed various events being held during the seven day mega event.

The Mandi's Mahashivratri, a centuries-old festival, starts a day later it ends in the rest of the country. The celebrations date back to 1526 when the town was founded during the rule of Ajbar Sen. He ""invited"" all local deities to mark the founding of the new town.

Like the week-long Kullu Dussehra festivities, Mandi's Mahashivratri also sees a congregation, in which there are both divine and temporal aspects.

Every year, the festival attracts scores of tourists. Many researchers also come here to study local gods and goddesses that arrive in beautifully decorated palanquins amid sounds of trumpets and drums.

During the first day of the festival, Lord Madho Rai, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and the chief deity, leads the procession. The assembled deities follow him in beautifully decorated palanquins, as per protocol, and assemble at the Bhutnath temple here.

Three such processions, locally called ""Jaleb"", would be taken out on the opening, middle and concluding days of the festival, organisers said.

Mandi, located on the Chandigarh-Manali national highway, is dotted with more than 80 temples built in typical hill architecture. The prominent temples are those of Bhutnath, Triloki Nath, Jagannath, Tarna Devi and Jalpa Devi.

The rulers of Mandi were devotees of Lord Shiva. Legend has it that ruler Sen (1499-1534) saw in his dreams a cow offering milk to an idol of Lord Shiva. His dream became reality because, according to legend, he actually once saw a cow make a milk offering to an idol. That was when the ruler constructed a temple in 1526, the Bhutnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The foundation of Mandi town was laid at the same time, and Sen later shifted his capital here.

The administration has since been inviting deities to the Shivratri festivities here, ever since the rule of princely states came to an end. The administration also offers an honorarium to the ""kardars"" (attendants of deities) for participating in the festival.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/himachal-cm-inaugurates-international-mandi-shivaratri-fair.html

37,23-2-20,Forest Dept plans safe corridor for tuskers,"Taking firm steps on its ambitious project of tusker corridor, the state forest department has identified several points that are crucial for the easy movement and sustainable living of the elephants in the Dalma sanctuary and, the prominent among them are constructing newer water bodies, solar fencing of the forest area and protection of the green cover on the Jharkhand-Bengal stretch.

“We are working on the project and have identified several points. The water bodies are of prime importance for the sustainable survival of the elephants in the forest cover and we are concentrating our focus much on this subject at the moment,” said a forest officer.

He said perennial water sources in the Dalma forest range but several water sources got dried up which led the department to initiate the work again.

“It is not just of reviving the old ponds but we are also identifying sites for the construction of new water bodies on the Jharkhand-Bengal stretch to ensure availability of the water to the elephants round the calendar year,” he said.

Though, he did not mention but sources in the Dhalbhum and Seraikela forest department have informed that at a dozen odd sites have been identified for the construction of new water bodies in the forest stretch leading to the neighbouring Bengal.

“The purpose is to let the elephant (s) have easy access to the water bodies so that they are prevented from descending on the field in search of water,” said the officer.

The new water bodies will have a better slop area to prevent potential accidents of the elephants and the second and important thing is that a dedicated team of forest personnel will keep regular watch on the water bodies.

For the adequate availability of water, the new water bodies will not depend entirely on the monsoon as the forest department is planning to make alternative arrangements to ensure availability of water in the water bodies round the year.

The perennial water sources are basically ponds running 15 to 20 feet deep while the new artificial water sources would also have the same depth, more or less.

Dalma sprawls over an area of 193 square kilometres and houses 85 villages inside the enclave and 51 villages in its periphery. Dalma is frequently visited people of Odisha and Kolkata. In fact a large number of foreigners also visited Dalma last year 24 trampled to death in 2019",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/forest-dept-plans-safe-corridor-for-tuskers.html

50,23-2-20,Liquor prices to go down in State,"Government has decided to reduce the price of liquor in the state. The decision was taken by the Uttarakhand cabinet on Saturday. The new excise policy was on the agenda of the cabinet meeting on the day and the cabinet gave its nod to it.

Though there was no official declaration of the cabinet decision, it is learnt that in the new excise policy, a revenue target of about Rs 3,600 Crore is kept by the state government for the coming financial year. Giving relief to the liquor lovers of the state, the government decided to reduce the price of liquor and make them at par or less than the price of liquor in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP). The prices of popular brands are likely to witness a reduction of 10 to 15 percent in Uttarakhand now.

This decision is taken in view of large scale smuggling of liquor in Uttarakhand from the neighbouring states. In the new policy, the state government has decided to adopt a dual policy of allocation of liquor shops in the state.

There are 612 liquor shops in the state. It is learnt that the excise department would offer the license holders of 380 profit earning shops to retain the license for the year 2020-21 by paying additional revenue of 15 percent on the last year’s fees. The remaining 332 shops would be sold by adopting the method of lottery system. Making amendment in the process of giving licences to the Bars, the new excise policy has given the district magistrates (DM) the rights of offering licenses. As of now the bar licenses are given at the level of the state administration.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/liquor-prices-to-go-down-in-state.html
51,23-2-20,"Akhilesh reiterates resolve to oppose CAA, NRC, NPR","Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has reiterated his resolve to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act saying his party is against the divisive law as well as National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“The members of the Samajwadi Party will not fill NPR forms. We want to talk only about work,” he said.

“Instead of NPR and NRC, the government should go for caste-based census to ascertain the share of each caste in the total population of India. Caste-based census is the lasting solution to the social conflict based on caste and religion,” he said.

Yadav also confirmed that his party will not form any political alliance with the Congress or any other political party for the 2022 UP Assembly elections.

“We will form the government in 2022 on the basis of our own strength. We may consider some political adjustments to reach the magic figure of majority on the floor of the assembly,’’ he added.

He claimed that the SP will form the next government on the strength of the development work done during the previous regime (2012-17).

Slamming the Congress for putting posters of ‘missing MP’ in his Lok Sabha constituency (Azamgarh), the former Chief Minister said: “Congress is an old hand in conducting smear campaign against its rivals and it was their handiwork. People of Azamgarh are firmly behind me and my party and I will soon visit the constituency’’.

“I wish to congratulate the people of Delhi who rejected the provocative statements of BJP leaders like ‘Goli maaro’ and voting for a party that had performed and delivered to the people as per promises made in the run-up to the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections,” the SP chief said while speaking at a programme in Lucknow on Saturday.

“What was witnessed in Delhi Assembly elections this February will be repeated in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. The Samajwadi Party’s ‘cycle’ will take along all sections of the society and will not resort to gimmicks like seeking the blessings of deities. We have confidence in our performance and in people, and we will have enough people’s support to form the government in 2022’’, the SP chief claimed.

“We will go to the polls and place the record of our performance before the people. The BJP has nothing concrete to showcase as their achievement so they always resort to their traditional politics of dividing people on the lines of caste and religion,” Akhilesh said, adding: “Anybody who has travelled on Lucknow-Agra Expressway will certainly vote for the Samajwadi Party’’.

Dismissing the claims of development works done by the Yogi Adityanath government, the former Chief Minister said: “The investor summit held in February 2018 was a damp squib with no benefit to the people of UP. The government claims to have signed MoUs worth over Rs 4.5 lakh crore but not a single penny has been seen on the ground’’.

He said the maximum number of MoUs was signed for setting up renewable energy or solar plants, and not a single plant has been set up so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-reiterates--resolve-to-oppose--caa--nrc--npr.html

However, they arrested his nephew and also accused Tripathi’s son of abusing and threatening the victim.

According to an official communiqué released by the DGP office, five others, who had also been named in the FIR lodged on Wednesday, were also absolved of rape charges by the district police. The FIR was registered against Tripathi and his kin on a complaint by a 40-year-old woman, who had alleged that they had raped her in 2017.

“During investigation, no evidence was found against the Bhadohi MLA and five others. They have been given a clean chit,” Superintendent of Police (SP) Ram Badan Singh told newspersons in Bhadohi.

“Tripathi’s nephew Sandeep Tiwari has been arrested on the charge of rape,” he said. Besides, Nitesh, son of the accused MLA who had been named in the FIR, has been booked for manhandling and abusing the woman,” the SP said.

After the woman’s statement was recorded before a magistrate, the probe was handed over to a two-member team, including women’s police station incharge Gulafsha.

The team failed to find any evidence to corroborate the charges, Singh said. The woman also refused to undergo medical examination, the SP added.

The complainant, a widow, had alleged that she was first raped by Tiwari in 2016. She said she did not lodge a complaint back then as Tiwari had promised to marry her. She alleged that in the run-up to the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, she was kept at a hotel for a month by Tiwari. All the seven accused would visit the hotel and repeatedly rape her. She also claimed that when she got pregnant, she was forced to undergo abortion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-mla-gets-clean--chit-in-rape-case.html

Overall purpose of UNICEF is to support the realisation of the rights of children, which largely requires Result Based Programme Planning and Results frameworks critical for achieving clearly defined and demonstrable results. As such, Results Based Management (RBM) is a tool for monitoring, measuring and reporting results whilst using Results Chain framework.

Strikingly, RBM increases transparency and accountability, and enhances efficiency and operational effectiveness which enviably allow programme interventions to complement each other and avoid overlap and waste.

The TOT on RBM aims at strengthening and reinforcing the comparative advantages and capabilities of CSO Partners and Faculty Members of select Institutions of higher learning on the underlying principles of RBM and their practical applications in programming within the framework of theory of change.

Strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), are key essential components of RBM which can greatly enhance the effectiveness of programme delivery and achievement of high level results.' he added

The chief speaker reiterated the history of Jharkhand and said that even when the British ruled over the country they did not have control over the tribal areas under their rule. “The reason for this was that the tribal society is extremely sensitive to its nature and the same was being destroyed by the British. As a result of living in one place, we are all tribals, but a tribe is the only one who has been given a place in the Constitution for their culture. The Fifth schedule has a special mention in our Constitution and it is a very important issue.”

While addressing the gathering Pradeep Munda said, “The Tribal Study Centre is working for the interest of the tribal society and resolves problems arising by giving tribals their rights. We are on a path to change, but with this change we our losing our language and our culture. It is important to understand the right of the tribals and also the problems they are facing.”

62,23-2-20,More teeth to anti-insurgency operations this Summer,"Anti-insurgency operations in Jharkhand are likely to be intensified during the summer season in a bid to push the Left Wing Extremist (LWE) groups on the back foot before monsoon hits Jharkhand, senior cops in the thick of events said on Saturday.

The State police is also in talks with law enforcement agencies in neighbouring States, especially West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha for launching joint operations against the rebels in the bordering areas of Jharkhand, they added.

“Anti-insurgency operation is a continuous process, and we have intensified our combing operations lately. However, it is ethically wrong to disclose our future course of action to the media,” said Additional Director General (ADG) Operations, Murari Lal Meena.

Central police forces across the country usually de-escalate their operations in the Left Wing Extremism-hit areas of India during Monsoon due to difficulty in moving in the jungles and increased chances of soldiers contracting vector borne diseases and other infections. The rebel outfits, police say, often take advantage of the monsoon season and strengthen their base. “We will take them down before they take advantage of the Monsoon season,” said an Inspector General rank official in the State police.

Police sources said that the State police will take help of Central security forces and police from neighouring States during the operations. A high level meeting of top police officials from West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh is also likely to be held soon, they added. However, there was no official confirmation on the meeting.

According to figures with the State police, there are around 550 active insurgents in Jharkhand and more than 250 of them have bounty on their heads. Some of these rebels, police said, have been active for more than a decade and are also actively involved in recruiting young villagers in order to increase their strength and muscle power.

As per figures with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), 19 of 24 districts in Jharkhand are LWE-affected. Apart from the CPI (Maoist), there are at least 17 splinter outfits active in the tribal State. Security forces, police said, will also target the rebels of splinter outfits during the operations. Two of the most active splinter outfits in Jharkhand are the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI) and the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC).

Even during the Monsoon season, the operations will not be de-escalated, police said. The security forces will adopt alternative techniques to overcome the barriers caused by the challenging weather and continue the operations. “Monsoon has always been a barrier for combing operations. But with time, we have adopted new techniques to keep our operations running strong,” said Meena.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/more-teeth-to-anti-insurgency-operations-this-summer.html
63,23-2-20,"Experts stress on reducing import of coking coal, loss to exchequer","Specialists and experts gathered on Saturday to think on reducing import of coking coal to save the Government’s foreign exchequer during a discussion programme organized at Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) on Saturday in which the present experts were also opined that reducing ash content during coal yield is need of the hour.

Addressing the gathering of mine specialists as Chief Guest Director (Technical) Binay Dayal in his address brought forward the issue of coking coal reserves quality of the Country which is very poor in terms of ash percentage and has difficulty in beneficiation. He stated that majority of coking coal produced in India is of Washery Grade-V and beyond. “Due to higher ash content only small share of coking coal produced in India has been utilized in metallurgical sector; and remaining major share has been diverted to non-metallurgical sector. The situation is alarmingly critical as we are not only losing valuable coking coal reserves to non-metallurgical sectors, but also it is draining huge Indian foreign currency reserves,” he added.

Speaking on the occasion as Distinguish Guest, Joint Secretary Ministry of Coal M Nagaraju, stated that Government of India has brought out the National Steel Policy with an objective to create a self-sufficient steel industry. “It is envisaged that around 300 mtpa of steel will be produced by 2030-31 for which requirement of coking coal will be around 180 mtpa. It has also given guidelines to use at least 35 per cent of indigenous coking coal. We have considerable resource of medium coking coal around 27.9 Bt out of which around 8.5 per cent Bt were not being considered for beneficiation owing to their higher ash content 35 per cent. After addition of two new grades namely W-V and W-VI in re-classification of coking coal, these coals which were earlier being used for power sector will now be used for steel sector after suitable beneficiation,” he added.

Chairman cum Managing Director, Central Coalfield Limited (CCL), Gopal Singh, also graced the occasion through his presence and had an interactive session with the representative of SAIL, MECON, TATA Steel and other delegates wherein the focus was that both coal and steel sector should sit together to discuss on utilization of the domestic coking coal in the interest of the country.

On the beginning of the programme Director Technical (P and T) KK Mishra welcomed the Chief Guest, Dayal, Guest of Honour Nagaraju, other dignitaries and delegates. He pointed out the figure of the foreign exchange that is 1,90,000 crore was spent on the imported coal. He, therefore, said that utilizing domestic coking coal in metallurgical sector is the need of the hour.

This work shop on “Optimization of clean coal yield at lower ash percentage” has brought learned and experienced persons together to think un directionally in reducing import of coking coal to save government’s foreign exchequer. We look forward to more integrated association of washery operators and consumers with coal producers to work on optimization of available resources.

64,23-2-20,Date for laying foundation stone to be decided next month,"After decade-long wait, the date for laying foundation stone of Ram temple at Ayodhya will be announced in the first week of March, Ram Janambhoomi Terth Khetra Trust member and Mahant of Nirmohi Akhara Dinendra Das said in Ayodhya on Saturday.

Das, who returned from Delhi after attending the first meeting of the Trust, said the date for foundation laying will be announced in the next meeting of the Trust, to be held in Ayodhya in the first week of March.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited by the Trust members to lay the foundation stone and it would possibly be done during Navratri. The PM is reported to have accepted the invitation of the saints to lay the temple’s foundation stone.

Meanwhile, the saints have claimed that as the ‘shilanyas’ of the Ram temple had already been done in the past, now the foundation stone would be laid by the PM. However, some saints say that the foundation stone should not be laid during Navrati or on Ram Navamvi as it could disturb the pilgrims, who come in large numbers to Ayodhya.

Meanwhile, the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board will be meeting in Lucknow on February 24 to take a decision on whether to accept the five acres land given by the authorities on the outskirts of Ayodhya for a new mosque.

The Board will also decide how to use the land as there were several proposals for setting up an educational institution or a hospital along with the mosque on the spot.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/date-for-laying-foundation-stone-to-be-decided-next-month.html

72,23-2-20,India’s Quest for Energy Security,"Over the past two decades, India’s approach takes into account the political, economic, social and environmental issues and concerns under which the energy security policy is being pursued today, writes Dr Ashok Sharma

Energy security has been significant to the economic transformation, global prosperity and well-being of the human kind. Energy security will continue to be detrimental to the existing life and much more crucial to the developing countries than the developed world. The world’s demand for energy grew by 95% in the last 40 years and the future demand, estimated to be more than 90%, to be because of huge growth in demand from India and China. These resources are finite, and the direct links between energy supply and economic growth have pushed the issue of energy security at the core of the policy debate with a considerable impact on the geopolitics.

India, one of the fastest growing major economies, is also the fastest growing energy consumer in the world. And set to become the most populous nation, it is not well endowed with energy reserves. India has mammoth task of meeting its economic and social developmental goals, and lift its millions of people out of poverty. The country has no option but to strive for sustained growth rate of 8-10% to achieve this. India’s economy in all likely will continue to supersede the growth rate of all other major economies in the world in the foreseeable future. The demand for energy in the coming years will accelerate further as India embarks on manufacturing through Modi Government’s much vaulted ‘Make in India’ programme, developmental projects and access to electricity to all. Consequently, energy security has emerged as one of the salient policy issues over the past decade and a half, and the successive Indian governments have emphasised on addressing the impending energy crisis challenges.

In the past, India’s energy security has been narrow in its approach, mainly aimed at managing supply. But over the past two decades, India’s energy security policy has evolved and approach is much more inclusive which takes into account the political, economic, social and environmental issues and concerns under which the energy security policy is being pursued today internationally. India’s quest for energy security could be seen under the framework of four ‘A’s: availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability, which is to make energy accessible to all the sections and sectors at an affordable price in a socially and politically acceptable carbon-controlled environment.

India’s more than 50% of energy needs is derived from domestic stocks of coal, mainly for the electricity. Coal shall remain India’s most important energy source and critical to its growth for the decades ahead. However, the percentage of coal in India’s energy mix will decline in the future. India, with 17% of the world’s population, has just 0.8% of the world’s known oil and natural gas resources. Today, oil accounts for 36% of the country’s primary energy use. This figure is set to rise both in absolute and in percentage terms. India’s domestic production is not sufficient to meet its demand. As a result, India already imports 80% of its crude oil needs. Without new and substantial domestic discoveries, imports will continue to increase. By contrast, natural gas currently provides only 8% of India’s primary energy supply, and most of that gas comes from domestic sources, onshore and offshore. But the position is likely to change drastically as India plans towards the world average for the use of natural gas.

To promote oil and gas production at domestic level, the Indian Government has been taking several steps which range from encouraging the Indian companies to increase their domestic activities and widening its engagement with multinational companies, broadening opportunities for them to participate in oil and gas exploration in India. Also, to stimulate the investments and development in the exploration of hydrocarbon sources of energy, some of the steps have focussed on regulatory changes, a transparent gas pricing policy and redevelopment of uneconomical assets. The domestic efforts have also seen a concerted focus on exploring various alternative sources of energy which are infinite, renewable and environment-friendly. The government has given a massive push in this regard in the energy production through solar energy, wind power, hydroelectricity power, and biomass, and nuclear energy.

At the domestic level, the challenges are puzzling and often at odds such as increasing energy access, building a smart system for drawing investment in energy infrastructure and pricing of energy to facilitate the economic and environmental competence. Unlike the past policy of self-reliance, India’s energy policy has shifted to position itself to address its new dependence on international markets, diversify its sources of energy abroad, look for alternative sources of energy, and increase its domestic production which continues to be in line with its earlier commitment to self-sufficiency. India’s domestic exploration and production push is not very promising. As a result, India continues to rely on the foreign sources for its energy needs especially for petroleum.

Since increased domestic production alone will not be sufficient to meet the projected needs for either oil, gas or coal, India is also expanding its efforts abroad. Eventually, this has made energy security one of the top foreign policy priorities. Despite the Indian government’s emphasis on domestic production of coal and efforts to diversify the sources of energy, the demand for imported coal is likely to continue. India’s energy demand, both for consumer and industry, cannot be done in the near future without the help of imported coal. There is no substantial proof that India can address its energy demand without the use of imported coal to supplement its domestic supply. For example, the energy security has been an important aspect of India-Australia relationship in which import of Australian high calorific value coal remains crucial.

Subsequently, energy security has emerged as one of the top foreign policy priorities of the Modi Government. This becomes significant as Modi Government embarks to make India a manufacturing hub through its much vaulted ‘Make in India’ initiatives. Energy security’s primacy in Modi government’s foreign policy is reflected in his record number of high-profile foreign visits during which he has been cutting energy deals with energy rich countries.

India’s energy security pursuit becomes more challenging with the growing concerns of global climate change and political instability in the energy rich regions of the world. India has been relying mainly on coal and petroleum for its energy sources. India’s move towards renewable energy sources will not be sufficient for its mounting energy demand. India has to look towards an energy sources with less carbon emission and provide base load power. In this context, gas and nuclear energy figure significant. Gas is less carbon emitting source of energy. India’s gas utilisation is far below the world average. Modi government has also given priority to enhance the gas utilisation and move towards gas based economy. India is planning to set up gas pipelines for import of gas from its neighbouring nations. A number of gas pipelines are proposed and are in the construction phase. Majority of them involve intense geopolitics as some of the proposed gas pipelines will pass through Pakistan and China.

Since the two-thirds of India’s oil imports come from one single region, that is, the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries, India is following in the footsteps of other major oil-importing economies and making significant efforts to obtain supplies from sources outside the Gulf. In addition, the possibility of disruption from unseen political instability, religious extremism, terrorism, and threats to supply lines have pushed India to look for new hydrocarbon destinations abroad.

India has taken steps to diversify its hydrocarbon exploration in the regions of Latin America, Africa, Caspian Basin, Russia and in the waters of Indo-Pacific region.

Problems of diversification of energy sources for India arises from the political volatility, geopolitics of these regions and above all it puts India in the direct competition with China particularly in the Non-Middle Eastern and Non-Gulf region as the new destination of energy source which further sparks a geopolitical competition and adds more complexities to an existing competitive and often conflicting India- China relationship.

Nuclear energy has the potential to become an important source of India’s energy mix given its economic affordability in the long run and environment friendly. Currently, nuclear energy makes up around 3% of India’s energy mix and has the potential to become 20 to 25% of India’s energy mix by 2050. The lack of enriched uranium, light water reactors, and advanced technology hampered India’s nuclear energy capability. But after the conclusion of India-US nuclear agreement, India’s nuclear apartheid ended and unchained India from the technology denial regimes of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Act of 1978 which came in the wake of India’s first atomic test in 1974. The nuclear deal was aimed to help India to meet its looming energy crisis by enabling it to access to safeguarded nuclear fuel, advanced light water reactors and civilian nuclear technology.

The India-US nuclear deal pushed the energy security to the core of India’s foreign policy. After the India-US civilian nuclear deal, India has sealed the civilian nuclear agreements with a number of countries including France, Russia, Canada, Australia, Japan and the UK. Given India’s non-signatory status of Nuclear-Non-Proliferation Treaty, for any country dealing with India in nuclear energy and technology trade becomes an issue of a mutual trust and confidence which required delicate diplomacy from India. Though aimed to address India’s energy security, the US-India nuclear deal was viewed by China as part of the United States’ grand strategy to contain the growing power and influence of China in Asia. As a result, the Chinese and Pakistani lobbying along with ‘Nuclear Ayatollahs’ put a concerted lobbying effort to block the nuclear deal at Capitol Hill, though failed. The India-China energy geopolitics resurfaced during India’s bid to membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) recently. China used its clout and prerogatives to block India’s case for the inclusion in the NSG. The nuclear energy is significant for India’s efforts to shift to an environmentally friendly energy sources and alternate sources of energy sources.

India’s push towards renewable energy has been remarkable which is reflected in Modi Government’s schemes to give a boost to renewable energy sources. But even the renewable energy sources are not free from the competitive geopolitical environment. India-Chian energy geo-politics is also reflected in renewable energy space. Renewable energy’s geographic and technical characteristics are fundamentally different from those of coal, oil and natural gas. Though still in the formative stage, international norms are being built towards the renewable energy, and India-China energy geopolitics will enter this new energy space as both are striving to influence the renewable energy space. The inevitability of renewable energy is undeniable and countries are gearing up for an increased share in their energy mix. Those that dominate the markets in these new technologies will likely have the most influence over the development patterns of the future. As other major powers find themselves in climate denial, China and India both are moving to use and exploit the global renewable energy space, though China is ahead.

India is emerging as a new normative player in the renewable energy regime. Prime Minister Modi has pursued unwavering commitment to energy security by constructing 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022 and India is committed to its unflinching commitment to combat global warming irrespective of what happens in the rest of the world. Prime Minister Modi being awarded the “Champion of Earth” by the UN Secretary General in 2018 is additional power to India’s growing normative leadership in this new energy source regime that translates into geopolitics as it helps India to enhance its image internationally.

India’s energy policy is being pursued in a much more inclusive manner in its domestic and international settings to address its fast-growing energy demand in a competitive geo-political environment. India energy exploration abroad in the new regions is putting in direct competition with with China. Unlike the US-Soviet Union energy geopolitics, the India-China energy competition has been mostly confined to the commercial and diplomatic level tussles, though both remain vulnerable to conflicts which may get aggravated due to their competitive and conflicting relations and the emerging strategic geometry in the Indo-Pacific region.

The AAP is, at present, recognised by the Election Commission as a state party.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/16-lakh-missed-calls-join-aap-campaign.html
78,23-2-20,"Rise in books’ prices triggers protest by students, parents","Hundreds of schoolchildren and parents demonstrated at the Jantar Mantar in the national Capital on Saturday against the rise in the prices of books. Parents expressed displeasure at the cost of books. Parents said the paper that came from outside for books has stopped, due to which the prices of copy and books are increasing.

The demonstration also saw participation of several paper associations along with children and parents at Jantar Mantar on Saturday. In the sit-in demonstration, the paper association said, ""If you cannot give jobs then at least don't take it away. Unemployment will somehow increase the crime rate.""

""Printing press in remote areas uses the small machines, which will be shut down due this import restriction, and thousands of people will become unemployed. These restrictions increase the rate of paper, which directly affect our businesses, they said.

One of the protesters Vinay Jain said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said to stop using the plastic but some people conspired and stopped the import of paper. Due to the ban on paper, which is coming from America, the copy, books became expensive because 80 percent of the paper imported from America was used for making school copies and books.

People involved in the demonstration were holding posters in their hands, which read, ""If books are expensive, how will daughters read"". Also on some other posters it was written, 'Stop the black marketing of white paper'.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rise-in-books----prices-triggers-protest-by-students--parents.html
79,23-2-20,Convict's claim of mental illness bundle of distorted facts: Tihar officials,"A Delhi court on Saturday dismissed the plea of Vinay Kumar Sharma, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape, claiming that he is suffering from insanity, mental illness and schizophrenia. In court, Tihar authorities termed as a bundle of distorted facts the claim by Sharma that he is suffering from mental illness.

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana rejected the plea by Vinay Kumar Sharma. The authorities told Additional Sessions Judge Rana that CCTV footage established that the convict, Vinay Kumar Sharma, had inflicted superficial injuries on himself and was not suffering from any psychological disorder.

The psychologist, who appeared on behalf of the jail, said regular medical checkups of all four convicts were done on a daily basis and they are all fine.

""These (convict's claims) are all a bundle of distorted facts. Doctor attended to him and found there was an injury. They gave him medicine. All injuries are self-inflicted and superficial in nature,"" the public prosecutor representing jail authorities said.

""The medical records say he is not suffering from any such mental illness and his checkup in any hospital is not required. He is under regular check by the jail doctor. He talked to his mother and lawyer. So it's wrong to say that he is not able to recognise them,"" he said.

The defence counsel said the convict has plaster on his hand that shows he has fractures and not superficial injuries.

""Why did the jail conceal the fact about his injuries from the court? Why are documents not being filed?"" advocate A P Singh, appearing for the convict, asked.

However, the Tihar authorities said ""it's wrong to say he had a plastered arm. It wasn't a fracture. It was only a slab around his hand.""

According to prison officials, Sharma injured himself by banging his head on his prison cell's wall in Tihar Jail. The incident happened in jail number 3 on last week on Sunday afternoon, they said, adding that he got some minor injuries and was treated at the prison premises.

The court had on February 17 issued fresh death warrants for execution on March 3 at 6 am against the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

It had issued fresh warrants against death row convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay Kumar (31).

80,23-2-20,Mughal prince with a heart,"Name : DARA SHUKOH: The Man Who Would Be King

Author : Avik Chanda

Publication : HarperCollins, Rs699

Avik Chanda’s book, Dara Shukoh: The Man Who would be King, is an ideal read, not only for aspiring historians but also for those interested in Indian history, writes Kumar Chellappan

A frequently heard complaint from a section of Indian historians is that vested interests have played havoc with the sub-continent’s history, traditions and culture. If one goes through the history books taught in the Indian schools and universities, it will be found that those lamenting over the tampering of India’s history are not exaggerating. Some sections of the country’s valuable history have been suppressed from the new generation, especially from those who were born after 1950.

How many among those who were born after 1950 are familiar with the great Maratha ruler Shivaji, the valiant fighter Tantia Tope, the great social reformer Mahatma Phule, the all time great of the 19th century South India by name Chattampi Swamikal and his colleague Sree Narayana Guru?

We cannot put the entire blame for distorting history upon previous regimes alone. It is a strategy deployed since time immemorial to misinterpret historical facts by groups with vested interests. “History is written by victors,” Sir Winston Churchill, former British Prime Minister who is known for his erudition and knowledge had said. In modern times, it was proved by the British colonialists. The best example is Louis Mountbatten’s decision to destroy even the last vestiges of victory symbols of the Japanese army from Singapore and Malaysia.

“After re-taking Singapore, Mountbatten’s (who was the Supreme Commander, South East Asia during Second World War) first act was to order the demolition of the war memorial honouring slain heroes of the Indian National Army. The INA War Memorial at Singapore to commemorate the “Unknown Warrior” was started on July 8, 1945 at Esplanade Park. It was razed to the ground by Mountbatten’s allied troops when they reoccupied the city. Demolishing memorials, war memorials and other revered symbols of defeated people is habitual Christian triumphalism as is desecrating the tombs of the rulers of conquered people,” writes Radha Rajan, one of the highly respected thinkers of our times.

Most Indians are not really serious about learning history. They are not even bothered about recent history as can be seen by the attitude of the new generation towards the dark days of emergency declared by the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.

I was shocked to see the larger than life flex boards with pictures of Fidel Castro and Che Guevera greeting the delegates of Indian Science Congress during the 2009 Indian Science Congress held at Thiruvananthapuram. There were no pictures of Sir C V Raman, Prof J C Bose, S N Bose and the likes who took Indian science to new heights. But for ISRO, which co-sponsored the event, there would not have been a single picture of that prince of Indian Space Science, Vikram Sarabhai.

This is not the case with science alone. How many among our new historians are familiar with the works of the great Acharya Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, whose seminal work the eleven-volume History and Culture of Indian People preserve and protect the great history of this great nation from getting tampered by the evil designs of people following imported and outdated ideologies?

Dara Shukoh, son of Shah Jahan, was the unsung hero of the Mughal Dynasty. Dara, the eldest son of Shah Jahan lived only up to the age of 44 years but left indelible marks in the history of the sub continent.

What makes him dear to the people in Mughal empire was his tolerance towards other religions and humane nature, unlike his younger brother Aurangzeb, who went on to become the Mughal ruler presiding over the kingdom till the ripe age of 89!

Aurangzeb was known for his hatred towards Hindus and went on demolishing and destroying the Sanatana Dharma and its symbols like temples, ashrams and monasteries. Though the secularists tried to portray him as a philanthropist by hiring the services of Audrey Truschke to come out with a volume by name Aurangzeb: The Man and Myth, it fell all flat as she could not counter the eye witness accounts of Francois Bernier (a European physician and traveller in Shah Jahan’s court) and Niccolao Manucci (a military strategist for Dara, who continued to work with Aurangzeb after the fall of the former).

Dara in his brief tenure as prince had got the Vedas and Upanishads translated into Persian and French and this itself speak volumes about his compassion for anything that originated in the sub continent. Who in India would have heard about Bernier and Manucci if it had not been for S L Bhyrappa who in his famous work Aavaran told the readers about the official eye witness accounts of these two Europeans?

Avik Chanda, a business advisor with degrees from Delhi School of Economics, has taken from where Bhyrappa left.

Chanda’s book “Dara Shukoh :The Man Who Would Be King” is a refreshing experience. Chanda gives the readers a bird’s eye view on the life and time of Shukoh, the designated heir of Shah Jahan. Even as a young prince, Shukoh wanted the common man to know more about the Islamic saints and for that he opted words instead of swords unlike Aurangzeb and Tipu Sultan. “What Dara was striving for was not linguistic and literary brilliance but a tone of simplicity, an idiom that would induce faith in the reader who was a common man,” writes Chanda (Page 51). Thus was born Safinat-ul-Aulia, an account of the lives of over 400 saints!

The account of Dara Shukoh once again underlines the fact that the Muslim invaders who occupied the thrones in New Delhi and elsewhere in the subcontinent chose this land only to loot and proselytise. The Sufi saints were Islamic evangelists who went ahead with their mission by singing about love and preaching the message of anarchy. Despite the fact that he belonged to the Mughal dynasty, Dara had some civility in his heart unlike his forefather Babar or sibling Aurangzeb. Those who are out to paint Aurangzeb with divinity may need more self styled historians like Audrey Truschke because we have writers like Avik Chanda for digging out the truth.

Dara Shukoh: The Man Who would be King is an ideal work not only for aspiring historians but for general readers interested in Indian history.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mughal-prince-with-a-heart-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/mughal-prince-with-a-heart.html
81,23-2-20,Trump’s jamboree in Delhi for regional equations,"The entire world looks forward to the upcoming jaunt of President Trump to New Delhi as both he and PM Modi share special chemistry with each other as has been evident during their various rendezvous

The American national interest is served by US President Donald Trump’s visit to New Delhi as both the nations are striving hard for a newly discovered “ally-hood” which might be a step towards a closer and a more fruitful relationship, as, an aftermath of President Trump’s visit to New Delhi which can be considered as significant summitry with all its ebullient expectations.

It was President Trump only, in the run up to the National Security Strategy Document in 2017, who declared that India needs to assume novae roles in the international system going by its rising pelf, geo-economic influence and strategic might. This gels well with the avowed ordering principle of “Vishwa guru” which India adheres to as a functional aspect of its foreign policy though the dictum needs much more of an elaboration in the light of the ebb and flow of the tide of International Relations. Such an American perception will be the key theme when President Trump visits New Delhi.

Perceived in the context of President Trump’s visit, a few pointers need to be elucidated. The foremost being the step which is much awaited in New Delhi that the US ought to disown the arch antagonist Pakistan and a kind of a reassurance to New Delhi can be given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though all military aid has already been curtailed to Islamabad. Secondly, New Delhi will air its concern about the outbreak of coronavirus and also as an attendant fact, China’s extended ministration in the Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation (IOC-ARC) region and the Malacca straits should be another theme to be deliberated upon by the summiteers.

Also, PM Modi can insist upon President Trump that in the case of other peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) and in the context of the Civilian Nuclear Liability Bill, more of a clearer comprehension can be reached between the twin nations in New Delhi, which falls in the criterion of the of PM Modi being a “Good Friend,” as elucidated by President Trump in one of his latest statement on the soil of the United States of America. Also, the Indian negotiators can look forward to a novae appreciation of the fact that India has waged a successful war against terrorism and a more practical and reflective collaboration can be materialised between New Delhi and Washington in tougher times to come. The deliberations might include the trade differences in relation with stents, knee implants, information and communication technology products along with the cess which the United States imposes on the sale of Harley Davidson bikes in India.

Perceived in such an interesting and illuminating light, the entire world looks forward to the upcoming jaunt of President Trump to New Delhi as both he and PM Modi share special chemistry with each other as has been evident during their various rendezvous. The Indian support to President Trump can be the order of the day on February 24, 2020, in relation to his electioneering in the American homeland. The summitry need not be dwelt upon as a promotional election event for President Trump, but, as a significant course corrective in the larger spectrum of the relationship between both the nations.

All in all and in toto, the negotiators from India and the United States are engaged fervently to reach a micro trade deal before President Trump lands in Delhi. If a well nuanced trade and investment quid pro quo is not arrived at by the twin interlocutors then a fledgling trade alliance is on cards as a prologue to the President’s jaunt to New Delhi. Such a biz takeway will be the cognizant quid pro quo in the commercial tryst with each other. Also, despite the divergences in the context of aluminum trade and the retaliatory Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), both the heads of Governments are well suited to negotiate hard for trade deal in lines with the characteristics of shared values, democratisation and attendant principles of a liberal trade ecosystem. Also, President Trump would do well to heed the concerns of PM Modi. Also, as an attendant fact the United States is expected to discuss the idiom of protectionism which the New Delhi denomination is adhering to in the light of a cyclical domestic downturn in the Indian economy. The US-based GSP refers to through the instrumentality of the US Customs and Border Protection that, “The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free treatment to goods of designated beneficiary countries. The programme was authorised by the Trade Act of 1974 to promote economic growth in the developing countries and was implemented on January 1, 1976.” It has been observed that a trade fight overshadows the dictum of the larger Strategic relationship in the specificities of the Trump-Modi meet in the Raisina Hill. The strategic collaborative exercise has germinated between both the nations since the last decade but this strategic partnership in the context of the Asiatic Space and the Indian Ocean Rim nations is all set to be discomfited in the aftermath of a trade war like scenario between India and United States of America.

The US Trade representative, Robert Lighthizer is already negotiating a hard ball Indian negotiating side to ramp up the Presidential visit with a prized micro deal to serve it up for the American electorate which is also in the larger protectionist national interest of President Trump’s blue collar America. The Indian concern at the Trump-Modi itinerary might be the chances of reprisals that New Delhi might have to confront if all do not go well with the larger trade talks in New Delhi. The allegation from the American industry and corporate is that India is still evading the liberal trade regime and ratcheting up the guillotine of strait-jacketed protectionism. The Foreign Policy, FP trade report, contends and informs us that President Trump is more concerned with the trade imbalance which the United States trade structure has with India and China, but that might be truer with the People’s Republic of China, then, with India. As a recent U-turn, President Trump has indicated that no big trade deal will be signed between both the nations in his visit to India though his negotiators had done the spade work before the President’s visit, which comes as a rude shock to the twin negotiating sides being engaged in trade negotiations. Though, the trade deal which will be limited in context, aims to achieve waivers for the American farm products along with the homeland’s dairy products, the refusal to ink trade deals points at the underlying tensions between both the nations. The US President has stated that he is looking forward to a limited trade deal while the wholesome agreement can wait for the future which might not augur well for New Delhi.

Apart from the trade optics of the Trump-Modi summitry, the diplomatic factoid of Xi Jinping ceremoniously inking trade agreements with Myanmar and establishing a deep water port in Myanmar, is a stately and crafty striving to sideline both India and the United States in the Indian Ocean Rim. It also aims at isolating India, which does not augur well for the United States, which now feels the squeeze of an overtly aggressive Chin in the contested waters of Indian Ocean. This theme, along with the threat for an Indo-US détente, might turn out to be a key part of deliberations in the President-Prime Minister summitry in New Delhi on February 25. Still, the epithet of being the “Tariff King” which the American President has utilised for India reflects the expected concessions from the side of the New Delhi fence as an aftermath of the February summitry.

82,23-2-20,Iran now says 5 dead out of 28 infected,"Iranian health authorities on Saturday reported a fifth death from the new virus that emerged in China, and said the fatality was from among 10 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.

So far, 28 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including the five who died.

People are being treated for the virus in at least four different cities, including the capital, Tehran, where some pharmacies had already run out of masks and hand sanitizer. Other cities are Qom, Arak and Rasht.

The virus loomed over a nationwide parliamentary election in Iran on Friday. Many voters went to the polls wearing face masks.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour made Saturday’s announcement for the latest figures on state TV, but did not specify when the fifth death occurred.

Two people had died earlier Friday from COVID-19, the illness caused by virus. Authorities reported two deaths previously this week.

Jahanpour said that of the 10 newly detected cases, two were in the capital of Tehran and eight were in the city of Qom. That’s where the first two elderly patients died on Wednesday. He said the two patients in the capital had visited Qom or had links with the city. Minoo Mohraz, an Iranian health ministry official, had said Friday that the virus “possibly came from Chinese workers who work in Qom and travelled to China.” She did not elaborate.

A Chinese company has been building a solar power plant in Qom. World Health Organisation officials have said that China’s crackdown on parts of the country bought time for the rest of the world to prepare for the new virus. But as hot spots emerge around the globe, including in South Korea and Iran, there has been trouble finding the first patient who sparked each new cluster.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/iran-now-says-5-dead-out-of-28-infected.html
83,23-2-20,Avoid non-essential travel to Singapore: Govt,"As India and China indulged in blame game on an IAF plane not getting permission to evacuate Indians from the coronavirus-hit regions there, New Delhi on Saturday issued a fresh advisory asking flyers to avoid non-essential travel to Singapore. It also said screening at airports is now being planned for flight passengers coming to India from Kathmandu, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia from Monday.

India’s assertion that China was “deliberately delaying” permission to the IAF plane was refuted by the Chinese embassy. Official sources said Japan, Ukraine and France have been allowed to operate flights between February 16 and 20 but India’s request has not been approved.

An IAF transport plane C-17 is yet to fly to China to bring back Indians and carry relief material for people affected by coronavirus there. However, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said the current epidemic situation in Hubei province is complicated, and the prevention and control of Covid-19 has entered into a critical stage. “There is no such thing as China deliberately delaying granting flight permission,” spokesperson Ji Rong said.

India was to send its military transport aircraft to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on February 20 but the plane could not take off as permission was not granted.

Sources said, Indian nationals stuck in Wuhan are waiting to be brought back home and the uncertainty over evacuation is causing them mental stress and anxiety. The aircraft was to carry a large consignment of medical supplies to China and bring back more Indians from Wuhan.

Sources said, while the Chinese side continues to maintain that there was no delay in granting permission for the flight to go, the clearance has ‘inexplicably’ not been given.

In a letter to President Xi Jinping earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed India’s solidarity to the people and Government of China in meeting the challenge of the coronavirus outbreak and offered to provide assistance to the country.

India then put together relief supplies in pursuance of Modi’s commitment as a token of India’s solidarity, particularly in the 70th year of the anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

“These supplies have been offered even as India faces tremendous shortage itself, given our ethos of helping others in their hour of need,” said a source aware of the issue. The relief items include gloves, surgical masks, feeding pumps and defibrillators based on the requirements as indicated by the Chinese side.

“The Chinese side always attaches great importance to the health and safety of Indian nationals in China, and provided assistance and convenience for the return of Indian citizens,” Ji further said in reply to the query.

“We are carefully assessing the ground situation, as prevention work requires. Competent departments of the two countries are keeping communication and coordination in this regard,” she said.

India’s national carrier Air India has already evacuated around 640 Indians from Wuhan in two separate flights. According to estimates, over 100 Indians are still living in Wuhan.

Indian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait for the flight. The delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish, said the sources.

They said relief and evacuation flights from other countries including by France are allowed to operate by China but the permission has not come through in India’s case.

“Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support? Why are they creating roadblock in evacuating our nationals from Wuhan and putting them under hardship and mental agony?” said a person aware of the issue.

On February 17, India had announced that it will send C-17 Globemaster, with medical supplies to Wuhan, and bring back its nationals as well as citizens from all neighbouring countries.

As regards the travel advisory, currently, passengers from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore and Japan are screened at 21 designated airports in the country for a possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. Universal screening at airports is now being planned for flights from Kathmandu, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia from Monday, the health ministry said. The decision was taken during a review meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary to take a stock of the status, actions taken and preparedness of states and Union Territories regarding management of novel coronavirus here on Saturday, the Ministry said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/avoid-non-essential-travel-to-singapore--govt.html
84,23-2-20,"Keep aside identities, think as one nation: BJP to Cong","The BJP on Saturday hit out at the Congress over its scepticism about US President Donald Trump’s visit to India asking the Opposition party, why it is unhappy when the country’s stature is being raised globally. The BJP said there are times when political parties should keep aside their identities and “think as one nation”.

The BJP’s counter came a day after the Congress said Trump’s visit should not become an extension of the US presidential election campaign but yield concrete results for India. The visit should not be reduced to a photo opportunity or a PR exercise that would devalue the importance of Indo-US partnership, the Congress had said.

Addressing a Press conference at the BJP headquarters here, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said Trump’s visit will be a landmark moment in the Indo-US relationship and advised the Congress to “start taking pride in the nation’s achievements”. “This is a meeting of the world’s largest and oldest democracies and it should be celebrated,” he said adding, “There are times when political parties should keep aside their identities and think as one nation.”

Underlining that Trump himself has said multiple times that India is a hard bargainer, Patra said the Congress should not be worried about India’s interests.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hardwork, India’s relations with other countries have further strengthened from Sochi to Mallapuram, he said. Taking a dig at the Congress, Patra asked if 10 Janpath (residence of party president Sonia Gandhi) had allowed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to develop Prime Minister Narendra Modi-like rapport with international leaders.

Trump’s visit will be a landmark moment in Indo-US relations and the Congress should “start taking pride in the nation’s achievements”, he added.

Responding to the Congress’ questions about what the country will gain from this visit, Patra said the latest defense equipment and the deals that the US was offering to India were never offered during the UPA regime.

85,23-2-20,Priyanka raises question on funding of panel formed to oversee US Prez visit,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday raised questions over the funding of the committee formed to oversee various programmes during US President Donald Trump’s Ahmedabad visit on February 24. She wondered what the Government is “hiding under the guise” of the committee.

“Rs100 crore is being spent on the visit of President Trump. But this money is being spent through a committee. The members of the committee do not know that they are its members. Does the country not have the right to know which Ministry gave how much money to the committee? What is the Government hiding under the guise of the committee?” the Congress general secretary tweeted.

The Congress also took a swipe at the ‘Donald Trump Nagrik Abhinandan Samiti’ with a parody advertisement on its official Twitter handle. The poster read ‘hiring now’ for job of “waving at US President Donald Trump”. It also said that the vacancies were 69 lakh and remuneration would be “achche din”.

The committee headed by Ahmedabad mayor Bijal Patel held its first meeting at the Circuit House in Ahmedabad on Saturday.

The formation of the committee, first announced as Donald Trump Nagarik Abhivadan Samiti by Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, had drawn flak from the Congress.

Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain who all are in this Samiti.

“Why is Gujarat Government spending Rs120 Crore for a 3 hour event organised by an unknown Pvt entity? India values its visiting dignitaries but pl note- Diplomacy is serious Government business & not a series of photo-ops & event management tactics,” Surjewala asked.

87,23-2-20,Manmohan: ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ misused to construct militant India,"In an apparent attack on the ruling BJP at the Centre, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said that nationalism and the slogan of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ are being misused to construct a “militant and purely emotional” idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens.

Addressing a gathering at the launch of a book on Jawaharlal Nehru’s works and speeches, Singh said that if India is recognised in the comity of nations as a vibrant democracy and, if it is considered as one of the important world powers, it was the first Prime Minister, who should be recognised as its main architect.

Nehru had led this country in its volatile and formative days when it adopted a democratic way of life, accommodating divergent social and political views, Singh said. India’s first Prime Minister, who was very proud of Indian heritage, assimilated it, and harmonised them into the needs of a new modern India, he said

“With an inimitable style, and a multi-linguist, Nehru laid the foundation of the universities, academies and cultural institutions of Modern India. But for Nehru’s leadership, independent India would not have become what it is today,” Singh said.

“But unfortunately, a section of people who either do not have the patience to read history or would like to be deliberately guided by their prejudices, try their best to picture Nehru in a false light. But I am sure, history has a capacity to reject fake and false insinuations and put everything in proper perspective,” he said.

The book ‘Who is Bharat Mata’ contains selections from Nehru’s classic books Autobiography, Glimpses of World History and the Discovery of India; his speeches, essays and letters from pre and post independence years; and some of his most revealing interviews. It was first brought out in English and now its Kannada translation has been released.

“It is a book of particular relevance at a time when Nationalism and the slogan of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ are being misused to construct a militant and purely emotional idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens,” he said.

Singh also extensively quoted Nehru, saying he had asked, “Who is this Bharat Mata?, whose victory you wish?”

“The mountains and rivers, forests and fields are of course dear to everyone, but what counted ultimately is the people of India... Spread out all over vast land,” Singh quoted Nehru as saying.

Nehru makes a very significant and time relevant remark on the dangers of leadership falling into a trap and getting removed far away from the common people whom they are supposed to serve, Singh said. “Conceit, like fat on the human body, grows imperceptibly, layer upon layer and the person whom it affects is unconscious of the daily accretion.

Fortunately, the hard knocks of a mad world tone it down or even squash it completely, and there has been no lack of these hard knocks for us in India. The school of life has been difficult one, and suffering is a hard task master,” he quoted Nehruo as

Embellishing his selection with high-note harmonies by grandson Tao Rodriguez, Pete strummed his banjo and guitar to strike up the ever-popular If I had a hammer question, reminisce Jose Marti’s Guantanamera, count 1,2,3 on the Vietnam Song and run through the Midnight Special. In between there were stories, lots of laughter, more stories and a knee-slapping, foot-stomping jingle that had the 77-year-old bringing the house down with thunderous applause.

And they all sang along.

The money tune came next. It was zesty, what with Tao’s freewheeling harmonies aided by the snappy guitar rhythm: …Money can still be handy too (but) let’s not allow ‘king money’ to rule.

The audience, essentially 30-plus, was loving it.

‘How does he do it?’

‘What energy, it’s amazing…’ were all that the chattering classes could manage.

But it was truly magical. How could one man, 77 years old, and helped only by a guitar and a grandson, captivate his listeners thus? And that too when there are none of the now-generation psychedelic pyrotechnics, no multi-coloured lights and no fancy bass-boosting sound system.

The truth is Pete doesn’t need all that. He never did. For having spent over five decades directing music towards social change for peace, equality and decency, his philosophy was always about heart-and-soul, and about the power of simplicity. No wonder they always sing along.

During the early ‘60s, after he was able to reorganise the Newport Folk Festival to use profits to help folk performers, he privately published How to Play the Five-String Banjo but refused to copyright the book because the ‘banjo belongs to everyone’. Pete’s humanity was so unusual it seemed threatening. Always a popular target of the US witch-hunt-he was sentenced to prison and blacklisted during the McCarthy era-particularly suspicious was his custom of learning songs from every country where he gave concerts.

Back at Siri Fort, Tao held on to this tradition as he rendered an Argentinian song about god, war and the future. Pete was on harmony this time as the grandson’s soul-stirring high-pitched singing had the audience fall head over heels. A standing ovation was the young man’s reward.

A slow and soft tune on Pete’s recorder helped the ever-cooperating audience hum one note for effect, which was then followed by what the Guru had picked up from an Indian student, Ram Dhun. Tao dwelled on the high notes once again as Pete celebrated his comeback.

Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram/Patita Pavan Sita Ram.…

And they all sang along.

Over two hours had slipped by rather quickly. By then there were more songs with tabla player Ashim Chakraborty joining the duo. But the audience was getting restless. Some of the favourites were yet to come. ‘Turn, Turn’, someone screamed from the far corner of the balcony. ‘Last Train to Nuremberg, Garbage’, it went on. Amidst all the shouts for encores, chief guest Ustad Amjad Ali Khan presented the customary floral tributes on behalf of hosts, Indian Council for Cultural Relations. And as Pete thanked the ‘wonderful singing audience,’ he obliged with The Anthem.

We shall overcome,

We shall overcome, someday

Oh deep in my heart I do believe

We shall overcome someday…

And they all sang along.

I learnt that song in Bangla in the ‘70s as a ten-year-old while living on a college campus on Beltola Road in Bhawanipore, hearing students sing it with zest, welcoming a group of families from Bangladesh who had fled the war of 1971 and had been sheltered there, courtesy my aunt, the principal of Beltola Basic Training College. Not sure if I grasped its true import then, but as the years passed I realised how my mother and I could well have been among them. Not fleeing war, but finding ourselves without a roof over our heads after life in Agartala took an unexpected turn.

That song, anthem really, would be heard on various occasions in Calcutta; at student marches protesting too few teachers in government colleges, at Left Front political rallies against the bourgeois Press or funnily enough, at residents’ meetings to demand, not eight-hourly, but four-hourly, water supply from Calcutta Corporation and at a Dharamtala sit-in defence of the Bengali’s inalienable right not to work and enforce a state-wide shutdown (bandh). Calcutta still loves a good protest. We had to take it in our stride. Still do.

But Delhi is way different.

89,23-2-20,Lord Shiva: Existence personified,"This friday, Hindus celebrated Shivaratri dedicated to Lord Shiva, popularly seen as one amongst the God-trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh (another contextual naming of Shiva). Hindus apart, who revere Him in highest esteem, Shiva now seems to be extending His charm even in the scientific world. He, now in his dance form (Nataraja), is prominently displayed at Perth laboratory, known for its particle accelerators engaged in exploring what they term as “God Particle.” For, in their perception, Shiva’s dance symbolises the play and interplay of cosmic energy streams, which progressively evolved into the manifest plural world. The concepts underlying Lord Shiva can be seen in different perspectives. For meditators, He remains the Adi Guru. In Nataraja form, he remains the guiding spirit of the classical dancers. Kashmir Shaivism carries on its metaphysical perception around Shiva. To me, He comes out as ‘Existence personified’.

A look at two imageries associated with Shiva in togetherness, presents a unified picture of the world process, encompassing the whole gamut of creation, sustenance and recycling. In the first picture Lord Shiva is seated in meditative posture on Mount Kailash. He is shown having lunar crescent over his head, almost bare bodied with just the private part covered with tiger skin. His poison fed blue neck is encircled by venomous snake. River Ganges flows down his matted hair locks. He is seen holding a trident in one arm, Damru (double headed hand drum) in another, rosary in the third, and the 4th palm in blessing mode. Being in meditative posture symbolises reflecting on the churning within, on the prospects of creation. As the rosary keeps circling, the life cycle keeps moving in succession. The blessing mode implies that all existences draw succour out of his inexhaustible potential.

In the second imagery, Lord Shiva, mounted on a bull, has in his entourage multitude forms of existences, some of them even weird and invisible. To name a few, divine beings, humans, devilish existences, animals, birds, goblins, and even invisible existences such as ghost etc. Symbolically, his entourage is indicative of the multipolar manifest world with all its enormity and diversity. This particular symbol stands for the dynamic world ever on the move at its own pace, as would a bull moving at a constant pace mean. While pulling a cart, the bull moves unprovoked at a constant pace and would not stop in the way till it reaches a place designated for being fed and taking rest. After a while, the bull again takes the journey forward, and then finally reverts back to its normal place of abode after completing the voyage. The manifest world too, after being on the run for a specified time, reverts back to the primal source to acquire a restful state, when it gets recharged once again. Following which, out of the seeds of life withdrawn into primal-source, fresh creation cycle takes off.

Mount Kailasa, is one of the high peaks in the Himalayan range to which lot of perennial rivers are sourced, including the Ganges. It, thus, is closest to the cosmic world, simultaneously having all round view of life down below. Lord Shiva, with lunar crescent over the head, read together with his place of abode, the Himalayan range having in store perennial rivers, is symbolic of eternity, infinity.

The presence of lunar crescent symbolises the convergence of all nature driven forces. For, Moon’s luminosity is drawn out of the light extended by the Sun, as well as all the planets and stars up above in the cosmos. But before all light drawn thus, flows down the line, Moon does its own stamping by turning them into an amiable form. Moon, thus, symbolises convergence of all nature driven energy streams.

With the play of Damru, the equilibrated state of the primal source gets shaken, when the primal sound note O? comes into play. Now going by the scientific perception, once there is entropy (disorder), it multiplies in geometric progression. So, it happened following excitation of O? sound. In the process, first came into play Energy-trinity — Sata, Rajasa, and Tamasa. Trident, it may kindly be noted is symbolic of Lord Shiva’s creative power — the three phalanges of the trident branching out of the base rod imply three dimensions of energies emanating from a singularity. The random mutation of the three that followed, led to multitude of differentiated energy streams. The harmony and symphony of these differentiated energy streams that followed, led to all creations, first up above in the cosmos.

90,23-2-20,When intelligence is artificial,"In its 11th edition, TEDxGateway has hosted exceptional speakers who are slowly but surely changing the healthcare sector. SHALINI SAKSENA catches up with researchers who talk about how they have carved a niche for themselves

Creating a buzz at age 13

Rishab Jain (15)

Scientist and Inventor

He is a freshman in school at Portland, Oregon, US. He does a lot of science related activities and research on pancreatic cancer in the medical field and the application of applying artificial intelligence (AI) to medical treatment of pancreatic cancer. When he is not doing research, he is busy participating in science bowl — a buzzer-based competition for those who want to increase their knowledge, especially in Biology. A big part of his free time is spent in track and field running cross-country. Meet 15-year-old Rishab Jain, a scientist and an innovator who has invented the Pancreatic Cancer Deep Learning System (PCDLS), an AI tool that improves radiation treatment in cancer. He aspires to become a surgeon and hopes to cure pancreatic cancer one day.

He tells you that despite his busy school schedule and the time spent on research for pancreatic cancer, he does manage to find time for himself to pursue what he loves — running. “I was 13 when I found out about this cancer, after passing of a family friend from pancreatic cancer. I was intrigued and found out the survival rate and got to know that this cancer is extremely deadly and survival rate is very low. This is because it takes time to pinpoint the area of the cancer,” Jain says.

His system of AI that uses deep learning is a technique that offers an abstract way of looking inside and identifying patterns in the data. But he used another technique withing deep learning — convolutional neural network. This network, he tells you has the ability to look at images and identify patterns inside. “What I did was the data that I had of MRI and CT scan of abdominal area. Within the thousands of different pictures of the abdomen, I had different images of the organs including pancreas. I used my tool to predict where the pancreas is positioned which is extremely hard to find for the untrained eye. My goal was to improve the accuracy for radio therapy by segmenting the pancreas which can sometimes take a long time for a radiologist to do,” Jain explains.

Another benefit of his deep learning system is its real-time application. Rather than pinpointing the pancreas from the images and then moving on for treatment, if there is a AI tool — PCDLS — can locate pancreas within a couple of seconds. “It is all about the execution of the programme running the command. When we take the CT and MRI images, it becomes fast to locate the pancreas,” Jain says. He tells you that his tool is about early detection of this type of cancer.

“At present, pancreatic cancer treatment involves generic cancer treatment. Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high doses of targeted energy to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumours. The problem in treating pancreatic cancer lies in its late detection – last stage. At this point, all one can do is shrink the tumour and if the patient is lucky, they can successfully remove the tumour,” Jain says.

Not only this, Jain is also named as America’s Top Young Scientist for his path breaking innovation to improve radiotherapy. A competition he entered when he was 13. “After I came up with the solution using AI for pancreatic cancer that began after a lot of reading and doing a lot of research I realised that it was something that can be used in the future and have a big impact after I got some success, I entered a competition — 3M Young Scientists Challenge. The great thing about this that they pick out the top ideas from the US that are presented and provide support like mentorship. The primary reason to enter the competition was if I was selected it would allow me to better my tool and I could look for a bigger expansion. After I was selected, I spent that summer improving on the accuracy of the tool. I got more data, I fined tuned it. It was then that my idea became a reality,” Jain says.

When he speaks at platforms like TedxGateway, the reaction of the people is centered more on his age. “When people see a young person talking while it can be a source of big inspiration, people may doubt it at first. I believe no matter what the age, anybody can make a difference. It just needs one idea that a person has to be passionate about and have the goal to complete it. With the right mindset and opportunity, it is possible to achieve that goal,” Jain says.

According to him the best overall invention has been the Internet that provided the biggest platform for everything. Just the creation of connecting multiple computers has made so many things possible today.

“In the medical world, I would say the CT technology that has had ginormous impact. When it was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield invented back in 1967, it opened a lot of doors and possibilities for all kinds of treatments not just cancer,” Jain says.

His future is set. He would like to continue to work on his research. His latest project today involves working on whether they can improve on the treatment of the cancer — to solve the gap that exits today.

CAD gets a brand new voice

Yuval Mor (54)

AI Technologist and Disruptor

What if someone were to tell you that your voice is enough to detect several diseases including coronary artery diseases (CAD)? Most people would not believe it or would term it as fake news. However, the truth is that Beyond Verbal is doing just this.

Yuval Mor, CEO of Beyond Verbal, tells you that what his company uses the tone of voice of the people in order to be able to identify different health conditions. “It comes under what we call vocal biomarket – the area of voice to detect various diseases,” Mor says.

The journey began with the analysis of emotions from the voice. “We all know that we can understand what people are feeling just by listening to them. As part of this analysis, our scientists did an experiment. He found that group of people he was evaluating had reading dyslexia. Because of this, their analysis of their emotions was incorrect. The scientist came up with an idea that maybe there is something in the voice of the people that gives their health condition. This led to our research in many different areas like mental health, heart conditions, lung and breathing conditions and many more,” Mor explains.

The good part is that order to get the voice, there is no need for any complicated device to record the voice. All one needs to do is record the voice on your smartphone. Yes, you read that right. One can record the voice on any regular mobile that allows voice recording and one is good to go. All one has to do is record your voice; there are not set words needed, nor does one have to speak in a particular tone or pitch. All one has to do is record the voice – like the tone one uses while talking to another person over the phone.

“After the call is recorded, one can send it is a central control analysis where experts use machine learning and AI in order to find specific indications in the voice that could indicate health conditions,” Mor explains.

“Since we are speaking over the mobile all the time, we can see a pattern when there are deviations. We use regular voice recorded over a regular mobile. The success rate when it comes to detection of coronary artery disease using a single voice analysis stands at 86-87 per cent level of accuracy. The idea is not to scare people to rush to the hospital, it is a tool to let them know that there is something wrong and that needs to be addressed in the near future. And to also increase the person’s awareness level when the information is sent to their doctor who can then decide to go for further testing; the tool is not for emergency care; it is a monitoring device,” Mor tells you.

The advantage, he tells you are amazing. Just imagine, we are using the voice all the time and mobiles. This way one’s mobile or smart home device can be a personal bodyguard when it comes to health. The device that has been collecting voice recording over time gives information if there is signification deviation in the voice. All this is becoming part of tele-medicine or remote healthcare. The idea is that one doesn’t really have to go physically to a hospital but a lot interaction can happen remotely using sensory, in this case voice sensory,

Mor tells you that the future will be about using all kind of devices that people will have in their homes or at their disposal. Some of these will be connected to the smartphones like we are already seeing in terms of wearables that are available in the market today to check our BO and even heart rate. “Some devices would be more dedicated and connect to a software that would e running of the mobile to collect the vitals but using the voice to say monitor oxygen saturations. It is no longer the future, the future is here, we are living it and using it when we buy a smart watch,” Mor says.

Back to Nature innovations by a reluctant Master of science

Oded Shoseyov (63)

Nano biotechnologist

He was born to a family in the vineyard business for more than 130 years. Twenty years back, he established the Estate Boutique winery near Jerusalem in one of the oldest grape growing regions in the world from the time of King Solomon. In High School, he was a terrible student. Nevertheless, his parents always told him that he had potential and so he never gave up.

“After three-and-a-half years of service in the Israel Defence Force, I decided that I would like to go to university and study Agriculture so that I could go back to the vineyard and help my father. I had to struggle a lot to get accepted to the university because I had very low grades from High School. My application to the Faculty of Agriculture of Hebrew University was rejected. Thanks to the intuition of the Dean of Chemistry Professor Lena Ben-Dor, I was accepted on condition to do an undergraduate course in Chemistry at The Hebrew University where I really shined. I met Professor Ben Ami Bravdo who invited me to join his laboratory. The day I entered his lab, I knew that this is my destiny,” Oded Shoseyov tells you.

His research in plant molecular biology, protein engineering and nano biotechnology is creating super-performing materials that could change the way we build our future products.

Over the years, Oded has established 14 companies and asking him to talk about a particular one doesn’t come easy. “You are asking me to pick my favourite child. But I will do my best. CollPlant is a company that produces human collagen from tobacco plants. Collagen is a special protein that builds up tissues and organs in our body. Medical implants like bone substitutes and heart valve leaflets are made of collagen extracted from pigs, cows and human cadavers which are not safe because they harbour viruses. At the Hebrew University, my laboratory cloned all the five genes from humans that are responsible for making collagen in our body, and by genetic engineering introduced all the five human genes into a tobacco plant,” Oded explains.

He says that tobacco plants produce human collagen through their leaves. “We grow the tobacco plants in greenhouses, harvest the leaves, extract and purify the human collagen. This collagen is safer because plants do not harbour human pathogens. From this, we make different medical implants for wound healing and tendon repair that are already used in clinics in Europe and Israel.

“Our latest achievement and source of pride is the new version of collagen that can be 3D-printed. We are now engaged with United Therapeutics, a US Pharma company and 3D Systems, a US 3D printing company in an ambitious project to print for the first time a fully functional living human lung. This is only the first in printing of future organs,” Oded tells you.

Another company is Biobetter Ltd whose mission is to make biologic drugs affordable. He tells you that antibodies are large and complex proteins which are central in our immune system.

“They help our body to overcome infection and cancer. In the last decade, biologic drugs and specifically humanised antibodies became extremely effective drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis, cancer and more. One major problem remain. Biologic drugs are produced by mammalian cell culture which is very expensive.

“We cloned the genes of Adalimumab (drug for rheumatoid Arthritis) and by genetic engineering introduced it into tobacco plant. We introduced several more genes into the plant to modify the sugar content of the Adalimumab to make it more human. We can produce the biologic drug in a greenhouse at a cost of lettuce. Our goal is to make it affordable — bring down the cost to less than $1 a day as opposed to $100 a day at present,” he adds.

His breakthrough was finding genes that are at the heart of a mechanism in plants that accelerates its growth. This discovery was later translated to transgenic eucalyptus trees that grow faster in the forest and enable production of timber and pulp for paper in a significantly shorter period of time.

According to him, over billions of years of evolution, Nature made amazing materials and systems. “I will mention only a few: Resilin which enables cat flees to jump 100-200 times their height and the amazing computational powers of our brain. Overabundance of these super performers around us are encoded by their DNA,” says Oded who is in India as a TEDxGateway speaker.

When he is not busy in his laboratory, he and his children are busy skiing and looking for new resorts to explore all over the world. He also enjoys mountain biking, running and music.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-intelligence-is-artificial-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/when-intelligence-is-artificial.html
91,23-2-20,‘I avoid doing intimate scenes’,"Harsh Vardhan Rane Having done all kinds of jobs for about 15 years before stepping into B-town, Rane is proud to have gone through that phase which made him what he is today. He speaks with Musba Hashmi about his debut, fondest memory and upcoming projects

Your father is a doctor, how did you end up becoming an actor?

It’s a long story. I had run away from home when I was 16. I came to Delhi in 2001 and did a lot of odd jobs to earn a living. I worked at an STD booth. I worked as a logsheet maintainer in a cyber cafe where I was paid `10 a day. Then I joined another cyber cafe where I was paid double the money. I also worked as a delivery boy. I have done all kinds of jobs but the one thing I had in mind was to become an actor. Back then, I didn’t know that this could be a profession because not many people would choose this line. In my subconscious I knew that this is what I wanted to do. Gradually, I carved a path in the South industry and finally became an actor.

What lesson did you learn during your struggle days?

I don’t see it as a struggle; it was rather fun for me. In order to reach somewhere you have to carve a path and all these jobs served that purpose. There were many lessons that I learnt during the period. In fact, I learnt some of the best ones. Discipline is one of them. Second, value of relationships. Third, honesty. If you are not honest with yourself and your job, you can’t reach the heights you want.

You made your Bollywood debut with Sanam Teri Kasam. How did you come on board for that?

My debut movie was Satra Ko Shaadi Hai produced by John Abraham. But it never got released. For Sanam Teri Kasam, there’s a different story. It was in 2015 when I was shooting for a couple of Telugu films and got a call for the film. I asked them if they could wait as I was shooting. It took me two-three months to complete the pending shoots and then I went to Mumbai. I reached the team’s office and was told that I was too late. They had already cast someone else and he was preparing to begin the shoot. I tried convincing Radhika Rao ma’am and Vinay Sapru sir ( writer-director) to cast me as I was in love with the script and the role. I was able to relate to Inder Lal Parihar a lot. After a lot of efforts, they asked me to perform a scene and I did. They asked me to do it once more. I did and they were in tears. They loved the conviction with which I played Inder. That’s how I got the role.

What is the difference between South and the Hindi film industry?

The South film industry has taught me a lot of discipline and also how to make your producer comfortable. A person who is investing money should feel comfortable. For Bollywood, undoubtedly it is every actor’s dream. It has a wider reach.

Is there a role that you would like to experiment with?

I want to play a warrior. Whenever I see such movies, there is a certain energy that I feel. I believe that I have some connection with a warrior. May be I was a warrior in my past life. (laughs)

What things are outside your comfort zone?

Doing intimate scenes. I try to avoid such scenes but if the script demands it then I don’t have a choice. But yes, I want to avoid it as much as possible because by all means I want to guard my co-actor. It is my responsibility to not do anything that would harm women co-actors in any way.

hat has been your fondest memory?

When my first film got released — both in Hindi and Telugu and I saw myself on the big screen; it is a moment I can never forget. I remember when I walked into the theatre, I didn’t get a seat. I was just standing in the corner and seeing such huge version of me on the 70 mm screen.

What are your upcoming projects?

I have my hands full. Haseen Dilruba and Taish will be releasing this year. Both of them are amazing movies. For Taish, I have done more homework than what I did for Sanam Teri Kasam. It’s a revenge-drama and people will see me in a different avatar.

Can you share a few memories from your life?

When I was struggling, I was very fond of river rafting. Back in 2011, all my friends made a plan to go to Rishikesh. I had no money back then. One of my friend knew a resort owner who was about to get married. I requested my friend to ask him if I could be the photographer and that he had to let me stay at his resort for three days — all free. He agreed. And now after so many years, I am playing a river rafter in Haseen Dilruba. Life definitely makes you take a full circle.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-avoid-doing-intimate-scenes----2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-avoid-doing-intimate-scenes---.html
92,23-2-20,Those wheels of yore,"The 9th edition of 21 Gun Salute International Vintage Car Rally and Concours d'Elegance was flagged off from India Gate last week. SHALINI SAKSENA tells you what makes this 4000 km royal expedition special

In 2011 when the first edition of the 21 Gun Salute Heritage Cultural Trust in association with the Ministry of Tourism was flagged off, nobody would have though that nine years down the line it would only grow from strength to strength and attract international participation, be covered by 20 international magazines and would bring 100s of rarest of rare vintage cars on to its platform. the ninth edition, was more than just display of rich automotive heritage that paid tribute to the golden era of the automotive industry; it was also about celebrating the country’s rich heritage. The 21 Gun Salute International Vintage Car Rally & Concours d'Elegance has grown to become one of the most anticipated and talked-about automobile events of Asia.

This salute to the spirit of motoring will showcase rare vintage cars in the world like the 1938 Rolls-Royce 25/30, Maserati 3500GT Vignale Syder, 1939 Buick Roadmaster Convertible, 1959 Jaguar XK 150 S, 1951 Bentley MK VI Freestone and 1959 Alfa 2000 to name just a few. The rally will cover 17 cities, 4000 km in 23 days that will be a tribute to the motoring and historic Indian culture. The rally, after 17check-in stops, will end in the City of Lakes — Udaipur — on March 10, 2020 with the the participants enjoying the Festival of Colours — Holi.

Madan Mohan, chairman and managing trustee of 21 Gun Salute Heritage & Cultural Trust tells you that India’s culture and heritage motoring are the two strong pillars of the competition. “Both aspects highlight that the show is of special importance and attract both participants and visitors. For the past eight years, the event has grown in all aspects to become a magnificent show that attracts tourists and motoring buffs from around the world,” Mohan says.

He tells you that the idea is the rally is not to just show the rarest of rare vintage cars that compete but it is a step in generating interest in global tourists to experience the grandeur of India. “Along with international participation from 15 motoring enthusiasts from around the globe, the rally will be a biennial effort to promote India as a global motoring tourism destination on a global platform. It will also bring enormous tourist footprint to our country,” Mohan tells you who got the support of the Ministry of Tourism for the rally back in 2014.

The motoring enthusiasts along with their masterpieces will travel to unique destinations — which changes each year — stay at palaces of erstwhile maharajas, dine with royal families and visit the forts to build build lifelong bonds. And then there is the fact that while the entries this year is over a 100, each vintage car that will be on the road have never been showcased in the show before.

“The idea is to show people cars from different era and how the speed and cylinders changed over time. There are cars with a speed of 40 km an hour. Given that those were still times of horse-drawn carriages, this speed back in the early 1930s would have been phenomenal,” he says.

In order to judge these cars, there is a gathering of an international jury panel comprising 37 motoring experts and renowned classic car experts, Fédération International des Véhicules Anciens (FIVA) officials, restoration experts, FIVA scrutineers, F-1 racers and other celebrated individuals from all over the world. The handpicked cars are given points on the basis of authenticity of cars, their style, design, rarity, the stitch on the upholstery, how authentic the colour is, how authentic the upholstery is and the entire car has been upgraded.

Mohan, who has 328 vintage cars, 43 jeeps and 106 bikes along with clocks, typewriters, and other antiques, has been a collector since he purchased his first-ever vintage car Dodge Victory 6, 1928, back in 2000, that was previously owned by Raja Saheb of Khetri.

“All these antiques have been painstakingly restored to their original glory. I scouts palaces and garages to look for abandoned vintage cars, buys them and then spends years in upgrading them. It is time consuming and an expensive hobby. One has to look for original parts or order them from the companies that are in the business of making these parts. Then comes the cost ofshipment. it is very rare that one will find a part here in India. It has to be imported.

“At each and every stage, there is a cost not to forget that the first six-eight months are spent in doing research on the car; its history and what made it special. Once that is done, the work on the car itself starts. Sometimes it takes months before we get a part or a specific upholstery. A lot of patience is required when you work on doing up a vintage car. But the satisfaction that comes from looking at the end result is worth all the hassle,” Mohan says.

Interestingly, Mohan is the face of the show and looks after the front management and it is his brother who spends hours toiling and restoring the cars. “My brother went for a course in vehicle restoration in the US when he was 46. He likes to stay in the background. While I do the marketing and am the face of the what we do,” Mohan says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/those-wheels-of-yore-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/those-wheels-of-yore.html
93,23-2-20,‘Indian music has an awe factor',"SHILPA RAO recently released a single in collaboration with six-time Grammy Award nominated sitarist- composer-producer Anoushka Shankar and Ayanna Witter, a British singer-composer and cellist. She speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about her journey and cross-culture collaboration

How did the collaboration happen?

Anoushka (Shankar) and I had met many years back and then we met again recently when I was in London for a holiday. We had talked about our music and things related to it. We also talked about a collaboration. Then we came together in Mumbai on a music that she had composed. It was such simple and minimalistic that I wanted to be a part of and couldn’t refuse.

What is the song about?

The song, Those Words, is about a journey of a woman who is all by herself now. She is out a relationship now. In the song she talks about the times when she was in one and the moments she lived in that relationship. It is a not a sad or a depressing song. More of a song that is based on internal thoughts. Something that we all do when we sitting by ourselves.

Was there a reason why you chose this theme?

When I heard the song, there weren’t any lyrics to it. But the music was so beautiful and moving and we wanted to do something on those lines. We discussed and we wanted to do a song that internalised feelings. Shirin then wrote the lyrics. And the whole thing fit perfectly and the song is so beautiful.

How much fun did the three of you have doing this collaboration?

The whole thing started on a simple note — a thought — which was very simple. The whole process was not complicated. It was just that she had a thought and shared it with me and I shared it with Shirin. The best part is that all this happened face-to-face and not over the mail. It was the first time that I was recording in London at the Guildhall School; it is one of the top schools for music in in the world. It was my first international collaboration. We spent an entire day together to make this song. It was little things that mattered while we made this song. It was not about what the song became later on but the whole journey that made it possible.

How important is it to have more such collaborations to experience global music?

Indian music has always had a certain awe factor for those who live abroad. It is not a new concept for people outside of India to listen to our music. Indian music is one of the most progressive music’s in the world; it has been It has been there for centuries. The best of this song is — Ayanna didn’t know anything about the words, Shirin had written them; we came from different backgrounds, we learnt a lot about each other since human emotions are the same. This is what you learn from such collaborations.

Where is Bollywood music heading?

Music keeps changing every month. When people ask me where I will be a year down the line, it is difficult to answer it. I live in the moment and committed to it. I love the unpredictability that is associated with the music and the business. It makes you want to learn more and keep evolving.

How did your musical journey begin?

It was an everyday life for us while I was growing up because of my father. We were surrounded with music. I didn’t always want to be a musician as a child. I learnt and listen to music because I loved it; it was till I was older that I wanted to sing. My musical journey was simple.

What is waiting for you?

There are a few Bollywood projects and a couple of more single releases coming up in the near future.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---indian-music-has-an-awe-factor--2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---indian-music-has-an-awe-factor-.html
94,23-2-20,Music for the soul,"Swaraag, the Sufi rock fusion band from Jaipur, was in the Capital recently for a show. SHALINI SAKSENA speaks with the founder on what makes them sought after and how they were part of the reality show Rising Star 3

They began their journey in 2014 and in the next six years, the band has over 1,000 performances to its credit. The band was formed with an idea to work with instruments and introduce that to the people. When they began to work on the music, they realised that in order to take it to a much larger audience they had to add a vocalist. And that is how sufi-rock fusion band — Swaraag was born.

“Our journey began back in 2014. Arif Khan, a freelancer and I decided to work on instrumental music. But after six months we realised that we needed a vocalist. We approached Khan’s younger brother Asif. He is the lead vocalist with the band. His forte lies in sufi music. In fact, each person in the band has a musical background, they are from the Sikar Gharana. We are from Rajasthan. So, people would demand that we play music from the region. Unfortunately, Rajasthani music is not much in demand in the State and hence we had not incorporated that in our band. We found that there was a market for it but not good content. We worked on this and introduced four things into our band — sufi, Rajasthani, instrumental and Bollywood music. This became our USP,” Pratap Singh, the co-founder and manager of the band explains.

But after being in the market for six years, they realised that they needed to add fusion in order to connect Indian classical and the youth. The fusion was done in a manner that it doesn’t sound odd. “We ensure that our fusion is such that it acts like salt in a dish. We don’t want to sound totally western. We have saxophone, drum and acoustic guitar. We don’t use digital instrument. This way the audience can enjoy the music of the instruments,” Singh shares. He says that the name of the band is derived from the Sanskrit word — swar and raag we all know — the music. The idea was to let people know that they are there to promote music.

He tells you that the reason why Rajasthan music is not famous even though it is a popular tourist place because the State is seen as land of royals. But when it comes to entertainment industry, people see only two-three things — food, palaces and royals. “Ask them if they would want to make a Rajasthani film and they want to know who will watch it. Another problem is that the dialect in the region changes every 100 km,” Singh opines.

The band was also part of Rising Star 3. While reality shows are good, it is not always the right place to showcase one’s talent. “It is not always correct. When I was there, I saw young people, who were there to showcase their talent but are nowhere today. One has to ask where they are today. Even if one wins a show, there are no guarantees that they will shine. One needs a combination of talent, marketing strategy and luck. While reality shows give you the much-needed jump, there is need to market it well. Talent alone will not take you far,” Singh says. However, he is quick to point out that for an artist, it is a big thing to be viewed on TV. Reality shows give you a face, a recognition.

Interestingly, he tells you that their music is not always appreciated. There have been two instances where they were caught on the wrong foot. One was when the band had to perform in Haryana. The people were looking to dance, our music is not on those lines. “The second was while we were performing in Vishakhapatnam. We wondered where we had landed. Finally, we played Amitabh Bachchan song. Three people came in front to dance. After 45 minutes we understood what they were looking for. The good is that we have people in our band with multiple talent,” he tells you.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/music-for-the-soul-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/music-for-the-soul.html

Thackeray had also called on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi where the controversial CAA was discussed.

“CM Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray requires a briefing on CAA — 2003 to understand how NPR is basis of NRC. Once you do NPR, you cannot stop NRC. On Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he needs to be reacquainted with design of Indian Constitution that religion cannot be basis of Citizenship,” he said.

Thackeray’s stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR) has become a bone of contention among the allies in Maharashtra, as the Congress and the NCP are opposed to the measures.

Tewari’s remarks came a day after Thackeray met Modi and said that nobody should feel threatened by the CAA or NPR as these measures are not meant to drive away anyone from the country.

Thackeray made the remarks at a Press conference held after his meeting with Prime Minister on Friday, the first after he took over as the Chief Minister. “We discussed CAA and NPR,” Thackeray said, adding he has come to understand the role of the Centre in the NRC.

Accompanied by his son and a Minister in his Cabinet, Uddhav met Sonia and held discussions on the current political situation and CAA-NPR-NRC. This was the first meeting of Thackeray with Sonia Gandhi after the formation of the coalition government in Maharashtra. AICC general secretary in-charge of Maharashtra Mallikarjun Kharge and Shiv Sena leaders Aaditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut were also present during the meeting.

104,23-2-20,Indians hailed critical verdicts despite apprehensions: PM,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said 1.3 billion Indians have disregarded apprehensions and “wholeheartedly” accepted recent critical judicial verdicts which were subjects of global discussion.

Speaking at the inaugural function of the International Judicial Conference 2020 – ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’ at the Supreme Court, Modi spoke about recent crucial judgements, in an apparent reference to path-breaking verdicts including in the politically-sensitive Ayodhya case.

The Prime Minister said no country or society in the world can claim to achieve holistic development without gender justice and referred to laws on transgenders, ‘triple talaq’ and on the rights of ‘Divyang’ (persons with disabilities). He said the government has also taken steps to give rights to women in military service and in providing paid maternity leave for 26 weeks. He also hailed the Indian judiciary for redefining environmental jurisprudence to strike a balance between development and ecological protection.

Modi, while emphasising on the use of technology and the internet, said it would help in procedural management of courts and would benefit the justice delivery system to a large extent.

He also referred to synchronisation of artificial intelligence with human wisdom and said it would bring “speed to delivery of justice”.

“In addition, in the changing times, issues like data protection, cyber crimes pose new challenges for the judiciary,” he said in his inaugural address.

“In recent times, there have been some critical judicial judgements and decisions which have been the subject of global discussion. Before these judgements were delivered, several apprehensions were being expressed about the consequences. But look what happened! 1.3 billion Indians wholeheartedly accepted the judicial verdicts,” Modi said.

He said it is going to be a decade of remarkable changes across the world which will impact all frontiers, be it society, economy, or technology, and these changes need to be rational as well as just and fair. Talking about the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister said, “Gandhiji’s life was dedicated to the cause of truth and service, which are the foundational tenets for any system of justice and as you all know, he was himself a barrister and belonged to the fraternity of lawyers”.

Hailing a vibrant judiciary, legislature and executive, the PM said, “Respecting each other’s jurisdiction and dignity, these three pillars of the Constitution have resolved various challenges faced by the country on several occasions.

“We are proud of having developed such a rich tradition in India. In the last five years, various institutions of India have further strengthened this tradition”.

He also referred to the Centre’s endeavour in repealing 1,500 archaic laws and said, “Speed has been demonstrated not only in doing away with irrelevant laws but also in enacting new legislations aimed at strengthening the social fabric”.

The Indian Constitution guarantees gender justice under the provisions of the right to equality, Modi said, adding that India is “among few nations which has ensured the right to vote for women since independence”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/indians-hailed-critical-verdicts-despite-apprehensions--pm.html
105,23-2-20,ASCI upheld complaints against 248 ads out of 408,"Several advertisements featuring celebrities like cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Bollywood star Ajay Devgan, actress Shilpa Shetty have been found to making misleading and false claims.

Bollywood star Ajay Devgn’s ad for Dabur Babool Ayurvedic Paste and Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) campaign for Rexona Whitening were among the marketing efforts found as “misleading”. Similarly, cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s ad for Orient Electric found misleading by Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI).

According to ASCI, the Dabur campaign on television and Youtube had a message in Hindi which alleges that ordinary white toothpastes are cheating consumers and the cheating will stop by using its toothpaste. “The advertisement featuring celebrity Ajay Devgan was considered misleading. The advertisement also denigrated the entire category of “calcium containing white” toothpastes while implying superiority of their ayurvedic toothpaste,” it said.

In the case of HUL, an ad for Rexona Whitening Roll-On in Bengali claimed the product can help get rid of dark underarms in five days was “ inadequately substantiated and misleading”, the ASCI statement said. Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare campaign for ‘Moov Advance Diclofenac Gel’ with claims of being ‘#1 Doctor recommended active for acute pain relief’ was also considered misleading, it said.

Orient Electric’s advertisement having legendary cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni was found to be “misleading by implication”. “It was observed that while the advertisement claims to have ‘flicker control technology’, it visually depicts ‘no flicker’ or absence of any flicker,” ASCI said on Orient ad. The advertisement’s claim “Livfast Inverter and batteries have 25% faster charging and provides 25% extra backup” featuring cricketer Dhoni was also inadequately substantiated.

Taking a strong note of misleading advertisements on Television, Print, Youtube and other social media plateforms, the ASCI has probed complaints against 408 and upheld complaints against 248 while 137 were promptly withdrawn by the advertisers.

A television ad shows a policeman riding the Platina with a barber riding pillion and shaving the policeman. The entire act was put up to showcase the ride comfort of the vehicle with the narrative of a ‘Makhkhan Jaisi Ride’ concept. “It was observed that the protagonist - a policeman in uniform who himself should be abiding by traffic rules, shown performing such stunts was inappropriate. The TVC shows dangerous practices, stunts in normal traffic conditions which manifests a disregard for safety,” it said.

A complaint against a drama serial promo indicating the protagonist doing self-harm by stifling her neck with a cloth (duppata) was also upheld. “The drama serial’s promo contains a specific visual of the female protagonist stifling her neck with a cloth (duppata) and then turning her body in upside down position. Such visuals shows a dangerous act (indicative of self-harm) with a disregard for safety and it is likely to encourage minors to emulate such an act which could cause harm or injury,” ASCI added. VLCC Health Care’s print and television ad claim ‘Add figure to your shape in just one session’ was not substantiated with treatment efficacy data, it said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/asci-upheld-complaints-against-248-ads-out-of-408.html

""There is no Shaheen Bagh like incident in Hyderabad. Do not compare Hyderabad with places where all these negative things are happening.

Nothing like Shaheen Bagh will be allowed in Hyderabad. Impossible,"" Anjani Kumar told reporters.

The Hyderabad Police will take legal action if common public is put to inconvenience, he reiterated.

Political protests are important butlaw and order is more important, Kumar said, adding, Hyderabad city has seen more than 200 protests/rallies (anti-Citizenship Amendment Act and also pro-CAA).

During such protests at other places in the country, there have been burning of vehicles, firing, people sitting for a month on dharna, but in Hyderabad such things are not happening, he said.

It is only because Hyderabad Police are concerned about safety, security and comfort of common public, he said.

""...At every place if you want to sit on dharna then it will cause inconvenience to common public and hence we have taken legal action and booked cases pertaining to some places where the protests were held,"" he said.

""If there is denial (for permission for holding protests) there are reasons. Some vested interests have approached courts and the court has given guidelines and court guidelines are supreme.

Whatever conditions we are putting it is as per judgment of the High Court,"" the police chief said.

107,23-2-20,Uddhav to visit Ayodhya on March 7,"In an apparent effort to reiterate that there is no erosion in his party’s Hindutva credentials even after forming a Government with “secular” Congress and NCP, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ayodhya on March 7 to mark the completion of 100 days of the Maha Vikas Aghadi Government led by him.

In an announcement made a day after the Chief Minister met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, veteran BJP leader LK Advani and Interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi, Shiv Sena’s spokesperson and MP Sanjay Nirupam said that Uddhav would visit Ayodhya along with a large number of Shiv Sainiks to have darshan of Lord Rama there.

“On March 7, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ayodhya on March 7 along with innumerable Shiv Sainiks. He will have darshan of Lord Shriram in the afternoon. He will perform Aarati on the ghats of Sarayu river. Please be part of the historic occasion,” Raut tweeted.

Uddhav, who had announced after the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayoidhya dispute case that he would go once again Ayodhya on November 24, 2019, had postponed his visit then, owing to the impasse in the government formation in the state. The public perception was that the Sena would soft-peddle its Hindutva agenda as long as it is running the government in the state with the Congress and NCP.

It may be recalled that Uddhav had on November 25, 2018 – along with his wife Rashmi and son Aditya, had visited Ayodhya. On June 16, 2019 year after the Lok Sabha polls, he once again visited Ayodhya and offered prayers at the makeshift Ram Lalla shrine.

However, atmosphere has changed after he joined hands with the “secular” and NCP to form a Maha Vikas Agadhi government in Maharashtra. The perception that has been gaining ground in the state political circles that in order to ensure that there is no threat to its government in the state the ruling Shiv Sena is not pursuing the Hindutva as vigorously as it was doing earlier. So much so that its erstwhile ally BJP has been taking pot shots at the Shiv Sena for giving up on its Hindutva agenda for the sake of power. It is in the backdrop that Uddhav has scheduled his visit to Ayodhya on the occasion of his government completing 100 days in office.

Significantly enough, Uddhav’s visit to Ayodhya comes at a time when there is absolutely no consensus between the Shiv Sena and its ruling allies – Congress and NCP over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While the Congress and NCP have opposed CAA and NPR, Uddhav has gone and announced his full support for the CAA and extended his “in-principle” support to NPR. In the process, Uddhav has rubbed the NCP and Congress the wrong way. However, there does not seem to any threat to the MVA government in the state.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uddhav-to-visit-ayodhya-on-march-7.html

Addressing a news conference with his party’s MLA Sayed Imtiyaz Jaleel, Pathan said, “I would like to make once again clear that I have not said any such thing that wrong inferences could be drawn on my statement and I have been targeted for the same. I see a political conspiracy in this to defame me and my party.

“Despite all this if any of my words have hurt anyone, I am withdrawing my words only because I am a true citizen of this country and I feel proud to call myself an Indian,” Pathan said.

“Like I have said before I take pride in my country. I am a true Indian Muslim No can challenge or raise questions about my love and respect towards this great nation and the people who live here whether they are Hindus, Dalits, Sikhs, Parsis or any one. I have never criticised any religion at any point of time. I respect and will continue to respect all religions. I also respect the practisioners of these religions, “ Pathan said.

Pathan, who has come in severe criticisms from all quarters for his controversial “15 crore hain hum lekin 100 crore pe bhari hain"" statement, clarified: “An impression is being created in the media that I am anti-national and thatI am against Hindus. The statement I made that 15 crore will be too much for 100. It does not mean that I have made this statement against Hindus in the country”

“What I meant was 15 crore Musilms are unhappy over CAA so are people from religions and castes who have faith in the Constitution. Like Jhansi Rani, our women are out on the streets protesting against CAA. But, there are some 100 people who are clearly against 15 crore Muslims in the country. They may be RSS, BJP, Bhajrang Dal or from other parties and organisations. I had made my statement in this context that we 15 crore will be heavy on these 100people,

“These 100 who want to divide this country by bringing this law. There are also journalists among 100 people who claim themselves as most patriotic persons – participating in prime time debates in the night, twist and turn a single statement of mine to suit their agenda.

The IEO will be conducted on the BitLux OTC crypto exchange and few other exchanges in the month of October, 2020 or earlier as per the people closer to the transaction.

LIC's IPO is slated for the launch in the second quarter of 2021. The Indian Government, through its disinvestment initiatives, will attempt to raise US $30 bn by diluting upto 10% of its holding.

Post listing of the equity shares, the LIC will become the India's largest listed company overthrowing Reliance Industries Limited.

The blockchain tokenisation is a process of digitising the real world assets like equity shares, land and building and then issuing them over the blockchain in the form of small digitised / fractionalised tokens or shares for an enhanced liquidity and a wider reach.

Overall, in the process of tokenisation, the blockchain based tokens are made to represent the price movement of the underlying asset and those are traded by the investors without the need of being in the direct possession of the assets, much like as a mutual fund where a investor purchases fund units instead of directly purchasing and managing the portfolio of shares.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/egw-capital-to-tokenise-equity-shares-of-lic.html

The I-T department issued advertisements in leading dailies saying the scheme was a “golden opportunity... To settle income tax disputes”, bridge the trust deficit in cases of disputes and minimise tax-related litigation.

The public message spells out the main features of the scheme proposed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech on February 1, like the eligibility, disputes covered and payment terms. Under the eligibility head, the department said appeals and writs filed on or before January 31 this year will be allowed to be taken up under the scheme.

Other eligibilities are: Orders for which time for filing appeal has not expired on January 31; cases pending before dispute resolution panel (DRP) or where the DRP issued direction on or before January 31, 2020 but no order has been passed; cases where assessee filed revision and in raid cases where disputed tax is less than Rs 5 crore in a year.

Ambassador Brendan Ward also said that there has been a surge in interest by companies from India for setting up a base in Ireland, where, as of now, 100 Indian firms have a presence, even as the bilateral trade between the two countries stood around Euro 4 billion annually.

“Ireland is a committed member of the EU and we work through the partnership which exists between the EU and India, while at the same time we have our own strategic approach. Sometimes India is a little overshadowed by China and Japan and part of my work here and my team here in India is to raise awareness of India in Ireland and particularly among Irish business people and investors. At the same time, Ireland is rather little known in India and an important role for us is raising that awareness,” Ward told PTI.

“One major factor that we have to deal with is that the United Kingdom has exited EU and for many Indian businesses thinking of a location for presence in Europe, the UK would have been the first choice. Now, a lot of them are looking at Ireland,” he said, on sidelines of an education fair where Ireland promoted itself as a destination for higher studies for Indian students.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ireland-an-alternative-to-uk-for-indian-firms-eyeing-eu-base-post-brexit--irish-envoy.html

115,23-2-20,"India needs pro-business, not pro-crony policies: CEA","India has some distance to go in fully shifting from pro-crony to pro-business policies, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Saturday.

It will be the pro-business policies that will enable the “invisible hands of the market” and also take the country to the goal of USD 5 trillion GDP, he added.

“Pro-business policies are those that enable fair competition in the country. We have some distance to go in terms of enabling that fully. Pro-crony policies on the other hand just help incumbents and that is something that we have to stay away from in enabling the invisible hands of the market,” he said at an alumni conference of his alma mater IIT-Kanpur here.

Indian policymaking has been criticised for favouring crony capitalists in the initial decades after Independence, till the country shifted gears by adopting liberalisation in 1991.

Subramanian said after the CAG’s report on telecom spectrum allocations came out in 2011, investor returns from “connected companies”, a euphemism for crony firms, have been very low as compared to the broader indices.

The problem with cronyism is that it is not better business models and processes which drive the growth, he said, adding that we should always aim for “creative destruction” where the incumbents are challenged.

In a critique of the dominant policy choices in the initial decades after Independence, Subramanian said “the tryst with socialism did not deliver the tryst with destiny”, referring to first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous speech when India attained freedom.

He also made a strong case for not depending only on recent work in economics to make policy choices and neglecting age-old texts like the Arthashastra.

“Scholarly work isn’t something that was written in the last 100 years but dates back millennia,” he said.

The Arthashastra stresses on ethical ways of creating wealth, he said, adding that we need to focus on creating trust in the markets as well.

If governance standards have to be increased in the country, there has to be a greater focus on disclosing related-party transactions, the CEA said. The comments come in the wake of frauds like the one at non-bank lender DHFL.

The Union Budget’s thrust on ‘Assemble in India’ should not be seen as substitute to the government’s flagship ‘Make in India’ programme, but as a complementary aspect which will act as a precursor to other goals, he said.

On the focus on ‘Assemble in India’, Subramanian cited the case of Suzuki’s entry into the country in 1980s and the developments in the auto sector since then to illustrate that simple assembly of parts to make a car is a precursor to manufacturing and also intellectual property creation.

Pointing out to the recently released Economic Survey, he said over four crore well-paying jobs can be created in the country by 2025 by focusing on assembling for the world, and the same can go up to eight crore by 2030.

Asked about the Budget’s thrust on imposing tariffs on certain sectors and how it has been criticised as being protectionist by some, Subramanian said we need to make a distinction between duties that are imposed on finished products against those on raw materials or intermediate goods which hurt exports.

“We need to move towards far more open trade policies on intermediate goods and raw materials to enable exports,” he told reporters.

To a question on external member of the Monetary Policy Committee Chetan Ghate’s pitch for more structural reforms, Subramanian said all measures like rate cuts and reforms work with a lag and we should allow time for their benefits to accrue.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-needs-pro-business--not-pro-crony-policies--cea.html

The agriculture ministry shared the progress made under the scheme, ahead of its first anniversary on February 24. The PM-KISAN was formally launched on February 24 last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Under the scheme, the Centre transfers an amount of Rs6,000 per year, in three equal instalments, directly into the bank accounts of the farmers, subject to certain exclusion criteria relating to higher income status.

“February 24, 2020 is the 1st anniversary of starting of a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN),” an official statement said.

The scheme was launched to provide income support to all landholding farmers’ families across the country and enable them to meet expenses related to agriculture as well as domestic needs, it added.

“The Central Government has already released more than Rs50,850 crores till now,” the ministry said.

Total number of beneficiaries covered under the scheme is about 14 crore, based on estimates of the Agriculture Census 2015-16.

As on February 20 this year, 8.46 crores farmer families have been given the benefits. The scheme is effective from December 2018. The cut-off date for identification of beneficiaries with regard to their eligibility was February 1, 2019. The entire responsibility of identification of beneficiaries rests with the state /UT governments.

The scheme initially provided income support to all small and marginal farmers’ families across the country, holding cultivable land up to 2 hectares. However, its ambit was later expanded to cover all farmer families in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings.

Affluent farmers have been excluded from the scheme such as income tax payers in last assessment year, professionals like doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants etc and pensioners pensioners drawing at least Rs10,000 per month (excluding MTS/Class IV/Group D employees).

All installments falling due on or after December 1, 2019 are being paid only on the basis of Aadhaar authenticated bank data of beneficiaries to ensure genuine beneficiaries and avoid duplicity in payments, except in Assam and Meghalaya besides the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, which are exempted from this requirement till March this year.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/centre-pays-rs50-850-cr-to-farmers-under-pm-kisan-scheme.html

The incident did not take place in the civilised world of human beings but in deep forests of Gudalur Forest Range in the Nilgiris.

Forest officials have been moved by the tragic story of a mother elephant’s attachment with its first-born calf which fell into a swamp and died despite the efforts of the elephant herd to pull it out of the dangerous area. The calf died last Sunday and since then the mother elephant and other pachyderms in the heard are standing guard to the carcass. The elephants, especially the mother elephant, do not allow anyone to go near the swamp where the carcass is lying,” said G Ramakrishnan, Range Officer, Gudalur, told The Pioneer over phone from Padanthorai.Ramakrishnan said efforts are underway to remove the herd from the spot where the carcass is lying because there are possibilities of the elephants developing infection from the carcass. “We have deputed five persons to distract the attention of the elephants and by Friday night, four of the elephants in the herd have left the spot and went back to the interior forest. Now we are trying to remove the mother elephant too from the spot. The unique bondage between the mother and the calf is because of the fact that the baby is the first child to be delivered by the young mother,” said Ramakrishnan.

He said the elephants have not attacked anyone till now.

Accompanied by national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and state BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal, Nadda met the Chief Minister at his official residence here. JD(U) is an NDA ally running a coalition government in Bihar.

The assembly polls, to be held by November, are of vital importance for the coalition led by the BJP, which has been sore after drubbings in Delhi and Jharkhand besides an unexpected setback in Maharashtra. Nadda shared pictures of his meeting with Kumar — which lasted for over 30 minutes — on his Twitter handle and hailed the chief minister’s leadership of the NDA in Bihar for having ""ensured all-round development of the state"".

Nadda earlier in the day addressed a meeting of the party’s 14-member core committee, which included Union ministers like Giriraj Singh, Nityanand Rai and Ashwini Kumar Choubey.

Besides, LIC-controlled IDBI Bank too received additional capital of Rs4,557 crore through the first supplementary demands for grants approved by Parliament in December.

Last year, the RBI removed five banks — Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Allahabad Bank and Corporation Bank — from the PCA framework in two phases after capital support from the government that resulted in improvement in their financial parameters.

The capital infusion helped these lenders meet requisite capital thresholds and reduce their net NPA levels to below 6 per cent.

Out of the 11 banks put under the PCA framework last year, Dena Bank ceased to exist as a separate entity after its merger with Bank of Baroda in April, while IDBI Bank has been acquired by LIC.

With regard to the proposed mega merger of public sector banks announced by the government, the governor said, the RBI has advised the lenders to take special measures to ensure that the normal activities do not face any disruption.

“The normal activity in terms of loan sanction in terms of recoveries and other activities are affected because of the merger process. So, and we are monitoring that, we will monitor that,” he said.

Last year in August, the government announced the consolidation of ten public sector banks (PSBs) into four mega state-owned lenders. As per the plan, United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce would merge with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB).

It was decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, while Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

In April 2019, Bank of Baroda in a first three-way merger exercise amalgamated Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself. The SBI had merged five of its associate banks - State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad and also Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself effective April 2017.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/efforts-of-banks-under-pca-frameworks-are-being-monitored--das-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/efforts-of-banks-under-pca-frameworks-are-being-monitored--das.html
126,23-2-20,Partial truce mostly holds across Afghan on first day,"A partial truce marking a potential turning point in Afghanistan’s gruelling war appeared to be holding Saturday, with only isolated attacks threatening to mar a process that drew jubilant civilians across the shattered country onto streets to celebrate.

The Taliban, US and Afghan forces have all agreed to a so-called “reduction in violence”, marking only the second lull in fighting since the US-led invasion of 2001.

“It is the first morning that I go out without the fear of being killed by a bomb or suicide bomber. I hope it continues forever,” Kabul taxi driver Habib Ullah said, while in other parts of the country people danced in the streets after the truce kicked in at midnight. However, in Balkh province in the north, Taliban fighters attacked a district headquarters near the provincial capital of Mazar-i-Sharif, killing two Afghan soldiers, a local official told AFP. There were also reports of a separate incident in central Uruzgan province.

General Scott Miller, who leads US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, did not directly address those incidents, but stressed that Western forces would continually monitor the situation. “We’ve stopped our offensive operations as part of our obligations,” Miller told reporters. In the event of any breaches of the truce, Miller said the US would communicate with the Taliban through various channels set up in Doha, where the insurgents have a political office. “As more days go on we will have a better understanding of what trends are,” Miller said.

“Very clearly this is a conditional effort, this is a trial period.” The partial truce is expected to set the conditions for Washington and the insurgents to sign a deal in Doha on February 29 that could, ultimately, pull US troops out after more than 18 years and launch war-weary Afghanistan into an uncertain future.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/partial-truce-mostly-holds-across-afghan-on-first-day.html
127,23-2-20,Iran’s hard-liners take early lead in Tehran after vote,"Iranian state TV on Saturday announced the first partial results from the country’s parliamentary elections, indicating a strong showing by hard-liners in the capital Tehran, although authorities have not released full results or the all-important turnout figure.

Voters had limited options on Friday’s ballot, as more than 7,000 potential candidates had been disqualified, most of them reformists and moderates. Among those disqualified were 90 sitting members of Iran’s 290-seat parliament who had wanted to run for re-election.

Although the final tally was still not released, a lower-than-usual turnout would signal widespread dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and the ways in which the government has handled a range of crises.

State TV, without providing the number of votes, announced the names of the leading candidates in Tehran’s 30 parliamentary seats. All were hard-liners led by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, who is expected to be the next parliament speaker.

Looming over the election was the threat of the new coronavirus. Many voters headed to the polls with face masks on, and some pharmacies ran out of masks and hand sanitizer amid the election-day rush.

So far, there have been five coronavirus deaths from among the 28 confirmed cases in Iran, including two deaths on election day. Another fatality was reported on Saturday, although the exact time was not specified.

By comparison, the 2016 parliamentary election saw 62% turnout. On Friday, election officials kept the polls open an extra five hours in an effort to boost turnout. Iran’s leadership and state media had urged people to show up and vote, with some framing it as a religious duty.

A parliament stacked with hard-liners could tilt public policy debates away from engagement with the United States.

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been high since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew the US from Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers, and imposed sanctions that have forced Iran’s economy into recession. Iranians have seen the price of basic goods skyrocket, inflation and unemployment rise and the local currency plummet.

The economic woes faced by ordinary Iranians fueled anti-government protests in November. International human rights groups say at least 300 people were killed in those protests.

A more hard-line parliament could also favor expanding the budget of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Guard’s elite Quds Force, responsible for the Islamic Republic’s campaigns abroad, was formerly led by Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani. He was killed by the U.S. Airstrike in January.

That strike led to a tense confrontation in which Iranian forces accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane after it took off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Most of those killed were Iranian.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran---s-hard-liners-take-early-lead-in-tehran-after-vote.html
128,23-2-20,"Prince Harry, Meghan agree to drop ‘royal’ from their new branding","Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have agreed to drop the use of the word “royal” from their future branding as a financially independent couple.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were in talks with the Buckingham Palace team handling their transition away from frontline royal duties, with some complications around the use of Sussex Royal as the phrase to be associated with their charitable work and other causes going forward.

“While the Duke and Duchess are focused on plans to establish a new non-profit organisation, given the specific UK Government rules surrounding use of the word ‘royal’, it has been therefore agreed that their non-profit organisation, when it is announced this spring, will not be named Sussex Royal Foundation,” a spokesperson for the couple said in a statement, issued to address the ongoing media speculation over the issue. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘Sussex Royal’ in any territory post spring 2020. Therefore, the trademark applications that were filed as protective measures, acting on advice from and following the same model for The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William and Kate Middleton), have been removed,” the spokesperson said.

The spring 2020 deadline refers to March 31, unveiled earlier this week as the formal date from when the couple will cease to formally represent Queen Elizabeth II and make their move to Canada, where they are expected to be based and travel to the UK “regularly”. Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, are currently living in a mansion on Vancouver Island in Canada with their nine-month-old son Archie. Harry remains sixth in line to British throne and will retain his military ranks of Major, Lieutenant Commander and Squadron Leader but will not use his honorary military positions or perform any official duties associated with these roles.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/prince-harry--meghan-agree-to-drop----royal----from-their-new-branding.html
129,23-2-20,South Sudan’s rival leaders form coalition Government,"South Sudan opened a new chapter in its fragile emergence from civil war Saturday as rival leaders formed a coalition Government that many observers prayed would last this time around.

A day after President Salva Kiir dissolved the previous Government, Opposition leader Riek Machar was sworn in as his deputy, an arrangement that twice collapsed in fighting during the conflict that killed nearly 400,000 people.

Kiir declared “the official end of the war, and we can now proclaim a new dawn.” Peace is “never to be shaken ever again,” the president said, adding that he had forgiven Machar and asking for Machar’s forgiveness, to applause. He called on their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups to do the same.

The world’s youngest nation slid into civil war in 2013, two years after winning a long-fought independence from Sudan, as supporters of Kiir and Machar clashed. Numerous attempts at peace failed, including a deal that saw Machar return as vice president in 2016 — only to flee the country on foot months later amid fresh gunfire.

Intense international pressure followed the most recent peace deal in 2018. Pope Francis in a dramatic gesture kissed the feet of Kiir and Machar last year to coax them into putting differences aside. Saturday’s ceremony began with a presentation to them of that photo as a reminder.

Exasperation by the United States, South Sudan’s largest aid donor, and others grew as Kiir and Machar in the past year pushed back two deadlines to take the crucial step of forming the coalition government. But with less than a week before the latest deadline Saturday, each made a key concession.

Kiir announced a “painful” decision on the politically sensitive issue of the number of states, and Machar agreed to have Kiir take responsibility for his security. On Thursday, they announced they had agreed to form a government meant to lead to elections in three years’ time — the first vote since independence.

“Finally, peace is at our doorstep,” a reporter with the U.N.-backed Radio Miraya declared from Bor in long-suffering Jonglei state. In Yambio, youth with flags were reported in the streets. “I rejoice with the South Sudanese, especially the displaced, hungry and grieving who waited so long,” the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted.

Hugs and applause followed Machar’s swearing-in. He thanked the pope and others and vowed to South Sudanese to work together “to end your suffering.” Even as citizens breathed a careful sigh of relief, aid groups, analysts and diplomats warned of major challenges ahead. In a likely sign of caution, no heads of state aside from Sudan’s leader, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, attended the swearing-in.

“While much work remains to be done, this is an important milestone in the path to peace,” the US Embassy said in a message of congratulations.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/south-sudan---s-rival-leaders-form-coalition-government.html
130,23-2-20,Twitter suspends 70 pro-Bloomberg accounts for breaking rules,"Twitter said on Friday it suspended 70 accounts for spam-like posts supporting Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, whose campaign has hired hundreds of people to promote him on social media.

“We have taken enforcement action on a group of accounts for violating our rules against platform manipulation and spam,” a spokesperson for the platform said. Some of the accounts are now banned while others can be re-authorized once the users behind them verify they are in control, Twitter said.

The Wall Street Journal revealed Wednesday that the billionaire former New York mayor has hired around 500 people in California at $2,500 a month to regularly post messages supporting him on social media and to send text messages to their friends. The technique blurs the lines between political advertisement and promotion by ordinary activists on social media networks, which are grappling with how to handle political content and prevent abuse.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/twitter-suspends-70-pro-bloomberg-accounts-for-breaking-rules.html
131,23-2-20,France begins shutting down oldest nuke plant,"French state-owned energy giant EDF on Saturday began shutting down the country’s oldest nuclear power plant after 43 years in operation.

EDF said it had disconnected one of two reactors at Fessenheim, along the Rhine near France’s eastern border with Germany and Switzerland, at 2:00 am (0100 GMT) in the first stage of the complete closure of the plant.

The second reactor is to be taken off line on June 30 but it will be several months before the two have cooled enough and the used fuel can start to be removed.

The removal of the fuel is expected to be completed by the summer of 2023 but the plant will only be fully decommissioned by 2040 at the earliest.

Shutting down Fessenheim became a key goal of anti-nuclear campaigners after the catastrophic meltdown at Fukushima in Japan in 2011.

Experts have noted that construction and safety standards at Fessenheim, brought online in 1977, fall far short of those at Fukushima, with some warning that seismic and flooding risks in the Alsace region had been underestimated.

Despite a pledge by ex-president Francois Hollande just months Fukushima to close the plant, it was not until 2018 that President Emmanuel Macron’s government gave the final green light.

“This marks a first step in France’s energy strategy to gradually re-balance nuclear and renewable electricity sources, while cutting carbon emissions by closing coal-fired plants by 2022,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said earlier this week.

France will still be left with 56 pressurised water reactors at 18 nuclear power plants — only the United States has more reactors, at 98 — generating an unmatched 70 per cent of its electricity needs.

The Government confirmed in January that it aims to shut down 12 more reactors nearing or exceeding their original 40-year age limit by 2035, when nuclear power should represent just 50 per cent of France’s energy mix.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/france-begins-shutting-down-oldest-nuke-plant.html
132,23-2-20,"Giroud, Alonso back in favour","Olivier Giroud and Marcos Alonso came in from the cold to inspire Chelsea’s 2-1 win against Tottenham as the Blues cemented their grip on fourth place in the Premier League on Saturday.

Giroud and Alonso had been reduced to fringe figures in Frank Lampard’s first season as Chelsea manager.

But Lampard restored both veterans to the team at Stamford Bridge in a gamble that paid rich dividends.

With Tammy Abraham only fit enough to make the bench, Giroud started for the first time since November and the France striker’s fine finish opened the scoring in the first half.

The 33-year-old could have joined Tottenham had Chelsea signed a forward in January, but instead he netted his first club goal since August and his first in the Premier League since April.

Alonso, 29, maintained the theme of exiles getting back in favour as the left-back struck in the second half of his first league start since Chelsea’s win at Tottenham in December.

Antonio Rudiger’s own goal came too late to ruin Chelsea’s first win in five league games, moving them four points clear of fifth placed Tottenham in the race to qualify for the Champions League.

Ending Tottenham’s three-game winning streak in the league was the perfect response to Monday’s home defeat against Manchester United.

Tottenham have now won just once in their last 34 visits to Stamford Bridge, making it a painful return for their former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who was beaten by Lampard for the second time this term.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/giroud--alonso-back-in-favour.html
133,23-2-20,Natural gas prices in India likely to be cut by steep 25 pc from April,"Natural gas prices in India are likely to be cut by a steep 25 per cent beginning April, in line with the slump in global rates, sources said.

The price of most of the natural gas produced by state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd, which account for the bulk of India's existing gas output, is likely to be cut to around USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit for the six-month period beginning April 1, from USD 3.23 as of now.

This will be the second reduction in six months and will reduce rates to the lowest in two-and-half-years.

Sources said the price of gas produced from difficult fields too is likely to be cut to USD 5.50 from USD 8.43 per mmBtu now.

Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

The rates, besides dictating the price of urea, electricity and CNG, also decide the revenue of gas producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).

Natural gas price was last cut by 12.5 per cent on October 1. Rates were cut to USD 3.23 per mmBtu from earlier USD 3.69. For difficult fields, the rates were cut from an all-time high of USD 9.32 per mmBtu to USD 8.43.

Sources said the reduction would impact revenues of India's biggest producer ONGC as well as Reliance Industries and its partner BP plc which plan to start gas production from their 'second-wave' of discoveries in eastern offshore KG-D6 block from mid-2020.

The cut in price will lower the earnings of producers like ONGC but will also lead to a reduction in the price of CNG, which uses natural gas as input.

It would also lead to lower cost of natural gas piped to households (PNG) for cooking purposes as well as of feedstock cost for the manufacturing of fertilisers and petrochemicals.

ONGC's revenue and earnings from the gas business will fall by around Rs 3,000 crore because of the price cut, sources said.

Gas prices in India are determined by taking a volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter.

ONGC is India's largest integrated oil and gas company, accounting for 75 per cent of crude oil and natural gas production by volume, and 17 per cent of domestic refining capacity.

Natural gas is a key raw material for the manufacturing of urea and comprises nearly 70 per cent of the total cost of urea production. For the fertiliser sector, nearly 42 per cent of the gas requirement is met through domestic gas, while the remaining is met through regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) imports.

The cost of production of urea changes by around Rs 1,600-1,800 per tonne for every USD 1 per mmBtu change. The price cut would thus reduce the subsidy outgo for the government by Rs 800 crore in the first half of FY21, they added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/natural-gas-prices-in-india-likely-to-be-cut-by-steep-25-pc-from-april-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/natural-gas-prices-in-india-likely-to-be-cut-by-steep-25-pc-from-april.html
134,23-2-20,Virus spreads in S Korean city as thousands are screened,"South Korea on Saturday reported an eight-fold jump in viral infections in four days to 433, most of them linked to a church and a hospital in and around the country’s fourth-largest city, where health workers scrambled to screen more than 9,000 worshippers.

There’s concern that the death toll, currently at two, could grow. Virus patients with signs of pneumonia or other serious conditions at the Cheongdo hospital were transferred to other facilities, 17 of them in critical condition, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.

He said that the outbreak had entered a serious new phase, but still expressed cautious optimism that it can be contained to the region surrounding Daegu, where the first case was reported on Tuesday.

In some positive news, China said Saturday the daily count of new virus cases there fell significantly to 397, though another 109 people died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Most of the new cases and all but three of the deaths were in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.

The new figures, along with an upward revision of Hubei’s earlier count, brought the total number of cases in mainland China to 76,288 with 2,345 deaths. China has severely restricted travel and imposed strict quarantine measures to stop the virus from spreading.

Of the 229 new cases in South Korea, 200 are from Daegu and nearby regions, which have emerged as the latest front in the widening global fight against the virus.

By Saturday morning, the city of 2.5 million and nearby areascounted 352 cases, including the two fatalities in the Cheongdo hospital.

The central government has declared the area as a “special management zone” and is channeling support to ease a shortage in hospital beds, medical personnel and equipment.

“Although we are beginning to see some more cases nationwide, infections are still sporadic outside of the special management zone of Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province,” Kim said during a briefing.

At the meeting in Saudi Arabia, the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency, financial leaders from the world’s top 20 economies are also seeking consensus on ways to achieve a global taxation system for the digital era.

The gathering comes amid growing alarm over the new coronavirus as Chinese authorities lock down millions of people to prevent the spread of the disease, with major knock-on effects for the global economy.

The virus has now claimed 2,345 lives in China, cutting off transportation and forcing businesses to close their doors.

The impact of the epidemic could see a “V-shaped” trajectory, with a sharp decline in China’s GDP followed by a sharp recovery, but the situation could have more dire consequences for other countries as the impacts spill over, said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva.

138,23-2-20,US says Russia behind huge virus disinformation drive,"Thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the new coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to combat the epidemic, US officials told AFP.

The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the COVID-19 outbreak, in an apparent bid to damage the US image by seizing on international health concerns, they said.

False personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points and conspiracies, including suggesting that the CIA is behind the virus that has claimed more than 2,300 lives, mostly in China.

“Russia’s intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,” said Philip Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia. “By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-says-russia-behind-huge-virus-disinformation-drive.html
139,23-2-20,If peace comes: Afghans dream of life after war,"With a partial truce under way Saturday and a deal between the US and the Taliban likely on the horizon, Afghans are daring to dream of the war ending and their country finally opening up.

The “reduction in violence” agreed by the Taliban, the US and the Afghan security forces comes ahead of a possible deal between the insurgents and Washington which would see the US pull thousands of troops out of Afghanistan.

While the move is fraught with uncertainty, it marks a potentially historic step in the country’s more than 18-year-old war.

Afghans have been sharing their hopes for peace on social media, tagging posts with hashtags in Dari and Pashto — Afghanistan’s two main languages — that translate to #ifPeaceComes and #whenThereIsCeasefire.

“In the past 15 years, people have not been able to travel on highways safely. The Taliban stop them, kill them or kidnap them,” Ramin Mazhar, a popular poet who helped spread the hashtags, told AFP.

If the reduction in violence holds, Mazhar said he would go to Nuristan, an inaccessible province in the northeast of the country.

“I want to go to Nuristan, run, laugh, sing, dance, whistle and eat yogurt,” he said.

“I want to touch its green hills, crazy rivers and blue sky. I want to climb its trees, and know its pigeons.” Afghanistan was once a popular destination on the “hippie trail” that saw foreigners from across Europe travel to the country by bus en route to India in the 1960s and 1970s.

Tourism was all but destroyed following the Soviet invasion in 1979 that led to over 40 years of continuous fighting and instability.

Few Afghans have been able to visit areas outside of their immediate home ever since, while millions have relocated to urban areas or moved abroad.

The desire to see more of the country is strong.

Afghanistan is home to stunning mountain ranges like the snow-capped Hindu Kush along with verdant, remote valleys and swathes of pristine desert.

However with the Taliban controlling or contesting approximately half of Afghanistan, only small pockets of the country are accessible.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/if-peace-comes--afghans-dream-of-life-after-war.html
140,23-2-20,4 for Messi,"Lionel Messi scored four goals as Barcelona began a crunch week in their season by thrashing Eibar 5-0 in La Liga on Saturday.

Barca play away at in-form Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday before facing title rivals Real Madrid next weekend, with pressure on the team, and Messi, amid a period of political turbulence at the club.

Yet on the pitch, Messi showed no sign of distraction as the 32-year-old completed the second fastest of his now 36 career hat-tricks, after just 40 minutes at Camp Nou.

Messi added a late fourth after being teed up by Martin Braithwaite, Barcelona’s emergency signing who enjoyed an excellent cameo off the bench by claiming two assists, the second for Arthur Melo in injury-time.

Braithwaite’s contribution and Messi's return to form delivered a timely boost ahead of what could prove a pivotal few days in Barca's season.

141,23-2-20,Pant’s run-out was turning point: Southee,"New Zealand pacer Tim Southee believes that Rishabh Pant’s freak run-out went a long way in changing the course of the Indian innings that eventually folded up for 165.

Pant, who started the day with a six in the first over suffered because of Ajinkya Rahane’s poor call and India lost five wickets for 33 runs from that point. Rahane himself fell to Southee as he inside edged to the keeper trying to shoulder arms and late inward movement became his undoing.

Asked if there was any strategy to dismiss Rahane, Southee replied: “No, the run-out of Pant was a big this morning. With him (Pant) being such a dangerous player and leading into that second new-ball, he could have scored quickly along with Jinks (Rahane’s nickname).”

Southee knew that Rahane had no option but to attack once Pant was dismissed.

“We knew though if we could open one end up with the bowlers, then Jinks was looking to play a little bit more aggressively, which brings us into play a little more.

“The way we bowled this morning was pretty good.

142,23-2-20,Agar takes hat-trick in big Aus win,"Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar took a hat-trick as Australia crushed South Africa by 107 runs in the first T20I at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday.

Steve Smith, back in South Africa for the first time since the 2018 ball-tampering scandal, hit a top score of 45 for Australia, who made 196 for six after being sent in.

South Africa made a bad start against the pace of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins before Agar’s triple strike sent them hurtling to their all-time lowest T20 total of 89.

It was also the host country’s biggest defeat in the format.

Man of the match Agar finished with career-best figures of five for 24.

“It was really exciting, a highlight of my cricketing life,” he said.

But he gave praise to the fast bowling attack of Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson and Pat Cummins who started South Africa’s collapse.

South Africa were reeling at 40 for four when Agar came on to bowl.

He had Faf du Plessis caught at deep cover with his fourth delivery, trapped Andile Phehlukwayo leg before next ball and Dale Steyn superbly caught at slip by captain Aaron Finch to complete the hat-trick.

Earlier, Smith and Finch (42) set up Australia’s big total with an aggressive second wicket stand of 80 off 52 balls, benefitting from some loose South African bowling.

The win extended Australia’s unbeaten run in the format to nine matches, with eight wins and one no-result. Their last defeat was in November 2018.

The second match of the series is at Port Elizabeth today with the third and final game in Cape Town on Wednesday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/agar-takes-hat-trick-in-big-aus-win.html
143,23-2-20,Funny how perceptions change quickly: Ishant comes to Bumrah’s defence,"India’s seniormost player Ishant Sharma finds it “funny” that people are questioning Jasprit Bumrah’s “ability” just after a few matches, ignoring his performances over the past two years. “It’s funny that perceptions changed after one innings. For two years, we have always taken 20 wickets, myself, Boom (Bumrah’s nickname in Indian dressing room) and Shami along with Ash or Jaddu (at home). How can people question on the basis of one innings (Test)?” Ishant asked while defending his colleague. “I don’t think anyone doubts Boom’s ability. Since his debut, what he has achieved for India, I don’t think anyone should raise any questions,” said Ishant. Bumrah also had support from New Zealand pacer Tim Southee, who called him a “world class bowler” and found nothing wrong in his execution.

“I don’t think there’s anything wrong. He is a world-class bowler. He is obviously coming back from injury, but he is a quality player, and we know a great performance is never far away when you’re a quality player,” Southee said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/funny-how-perceptions-change-quickly--ishant-comes-to-bumrah---s-defence.html
144,23-2-20,Aus win will give India huge confidence: Mithali,"India’s demolition of a formidable Australia in the Women’s T20 World Cup opener will give them a huge boost going forward, said star batswoman Mithali Raj, who also lauded leggie Poonam Yadav for her magical performance.

Poonam took four for 19 to help India complete a 17-run victory against defending champions Australia on Friday.

“Everyone has been talking about how much batting depth Australia have, yet they couldn’t chase 132,” Raj, a former India Test and ODI captain, said.

“India will take so much confidence from that victory, but this World Cup is still very open. The match between Australia and India proved how competitive the tournament will be. It proves it does not matter where you stand in the ICC rankings.

“We will be seeing more of the same drama yet. This victory proves every team has a chance,” said Raj, who has retired from T20 cricket.

The 37-year-old veteran batswoman said “the opening match definitely lived up to the hype of the tournament”.

“It was a whirlwind. There were so many ups and downs. It was a great start to the tournament not only because India beat the defending champions on home soil, but also because of how the game progressed altogether.

“At no point could you say it was going in one side’s favour. First we saw our early wickets fall, then we recovered and Australia had to chase 132 before their middle-order collapsed. India and Australia both took the game their own way at different points which made it fascinating for spectators to watch.”

Raj said Poonam’s spell was the turning point.

“She’s been one of the main spinners for India for quite some time now, and her style worked again. Getting their (Australia’s) middle-order out really titled the match towards India, she was brilliant.

“Although we recovered our innings through Deepti Sharma and her partnership with Jemimah Rodrigues, it was Poonam’s flurry of wickets against Australia’s megastars, which completely changed the game,"" Raj said.

Raj also praised 16-year-old Shafali Verma for scoring 29 off 15 on her World Cup debut.

“Shafali Verma impressed me too on her debut. She gave India’s middle order the cushioning they needed to regain momentum. Verma has stuck with stroke play that she demonstrated in the tri-series,” she said.

“I think she should be given that free range in the first six overs because when you’re playing a top team, the runs in the first six overs are so important. It was great to be 40 up after just a few overs thanks to her contribution — Australia couldn’t replicate that.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-win-will-give-india-huge-confidence--mithali.html
145,23-2-20,Kane keeps Kiwis ahead,"Ishant Sharma’s lion-hearted bowling effort met its match in Kane Williamson’s elegance as New Zealand ended an attritional second day of the opening Test against India with a slight upper-hand, here at Basin Reserve on Saturday.

After another lower-order collapse that saw get India bundled out for 165, Ishant, coming straight back from an ankle injury, took three for 31 in 15 overs despite Williamson’s effortless 89 in New Zealand’s day-end score of 216 for 5.

New Zealand now lead by 51 runs.

Mohammed Shami (1/61 in 17 overs), during his final spell of the day, removed Williamson, who couldn’t check an uppish drive. Henry Nicholls’ (17 off 62 balls) struggle seemed to have hampered Williamson’s rhythm.

During the final hour, Ravichandran Ashwin (1/60 in 21 overs), who also bowled beautifully throughout the day, relieved Nicholls of his agony with a delivery that had drift and a hint of turn as India skipper Virat Kohli snapped the low catch at second slip.

Williamson looked good as he hit some delightful strokes square off the wicket. The square drive on the rise off Jasprit Bumrah (0/62 in 18.1 overs), followed by a cover drive, showed his class.

In all, the New Zealand skipper hit 11 boundaries off 153 balls.

Bumrah, in particular, was punished by Williamson. Either Bumrah bowled too full and drivable length deliveries or too short that even Rishabh Pant failed to gather the ball over his head.

This was where Ishant came into the picture. While he was lucky to get opener Tom Latham out with a delivery drifting on leg-stump, the other opener Tom Blundell (30) had a typical Ishant dismissal written all over it.

The ball was full on the off-stump channel and jagged back enough to find the gap between his bat and pad.

“Actually, the wicket became slow. It had tennis ball bounce at the start but when we bowled, there was no seam movement available,” Ishant said after the end of the day’s play.

Williamson and Taylor then had a partnership of 93 runs during which New Zealand also got the lead before Ishant, coming back for his third spell, bowled one that reared up from good length and proved to be an easy catch for Cheteshwar Pujara at short-leg.

Looking good for his 22nd Test hundred, Williamson, in his bid to get another boundary, couldn’t check a cover drive and the low catch was taken by substitute fielder Ravindra Jadeja.

Earlier, New Zealand’s debutant Kyle Jamieson (4/49) and veteran Tim Southee (4/49) took four wickets apiece as Indian innings folded in 68.1 overs. The duo took four of the five wickets that fell on the second morning with India adding only 43 runs to their overnight score of 122/5.

Rishabh Pant (19) started with a six but then a horrible mix-up with senior partner Ajinkya Rahane (46) resulted in a run-out and the little chance of recovery was gone for good.

Southee then got rid of Rahane when he tried to shoulder-arm a delivery that made a late inward movement. Mohammed Shami's entertaining 21 then enabled the visitors to cross the 150-run mark.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kane-keeps-kiwis-ahead-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kane-keeps-kiwis-ahead.html
146,23-2-20,World champion Marquez admits shoulder injury worry,"World motorcycling champion Marc Marquez admitted that his long-standing shoulder problem hampered his performance on the opening day of pre-season testing on Saturday.

Honda rider Marquez, a six-time champion in the sport's elite class, was sixth fastest at the Losail track, 0.361sec behind the Suzuki of Spanish compatriot Alex Rins.

Marquez underwent surgery on his right shoulder last November after a fall in testing in Jerez, aggravating an injury originally picked up at last year's Malaysian Grand Prix.

""Today we started well but I am struggling a bit more than in Malaysia (at a recent test) with my shoulder,"" said Marquez.

""In the long corners here, especially the long right handers, I feel my shoulder.

""As always, Qatar is not an easy circuit for us and we're aiming to be as strong as possible.""

Qatar will host the world championship season-opener on March 8.

It was a day to forget for the Marquez family with younger brother Alex, promoted to the Honda MotoGP team this season, down in 21st place from 22 riders.

That was over two seconds off the leading Suzuki.

""I have been feeling a little sick,"" said 2019 Moto2 world champion Alex.

""It's nothing serious but I do not have my full power and in MotoGP you need to be at your best.

""I had a crash today. This is how you find the limit as a rookie so I'm not focusing on it.""

Rins was joined at the top of the time charts by Suzuki teammate Joan Mir. Yamaha's Maverick Vinales was third, completing a Spanish top three.

Seven-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi was seventh fastest, one place ahead of Fabio Quartararo who will replace the veteran Italian at the Yamaha factory team in 2021.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/world-champion-marquez-admits-shoulder-injury-worry-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/world-champion-marquez-admits-shoulder-injury-worry.html
147,23-2-20,"Cong asks PM Modi if he would raise H-1B visa, restoration of GSP issues with Trump","Ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit, the Congress on Sunday asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would raise with him the issue of easing H-1B visas, restoration of GSP status and security concerns over Taliban.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked why Prime Minister Modi is silent about ""India First"" as President Trump talked of ""America First"".

He also asked whether Modi would ensure cheaper oil for India after it stopped buying oil from Iran in view of sanctions and if Indian steel exports would get a boost after India commits to USD 3 billion defence purchases.

""Trump Government's restrictive immigration policies have hit H-1B visas. Indians get 70 pc of 85000 H-1B Visas.

""Now, Rejection Rate for India has increased from 6 pc in 2015 to 24 pc in 2019, especially for IT professionals. Post 10 million people gala event, Will PM Modi ask for easing H-1B visas,"" he asked on Twitter.

Surjewala said as US prepares to sign a deal with Taliban on February 29, what about India's red lines.

""Have we forgotten IC-814 hijacking and release of terrorist Masood Azhar in Kandhar, who's JeM then attacked Parliament and Pulwama? As gala bash unfolds, Will Modiji raise our National Security concerns,"" he said.

The Congress leader said continuing since 1974, the US removed India from Duty Free Imports i.E GSP (generalised system of preferences) on 5 June, 2019.

It has affected the USD 5.6 billion Indian exports to the US, especially gems, jewellery, rice, leather, he noted.

""Post 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump' gala events, Will PM ensure restoration of GSP status,"" he asked.

Surjewala said up till 2018, India imported 250 crore ton Crude Oil/month from Iran on Rupee payment, 90 days credit and doorstep delivery.

The Modi government stopped buying cheaper Iran oil as per US sanctions that raised oil prices in India, he alleged.

""As fest continues in Ahmedabad, Will Modiji secure cheaper oil for India,"" he asked.

The Congress leader alleged that India's exports of USD 761 million of steel to the US fell by 50 pc to USD 372 million as the Trump Government hiked tariffs on import by 25 pc.

""As India commits to USD 3 billion Defense purchases, why zero relief for India's export of steel?

Both the teams were locked 2-2 at the end of regulation time.

India converted two penalty corners through Rupinder Pal Singh (25th minute) and Harmanpreet Singh (27th), while Trent Mitton (23rd) and skipper Aran Zalewski (46th) were the scorers for Australia in the regulation 60 minutes.

150,23-2-20,Ravi shows class with Gold,"Ravi Dahiya impressed with a Gold-winning effort at the Asian Wrestling Championship but India’s biggest Olympic medal hope Bajrang Punia looked good until he ran into Japanese Takuto Otoguro in his final here on Saturday.

In a strong show by the home wrestlers, four of them reached the finals but only Ravi stood on top of the podium, with a scintillating show in the 57kg.

Ravi had shown at the 2019 World Championship in Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan, that he is one for the future, and he proved it again at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium.

His agility, tactic and a strong will all came together and resulted in a tremendous performance.

Apart from Bajrang (65kg), Gourav Baliyan (79kg) and Satyawart Kadiyan (97kg) also had to be content with Silver medals.

World number two Bajrang entered the event as defending champion and conceded only two points on his way to the final but could not avenge his defeat to Otoguro in the 2018 World Championship title clash.

At that time his leg defence was a huge issue but on Saturday he lost in a different manner. In the fast-paced bout, Bajrang’s leg defence was not a problem but he lost points on smart counter-attacks by Otoguro.

Much to the shock of home fans, Bajrang suffered a comprehensive 1-10 defeat against the world number nine.

Bajrang could score just one point on push-out even as Otoguro kept strengthening his lead with tremendous tactical acumen and power.

An upset Bajrang said he could not fight the way he wanted.

“It was important to fight with all these wrestlers because I will wrestle with them at the Olympics. I have taken my lessons from this. I could not fight as I wanted. It was a very different fight. His counter-attacks were good and this is an area I need to work on to,” he said.

Bajrang’s coach Shako Bentinidis admitted that Otoguro emerged stronger.

“Bajrang was slow, Otoguro was stronger. But I am happy with Silver. It’s difficult to maintain intensity and a high level of performance for two years. We still have five months and he remains a contender at Olympics,” Bentinidis said.

“If you see all top wrestlers even in Europe have slowed down a bit. It’s happening now and not two weeks before the Olympics, so it’s okay. Wrestling is tough, it’s not like football or basketball. In 65kg all wrestlers are almost at the same level,” he said.

Poor leg defence and conceding a big lead in the first period troubled Bajrang for some time but none of them cropped up on Saturday as he remained strong from the beginning.

He won all his bouts by technical superiority, beating Tajikistan’s Dzhamshed Shafirov, Uzbekistan’s Abbos Rakhmonov and Iran’s Amirhossein Azim Maghsoudi.

In 57kg, Ravi, who is fast emerging a strong contender for the Tokyo Games, too, put up a strong show, beating 2017 World champion from Japan Yuki Takahashi (14-5) before pinning Mongolia’s Tugs Batjargal in the quarterfinals.

In the semifinal, Uzbekistan’s Nurislam Sanayev too could not challenge Ravi much.

In the final against Tajikistan’s Hikmatullo Vohidov, the world championship Bronze winner from India claimed the Gold with ease, registering a victory by technical superiority.

“I am doing well and hopefully we will come up with a good performance at the Olympics too. The key for me is to stay injury-free as of now,” said Ravi.

Satyawart was outplayed by Iran’s Mojtaba Mohammadshafie in the final on technical superiority, but Gourav fought his heart out before losing to Arsalan Budazhapov of Kyrgyzstan.

Of the five Indians in action, it was only Naveen who missed out on a final appearance, in the 70kg category.

He lost his semifinal to Iran’s Amirhossein Ali Hosseini 2-3. Later, he lost his Bronze medal play-off to Kazakhstan’s Meirzhan Ashirov.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ravi-shows-class-with-gold-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ravi-shows-class-with-gold.html

By stumps on the third day, the visiting team extended the advantage by reaching 93 for 2 in their second innings.

J&K poised for lead

Jammu: Jammu and Kashmir were in a good a position to take the crucial first-innings lead after bowling out Karnataka for 206 on day three.

Resuming the day on 14 for two, Karnataka somehow managed to get past the 200-run mark with K Siddharth scoring 76 off 189 balls.

It was a disciplined bowling performance from the home team with Nabi and his new ball partner Mujtaba Yousuf taking three wickets each.

J&K skipper and off-spinner Parvez Rasool ran though the tail, ending with three wickets including of Siddharth.

In response, J&K were 88 for two at stumps, needing another 119 runs to take the first-innings lead.

Hasaranga, known for his leg-spin bowling, hit an unbeaten 42 after coming in to bat at number eight as Sri Lanka chased down their target of 290 with five balls to spare and lead the three-match series 1-0.

Hasaranga held his nerve after Sri Lanka slipped to 253 for seven following the departure of Thisara Perera for 32 to register his highest ODI score.

For the West Indies, Alzarri Joseph claimed three wickets after Shai Hope made 115 in his team’s 289 for seven.

“I think we bowled too many bad balls in the start, gave them too many freebies, that’s where we lost the game. Our discipline was not there,” said Windies skipper Kieron Pollard

Officials and security agencies are giving final touches to preparations for the US President's visit to the city.

Even as there is uncertainty over Trump's visit to Sabarmati Ashram during his roadshow, all preparations have been done in anticipation of this arrival there with Modi, officials of the ashram said.

The Sabarmati Ashram served as the epicenter of the country's freedom struggle during Mahatma Gandhi's stay there.

As per the plan, Trump and Modi will embark on a 22-km roadshow from the Ahmedabad airport, where the US President will be accorded a grand welcome.

After the roadshow, both the leaders will reach the newly-built cricket stadium in Motera area of the city.

Authorities believe over one lakh people are expected to line up along the route of the roadshow, which has been named as 'India Road Show' by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.

The city civic body is leaving no stone unturned to make the roadshow a memorable experience for the dignitaries as well as the people of Gujarat.

""Hello Ahmedabad, Come,be a part of the 22 km long mega India Road Show. Lets showcase the best of Indian culture and diversity to the world. #Namaste Trump,"" Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra said in a tweet on Sunday.

The civic body has invited artistes from almost all the states to perform during the roadshow.

There will be separate stage for each state at regular distance on the route and artistes from different states would perform on these 30-odd stages.

After the roadshow, Trump and Modi would reach the stadium at Motera for the 'Namaste Trump' event, where the two leaders would address a gathering of around 1.10 lakh people.

159,23-2-20,Police fire teargas shells as anti-CAA protesters turn violent in Aligarh,"Clashes broke out between anti-CAA protesters and police in the old city area here following incidents of arson and stone pelting on late Sunday afternoon.

The police had fired teargas shells to disperse the mob indulging in vandalisation of property and throwing stones at security personnel in upper Kot area of the Kotwali police station, said police sources.

There were reports of injuries to some people but the exact number of those injured in clashes is yet to ascertained, they said.

Reports of brick-batting, arson were still coming in from a spot where some women protestors were holding a dharna since Saturday on the Mohamed Ali Road leading to the Kotwali police station with police trying to evict the protesters from there, they said.

The clashes broke out shortly after a Bhim Army-led march by hundreds of anti-CAA protesters heading to the district collectorate earlier were stopped midway by police and Rapid Action Force jawans.

Stopped by police, the protesters, however, had headed towards the Eidgah area in the city where another group of anti-CAA women protestors had been holding an indefinite dharna for the past three weeks.

As the Bhim Army-led protestors, including women, were stopped by police from moving ahead after they crossed over the Katpula Bridge from the old city, they decided to join the women protesters sitting in Eidgah area.

The protesters had taken out the march on a call by Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar.

Shops in some areas near Kotwali had downed their shutters.

Aligarh SSP Rajmuni, who took over the charge as the district police only last night, had earlier told mediapersons that following the abortive march, an FIR has been lodged against three persons at the Delhi Gate police station for trying to violate prohibitory orders and breach peace in the city.

The new SSP said he was monitoring the situation arising out of the anti-CAA protests, going on both at the AMU and the old city area.

He had said our ""channels of communications with protesters are going to remain open but it does not mean we will allow anybody disturb the city's law and order"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/police-fire-teargas-shells-as-anti-caa-protesters-turn-violent-in-aligarh-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/police-fire-teargas-shells-as-anti-caa-protesters-turn-violent-in-aligarh.html
160,23-2-20,Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha denies he endorsed Pak Prez Alvi's concerns over Kashmir,"Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday rejected Pakistan President Rashid Alvi's claim that the actor-turned-politician ""endorsed"" his concerns over the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir imposed after India revoked its special status.

Sinha, 74, who was on a ""personal"" visit to Pakistan to attend a wedding there, met President Alvi after receiving a ""surprise"" invitation from him at the Governor's House in Lahore on Saturday.

""We were very touched by this gesture of the President of Pakistan and we reciprocated it with love, warmth, thanksgiving and an attitude of gratitude. I had attended the Honorable President's son's wedding a few years back in Karachi, so I have known the family very well,"" Sinha said in a tweet.

Terming it a ""great meeting of minds"", Sinha said they discussed social and cultural issues but not politics.

""...Though the meeting lasted for quite some time, it was purely social, personal and purely a courtesy call to give profound regards. We discussed so many things on social and cultural issues but no politics was discussed,"" he said.

""Nothing political or official about it. My friends, well-wishers and supporters and of course the media should realise that one shouldn't discuss the politics or policies of countries on foreign soil when one isn't competent, qualified & authorised by the Govt,"" he said.

Sinha's remarks came after Alvi's office said in a tweet that Sinha had ""endorsed"" concern of the Pakistan President over the ""lockdown"" in Kashmir, following the Indian government's August 5 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcate the state into two union territories.

Sinha has visited Pakistan on several occasions in the past owing to his closeness to the country's former president Zia-ul-Haq.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/congress-leader-shatrughan-sinha-denies-he-endorsed-pak-prez-alvi-s-concerns-over-kashmir-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/congress-leader-shatrughan-sinha-denies-he-endorsed-pak-prez-alvi-s-concerns-over-kashmir.html
161,23-2-20,I'm honoured to return to India: Ivanka Trump,"Ivanka Trump, daughter and advisor to US President Donald Trump, on Sunday hailed the ""grand friendship between the world's two largest democracies"".

In a tweet, Ivanka said she is honoured to return to India.

""Two years after joining @narendramodi at the Global Entrepreneurial Summit in Hyderabad, I am honoured to return to India with @POTUS and @FLOTUS to celebrate that the grand friendship between the world's two largest democracies has never been stronger!"" Ivanka tweeted.

Ivanka visited India to attend the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in Hyderabad in November 2017, and had dinner with global delegates at the Taj Falaknuma Palace.

""Globally, between 2014 and 2016, entrepreneurship activity among women increased by 10 per cent. In the US, within the last decade, the number of women-owned firms has grown by 45 per cent. Minority women have started nearly 8 in 10 new women-owned businesses,"" Ivanka said while addressing the gathering at the GES event.

She praised Modi for proving that ""transformational change is possible"".

This time, she is accompanying Trump along with her husband Jared Kushner and several high-profile officials, like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien.

162,23-2-20,Kejriwal not ‘Happiness’ tour guide for Melania,"AAP blames Centre as US Embassy says CM, Sisodia not in event’s invitee list

Names of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia are missing from the guest list for the February 25 event when US First Lady Melania Trump is scheduled to visit a Delhi Government school in the national Capital to watch “happiness classes” and interact with the students, sources said.

The Delhi Government sources said the US Embassy communicated to the city administration on Saturday morning that the names of Kejriwal and Sisodia do not figure in the list of invitees for the school event. When contacted, a US Embassy spokesperson referred the query to the Delhi Government on the matter.

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the names of Kejriwal and Sisodia have been dropped from the list at the behest of the BJP-led Central Government. “The BJP is claiming that it (Centre) did not ask the US Embassy to drop the names of Kejriwal and Sisodia from the list. The comments actually indicated that there is something fishy,” Bhardwaj claimed.

According to the original schedule, Kejriwal and Sisodia were to welcome Melania at the school and brief her about rationale behind introduction of “happiness classes” as well as the Delhi Government’s overall reform initiatives in the education sector, officials said.

“Names of Kejriwal and Sisodia have been dropped from the list of invitees. We do not know who will receive and brief the First Lady about happiness classes when she visits our school,” said a Delhi Government official.

Though there was no official reaction from the Delhi Government on the issue, a series of tweets by Sisodia, credited with educational reform in Delhi schools, indicated the AAP dispensation’s unhappiness over it.

He said “happiness class” is “the solution to all hate and narrow mindedness”.

“Education is meaningless without happiness. I am happy that Delhi Govt schools are showing a path to the world. And the world is curious to know what we are doing in happiness class,” he said.

Earlier in the day, the Deputy Chief Minister told reporters that the Delhi Government had received a request about Melania’s visit to a Government school.

“If she (Melania) wants to come (to a Government school), we welcome her,” he said.

An AAP functionary argued that in absence of the Chief Minister and his deputy, who will brief Melania about the ‘happiness curriculum’. “Delhi Government’s happiness curriculum has been lauded across the globe. Who will brief Melania Trump if the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister are not present during her visit,” he asked.

Expressing anguish over exclusion of names of the two leaders from the event, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said it has been a “protocol” and “convention” that the state leaders are present when any foreign dignitary attends events in their States.

He also alleged that the names of Kejriwal and Sisodia have been dropped from the guest list at the behest of the BJP-led Central Government. He referred to a Press conference by a BJP spokesperson to clarify the saffron party’s stand on the issue.

“If it (the Centre) has not asked it (the US Embassy) to drop names of the CM and deputy CM, then it could have simply requested the Embassy to include their names,” he said.

“Instead of asking the US embassy for the same, holding Press conference by a BJP leader is a clear indication that it (BJP) is involved in the entire matter,” Bharadwaj said when asked about the issue.

On Kejriwal not being part of the guest list for Melania’s visit to the Delhi school, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said there shouldn’t be any “low-level politics or petty politics” on issues which are of national interest.

“India comes under disrepute if we start pulling each other’s legs. The Modi Government doesn’t influence the US, as to whom they invite or not,” he said.

The Delhi Government introduced the happiness curriculum in July, 2018. According to the curriculum, students studying in classes 1-8 at Delhi Government schools spend 45 minutes every day to attend “happiness classes” where they participate in activities like storytelling, meditation and question and answer sessions. Similarly, for nursery and kindergarten students, the classes are held twice a week.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led Government has been spending a large chunk of its budget on education in the city in the last several years. In its last budget, the Delhi government had set aside 25 per cent of its total budget for the education sector, perhaps highest among other States. Kejriwal led AAP to a spectacular victory in the assembly elections earlier this month primarily riding on his development agenda including reforms in the health and education sectors.

The reforms initiated by the AAP Government have been lauded by several prominent personalities.

On Friday, Kejriwal said his Government will provide all possible help to the Maharashtra government to implement education reforms which he said reflected “cooperative federalism at its best”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-not----happiness----tour-guide-for-melania-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kejriwal-not----happiness----tour-guide-for-melania.html
163,23-2-20,"FPIs remain bullish on India; invest Rs 23,102 cr in Feb so far","Staying bullish on Indian markets, overseas investors have pumped in a net amount of Rs 23,102 crore in February so far driven by positive sentiment around the budget and RBI's decision to maintain an accommodative stance in the latest monetary policy.

According to the depositories data, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) invested a net sum of Rs 10,750 crore into equities and Rs 12,352 crore into the debt segment, taking the total net investment to Rs 23,102 crore between February 3-20.

FPIs have been net buyers in the Indian markets since September 2019, the data showed.

""There are multiple factors like positive sentiments around the budget and RBI's decision to maintain an accommodative stance in the latest monetary policy that have had foreign investors hooked to the Indian markets despite the challenges faced by the domestic economy and slow pace of growth in corporate earnings,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

The removal of DDT in the budget and the government's proposal to increase the FPI limit in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent have helped FPIs regaining their confidence back.

Additionally, fixed income markets have witnessed positive flows largely on the back of RBI's decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance, Srivastava said.

Globally, he said, there has been a risk-off sentiment among foreign investors with the outbreak of coronavirus epidemic. FPIs have been particularly wary of investing in markets, which rely on tourism, as the spread of virus can adversely impact their prospects and economic growth.

""From this perspective, Indian equity market is better positioned among such group of countries and hence it has been attracting foreign flows,"" he added.

Going forward, ""FPIs don't expect the Fed and European Central Bank to tighten policy soon. FPI flows will continue so long as the leading central banks are in accommodative monetary policy,"" V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-remain-bullish-on-india--invest-rs-23-102-cr-in-feb-so-far-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/fpis-remain-bullish-on-india--invest-rs-23-102-cr-in-feb-so-far.html

Addressing his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' radio address, the prime minister referred to Tamil poetess Avvaiyar to drive home his point.

""What we know is just a handful of sand. What we do not know is like a universe in itself,"" he said quoting her.

Similar is the case with the biodiversity of this country, the prime minister pointed out.

165,23-2-20,Agra sports new look to welcome US President Donald Trump,"Walls are being adorned with paintings reflecting the Brij culture and architectural heritage of Agra, victorian-style lamp posts installed and the lawns of the iconic Taj Mahal bedecked with colourful blooms as the historic city gears up to welcome US President Donald Trump.

Trump is slated to arrive in Agra on Monday evening after attending the mega 'Namaste Trump' event at the newly built Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.

The city administration is all geared up for the big day and preparations are in full swing to present the ""best face of Agra"".

""We are fully prepared, and we wish to present the best of Agra to the US President and his delegation. At the Kheria airport, upon his arrival, expected at about 4:30 pm, hundreds of artists will welcome him with 'mayur nritya',"" Agra's Divisional Commissioner Anil Kumar told PTI.

Security has been stepped up in the city ahead of Trump's visit, his first to India. His daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and a galaxy of top US officials will be part of the high-level delegation accompanying him during his visit to India on February 24 and 25.

In Agra, the Trump family will spend about an hour at the Taj Mahal before sunset. They will then leave for Delhi.

Authorities said a multi-level security cover will be in place for the visit and police and paramilitary and other forces are keeping a hawk-eyed vigil in the city.

The huge police deployment will be in addition to officials of the United States Secret Service, and officials of the National Security Guards (NSG), they said.

The Agra commissioner said Trump's convoy route from the airport to the Taj Mahal will span about 13 km, and along the way thousands of artistes will welcome him with special performances.

""Along the route, 21 designated areas have been marked, some with stages and others on ground level, where artistes will present the dance forms of Brij region (Mathura-Vrindavan), like Krishna Lila, dances themed on Radha, and other cultural assets of the region,” Kumar said.

In the main city, old roads are being repaired, road-dividers being painted afresh, illegal hoardings and posters removed, and walls along the route that President Trump will take being decorated with painting reflecting the Brij culture and architectural heritage of Agra.

At many places, artworks greeting Trump have been made by artists, who are busy finishing walls ahead of the visit. Water is being sprayed regularly to ensure there is no dust.

Victorian-style lamp posts have been installed in many areas to improve the aesthetic look of the city.

Water has also been continuously discharged into the Yamuna river to improve its environmental condition, authorities said.

At the Taj Mahal premises, workers were seen cleaning the marble and sandstones.

The 17th century famed mausoleum was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan over a period of about 20 years after the death of his wife Mumtaz Mahal in 1631.

Built with white marble and red sandstone, the exquisite architectural marvel, considered one of the seven wonders of the world, attracts a huge number of tourists from all over the world, and is often on the itinerary of heads of states of different countries who visit India.

In Taj Ganj, the area neighbouring the mausoleum, many shops are sporting a uniform signboard as directed by local authorities.

""About a week ago, the boards were changed to a uniform look for all shops to present a beautiful look. We are very excited about President Trump's visit,"" said Pawan Kumar, who runs a 'petha' shop.

Guide Abdul Khan also gushed about Trump's visit, saying it will “boost the stature of Agra and further boost tourism”.

""The fountains have been thoroughly cleaned and flower pots are being put up bearing shimmering flowers. Taj doesn't need any promotion, but an added spotlight will definitely enhance the glory of Taj and Agra too,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/agra-sports-new-look-to-welcome-us-president-donald-trump-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/agra-sports-new-look-to-welcome-us-president-donald-trump.html

169,23-2-20,Growing perception that Cong 'adrift'; party must resolve leadership issue for revival: Tharoor,"The Congress must fix its leadership issues on top priority to address the growing perception among the people that the party is ""adrift"", senior leader Shashi Tharoor said on Sunday and asserted that resolving the uncertainty over a long-term president was crucial for the party's revival.

In an interview to PTI, Tharoor also said that it was up to Rahul Gandhi to take a call if he wishes to return as Congress chief, but if he does not change his earlier stance then the party needs to find an ""active and full-time leadership"" so that the party can move forward as the nation expects.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who last week renewed his call for elections for the Congress Working Committee (CWC), said the process of electing some members of the party's highest decision-making body will usher in a dynamic leadership team with a credible mandate to work together to address the organisational challenges.

Asserting that the Congress is the indispensable national alternative to the ""divisive policies"" of the BJP, Tharoor said, ""The immediate cause of worry for many of us is that there appears to be a growing perception in the eyes of the public that we, as a political entity, are adrift.""

This is naturally driving some voters towards considering other political options and the most recent example of this was seen in Delhi, where the voters chose to side primarily with the AAP and to a smaller extent with the BJP, leaving the Congress with naught, he said.

""This is where the compelling case for urgently addressing this perception in the eyes of the public comes from -- and for that matter, changing the attitude of the media, which is repeatedly writing us off dismissively,"" Tharoor said.

""But for us to do so, we do need to fix our current leadership issues. We need to start with a longer-term, as opposed to interim, Congress president, as well as the 'elected' membership of the Working Committee,"" the former Union minister said.

Tharoor said he is an advocate for free and transparent elections within the party for these positions as such a process would significantly add to their credibility and legitimacy.

The CWC found an excellent interim solution in Sonia Gandhi, but the party cannot indefinitely keep depending on and burdening a president who had only just relinquished the job less than two years ago, he said, adding that it is neither fair to her, nor to the voters.

He also said the repeated question of 'Gandhi or non-Gandhi' as party president was ""missing the wood for the trees"".

""The larger concern and the need of the hour is to find a new president and leadership, and I am confident that if we do so through a participatory, transparent and democratic electoral process internally, the workers will at the end of the day throw their might and energy behind whoever emerges as the winning candidate,"" he said.

Asked if the problem remains that of ""who will bell the cat"" and raise leadership issues with the Gandhi family, Tharoor said, ""I don't think the issue at hand is specifically about not being able to raise these concerns with members of the Gandhi family.""

""It is of critical importance that we delay no further and work together to move forward. Resolving the uncertainty about long-term leadership is an indispensable aspect of our process of revival. It must be given foremost priority,"" Tharoor said.

Talking about the party's conundrum over whether to convince Rahul Gandhi to come back or move on, Tharoor said Gandhi will always hold a special place at the core of the party and the rank and file of the party are pretty unanimous in their belief that he has the vision to rally the party together and take it forward.

""This is why most of us were keen for him to continue and stay on in this role after the elections, because while we respected his desire to publicly offer accountability for our defeat, we still felt that there is no one better to ensure the much needed process of revival that is needed for the party,"" he said.

At the end of the day, just as his resignation was a personal decision, the question of his return is one as well, he said.

Pitching for election of CWC members, Tharoor pointed out there are three categories of members -- elected members, permanent invitees and special invitees.

""All three are currently named by the high command, but I believe it would be healthy for the party if the 'elected members' were actually elected,"" he said.

Tharoor hoped that those who are currently against the idea of elections for CWC recognise that a participatory electoral process, which channels the wishes of the members of the AICC plus PCC delegates – some 10,000 workers in all – is an exercise in inner-party democracy that will strengthen the party.

It could also have other beneficial effects such as increasing the national interest in the party, he said.

Asked if Rahul Gandhi is not convinced on coming back as chief should Priyanka Gandhi Vadra take on the leadership role, Tharoor said he was neither for nor against any Congress leader who might want to put their name forward.

""I certainly hope that she will throw her name in the ring when the call for elections for the post of party president are officially declared,"" Tharoor said.

Priyanka Gandhi has a natural charisma and also comes with organisational experience, he said.

""But at the end of the day this will be her personal decision and we must respect that,"" he said.

Tharoor had backed Sandeep Dikshit last week in asserting that the leadership issue needs to be laid to rest immediately.

Sonia Gandhi was appointed as the interim Congress president in August last year after Rahul Gandhi resigned taking moral responsibility for the party's Lok Sabha poll debacle.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/growing-perception-that-cong--adrift---party-must-resolve-leadership-issue-for-revival--tharoor-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/growing-perception-that-cong--adrift---party-must-resolve-leadership-issue-for-revival--tharoor.html
170,23-2-20,Uncertainty about Modi joining Trump’s Taj trip,"Just a couple of days before US President Donald Trump’s visit to India, confusion prevails over whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will accompany the Trumps during their visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra on Monday. Contrary versions emerged from the Indian and American sides on Saturday with sources in New Delhi saying Modi accompanying the Trump family to Agra is unlikely and reports attributing US officials stating otherwise.

The Government sources said Modi will not accompany the US President and First Lady Melania Trump to see the Taj Mahal in Agra.

The US President, his wife, daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner along with a large US delegation, are coming to India on a two-day visit on Monday.

The Indian side’s reaction came after a senior US administration official, during a conference call with journalists, said, “The President will arrive in India, in Ahmedabad... The President and the First Lady will then go with Prime Minister Modi to visit the Taj, in Agra. They will then fly to New Delhi and rest overnight in New Delhi, and have a full program on Tuesday.”

Denying this, sources said here, “We have seen media reports regarding PM Modi’s presence in Agra in connection with the visit of President Trump. The visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra by the US President and the First Lady will afford them the opportunity to view the historical monument suitably. Therefore, no official engagements or presence of senior dignitaries from the Indian side is envisaged there.”

Modi will be with Trump in Ahmedabad, where a public reception will be accorded to Trump and the US First Lady on February 24, and in the Delhi leg of the visit where official engagements are envisaged on February 25,” they said. Modi and Trump will go on a roadshow to the world’s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad’s Motera.

Among the many welcome gestures for the guests, a ‘Trump platter,’ comprising signature dishes from ITC Maurya’s restaurant Bukhara here with a little customisation, is likely to be laid out for the visiting dignitary, sources said. The Bukhara restaurant, which has hosted several heads of States, including former US presidents, has not altered its menu for the last 41 years.

Like his predecessors, Trump is likely to dine at the iconic restaurant. It will be customised according to his taste, they said. The hotel, however, has not revealed anything about the arrangements made for Trump, including the food.

Barack Obama had visited India twice in 2010 and 2015 as the President and he was served the ‘Obama platter’. Since then, the dish has become a part of the menu and is also very popular among the guests. The Obama platter consists of tandoori jhinga, machhli tikka, murg boti Bukhara and kebabs.

When Bill Clinton had visited Bukhara as the president, the hotel had introduced “Clinton platter” and “Chelsea platter.” Bukhara’s dishes are mainly tandoor-based and has an assortment of kebabs, the signature ‘Dal Bukhara’ and breads like ‘Khasta Roti’, ‘Bharwan Kulcha’.

Trump is also likely to be gifted an apron with a painting of MF Husain. Legend has it that Husain was so impressed with Bukhara that he painted his trademark horse on his canvas while having food at the restaurant.

Puja to play vaishno devi

Star Bharat’s mythological show Jag Jaanani Maa Vaishno Devi — Kahani Mata Rani Ki has mesmerised audiences with its amazing story and star cast. Recently, the show has completed 100 episodes. But a big twist is coming in the story of this show. Maisha Dixit, who played the younger Vaishno Devi in the show, left no stone unturned to win the audience with her spectacular performance. The show is set to take a leap and it is going to excite the audience with it more twist and turns. Puja Banerjee will enter the show after the leap where she will be playing the role of elder Vaishno Devi in the show. We will get to see elder Vaishno Devi who will be more powerful and beautiful.

Let me tell you that many popular actresses were being considered for the role of elder Vaishno Devi, for which talented and famous actresses like Diana Khan, Niyati Fatani, Samiksha Jaiswal and Anushka Sen were approached. Finally, actress Puja Banerjee was finalised for the role. Its shooting will also start from next week. The leap will be aired on the Star Bharat channel from the first week of March.

When spoken to the actor Puja Banerjee said that: “It is a great pleasure for me to be selected for this role. Along with this, many of my old memories have also been refreshed as I had done a mytho show with this channel earlier. The previous role in mytho got me a lot of appreciation from the audience. I wish that history would be repeated again through this show. I hope the audience shower the same love.”

Recreating b-town’s iconic jodi

Commitment and dedication are the keys to success & nobody knows it better than the budding talents of Rajshri Productions, Anagha Bhosale, and Ankit Raizada. The actors have been winning the hearts of the viewers with their performance as Shraddha and Shlok in Star Plus’ Dadi Amma…Dadi Amma Maan Jao & are pulling out all stops to get their on-screen avatars right.

Recently, the actors had to re-create the iconic and blockbuster jodi — Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit’s chartbuster song on the show and we couldn’t take our eyes off them from the few glimpses that we had a chance to see. Taking inspiration from Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit’s styling to shaking their legs and imitating the signature steps, the actors did it all!

Commenting on recreating the song, Anagha shares: “It is a dream come true feeling for me. Madhuri Dixit has been my biggest inspiration. Getting to perform on her song and wearing the exact clothes had taken me to cloud nine! Moreover, we had a very hectic schedule so I had to rehearse the song within a span of 30 minutes and it was quite challenging. I watched the video of the original song several times to gauge Madhuriji’s expressions and ensured I focused on getting those right while I was shooting for the song.”

Adding further, Ankit Raizada shared: “It is literally a different kind of feeling for me as Hum Apke Hai Kaun is one of my favorite movies. Additionally, working for the same production, wearing the same clothes and shaking a leg on my biggest inspiration Salman Khan's song Didi Tera Dewar was unbelievable for me. Although I know I cannot match up to his persona and talent, from my side it’s a small tribute to my style icon.”

Well, we can’t wait to watch the duo’s outstanding performance on-screen!

Varun shares weight loss mantra

It’s true when they say size does not matter, but fitness does for sure! This has been proved by none other than Television’s senior actor, Varun Badola, who has been adored by the audiences for his depiction of Amber Sharma in Sona Entertainment Television’s show, Mere Dad Ki Dulhan. As we all know that Varun was asked to gain 12 kgs for his character, he is also sizing down as his character shifts from a grumpy dad to an ideal partner.

As he works towards his goal of a fit middle-aged man, Varun shares his weight loss and fitness secrets! Following the path of intermittent diet, Varun Badola eats only twice a day without giving up on his favourite yet healthy food. Sharing his weight loss mantra, Varun says: “It’s not easy to follow the intermittent fasting, while the rest of the world follows a particular meal time, I have my first meal of the day at 12 pm which is a mix of everything! Between 12 pm to 8 pm I can have a balanced meal and as much as I want. But from 8 pm to 12 pm I can’t have anything. It works very well with my shoot schedule. I work out rigorously over the weekend. This has helped me lose a lot of weight in the past one and a half months. And right now it’s the ask of the character.”

Along with intermittent fasting, Varun is also working out in the gym whenever he gets the time.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tellytale-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/tellytale-tellytale-2020-02-23.html
172,23-2-20,Obesity at younger age? Bariatric surgery may help,"Researchers have found that surgical treatment of obesity is as effective for individuals who developed the disorder early, by the age of 20, as for those who have developed obesity later in life.

The results, published in the journal Diabetes Care, are based on data from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study.

For the fndings, the researchers covered a total of 4,026 adult individuals who had developed obesity. Half of them had undergone bariatric surgery and the other half were a control group.

""We were somewhat surprised at the results. Since the group that had already developed obesity by the age of 20 had been exposed to obesity and its risks for longer periods, we'd expected that bariatric surgical treatment in these participants would be less effective in terms of weight loss and obesity-related sequelae than in the other group. But it wasn't like that,"" said study researcher Johanna Andersson Assarsson from University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

Each of the groups was divided into three subgroups, based on the participants' body mass index (BMI) at age 20: those of normal weight, those who were overweight, and those with obesity.

The researchers then investigated whether there was any difference in the effects of bariatric treatment for obesity among those who had developed the disorder before age 20, compared with those who developed it later in life.

""On the contrary, the group with obesity at age 20 lost a little bit more weight after the operation, and there was no difference in effects on diabetes or its complications, cardiovascular disease or cancer, compared with individuals who developed obesity later in life,"" Assarsson said.

According to the researchers, for many diseases, early treatment is advantageous, but individuals with early-onset obesity have often had their disorder for a long time before bariatric surgery is considered.

It has sometimes been speculated that bariatric surgical treatment would be less effective in these individuals because of their longer exposure to the adverse health effects of obesity.

""Here, we show that's not the case. And we think it's important that this information reaches people considering bariatric surgery for obesity and also health professionals who treat patients with obesity,"" Assarsson said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/obesity-at-younger-age--bariatric-surgery-may-help-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/obesity-at-younger-age--bariatric-surgery-may-help.html
173,23-2-20,Macron says 'not sure' EU-UK trade deal possible before end of 2020,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said he was ""not sure"" it would be possible for the European Union and Britain to reach a trade deal by the end of the year.

Britain and the EU are about to embark on negotiations aiming to hammer out a trade agreement by the time the post-Brexit transition period shuts at the end of December.

But France has made clear it thinks the negotiations will be particularly difficult, especially in such a tight timeframe.

""I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,"" Macron said at a meeting with fishermen, who are concerned for their livelihoods after Brexit, at an agricultrual trade event in Paris.

""Anyway, it is going to become more tense because (the British) are very hard,"" he said, adding that fishing rights would be a key point of contention.

Britain formally ended its 47-year membership of the EU on January 31, nearly four years after a majority voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum.

France and several other countries want to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while London wants full autonomy and limited access for European fishermen.

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU's top priorities are fishing, security and maintaining fair trading conditions for European companies.

He has also firmly rejected a British suggestion that City of London companies could be given broad, permanent access to EU markets without conditions.

Overall, French fishing boats generate 30 percent of their revenue from catches in British maritime territories, particularly rich in fish stocks.

French officials say that the UK exports the bulk of its catch to Europe, indicating that British fishermen have plenty to lose if the two sides fail to reach a deal.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/macron-says--not-sure--eu-uk-trade-deal-possible-before-end-of-2020-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/macron-says--not-sure--eu-uk-trade-deal-possible-before-end-of-2020.html
174,23-2-20,Bernie Sanders wins Nevada Democratic Caucus,"US Senator Bernie Sanders on Sunday secured a convincing victory in the crucial Nevada caucus, giving a big boost to his campaign for the 2020 White House bid as the race to Democratic party's nomination gathers momentum over the next few months.

Multiple American media outlets declared Sanders as the winner of the Nevada Caucus for the Democratic Party's presidential primary.

The 78-year-old senator from Vermont had 54 per cent of the county delegates available when several national news networks, including Fox news and MSNBC, called the race with only four per cent of precincts reporting.

When last reports came in, Sanders had garnered more than half of the votes, with former vice president Joe Biden trailing at 19 per cent.

""Breaking: We won Nevada! We are building an unprecedented grassroots movement, and together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,"" Sanders tweeted.

Sanders, who lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries in New Hampshire, had won the New Hampshire primary recently and was in a virtual tie with underdog Pete Buttigieg in Iowa.

Trump congratulated Sanders in a tweet.

""Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden and the rest look weak, and no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential debates,"" the president tweeted.

""Congratulations Bernie, and don't let them take it away from you!"" Trump tweeted.

""We did it! We won the Nevada caucus, and we won BIG!"" said Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Sanders.

""This win is our win, in large part because of the record number of donations and volunteer enthusiasm for Bernie in the state,"" he said.

Nevada is the first state with a diverse population to hold a nominating contest.

""In Nevada, and in New Hampshire and in Iowa - what we showed is that our volunteers are prepared to knock on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doors,"" Sanders was quoted as saying by CNN in San Antonio.

""That no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason why we're going to win this election.""

""Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election,"" Sanders continued. ""They think they're going to win this election by dividing our people up, based on the colour of their skin, or where they were born, or their religion or their sexual orientation. We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite. We're bringing our people together.""

176,23-2-20,"WHO team visits Wuhan city as China's coronovirus death toll jumps to 2,442","Ninety-seven more people died in China due to coronavirus, taking the death toll to 2,442, officials said on Sunday, as a team of WHO experts visited the worst-affected Wuhan city in Hubei province.

By the end of Saturday, a total of 2,442 people had died of the disease and 76,936 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily update on Sunday.

Ninety-six deaths were reported from Hubei province and one from Guangdong province on Saturday besides 648 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, it said.

Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December last, reported 630 new confirmed cases, taking the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 64,084, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The NHC also said China's daily number of newly cured and discharged novel coronavirus patients has surpassed that of new confirmed infections for the fifth consecutive day, indicating that cases of infections are coming down.

Saturday saw 2,230 people walk out of hospital after recovery, much higher than the number of the same day's new confirmed infections, which was 648, Xinhua reported.

A total of 22,888 patients infected with the novel coronavirus had been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Saturday, NHC said.

Meanwhile, a team of public health experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) visited Wuhan on Saturday to conduct a detailed probe about the virus which reportedly originated from a seafood market in the city in December last year.

The NHC said WHO experts along with their Chinese counterparts who formed a joint investigation team have held talks with the local health authority in Wuhan and visited relevant healthcare institutions.

The UN team comprises specialists from the United States, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore and South Korea, Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post reported.

The 12-member team, which arrived in China on Monday, was initially designated to visit only Beijing, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, while the worst-affected Hubei province and its capital Wuhan were missing from the list.

However, the team was finally given permission to visit Wuhan by the Chinese government.

Besides controlling the spread of the virus, a major task for the WHO team along with their Chinese counterparts was to come up with standard medicine to cure the disease.

The NHC said on Saturday that the team had met top Chinese respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan in Guangdong, and visited the centre for disease control and prevention in Guangdong and the city of Shenzhen, and Sichuan.

The specialists also discussed quarantine measures, the wild animal trade and community prevention measures with their Chinese counterparts, it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-team-visits-wuhan-city-as-china-s-coronovirus-death-toll-jumps-to-2-442-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/who-team-visits-wuhan-city-as-china-s-coronovirus-death-toll-jumps-to-2-442.html
177,23-2-20,"South Korea virus cases spike, as Italy and Iran take drastic steps","South Korea reported a sharp jump in coronavirus cases on Sunday, while Italy and Iran took drastic containment steps as worldwide fears over the epidemic spiralled higher.

The contagion's spread prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to warn that Africa's unprepared health systems left the continent vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease, which spilled out of China and has infected more than 77,000 people in more than 25 countries.

Already one of the worst-hit nations outside of China, South Korea reported 123 new cases Sunday, taking its fast-rising total to 556. Its death toll also rose to four with two additional fatalities.

The higher toll came a day after Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the nation of around 51 million people faced a ""grave"" situation.

The Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southern city of Daegu -- considered by many a cult -- has emerged as a hotbed of contagion, with hundreds of members infected.

Prime Minister Chung called on Koreans to refrain from attending large gatherings including religious services.

Other South Korean cases involved many under hospital treatment for mental health issues, an employee with electronics giant Samsung, and eight people who just returned from a trip to Israel.

Italy and Iran began introducing the sort of containment measures previously seen only in China, which has put tens of millions of people under quarantine lockdown in the epicentre province of Hubei.

More than 50,000 people in about a dozen northern Italian towns near the business hub of Milan were urged by authorities to stay home, shuttering shops and schools.

Among dozens of cases, Italy on Friday became the first European country to report one of its nationals had died from the virus -- a 78-year-old retired bricklayer in the region of Veneto.

That was followed Saturday by the death of a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government was weighing ""extraordinary measures"" to halt further infections.

Officials said all patients in Lombardy were linked to a 38-year-old man in intensive care in the town of Codogno, whom Italian media say dined in January with a friend who had returned from China.

The friend has since tested negative, however, illustrating mounting frustration among authorities worldwide over exactly how the virus spreads and the duration of its incubation period.

China reported another 97 deaths in its daily update on Sunday, taking its total to 2,442, plus another 648 new infections. Nearly 80,000 infections have been reported worldwide.

China's infection rate has slowed sharply from earlier in the epidemic, but repeated Chinese flip-flopping over counting methods has sowed confusion over its data.

Iran ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 provinces from Sunday following five deaths in the Islamic Republic -- the most outside East Asia and the first in the Middle East.

Iran's outbreak surfaced on Wednesday and has quickly worsened with 28 cases confirmed.

""The concern is... That we have seen ... A very rapid increase (in Iran) in a matter of a few days,"" said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness department.

Iran's government also ordered all ""art and cinema events"" nationwide cancelled until the end of the coming week.

Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from Iran, and flag carrier Kuwait Airways has suspended flights to the country.

Although Egypt is the only African country with a confirmed case of COVID-19, the WHO warned that the continent's health systems were ill-equipped to cope with a potential major outbreak and urged more cooperation among the African Union.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said necessary treatment tools such as respiratory support machines are ""in short supply in many African countries and that's a cause for concern"".

The US State Department said global anxiety was being stoked by a coordinated effort by thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts to spread conspiracy theories that the outbreak was a US-orchestrate ploy to damage China, officials said.

Russia's foreign ministry dismissed the allegation as ""deliberately false"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/south-korea-virus-cases-spike--as-italy-and-iran-take-drastic-steps-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/south-korea-virus-cases-spike--as-italy-and-iran-take-drastic-steps.html
178,23-2-20,"Modi is versatile genius, says Justice Arun Mishra","Supreme Court judge Justice Arun Mishra on Saturday was all praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and termed him as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” and a “versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally”.

Complimenting the PM and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for doing away with 1,500 obsolete laws, Justice Mishra said India is a responsible and most friendly member of the international community under the “stewardship” of Modi.

Delivering the vote of thanks at the inaugural function of the International Judicial Conference 2020 — “Judiciary and the Changing World” at the SC, he said “We thank the versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally, Shri Narendra Modi, for his inspiring speech which would act as a catalyst in initiating the deliberations and setting the agenda for the conference.”

Justice Mishra, who is third in seniority in the apex court, expressed gratitude to the PM for inaugurating the conference.

He said India is the biggest democracy in the world and “people wonder how this democracy is functioning so successfully”.

“India is a responsible and most friendly member of the international community under the stewardship of internationally acclaimed visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,” he said.

“India is committed to constitutional obligations and dedicated to a peaceful and secure world, free from terrorism. In the process of development, preservation of environment is considered supreme,” he said.

Justice Mishra emphasised on the need to strengthen the judicial system saying, “Now we are in the 21st century. We are looking for modern infrastructure not only for the present but also for future.

“To strengthen judicial system is the call of the day as it is the backbone of democracy whereas legislature is the heart and executive is the brain. All these three organs of the state have to work independently but in tandem to make democracy successful...”.

Referring to globalisation, he said, “but there is growing concern among masses of being left out and deprived of the gains of globalisation”.

“The sense of injustice and inequality being created by the same looms large on us,” he said, adding, “It has to be taken care of by all of us alike before it becomes lethal like coronavirus”.

He also referred to the contribution of an independent and robust bar and said there is no denying the fact that “bar is the mother of judiciary”.

Judges from over 20 countries are attending the conference here.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/modi-is-versatile-genius--says-justice-arun-mishra-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/modi-is-versatile-genius--says-justice-arun-mishra.html

180,23-2-20,Trump says looking forward to being with 'my great friends' in India,"President Donald Trump has said that he was looking forward to being with his ""great friends"" in India as he retweeted a video in which his face was superimposed on the hit movie-character Bahubali, showing him as a great saviour.

Trump will arrive in India on Monday on a two-day visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation including First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and a galaxy of top American officials.

""Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!"" Trump tweeted on Saturday.

Along with the tweet, Trump shared an 81-second video by a Twitter account identified as ""Sol"" with the handle Solmemes1.

""To celebrate Trump's visit to India I wanted to make a video to show how in my warped mind it will go... USA and India united!"" the handle Solmemes1 tweeted in the original post with the video.

Trump appears as a great saviour, in the short animated clip, riding on a chariot with First Lady Melania. A few stills later, Trump is seen riding a horse carrying on his soldiers his son Donald Junior and daughter Ivanka.

Later, he is welcomed by Prime Minister Modi in a village setting. Hundreds and thousands of people are seen welcoming Trump in the video.

""This week Trump will visit India and in celebration I have created a new meme for the occasion... You few, who are my patrons, get to see it first!"" Sol told viewers on subscription content service Patreon on Saturday.

A few hours later, Trump retweeted the video.

In the Twitter description, Sol describes herself as ""award winning master memetician, professor of memology at University of GFY, my views are my own and not associated with real life.""

The video, which ends with ""USA and India United"", went viral after Trump retweeted it. In a few hours, it was seen by more than ten lakh people.

Sol in one of her previous posts, dated January 23, writes she was inspired by a video of Bahubali sent to her by a friend, which is the story of 'good defeating evil.'

This inspired Sol to create her first Bahubali-theme meme. The video is titled ""Jiyo Re Baahu Trump"", in which the First Lady is seen wearing a saree. ""Jiyo Re Bahubali,"" is the theme song of the video.

Sol's posts show she is an admirer of the President and the First Lady.

Her January 23 video was released at the peak of Trump's impeachment proceedings. In the video, Trump is seen being greeted by an elephant, who bears the logo of the Republican Party.

Towards the end of the video, Trump is seen riding the elephant, and putting on fire the effigy of ""Raavan"" marked as ""D"" in a big circle representing the opposition Democratic Party.

An arrow is given by warrior Modi to the First Lady, who then passes it on to Trump, before he lights the effigy.

Trump's visit to India provides an opportunity for the two countries to improve their bilateral relationship and strengthen strategic interests, say senior officials.

After Barack Obama, Trump is the only other US President to visit India in his first term.

Issues expected to be discussed during the visit include an open Indo-Pacific, reduced trade barriers, boost to counter-terror cooperation and mitigating Indian concerns over H-1B visas.

""President Trump has been the best friend of India amongst all US Presidents. He loves Indians and Indian-Americans. Indian Americans nationwide love him as much,"" Al Mason, advisor to Global Real Estate Investments, Education Institutions and Hospitals, told PTI.

""How else do you explain 60,000 Indian-Americans attending his 'Howdy, Modi!' rally with Prime Minister Modi in Houston, not to overlook the fact that billion-plus Indians in India love President Trump too,"" he said, referring to Trump and Modi sharing the stage in September in Houston at a massive rally of Indian-Americans called ""Howdy, Modi!"".

Modi and Trump are set to share the stage on Monday for ""Namaste Trump,"" event which roughly translates as “Hello Trump"" in Ahmedabad.

The president, who arrived at the White House following four days of hectic political campaigning in the western parts of the country, had no public engagements on Saturday.

Rated: 7.5/10

A movie on gay relationships? Most people would baulk at even thinking about going to a film that talks about LGBTQI community let alone watch two men kiss each other not once but twice. Even though the Government has decriminalised homosexuality by declaring Section 377 IPC as unconstitutional, the society has yet to come to terms with the love same sex. In their mind, it is not normal love.

But like Ayushmann Khurana, who plays Kartik, in the movie rightly said: What is normal? We have grown up on a diet to love stories that talk about love between a man and a woman. We have grown up rote learning Jack and Jill poem. Why did the poem not talk about Jack and Johnny? This is the question that we should all be asking ourselves. Fifty years back, nobody would have thought that there would be a device that allowed wireless communication. But here we are, totally dependent on our smartphones. This is our normal today. People love their cat/dog. They leave properties to them. We call them crazy but do we shun them? Why can’t love between same sex people be normal and why can’t families accept it?

Like Khurrana’s character rightly says: Roz hume ladaayi ladni padti hai zindagi mein par jo ladaayi parivaar ke saath hoti hai woh saari ladaayi sabse badi aur khatarnaak hoti hai.

Shubh Mangal... touches a cord that plus a cord like no other because it is one of the best love stories that Bollywood has made in the recent past, the last being Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani back in 2013. If only the director, Hitesh Kewalya, had released this film on Valentine’s Day because the movie is less about homosexuality and homophobia and more about how two people who are in love should stay together rather be caught in a loveless marriage.

The banter and funny dialogues between Gajrao Rao (Shankar Tripathi) and Neena Gupta, his onscreen wife – Sunaina, among the family members, between Rao and Kartik is what makes Shubh Mangal… such a delight. What is even cuter and sweeter are the detailing that has gone into Khurrana’s character. It is absolutely impossible to miss the nose ring, the pink dupatta and the cape he wears while proclaiming from the roof top that Shankar Tripathi is a homophobic.

Then there are the brilliant performances by the actors. Khurrana has once again proved that is a great actor. His demeanor and expressions are bang on and such a delight to watch. He is the life and soul of this movie. Then there is Jitendra Kumar who plays Aman Tripathi, Kartik’s partner who compliments Khurrana. A special mention here for Rao, Gupta, Manurishi Chaddha and even Maanvi Gagroo. While Khurrana helms the movie, the rest of the starcast do their best and make this such a delightfully cute love story.

However, if you are a homophobic, stay away!",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delightfully-cute-love-story-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/delightfully-cute-love-story.html
182,23-2-20,This is a sinking ship,"Bhoot part one: The haunted ship

*ing: Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, Ashutosh Rana

Rated: 3/10

There are a few genres on which Bollywood should never attempt to make movies. First, of course is comedy. Vir Das has rightly said: Indians have not learnt the art of laughing at themselves. Second, and Bhoot: The Haunted Ship, falls under this category is horror. There was a time when Bollywood had some incredible horror movies to its name like Mahal and Bees Saal Baad. Then came the era of Ramsay Brothers. While these movies had the bhoot, it lacked the scare factor. Not the spine-chilling expression of teenage Damien in Omen.

One has to understand that everything that goes bump at night and strange clanking noise doesn’t constitute horror. That is what ails this latest ghost movie. Bhanu Pratap Singh may have used a ghost ship to tell his story that already has a history of haunting and the entire crew mysteriously committing suicide, the creepy looking ghost or the victim it has possessed and kept with it for more than 10 years is more on the lines that the bhoot needs psychiatric treatment rather then be exorcised.

While Vicky Kaushal may be the only saving grace of this sinking ship, the fact remains why he chose to do this film in the first place given that the storyline and the script of this film is not a patch on the kind of movies Kaushal has picked up in the recent past like Uri and Manmarziyaan. Sad that Ashutosh Rana who has been in the industry for more than two decades would say yes to this project.

There are several lose ends at the climax. If the director was looking at a Bahubali: The Beginning kind of end, he failed miserably.

Only see this one if you are a horror film fan.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/this-is-a-sinking-ship-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/this-is-a-sinking-ship.html

184,23-2-20,‘Need to have more real stories’,"From playing Vishnu to Krishna to Akbar and now a chef, SOURABH RAJ JAIN has donned several hats. He speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about what made him take up the latest role and his favourite pastime, among other things

What made you say yes to the role?

The character, the storyline of course, the concept of the show, and the backstory that my character had intrigued me the most. It was also after my meeting with the producers of the show Rajita Sharma and Vivek Budakoti who are also writers of the show, that I was thoroughly convinced to take it up.

Any similarities that you share with your character?

The one similarity that I share with Neil Oberoi is being passionate about whatever I take up in my field. While Neil is a very passionate cook, I am in real life passionate about my acting and whatever I showcase on screen. So that way, my character and I are very similar when it comes to our careers.

What should the audience look forward to in the show?

I am showcasing myself in a different genre after very long, so that is something the audiences should definitely look forward to. Other than that the backstory that my character has been unveiling through the course of the show has been very interesting, and something that the audiences too would like to know more about.

From Remix to Patiala Babes, how has your journey been?

The journey has been overwhelming, amazing and one that I am extremely proud about. Through the years I have got to experiment with so many different genres, roles and concepts, and as an actor there is nothing better that I could have asked for!

You have explored different genres and have done variety of roles. How did the transition happen?

Experimentation of course! Because as an actor if you don’t experiment with and try out new genres and mediums, you are never going to grow or learn. And for me being diverse with my skills in such a field is extremely important.

What was the most challenging role?

I have done so many roles in the years gone by and to be honest all of them have been challenging. Every role demands a different side of me, so each of them has actually had me experience a different challenge altogether.

A change that you would like to see in the industry for actors or other working professionals?

I feel that our industry needs to open doors to more real concepts and storylines, specially with the youth of today who are always looking out for new things to watch. There has to be a certain section content which caters to them, as they are our biggest critics and the bright future of tomorrow.

Apart from acting what else keeps you busy?

Spending quality time at home with my family is something I always look forward to post shoot.

Upcoming projects?

As of now I am very caught up with Patiala Babes, so that’s the only thing I am working on at the moment.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---need-to-have-more-real-stories----2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---need-to-have-more-real-stories---.html

186,23-2-20,"Agarwal's half-century takes India to 78/2 at tea, still trail by 105 runs","Mayank Agarwal reached his half-century but Cheteshwar Pujara paid the price for his ultra-defensive batting as India reached 78 for 2 at tea on the third day of the first Test against New Zealand here on Sunday.

This was after New Zealand lower-order gave the hosts a commanding 183-run lead in the first innings.

India are still trailing by 105 runs after New Zealand scored 348 in their first innings.

India lost Prithvi Shaw's (14) wicket in the second session as Agarwal (52 batting, 81 balls) and Pujara (11 off 81 balls) added 51 runs for the second wicket.

However, Pujara's negative batting did have its impact as it caused an error of judgement while shouldering arms to an incoming delivery from Trent Boult (2/17 in 10 overs).

Shaw's poor technique was once again exposed as Boult got one to rear up and the opener fended it awkwardly with a closed bat face and the ball ballooned up to short square leg where Tom Latham took a diving catch.

Agarwal showed positive intent hitting six boundaries and a six over long-off off Ajaz Patel's bowling.

Pujara, at the other end, defended well leaving a lot of deliveries on length and ducking the bouncers. He was stuck on 6 for 28 balls before a couple of runs helped him break the shackles.

There was a strong appeal for caught behind to a short ball bowled by Kyle Jamieson. Pujara was batting on 3 but the third umpire upheld the decision of on-field official Richard Kettleborough after TV replays showed that the ball brushed his arm guard.

In the first session, debutant Jamieson continued with his dream debut as he and No. 11 Boult belted the Indian bowlers for fun and stretched their lead above 175-run mark.

Ishant Sharma (5/68 in 22.2 overs) remained the stand-out bowler for India. Ravichandran Ashwin (3/99) also got a couple of wickets in the morning but not before getting a bit lot of stick from the tail-enders, who were in the lookout for quick runs.

Jamieson's 45-ball knock had four towering sixes. He added 71 runs for the eighth wicket with Colin de Grandhomme (43 off 74 balls) in just under 15 overs.

Boult (38 off 24 balls) had some real fun in the end and by that time, the shoulders of the Indian attack had already dropped as they were able to read the writing on the wall.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/agarwal-s-half-century-takes-india-to-78-2-at-tea--still-trail-by-105-runs-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/agarwal-s-half-century-takes-india-to-78-2-at-tea--still-trail-by-105-runs.html
187,23-2-20,India look down the barrel after another top-order flop show,"The Indian batsmen, caught between over-cautiousness and impetuosity, produced yet another inept batting performance to put New Zealand firmly on the driver's seat at the end of third day's play in the first Test here on Sunday.

At stumps, India reached 144 for 4 in their second innings as the top-order found Trent Boult's (3/27 in 16 overs) high-quality swing bowling too hot to handle.

India now trail New Zealand by 39 runs going into fourth day, which could well be the final day of this game unless Ajinkya Rahane (25 batting, 67 balls) and Hanuma Vihari (15 batting, 70 balls) show the art of survival that was distinctly lacking in some of the other top-order batsmen.

After New Zealand's tail wagged big time to post a good first innings total of 348, the deficit of 183 understandably put India under severe pressure.

If Cheteshwar Pujara (11 off 81 balls) paid for his ultra-defensive mindset shouldering arms to an indipper, skipper Virat Kohli's (19 off 43 balls) split second indiscretion became his undoing as he went for a needless pull-shot to a well-disguised short ball.

Mayank Agarwal (58 off 99 balls) was impressive in one session and lost concentration in the second, ditto to what happened on the first day and was caught down the leg-side.

The bowler on both the occasion was Boult, who successfully took over the job of tormenting the Indian batsmen from Tim Southee (1/41 in 15 overs) and Kyle Jamieson (0/33 in 17 overs). It was a top-class seam and swing bowling show on a third day pitch, which still had something for fast bowlers.

Boult bowled with a lot of fire as he exposed Prithvi Shaw's (14 off 30 balls) poor technique, laying a trap for the opener.

A short ball hurried the flamboyant Mumbaikar, whose huge back-lift became his undoing. By the time the ball grew big on him, he was fending it awkwardly with a closed bat and at the short square-leg Tom Latham was waiting gleefully for that chance.

It was pretty similar to his dismissal to Scott Kugggeleijn in the warm-up game, the only difference being the pace of the short ball which was a tad quicker then.

Pujara and Agarwal did add 51 runs for the second wicket but it was largely because of the Karnataka opener, who played his shots and showed positive intent. He, in fact, hit Ajaz Patel for a six and a four but Pujara at the other end only looked keen on defending.

Just like first innings, Pujara was leaving balls on length but at one stage, he was stuck on personal score of 6 for 28 consecutive balls. While leaving Jamieson from length wasn't an issue, Pujara didn't account for Boult, shouldering arms a delivery that came in sharply.

In the first session, Kyle Jamieson continued with his dream debut as he and No 11 Trent Boult belted the Indian bowlers for fun to stretch New Zealand's lead above 175-run mark.

Ishant Sharma (5/68 in 22.2 overs) remained the stand-out bowler for India. Ravichandran Ashwin (3/99) also got a couple of wickets in the morning but not before getting a bit lot of stick from the tail-enders who were in the lookout for quick runs.

189,23-2-20,"Shaheen Bagh blows hot & cold, one road opened","A stretch of Shaheen Bagh Road Number 9, from Abul Fazal Enclave to Kalindi Kunj Junction, was opened by a section of the anti-CAA protesters on Saturday. It was one of the roads closed since December 15 when the anti-CAA protest began.

“A section of the protesters opened the stretch that joins Abu Fazal Enclave to Kalindi Kunj Junction but after a few minutes, it was closed again by another group. Subsequently, the stretch was opened again by the protesters and it remains open,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East) RP Meena said.

The opneing of Kalindi Kunj road number 9 will made it easy for commuters to ply to and from from Noida, said residents. However, the Delhi Police and the Noida Police were continuing to barricade it from one side. The development came after three days of talks between the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors — senior advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran — and the protesters over the issue of difficulty to commuters due to blocking of roads.

According to the police, the protesters briefly opened a small portion of a road leading to Kalindi Kunj so that locals can pass through it with their two wheelers.

The Noida Traffic Police, however, also continued the restrictions on the Uttar Pradesh side of the road, an official told PTI.

“It was being alleged repeatedly that the protestors have blocked the Kalindi Kunj road, which leads to Noida Sector 37. So, today it was decided that this allegation has to be done away with and the route was opened,” Sonu Warsi, a protestor, said. “The decision was also taken to give a gift to the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors, whose interaction and mediation has helped reopen the case. We have opened the road and it is now up to the Delhi Police and UP police to decide which vehicles they will allow,” he added.

After the talks on Friday, Hegde had said the protesters, in principle, were not fundamentally against opening of the non-protest side of the road if their security could be guaranteed in writing by the Delhi Police under suitable orders of the apex court.

“We will not be holding a public interaction tomorrow to enable the protesters to come to an independent conclusion as to the way forward. We will return on Sunday only if we deem it necessary and feasible to do so,” he had said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-blows-hot---cold--one-road-opened-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/shaheen-bagh-blows-hot---cold--one-road-opened.html
190,23-2-20,Pavail Gulati: 'Thappad' is a risky role for me,"Actor Pavail Gulati gets his big Bollywood break as Taapsee Pannu's on-screen husband in Anubhav Sinha's upcoming film ""Thappad"", and he says that working with the maker helped him to gain confidence as an actor.

""Anubhav (Sinha) sir allows actors to make mistakes and give inputs in the creative process. If I do something wrong, he won't humiliate me. I would say that it helped me to gain my confidence as an actor. Usually, sir does not cast any actor without auditioning but I am the lucky one who has been cast as one of the leads in his film! Initially, I was a little sceptical because he has that aura of a serious man,"" Pavail told IANS.

""He is a well-built, well-read man, and has made serious films like ‘Article 15' and ‘Mulk', and I thought what if he intimidates me? I was a little nervous. I have to say he is younger than me at heart!"" smiled the 21-year-old actor.

""Thappad"" features Taapsee Pannu and Pavail with Kumud Mishra, Ratna Pathak Shah, Tanvi Azmi, Dia Mirza, and Ram Kapoor, among others. The film, slated to release on February 28, revolves around a young married couple and how one day, when the wife is slapped by the husband in front of guests at a house party, the incident triggers off a chain reaction that lead to self-realisation for her, leading to her walking out of the marriage. Pavail is cast as the career-obsessed husband who misbehaves in public with his wife, essayed by Taapsee.

On taking up such a role with negative shades, he said: ""It was risky for me. People might just dislike me because I play a character who slaps a woman. But once I started reading the script, I realised that he is a victim of the situation too. This film shows both sides of the story, on why we often take our loved ones for granted and how social conditioning is responsible for our actions. It questions many age-old practices.""

Pavail says although we tend to associate domestic violence mostly with the lower class, that is not always the case. ""The fact is, when domestic violence happens in an educated family, keeping the ‘duniyadari' in mind, such families of the high society do not talk about it openly, as it is a taboo, and because they have to maintain the image of an ideal family. In lower economic strata, like everything else, they talk about domestic violence very openly. That is why we tend to think that the house help faces domestic violence and not any members of our family. But living in denial is not the solution,"" explained the actor, who was also recently appeared in the Netflix anthology ""Ghost Stories"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pavail-gulati---thappad--is-a-risky-role-for-me-2020-02-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/pavail-gulati---thappad--is-a-risky-role-for-me.html
