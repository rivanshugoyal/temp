0,01-3-20,Blindfold of Lady Justice,"Defining justice has never been easy as there is always an element of subjectivity in the concept. Understanding the idea of justice may be only a little less daunting than verifying the number of stars in our galaxy. If the latter ranges from 100 to 400 billion, the number of definitions of justice are only slightly less astronomical as they, too, range from 7 to 8 billion. Every individual has at least one definition of justice, depending on his or her experience and interpretation of that experience. Sometime, the same person can have a different idea in different situation. The one thing that can be said about the idea of justice is that it is continuously evolving. Naturally, the law must also change to keep pace with the changing connotations of justice. Law is the tool that the society has developed to dispense justice. However, the pace of change of law is not in tandem with the changing idea of justice. One case in point is the proposed change in the law to try minors as adults. It is only after the serious public outcry that a change in Juvenile Justice Law is being felt. It was always evident that heinous and serious crimes committed by technically Juvenile offenders needed to be treated as adult crimes. The rising number of cases involving juveniles in premeditated heinous crimes were alarming, hence the punishment needed to be the same as that given to an adult. However, there are many other issues involving the question of law, justice and fairness which need serious consideration. The one, and most rampant, issue is the act of instituting false criminal cases on innocent people to harass, intimidate or sometimes even force compliance for achieving wrong ends. The key issue in these cases is the over reliance on eye witnesses. Any person with criminal intent can find out two or three witnesses and file a case against any unsuspecting person in order to gain unlawful advantage. There is an ancient Indian village proverb saying that to settle scores don’t go for a civil suit or “Diwani”. Rather, go far a criminal case, which is termed “Faujdari”. The unfortunate part is that even in this technology driven 21st century the trick works. The courts are aware of this hard reality, but precious little has been achieved. It is time to make amends. For some five centuries the Lady Justice has been standing as a blind-folded statuette with a balance in one hand and sword in the other. It is time the blindfold is removed. The allegorical personification of the moral force in the judicial system needs a rethink as justice is being derailed by the unscrupulous who have the wherewithal. Justice can certainly be more impartial if Lady Justice can see the faces of evil with her own eyes. From King Solomon to Suddhodana to Vikramaditya to Ranjit Singh history has many examples. They relied more on wisdom, conscience and judgment rather than evidences of witnesses of doubtful virtue and were able to dispense justice. Atop the old Bailey Courthouse of London the Lady Justice stands without blindfold, perhaps to suggest this. The crowding at top courts is more due to motivated concoctions rather than any genuine grouse. Public opinion as John Galsworthy said is always in advance of law. Public is now feeling the pinch.

1,01-3-20,Delhi riots aimed to gain foreign media attention,"Now that the law and order situation in the troubled corner of Delhi has been brought under control, the process of recriminations and myth-making has begun. The latter is a more complicated phenomenon and will probably take years to unfold — depending on which of the breathless, gush-gush reporters who genuflected before the matrons of Shaheen Bagh is first off the mark with a quickie. In the old days, various grand-sounding bodies claiming to uphold civil liberties and democratic freedom usually published a report that would be flaunted as the authentic version of a political or natural disaster. But with video clips on social media telling the story, the appeal of ponderous reports blaming it all on a “fascist” conspiracy won’t enjoy too much popular traction.

Not that telling the people is ever a priority of those professional riot-watchers and ambulance chasers. The target audience isn’t Indian voters, it’s foreign governments and grant-awarding bodies in the West. The agenda is very different: to put India on the defensive in international fora and leverage this for both strategic and economic ends. This is not to suggest that the foreign media that often is highly selective and tendentious in its coverage is acting as pawns of foreign governments. It isn’t as straightforward as that. The Western Establishments are multi-layered and often operate with different and occasionally contradictory impulses. There is also an international fraternity of do-gooders who operate on their own steam, often bankrolled by the likes of George Soros whose agendas defy neat categorisation. The intersection of all these different impulses and motivations are tailor-made for everyone with either a grievance or a horror story to narrate.

The recriminations game is relatively less complex. Its perspectives are more immediate and explicitly partisan. The target this time is Home Minister Amit Shah. He is being blamed for two things. First, the failure to anticipate the disturbances and, secondly, the failure to bring matters under control immediately.

The criticism of Shah doesn’t stop here. There are also suggestions that the dharna in Shaheen Bagh should never have been allowed to continue for so long and fuel communal tensions in Delhi. The issue is worth exploring.

Assuming for a moment that the Delhi Police, already under attack for having over-used force against the students of Jamia Milia Islamia, had taken steps to clear the protesters in Shaheen Bagh at the very outset, what would have been the reactions. First, the entire Opposition and the liberal fraternity would have gone to town at the images of policemen and policewomen forcibly ejecting the elderly women who occupied the front rows of the protests. It would have been made out that the Government is utterly intolerant that it cannot countenance normal democratic protests, especially those conducted by Muslims. Perhaps this was the idea of the protests to begin with, which is why women were put in front.

In any event the Government did not oblige. What the BJP did instead was to try and isolate the protesters and build public opinion against Shaheen Bagh and the other copy-cat protests. These were also linked to the Delhi Assembly elections. They even paid electoral dividends but not sufficient to upstage the governance dividend that accrued to Arvind Kejriwal. In any event, the matter then came up before the Supreme Court which attempted to tackle the issue of civic inconvenience with kid gloves. It would seem that the apex court too was mindful that forcible ejection, without at least a show of patience and flexibility, would look bad.

Where the Home Ministry and the Delhi Police can be faulted is in not anticipating that the Muslim protests would definitely escalate and acquire an additional dimension to coincide with the visit of President Donald Trump. The presence of a large contingent of American media was always going to be an incentive for the protesters to showcase their opposition to Modi. In the event, the reaction of the authorities to the new blockade in Jafrabad, in the vicinity of the Muslim ghetto of Seelampur, was inadequate.

However, to be fair, the police response was never going to be adequate. The protesters in that corner of Delhi had come very well prepared for a war. They were certainly in a mood to confront the police but also to escalate the conflict into a communal riot. They wanted to combine aggression and victimhood — and achieved their twin objectives. They got the foreign media to paint the riots in exactly the way they wanted — as an example of the state and Hindu nationalists targeting Muslims — and managed to gloss over the fact that they were intent on a riot to begin with.

The death toll from the Delhi riots, having crossed 40 at last count, is unacceptably high. I guess if Trump wasn’t visiting, the police action would have been more targeted and decisive. But that is the reality and the lessons from the Delhi riots must be internalised by the Government.

However, there is a larger question that still has no firm answers. What will be the political consequences of the Delhi riot be on both Hindu and Muslim mobilisation around the CAA? There is some evidence to suggest increased Hindu determination. There is also some evidence to suggest ordinary Muslims realise that the community overplayed its hand and triggered a backlash. Unfortunately, a study of communal riots in the recent past suggests that aggression followed by contrition has been the norm. Unless the Muslim community does its bit to demonstrate that it won’t be pawns in the hands of either radical Islamists or cynical secularists, this unfortunate pattern of communal disruption is bound to go on endlessly.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/delhi-riots-aimed-to-gain-foreign-media-attention.html
2,01-3-20,Three killed in separate mishaps,"Three persons were killed in separate mishaps across the state since Friday evening.

In Sonbhadra, the body of a labourer was recovered from the debris of boulders in a stone quarry in Billi Markundi mining area in Obra police station limits on Saturday morning.

A day earlier, the entire shaft had come crashing on the site and two seriously injured labourers were extricated on Friday evening. Both were later referred to a hospital in Varanasi.

“The rescue operations assisted by NDRF continued through the night and the body of a labourer, Surendra (55), was found this morning. The operations are continuing as some more labourers were suspected to be trapped,” said District Magistrate S Rajalingam.

On Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had directed the district magistrate and the district police chief to reach the accident site and ensure relief and proper treatment of the injured.

In another incident reported from Shamli, a woman labourer was killed and two others were injured when the boiler of a factory exploded at Humrajpur village in Kandhla on Friday.

The police said that a woman worker, identified as Sharmila, was killed while Sangita and Manzoor were injured in the explosion at the tyre factory.

The injured were sent to hospital and police were probing the incident.

A case was registered and the body was sent for autopsy.

In Muzaffarnagar, Monu (16), a member of a wedding party, was fatally hit by a bus in Khai Kheda village under Kakrauli police station on Friday, after which the locals beat up the driver and damaged the vehicle.

Angry residents later placed the body on the road and staged a protest, blocking Morna-Jansath road.

Later senior officers reached the spot and pacified the protesters by assuring swift action after which the road block was lifted.

The body was sent for autopsy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/three-killed-in-separate-mishaps.html
3,01-3-20,Parties gearing up for bypolls to two UP assembly seats,"Political parties are gearing up for the bypolls to two Uttar Pradesh Assembly seats which were declared vacant.

The Bangarmau seat in Unnao, which was held by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, fell vacant after he was disqualified earlier this week after being convicted in a rape case.

The other seat is Swar Tanda in Rampur from where the election of Samajwadi Party’s Abdullah Azam has been set aside by court for forgery in his birth certificate documents.

Both Sengar and Abdullah Azam are in jail for their offences.

Sources said that the Sengar family is planning to field the disqualified legislator’s wife Sangeeta Sengar from Bangarmau in the bypoll. Sangeeta Sengar is chairperson of Zila Panchayat and wields a lot of clout in the area.

“People here know that Kuldeep Sengar has been falsely implicated in the case due to political rivalry. There is sympathy for him and if Sangeeta contests, she will be able to underline his innocence and get sympathy votes,” said a family member.

But as the Bharatiya Janata Party may not support Sangeeta’s candidature, the Sengar family is considering the option of fielding her as an independent candidate.

In Rampur, the candidate could be from the Azam Khan family and he would contest on SP symbol.

Sources said that Azam Khan’s elder son Adeeb Azam Khan could be fielded by the SP, which has decided to stand by the Khan family.

Adeeb Azam has so far kept away from politics.

On Thursday, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had visited the jailed Khan family in Sitapur district jail and accused the ruling BJP of pursuing politics of vendetta.

The SP would like to whip up a sympathy wave since Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah Azam are in jail.

The BJP, on the other hand, is determined to win both seats.

“We have set an example by expelling Kuldeep Sengar and handing over the case to the CBI. We made no attempt to shield him. On the other hand, Samajwadi Party is protecting Azam Khan, who is an epitome of corruption. We are going to win both seats,” said BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan.

The Bahujan Samaj Party is still undecided whether it should contest the bypolls or not. The Congress, on the other hand, is overconfident of its prospects.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/parties-gearing-up-for-bypolls-to-two-up-assembly-seats.html
4,01-3-20,Punjab Health Minister to file defamation suit against SAD's Majithia,"Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Saturday said he will file a defamation suit against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia for allegedly levelling false allegations against him in connection with the diversion of buprenorphine tablets from private de-addiction centres (PDAC).

Speaking in the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday, Majithia had sought Sidhu's dismissal from the cabinet, alleging that five crore tablets of buprenorphine, a scheduled drug, worth Rs 200 crore had gone missing from the PDCAs.

Describing Majithia's allegations as ""baseless and fallacious"", Sidhu said he will file a defamation suit against the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader.

The previous SAD-BJP Government ""totally failed"" to break the supply line of drugs and now the Akalis are trying to divert people's attention by politicising the issue, the health minister said.

Sidhu said the PDACs are authorised to directly purchase medicines from pharmaceutical companies and the health department has no role in the process.

The difference in online and offline records of medicines was noticed by the health department itself. After that, to ensure 100 per cent data entry online, show cause notices have been issued to the PDACs, he added.

Sidhu said he has directed Principal Secretary Anurag Aggarwal to conduct a thorough audit of all the PDACs. He said he has also asked Aggarwal to ensure that treatment of patients is not affected during the audit. He added that he is personally monitoring the issue and legal action will be taken after an analysis of the online and offline records of the PDACs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-health-minister-to-file-defamation-suit-against-sad-s-majithia.html

8,01-3-20,Cong holds protest against IT raids,"Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee-led by CPCC chief Mohan Markam staged a sit-in-demonstration at Gandhi Maidan against the recent IT raids carried out in the premises linked to many bigwigs close to the Congress government and officials.

Markam addressing the gathering said Central government’s intention is flawed as for the first time without giving any information to the state government the action has been initiated within limits of the state. It is crystal clear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah’s intention against the state government, he said. Earlier, the Congress has fought against the Britishers, now the fight will continue against them. No one needs to fear, he added.

He said continuously central government wants to unstabilise the state government that is why this protest is being registered.

Congress MLA further said after 15 years of fight, the party could uproot the Raman Singh government. The popularity of the Government of Chhattisgarh has risen in foreign countries also. As the popularity graph of BJP is falling, such hunts are being carried out.

Congress MLAs and Mayor also addressed the gathering alleging that Modi government is misusing the central agencies against the state government. Later the Congress leaders with workers marched towards the Income Tax office building holding banners and posters.

The party workers were blocked near Kalimata Temple square, near Akashwani by police putting ‘tin’ sheets barricade. The Congress party workers pulled down the barricades and continued their march to reach the IT Bhawan and staged protest in front of it.

10,01-3-20,BJP justifies IT raids,"BJP National spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sudhanshu Trivedi said the Congress leaders should reply whether the Income Tax raids carried out in the state were to instil “political stability or instability.”

He was responding Chief Minister’s statement and Congress party’s protest over the IT raids in the state.

Interacting with media persons, he went on the claim that ISIS was backed by some of the intellectuals and others in the country. The BJP leader even maintained that each protest in Delhi had a committee with list of demands but in Shaheen Bagh there was no such thing.

He further claimed during every visit of President of USA, there had been incident in Kashmir, but such an act in parts of Delhi during Trump’s visit gave a different picture to the incidents.

On CAA he said, not a single person protesting against the CAA has come out with fact to prove that any word or clause in the Act speaks of taking away nationality of any citizen of the country.

He added that Congress has not been playing a constructive opposition instead is involved in instigation which has created an unfortunate situation in the country. Not a single senior Congress leader has come up with a statement to the people registering protest to maintain peace and tranquillity, he said.

There were days when the Congress claimed it can only rule the country but since few decades, the people had given befitting reply to it even though the party has ruled the country for longer period.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-justifies-it-raids.html
11,01-3-20,Being treated like a terrorist in jail: Azam,"Samajwadi Party leader and Lok Sabha member from Rampur, Mohammad Azam Khan, alleged that he was “being treated like a terrorist” in the Sitapur district jail.

Denying the charge, the jail superintendent said that the jailed MP was being given all facilities as per the Jail Manual.

Khan was taken to Rampur jail from Sitapur district jail for a hearing before the Special MP/MLA Court on March 2.

On February 26, the Special MP/MLA Court of Rampur had sent Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah Azam to jail till March 2. The trio had surrendered in connection with a forgery case related to two birth certificates of Abdullah Azam.

Before heading for Rampur on Saturday, Khan told reporters outside Sitapur district jail that he was being treated like a terrorist in the prison.

Azam Khan was lodged in a high security room in Sitapur jail along with his son, while his wife was lodged in the women’s barrack.

The SP MP spent a sleepless night in the jail while his wife complained of acute back pain.

The SP leader was sent to Rampur under tight security with around 40 policemen, including several women constables, guarding their vehicles.

Abdullah Azam Khan was disqualified from the membership of UP Legislative Assembly and the Suar Tanda seat in Rampur which he represented was declared vacant on Thursday.

The development came after the Allahabad High Court set aside the election of Abdullah Azam, maintaining that he was not qualified to contest the poll as he was below 25 years of age when he filed his nomination papers as SP candidate from Suar Tanda seat in 2017.

Azam Khan’s arrest is being seen as a big set back to Samajwadi Party, which suffered three successive defeats at the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014, 2017 and 2019.

The ascent of the lawyer-turned-politician during the last three decades significantly contributed to the rise of Samajwadi Party with the consolidation of Yadav-Muslim votes.

The expected marginalisation of Azam Khan as a Muslim mascot in UP could pave the way for the Congress to make a dent in the Muslim vote bank of the SP.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been aggressively wooing the Muslims and she visited several towns where Muslims suffered causalities during anti-CAA violence on December 20.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/being-treated-like-a-terrorist-in-jail--azam.html
12,01-3-20,"Mishra visits Ayodhya, meets Gopal Das","Ram Temple Construction Committee Chairman Nripendra Mishra visited Ayodhya on Saturday and met president of the recently set up Ram Temple Trust, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, on Saturday.

The Ayodhya visit of Mishra, a retired IAS officer UP cadre and former principal secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is significant as the date for starting the construction of the Ram temple would be announced by Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust set up earlier this month as per Supreme Court verdict on November 9, 2019.

The meeting of the Trust is likely to be held in the first fortnight of March and the date for starting the construction of the Ram temple is likely to be announced during Ram Navami. Close to 20 lakh pilgrims flock the temple town of Ayodhya during Ram Navami.

Mishra, who arrived in Lucknow on Friday, reached Ayodhya by road on Saturday where he was received by District Magistrate Anuj Jha, Divisional Commissioner MP Agarwal and Senior Superintendent of Police Ashish Tewari. Mishra first went to Hanuman Garhi temple for ‘darshan’ and performed aarti there.

Later, he met other members of Ram Temple Trust to initiate the process for preparing a blueprint for construction of the temple.

This was his first visit to Ayodhya after being appointed chairman of the Temple Construction Committee.

Mishra remained in Ram Janmabhoomi complex for three hours and reviewed the progress of construction of idols for the Ram temple.

He also visited a workshop where carved stones and pillars are stored. He will stay in Ayodhya on Saturday and leave for Delhi on Sunday.

His visit to Ayodhya is also significant because the Temple Trust has to take important decision on shifting the makeshift Ram temple to another place. The idol of Rama Lalla is to be shifted to an alternative sanctum sanctorum till a new Ram temple is constructed.

Besides, the issue of transfer of management and control of temple affairs and land from Ayodhya district administration to Temple Trust is also to be formalised. Till the constitution of the Trust, the divisional commissioner of Ayodhya was the custodian of the 67-acre land around the Ram Janmabhoomi.

After the Supreme Court verdict and setting up of the Trust, the title and management of land and temple have been transferred to the Trust which will now have to appoint its own employees for managing the temple.

Earlier on Friday, Mishra had met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow. Chief Secretary RK Tiwari and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi were also present.

In the hour-long meeting, Mishra is understood to have discussed modalities for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mishra-visits-ayodhya--meets-gopal-das.html
13,01-3-20,"Capt lashes at Sukhbir Badal, terming his remarks on Budget as ‘bizarre’","Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday ridiculed Sukhbir Badal over the latter’s reaction to his government’s budget, saying that in the absence of any real cause for criticism, the Akali leader had once again resorted to making bizarre and illogical comments.

Finding absolutely no real cause to complain with the budget, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president had come out with one of his most ridiculous statements ever, said the Chief Minister, lashing out at Sukhbir for his persistent attempts to mislead the people of Punjab with unfounded and senseless remarks.

Referring to Sukhbir’s comments calling him (Capt Amarinder) a businessman, the Chief Minister said it was evident that the Akali chief either had no clue about what a businessman really was (which could not be ruled out) or was, as usual, playing to the gallery by picking up some catchy word or phrase to make media headlines.

Frankly, said Capt Amarinder, considering the wide array of business interests (cable, hotels, transport etc) in which the Badal family had involved itself during the 10 years of their rule, it was Sukhbir and his kin who were the real businessman. And like a petty businessman who does not want to share the fruits of his business with others, Sukhbir had never left his Rs shop’ for a second, said the Chief Minister, adding that the SAD president was, even now, obsessively controlling his business interests with an iron hand, to the detriment of his own party.

“Had Sukhbir shown even 10% of this interest (he is now showing in my doings) in the welfare of the state when his party was in power, Punjab’s story would have been different today,” said the Chief Minister, lashing out at the Akali leader for looting the state left, right and centre for his own business interests during the decade-long rule of his party.

Capt Amarinder also took a swipe at Sukhbir, as well as Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, for deriding the Rs Ideal Chief Minister’ award recently conferred on him by the Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad. “It is clearly a case of sour grapes for them,” he retorted, adding that none of the Badals could ever dream of being even remotely considered for such an honour – the reason for their angst at anyone else being awarded for their good work.

The SAD is in a total disarray as a result of Sukhbir’s ineffective style of functioning, said Amarinder, adding that, in sharp contrast to the former deputy chief minister, he believed in delegating responsibilities to ensure more effective and transparent governance in the larger interest of the state and its people.

It was the result of this way of functioning that his cabinet colleagues and the entire team of officers, from the top to the lowest ranks, were able to deliver their best, in an environment where they could think, ideate and act freely, without having to report every movement to the Chief Minister, said Amarinder. His government’s success in bringing back on track the state’s economy, which the previous SAD-BJP government had completely ruined, was also the result of this democratic and transparent style of working, he added.

Taking a dig at Sukhbir’s comment on the condition of the state’s roads, the Chief Minister when was the last time the Akali leader had looked at any road (except perhaps the one that leads to The Oberoi Sukhvilas, in which he has a major business interest). The Akali government had left the roads in a pathetic condition, just as they had done with every other facet of Punjab, Captain Amarinder quipped, adding that his Finance Minister, Manpreet Badal, had been walking a tightrope for the past three years, trying to address the multitude of economic challenges faced by the state as a result of the misgovernance of the previous government, headed by the Badals.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-lashes-at-sukhbir-badal--terming-his-remarks-on-budget-as----bizarre---.html

46,01-3-20,Banks in State to shut for 11 days in March!,"Let the account holders know that the banks will remain closed for as many as 11 days in the month of March.

The March 2020 calendar has already slated eight holidays for the banks in Odisha, including the second Saturday, Sundays and Holi. But the number of days of banks’ closure is likely to rise to 11 as bank employees have declared a three-day nationwide strike in the month.

Reportedly, the bank employees would go on strike from March 11 to 13 to press for their demand for salary hike. They demand an increase of 25% in their monthly salaries instead of the 12.5% hike that the Indian Bank Association (IBA) has given agreed to. This would be the third consecutive strike of the year by the bank employees.

Generally, the revision of salaries of bank employees is done every five years. Apparently, last time, it was delayed from 2012 to 2015. Although the IBA has formed a committee to resolve the issue and consider the demands of the employees, the minimal percentage of hike in the salary structures has discontented the employees.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has denied mediating between the employee and the IBA in the matter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/banks-in-state-to-shut-for-11-days-in-march-.html

82,01-3-20,"Building sustainable,global institutions","Higher education institutions have a central role to play in achieving a new sense of individual consciousness and intellectual orientation towards creating a sustainable future, writes Prof C Raj Kumar

The demand for recognising issues related to sustainability in higher education is slated to grow exponentially the world over. Educational leaders have a unique opportunity to lead the creation of a new institutional consciousness on sustainability. It is educational leadership that will lead in enabling a new consciousness and intellectual orientation for a sustainable world.

The leading universities of the world have demonstrated a deep, persistent and sustained commitment to interdisciplinarity. The importance of crossing disciplinary boundaries in teaching, learning and research is yet to be fully realised within the Indian higher education system. Institutional mechanisms need to be established within universities to enable students to learn across schools, departments and programmes across the entire university. The big debates of our time will not be addressed by knowledge and understanding of single discipline, but our ability to drawn upon the expertise from many disciplines with a view to producing solutions.

At the Caspian Week — World Economic Forum 2020 sessions at Davos, the two key panels: “Education & Leadership for Sustainable World” focussed on educational leadership, sustainability, inclusive development, institutional cultural change, and pedagogies of sustainability. The second panel was on “The Role of Global Universities in Promoting Sustainable Futures”, where the discussion focussed on challenges that universities are confronted with today and that global universities can play a specific role in advancing the cause of sustainable development.

Higher education institutions in particular have a central role to play in achieving a new sense of individual consciousness and intellectual orientation towards creating a sustainable future. Institutional leaders have the opportunity to intervene and address sustainability issues in multiple forms. They can foster new institutional consciousness towards a sustainable world; there are some key steps that need to be initiated. Universities can be crucial partners in the initiation of dialogue between regional scholars, academics, policymakers, researchers and relevant state-level agencies. International collaborations between academics, researchers, international institutions and non-profit foundations engaged in the study and practice on related areas can increase potential to study previously unexplored approaches and potential funding sources for research and initiatives related to sustainability.

Universities can affect deep and meaningful change in local communities and can shape as to how they respond to sustainability issues over the long-term. Adopting approaches to address sustainability and sustainable futures in curriculum, research agendas, infrastructure (energy/water conservation and waste management), campus engagement, public institutional engagement, diversity and accessibility indicators, and institutional environmental footprint are some example of this initiative.

There is more. Specific initiatives are needed at the institutional level. Investing in research that is valuable to local communities will lead the way to an intellectual consciousness. This includes developing research networks with(in) local communities. Relevant disciplinary areas that could lead and contribute to such networks include public policy, law, architecture, journalism, management, environmental studies, and liberal arts. Working in collaboration with local governments is another area for greater exploration by universities and institutional leaders.

We need to develop interdisciplinary global networks focused on sustainable development. These could include research partnerships on exchanging institutional and pedagogical best practices, and transnational dialogues and forums to deliberate and explore new approaches to institutional governance that better address sustainability concerns.

For universities to play an effective role in advancing sustainable local, national, regional and global development, students must be made active stakeholders in existing and future approaches to sustainability. A primary mode of cultivating sustainability consciousness is by grounding relevant themes, issues, challenges and concerns within the curricula while focussing on experiential learning, clinical programmes, capstone projects and community level engagement.

Of particular focus must be those that relate to the most critical local, national and regional issues. A greater range of relevant pedagogical interventions is then made possible through curricula that are aligned towards addressing the challenges of sustainable development. A secondary focus area is to orient faculty members to design and teach courses that are more closely aligned with institutional, national and global sustainability agendas.

While research funding for related areas is important, institutional incentive structures for researchers can go a long way in encouraging greater research on sustainable development themes. One way to address this is for institutional leaders to prioritise research sub-themes that may contribute directly to sustainable local and national developmental concerns. This prioritisation could imply not only actively setting institutional research agendas on a periodic basis, but also incentivising researchers who choose to work on these areas through greater research support, more accessible dispensing of available institutional funding, adjusting institutional teaching and research responsibilities, and making available necessary infrastructure for such research. All of this has to happen in recognition of the extended time horizons, longer study periods and lack of immediate and demonstrable outcomes that such research may require.

Locally, Fostering community networks will encourage exchange of ideas. These could include networks for institutional, research, teaching and student related initiatives that encourage greater transnational exchange of current practices, ideas, and problem-solving approaches. Of crucial importance will be the role that universities play in not only encouraging and nurturing greater participation of young students in such networks, but also creating opportunities for greater cross-border interactions with peers and enabling students to undertake leadership roles in exploring new approaches to sustainable futures.

Then, institutions adopting interdisciplinary approaches in research, teaching, learning, policy and practice will be key to acting progressively on sustainability issues. For universities, this means that investing in creating opportunities and pathways for interdisciplinary interactions will be essential. One approach to this is to institutionalise interdisciplinarity across core functions. For instance, in course offerings, the availability of interdisciplinary, cross-listed electives is a useful way to encourage students to think and learn outside their own subject areas. Universities could also enable greater interdisciplinary interactions within their campuses, for instance through conscious and deliberate design of their physical infrastructure and facilities, and offering greater support for teachers and researchers who undertake interdisciplinary initiatives and projects.

Higher education institutions necessarily need to be as representative as possible of their host communities and regions in order to survive and thrive. Universities have a greater obligation to accomplish such representation given the public character of their mission and purpose, and the broad societal goals they commit to achieve. These aims take on greater significance in developing economies, and given the value that a robust higher education system can add to achieving national developmental goals. These include providing adequately representative access, particularly to marginalised groups of citizens; balancing such access with the provision of university environments that are of global standards; helping our students bridge gaps in communication and thinking skills that can meet the requirements of globalised careers and roles; and perhaps most importantly, institutionalising efforts to identify and correct disparities in diversity and inclusion indicators.

Universities are confronted with the challenge of embracing globalised modes of functioning and expansion while simultaneously remaining rooted, mindful and responsive to local, national and regional developmental and sustainability concerns.

Eventually, the role that academic leadership plays in creating a beneficial environment will be key to creating a systematic process for sustainability. Approaches to creating institutional environments that are conducive to the study and practice of sustainability necessarily need to be whole-system oriented.

Such approaches could take the form of making sustainability a lived experience within campus environments and spaces. Hence sustainability as a concept is then not far removed from the everyday experience of teaching, learning, working and residing within campus environments.

There is a need to build an attitude of conservation of natural and other resources. Institutions need to move towards adoption of alternate technologies, increasing green cover, water and energy conservation, reducing waste, and increasing intra-campus awareness of its carbon footprint within host regions.

Leaders must bring greater awareness of adverse impacts of developmental trajectories on local/host communities while, interweaving sustainable objectives into all aspects of university activities including administration, pedagogy, and residential life.

While 21st century universities must serve as bastions for academic and scholarly work, they must also serve as models of organisational innovation, agility in a complex world, creative negotiation with change, and representative in demographic, identity and design with local and national communities. These are key elements that will determine the preparedness of universities to contribute to building more sustainable futures while preparing students more adequately to intervene in sustainable development efforts.

83,01-3-20,The Karmic connection,"Every action and thought that crosses your mind leaves an imprint on your destiny, to be fructified at a later point in this life or future lives. These are samskars, writes Hingori

You suffer countless losses, diseases, heartbreaks in life and feel sorry for yourself. And here, oscillates the pendulum — good, bad, right, and wrong. One moment you like yourself, the other you do not. Duality has its day. Delusion has its way!

At times such as these, the first question that comes to your mind is — “Why me? What did I do deserve this?” The answer to this lies in understanding the concept of samskars.

Every action and thought that crosses your mind leaves an imprint on your destiny, it gets stored in the karmashaya, an ethereal hard disk so to say, to be fructified at a later point in this life or future lives. This stored data is called samskars.

These samskars fructify, deciding the course of your life because in attaching emotions to your actions you gain a sense of ownership towards these actions. When your destiny is paired with the data stored in your ethereal hard disk, those stored samskars, fructify in congruence with the rays of the planets.

So, if at a particular time your destiny is meant to provide you with wealth, good looks, luxury, good times, the stored samskars that match your destiny at the time will fructify.

On the other hand, if physical pain, loss in business, difficult days, are a part of your destiny at a particular time, then the karmas matching this negative period will come to fore and fructify. And what you receive in the fructification of these past karmas, you take ownership of and begin the cycle all over again, reloading your karmic matrix instead of exhausting it.

You have thoughts all day, every day. You think about your thoughts, about why you have these thoughts, feel good about some and chastise yourself for some. Of course you do, they are your thoughts, right? Wrong! They are thoughts that you receive, which come and go through your mind.

Our minds should be open vessels allowing these thoughts to enter and leave, watching them from a distance, in third person. Instead we lid the vessel as soon as a thought comes floating in, paint it in emotion and make it ours. It then adds to our karma, positive or negative depending on the thought. And before you know it, one thought links to another and you gain ownership of a long chain of thoughts.

The positive samskars will be converted in the future into Bhog (pleasure and riches). The negative samskars into Rog (debt, disease, and misfortune). And divine deeds will get converted into Yog (spiritual evolution).

One can extend this point to the fate of countries as a whole too. Countries can be divided into those that offer lesser comforts and luxuries called Tapo Bhoomi, where people exhaust more of their negative karmas and also practice penance and austerity. And other countries that fulfill the Rajasic experience called Rajo Bhoomi, are where people enjoy and exhaust their positive karmas, by getting consumed by luxury, comfort and wealth.

Spiritually evolved people know how to re-balance their karma and negate samskars through the practice of recitation of advanced mantras and performing a lot of seva, thereby tilting the balance in favour of perceived positivity.

When your thoughts, which are not really your own, lead you to perform actions you consider worthy of pride, you take ownership of these actions and add to your samskars. It could be something as simple as helping an elderly cross a road to something as large as donating a large sum of money to charity. You feel good about yourself and add to your positive karma.

When positive samskars fructify, rewarding you with good days, prosperity, health, you tend to spend it in indulging your whims and fancies. Some become vain, some abuse this reward and eventually end up with a massive karmic negative tilt.

It is important to realise that while it is your past actions that have earned you such luxuries, it is your destiny that lead you to earn them and you as an individual have no role in it.

Credit for the good deeds or blame for the bad, neither is yours to take. These rewards are automatically fructified to balance the karmic balance sheet thereby leading to automatic exhaustion and redemption of stored samskars.

Knowledge or gyan helps people to re-examine the above principles and use them for personal evolution.

There are essentially 3 types of people:

The astute, who understand this subject and try to improve their balance sheet by simply reducing their desires, thereby spending less of their positive karmas.

The more astute, who practice tapasya including voluntary suffering, for example fasting, long hours of meditation and spiritual sadhana.

The most astute, who understand the only way to transcend karma is to not take ownership of their actions, thereby exhausting the all kinds of samskars and karmas and eventually freeing themselves from the shackles of karmic connections.

It takes a certain level of spiritual evolution to be the third type of person but that is the ultimate goal.

May this dawn upon you and may you succeed in your endeavour.

84,01-3-20,Energising your crystals,"If you want your crystals to help you, allow them to thrive, says Sumiran Annamaria Kashyap in part three of the ‘Cosmic heirloom’ series

Crystals are conductors of healing, uplifting energies. Sometimes, you might find that you don’t ‘feel’ the same way around them, as you did before. Nothing has changed in those crystals, but, as ‘mood mirrors,’ they’re trying to show you that, possibly, something has changed within you — for worse, or, for better.

Should you be willing to treat this in a introspective manner, you might allow your crystals to become trustworthy guides, that help you understand your day-on-day triggers. Eventually, you’ll know when to bring which crystal to the forefront, and with everyday that passes by, you will find this small team of guides to be indispensable. The energy exchange can be quite intense, so, like you, crystals need time and space to detox and recharge. While some identify a subtle, but significant difference between the idea of cleansing, clearing and charging crystals, I personally find that these terms are largely interchangeable.

Methods for Charging Crystals

Some do well under clean, pure, running water, or sunlight. Others aren’t meant for water, or the sun at all — they may dissolve, or fade. Take note of specific dos and don’ts from your vendor, depending on the crystal you get. If sunlight works for your chosen crystal, opt for the gentle warmth of the early morning, or late evening sun.

Charging under the full moon, with direct exposure, is popular. I quite like burying my crystals in the earth, the mud of my potted rose plants. Most crystals come from the Earth’s bedrock, so I feel they would like to hibernate there. The rose is the flower of the heart and resonates personally, but you can go with whichever one is your favourite.

If you have singing bowls for meditation, you can charge your crystals to their sounds, too. And, if you want something even simpler, then, just the warmth of your (clean) hands, moisturised with something gentle, so as to not disturb the composition of the crystal. If you are unsure, use an oil that complements the crystal and rub a few drops into your palms. I personally find frankincense, myrrh, cedar, sandalwood, moringa and jojoba work with most. Otherwise, think of why you’re using a crystal, find an essential oil that serves the same purpose; and add a few drops to a carrier oil that suits your skin, before application.

Creating a Sacred Space

Storing your crystals properly is a fundamental step. And, if you like to wear them as you are going about your day, they will still comfort and support you. But, when you sit down to work with them in a meditative or prayerful way, it helps to designate a special space to do so. It doesn’t matter if this space is a small corner, where you can sit on a mat and work with your crystals, or a full-fledged altar. What you don’t need is external cacophony, your phone ringing constantly, and dirty sheets, mat, clothes, or hands. If you practice other methods of divination, you can keep the associated material in this space. Even if you don’t, you can just keep symbolic talismans, that represent your hobbies, work, family, personal beliefs and so on. You can add your favourite flowers, or decorate this space with the colours that uplift your spirits.

As an extension of the ‘mood-mirror’ thought, sometimes, try including colours, or souvenirs that you tend to avoid. See how they make you feel in the presence of your crystals, and think about why you avoid them. The avoidance could be a nudge towards an energy block, one that could lay all your diligent efforts to waste if you ignore it. This is probably what needs the most work. Remember, while ‘out of sight, out of mind’ makes convenient sense, it doesn’t talk about what may have left sight and mind, to lodge itself deep into the soul.

85,01-3-20,Reform your thinking,"The secret to managing anger and hatred lies in your thought. Change the way you think to fix these negativities, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

Our thoughts are dominated by lust, greed, anger, hate, etc. In old age, our thoughts turn towards our aging bodies. If we allow these thoughts to linger, we are in serious trouble. Because they reinforce “tamoguna” — the mode of darkness.

There are three modes, which constitute our bodies. These are: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of darkness. The mode of goodness is the most desirable, because this is illuminating and free from diseases on account of purity. The mode of passion suffers from the fault of attachment because of our faulty desires. Normally, this mode dominates the psyche of most people. The mode of darkness causes delusion, because it is born of ignorance. These modes exist in different percentages in us. Ideally, the mode of goodness should have the highest percentage, followed by the mode of passion and we should have the least percentage of the mode of darkness.

The wise try to reinforce the higher modes and reduce the percentages of the lower modes by their thoughts, deeds, etc. The secret to managing these modes within us lies in the way we think. To work on ourselves, we need to reform our thinking. Because our thoughts cause the most damage, that is, they have a large share in changing the relative proportions of the three modes. Thoughts of love, compassion, cooperation, forgiveness, etc. increase the percentage of the mode of goodness, which benefits us immensely. On the other hand, if we reinforce the mode of darkness by our impure and negative thoughts, this gives rise to fears, anxieties, depression, etc. This mode can become so potent that it can even kill, as happens in suicides. There is no outside force involved in such deeds; the self commits this senseless act.

Let us understand how this dangerous mode establishes its control in us. Lust thoughts appear in the mind at a certain age. If we allow these thoughts to rule, we end up causing harm to ourselves without realising. Lord Krishna has warned of this enemy in several verses of the Gita. The lust may exist for many things, of which lust for tasty food and illicit sex are the most damaging.

It is said that lust leads to the doors to hell. Greed and its related thoughts are common and not far behind in hurting us. The same is true of angry thoughts. Hate takes us to an entirely low level. One may even end up being born in lower species in the next birth!

Focusing our attention to our bodies, we only harm ourselves; we don’t allow our bodies to perform their functions, which they do quite well. This human body is a thing of marvel. Normal care by eating, sleeping, being active and entertaining the self appropriately is what we really need to do; our miseries will be reduced drastically. (Bhagawad Gita, 6.17)

So what should we do? As soon as harmful thoughts appear in the mind, we need to seek help from God. By ourselves, we may be helpless in controlling them. Saintly persons go a step further; they think of God a lot. God is prepared to help and guide. This is the cosmic design. When we do that our lives take an about-turn. Not only do we get the perfect guidance and requisite help, we also get the elusive peace. This in turn leads to ‘sukha’ or the real happiness, which is different from transitory sense pleasures. However, this practice is not easy. Because we have to act on two fronts. One, we must desire to shun bad thoughts and two, we should desire to have God-related thoughts. This is ‘tapasysa’. Either we convince ourselves of the right way or the tamoguna will create havoc in our lives.

However, the protesters were nabbed by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and were handed over to Delhi Police for further action.

Under Delhi Metro (Operation and Maintenance) Act 2002, any kind of demonstration or nuisance is prohibited in Delhi metro premises. “Any passenger indulging in such act is liable to be removed from the Metro premises,” according to the Act.

According to eye witnesses on the spot, the group of five-six men, wearing saffron T-shirts and kurta, started the sloganeering when the train was about to halt at the Rajiv Chowk metro station.

""After deboarding the train, they continued chanting pro-CAA and provocative slogans. The CISF personnel, responsible for the security of the Delhi Metro, intercepted the protesters and handed them over to the Delhi Police

""On February 29, at about 10:25 hours, six youths were seen shouting slogans at Rajiv Chowk metro station, Delhi.

The event was organised by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) under its Horizon Series.

Govind Bhanusankar Gehalot (Dhar) along with his fellow artists presented the 'Bhagoria dance' of the Bhil tribe to the audience. Bhagoria dance of the Bhil tribe, Holi at Bhagoria Haat and other occasions are performed by Bhil youths.

Bhagoria Haats are organized before Holi during the Phagun season. Bhagoria Haat is a meeting of young men and women, not just haats. It is from here that they come in contact with each other, are attracted and run away to get tied in the life thread, hence these haats are named Bhagoria. In Bhagoria dance, various footsteps, Pali, Chakripali and Pyramid dance postures are the center of attraction.

Girls are dressed in colorful costumes and dancing in their hands are typical traditional and ethnic designs. In this dance the group showed the way to celebrate the festival of Holi.

This festival has been a part of the heart of India in centuries of spontaneous joy and excitement.

This sequence runs for five days from Holika Dahan to Raan Panchami. To perform it, the dance team dances in different postures with peacock feathers on the head, ashes in the head and in the waist? After this, the group performed its enchanting performance on Bhorea Dance.

89,01-3-20,"Even if his body is found in drain..., says father seeking closure","Hopelessness and desperation are gradually taking over the people who are yet to get any news of their loved ones missing in the communal clashes in north-east Delhi, with some like Alam Afroz now visiting hospital mortuaries “for closure”.

A distraught Afroz (52), who has been looking for his son for days, says he is unable to answer the anxious queries of his family members about his whereabouts.

“Even if his body is found in a drain, I will know at least that he is gone. Every time I go back home, my daughter-in-law and granddaughter ask if there has been any news of him and I have nothing to answer,” he said.

IB staffer Ankit Sharma’s body, with multiple stab wounds, was found in a drain in Chand Bagh a day after he went missing during the riots.

Madeena (48), whose son has been missing since Tuesday, was at the GTB hospital mortuary looking for his body after her efforts to trace him bore no fruit.

“I have been visiting different police stations. There is no trace of him. I don’t know if he is alive or not. Even if he is found here among the dead, I will get a closure at least. Otherwise I will live in hopes forever that he will come home some day,"" she told PTI.

Mohammad Qadir from Bijnor too has been making the rounds of GTB hospital since Wednesday, looking for his 18-year-old brother Aftab.

""He had gone to meet his friends that day. His friends told me that they were attacked by a mob. While the others managed to escape, he was beaten up badly. Nobody knows what happened to him and where he went.

""I have approached the police several times but they ask me to visit the police stations which have witnessed some of the worst violence and arson. I tried, but it is scary,"" he said.

Frantic search for the whereabouts of 22-year-old Monis also ended at the GTB Hospital morgue on Friday. Monis' mother was wailing outside the mortuary as the family was called inside.

They identified his body. He was missing since February 25.

But for the family of 35-year-old Mohammad Feroze the search didn't end at the GTB hospital. His wife Shabana said he was returning home from work, when he was beaten up.

""His phone was probably broken during that attack. He was saved by a Muslim family who gave him shelter. He called his nephew and me from their phone on February 24 but since then there has been no contact,"" she said.

Recalling her last conversation with him, she said, ""He said he had been beaten up and couldn't talk much since there was no electricity as the wires had been damaged by rioters and the phone's battery was about to die. He said, 'This is probably our last conversation. Don't know when we will talk again'.""

Shabana said they have learnt that the house where he was given shelter has been burnt down. ""We don't know where he is,"" she said with a heavy voice.

""Feroze might be alive. But he had said that he was badly injured. He was quite weak and was suffering from tuberculosis. We will also go to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital to look for him,"" said a family member.

The communal violence in northeast Delhi sparked by protests over the amended citizenship law has claimed at least 42 lives and left over 200 people injured. But the number of people who are stilling missing is unclear.

Frenzied mobs torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump and pelted stones at locals and police personnel.

92,01-3-20,Ensuing RS polls trial of strength between Cong and BJP,"The ensuing Rajya Sabha polls is poised to be a trial of strength between ruling Congress and opposition BJP. The election to third berth in Rajya Sabha elections has a crucial bearing on the fate of Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh.

While the change of guard has recently taken place in Madhya Pradesh unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the saffron party seems aggressive. However, the intentions of the BJP high command would be clear in the Rajya Sabha elections.

Three Madhya Pradesh quota seats, held by Digvijay Singh, Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya, are going vacant in April 2020.

Going with the numbers, one berth each to BJP and Congress is certain, but the biggest question is whether the BJP would make any attempt to reach the desired figure of 57 votes (for winning one seat), by harnessing Congress and independent members of the State Assembly? For gaining the second seat, the ruling Congress would require only one vote (of legislator), while the BJP would need nine votes.

With the appointment of VD Sharma as new BJP chief in Madhya Pradesh, the high command did charge the party that was defunct since Congress came to power in December 2018.

However, on the other hand, the party is facing problems in the State Assembly, due to non-aggressive Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargav. In past 14 months, he could not leave any impact on the party legislators.

Political observers feel that it would be quite difficult for the BJP to get eight votes in the present equation of numbers in the assembly. On the contrary, BJP should fear saving its castle. In the past too, during the division of votes in favour of a Bill, BJP’s two members Sharad Kol and Narayan

Tripathi had voted in favour of the ruling party.

Since, the BJP had not issued any whip in this regard, no action was taken against them.

One of them, Narayan Tripathi had later appeared before media persons along with Chief Minister Kamal Nath and openly expressed his wishes to remain with Nath.

If the Congress manages to get both the Rajya Sabha seats, Chief Minister Kamal Nath would emerge as strong leader once again and the new PCC Chief would be of his choice undoubtedly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ensuing-rs-polls-trial-of-strength-between-cong-and-bjp.html
93,01-3-20,Decoding Shiva: Existence is God,"Picking up threads from the previous issue, it is now time to see how creation moved forward on to the earth plane. Moon plays from the front as the carrier of cosmic energies, serving as the interface between the cosmic world above and life mechanism on earth plane. Thus, comes into place a life cycle, which runs in succession, as would running water of the perennial river Ganges originating from Lord Shiva’s hair locks imply. Travelling from the source to the sea, water extends life all through its run. Remember, but for water there would be no live form-existence. Even science believes that the first live existence emerged in water. Water running down the river stream as also in the sea evaporates, leaving behind all impurities, takes the form of cloud, and again rains back to recharge the water bodies on earth. Similarly, all forms of life run in succession in a cyclic order.

Coming back to Lord Shiva’s entourage, it exemplifies multitude of existence forming this world. The divine beings are personification of the cosmic forces, vital to creation, sustenance, and recycling of existential order. Human beings armed with intelligence and awareness level, higher than other creatures, the onus lies on them to work towards qualitative existence of the living order. Devilish existence imply ignorant people with lower intelligence level and primarily driven by animalistic instincts. They, therefore, are not expected to be conscious about their collective obligations. It also implies all negative orientation of mind that may prove detrimental to harmonious and peaceful coexistence.

The presence of invisible existence such as ghosts, make out a purposeful reference. These unseen creatures symbolise invisible existence in the intervening period between two successive form-existence, reflecting upon continuum between successive lives. Lord Shiva’s entourage, thus, presents a picture of all seen and unseen existence forming this living world.

Lord Shiva, despite evolutionary barrier of incommunicability amongst the varied creatures forming His entourage, through His selfless force of love, remains in accord with all of them. Overlooking their individualistic vagaries, as His eyes, half open and half closed would signify, He carries them all along. Purposely so, because He knows that all creatures, by themselves, are imperfect, and incapable of meeting existential needs by themselves. But all put together, complement and supplement each other. Their limitations apart, each is simultaneously also armed with such virtues, as would be necessary to nourish and sustain the collective existence.

Take the case of termite, which otherwise spoils wood, paper, and if left unattended even crops. But then, they dig hole deep inside the soil structure to facilitate entry of oxygen and activate creative potential of the earth mass. In the process, the termite eats earth mass. To digest it, its body releases necessary enzymes. Having consumed a small part for its own sustenance, it excretes the rest, and that being rich in enzyme, further add to the fertility of the soil. The termite has to however meet its end before the crop comes up, but not before serving the cause of larger existence. It, thus, comes out that there is nothing in existence, without a specific assignment in support of the collective existence.

Lord Shiva, therefore, in order to get the best out of one and all and facilitate smooth run of the worldly order, purposely ignores their individual limitations. But it doesn’t come about easy. He has to absorb all the negatives appearing as by-product during the run of the world process, as would His poison fed blue neck imply. He does that in the larger interest of the existential order, but for which the very existence may become questionable.

Serving as provider, He nourishes the whole living order with all His resources in hand — the cosmic energy drawn through lunar crescent, water stream of river Ganges. Lord Shiva enjoys the confidence of all, as He selflessly serves them all without any sense of differentiation, with the sole noble objective to ensure a smooth run of the existential order. His selflessness is exemplified by being bare bodied, despite being the source and effective cause of creation.

To sum up, there is a system in place, which includes the primal source; the manifest plural world; and with lot of intervening dynamism playing in between, which drives us all individually and collectively. The existence as such is symbolised by Lord Shiva, who deserves being termed as God.

94,01-3-20,WHO upgrades risk to ‘very high’,"As increasing cases of Coronovirus (COVID-19) with and without a defined chain of transmission appear from the outbreak-hit nations, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Saturday upgraded the global risk of the deadly pathogen spread to “very high” - its top level of risk assessment. The virus is now present in five continents with at least six nations Iceland, Nigeria, Mexico, New Zealand, Belarus and the Netherlands reporting their first cases on Saturday.

However, the global health agency cautioned against unnecessary panic, stating that proper containment, with the help of an “all Government, all society approach” will help slow down rates of infection, break chains of infection and take pressure off healthcare systems around the world.

According to the latest data, more than 84,500 people are infected with the virus worldwide while nearly 3,000 have died.

In the meantime, amid increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Iran, where 43 people have died, India’s Ambassador to the country, Gaddam Dharmendra, on Saturday said the authorities are working to facilitate the return of those Indians who wish to go back to New Delhi.

India has recently successfully evacuated around 650 Indians from virus-hit Chinese city Wuhan and a shipping cruise in Japan. While the first lot of batch have already been discharged, all the 112 people, who were airlifted from Wuhan on February 28 have been housed at an ITBP quarantine facility and have found to be tested negative for coronavirus after their first samples were taken, an official said on Saturday. Their quarantine period will continue for about a fortnight. So far, more than 50 countries have reported cases of the deadly pathogen.

Alarmed at the rising cases of pathogens from other nations besides China, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a Press conference in Geneva on Saturday said it would be a “big mistake” to switch from a public health strategy of containment to mitigation, where authorities accept the virus is spreading.

In the last few days, 24 cases had been exported from Italy to 14 countries and 97 cases had been exported from Iran to 11 countries, Tedros said.

WHO Executive Director Michael J Ryan said, “Interrupting transmission gives us an opportunity to stop the virus and allows us to get ready and to prepare”.

“You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world to be ready,”

Dr Ryan said.

Every country should prepare for the arrival of the virus, Tedros warned. “Every country must be ready for its first case,” Tedros said. “No country should assume it won’t get cases. That could be a fatal mistake. This virus does not respect borders.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/who-upgrades-risk-to----very-high---.html
95,01-3-20,Old & infirm more prone to attack: Study,"Older people, especially those with pre-existing illnesses such as heart, hypertension, diabetes or lung diseases, are more vulnerable to Coronavirus (COVID-19) which has taken a toll of close to 3,000 lives across the world in the last two-and-a-half-months.

A Chinese study released recently has found that less than 1 per cent of hospitalised patients were younger than 15 years old, while 42 per cent were 65 and older. Patients who reported no pre-existing medical conditions had a case fatality rate of 0.9 per cent. Deaths were also rarer among younger people.

“That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to develop a severe form of pneumonia after being infected by the virus. The reason for this is being investigated as we try to learn more about this new virus,” said another report.

The evidence gathered so far from an analysis of COVID-19 cases is that the pathogen causes mild disease (i.e. non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in about 80 per cent of cases. More severe disease occurs in about 20 per cent of cases, with about one in four or five experiencing critical illness, said the report.

How long do symptoms last? Using available preliminary data, the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission published on February 28 by the WHO, which is based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases, found that mild cases took approximately two weeks for clinically recovery while severe or critical disease had 3 to 6 weeks duration. Time from onset to the development of severe disease (including hypoxia) took one week while among patients who have died, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranged from 2 to 8 weeks.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/old---infirm-more-prone-to-attack--study.html
96,01-3-20,SC should appoint amicus curiae to look into cases: Cong,"The Congress on Saturday accused police of carrying out a “one-sided” investigation into the violence in Delhi and urged the Supreme Court to appoint amicus curiae to scrutinise all such cases in which protesters and activists are being slapped with serious charges.

Party’s senior spokesperson Anand Sharma also said the situation is far from normal and an atmosphere of fear is still prevailing in the national Capital. Sharma alleged police “which allowed Delhi to burn for four days” is carrying out a “one-sided” investigation. He said in the name of action it should be seen against whom the action is being taken.

“What is the definition of hate speech? If the speeches made by the BJP leaders were not hate speeches, and the protests are a threat to the society as per the cases registered. Shockingly, as per an FIR against a group of people and an organisation called United Against Hate. And what is the case...For having said in a speech that ‘we shall not get up or give up our protest even if we have to die for that’. For that they were slapped with Section 307 of IPC (attempt to murder),” he said.

“We urge the Supreme Court to take cognisance of all these cases and appoint amicus curiae to scrutinise all these cases where people are being framed and put in jails,” Sharma told reporters. Amicus curiae assist a court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the case.

“The SC is the custodian of the Constitution. The delays don’t help. The entire world is watching this country, it is time that the Supreme Court intervenes effectively to protect the rights of the citizens guaranteed by the Constitution,” Sharma said.

“We have no expectations from Centre or the Home Ministry or Delhi Chief Minister (Arvind Kejriwal) but we have hopes from the courts,” he said. At least 42 were killed and over 200 injured in the communal riots that broke out in northeast Delhi on Monday after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control.

The areas worst affected in the violence include Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Chand Bagh, Khureji Khas and Bhajanpura.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-should-appoint-amicus-curiae-to-look-into-cases--cong.html
97,01-3-20,"Kanhaiya case: Cong, Left hit out at Kejriwal Govt","The Congress and the Left parties on Saturday criticised the Arvind Kejriwal Government for sanctioning prosecution against former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in connection with a four-year-old sedition case.

Congress leader and former Home Minister P Chidambaram hit out at the Delhi Government saying the Kejriwal dispensation is “no less ill-informed than the Centre” in its understanding of the sedition law even as the CPI vowed to fight both “legally and politically” the sedition case against its leader Kanhaiya Kumar.

“I strongly disapprove of the sanction granted to prosecute Mr Kanhaiya Kumar and others for alleged offences under sections 124A and 120B of IPC,” said Chidambaram. CPI alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government in the national Capital had “succumbed to political pressure”.

The Delhi Government on Friday gave a go-ahead to the city police to prosecute former JNUSU president Kumar and nine others in connection with a four-year-old sedition case, as the ruling AAP denied the persistent BJP charge of blocking the proceedings in the matter.

“The national secretariat of the Communist Party of India (CPI) will fight legally and politically the sedition charges against party national executive member and former president of the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) Kanhaiya Kumar. “The party is confident that Kanhaiya Kumar will come out unscathed as the charges are false and politically motivated,” the CPI said in a statement.

The party feels that it is unfortunate that the Arvind Kejriwal Government has “succumbed to political pressure and granted permission to prosecute Kumar”, it said.

“It may be recalled here that the chief minister (Kejriwal) himself had in the beginning said that there is no case of sedition against Kanhaiya and videos were doctored. We are yet to ascertain why this sudden change of heart has happened,” the statement said.

The party said it will soon secure a copy of the Delhi Government’s standing counsel’s recommendations which had not given sanction for the prosecution. “The party vehemently opposes the move to implicate Kanhaiya Kumar in a false sedition case and urges all its units and mass organisations to protest peacefully against the prosecution move,” the statement said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kanhaiya-case--cong--left-hit-out-at-kejriwal-govt.html
98,01-3-20,Cong slams Govt for ruining economy by monumental mismanagement,"Accusing the Government of “ruining” the economy by its “monumental mismanagement”, the Congress on Saturday advised the Centre to immediately give money in the hands of the poor by making rural job scheme MNREGA “need based”.

Former Union Minister Anand Sharma said under the rural job scheme MNREGA the Government should give employment for 150 days a year at a daily wage of Rs 500 to revive rural demand and economy.

“We remain seriously concerned about the continuing job losses which will eventually have an adverse impact on social stability and peace in the country with a large number of unemployed youth in the country having no hope and in despair. This government is ruining the economy by its monumental mismanagement and it continues to remain in denial,” Sharma said at AICC Press briefing.

He urged the Government to honestly release the number of jobs lost and not mislead the people by giving “the numbers of the changeover from informal to formal as the number of people who are expected in normal course or the employees to come on the provident fund platform”.

NSO data shows that the GDP for the third quarter is at 4.7 per cent, which is the lowest of the last seven years, Sharma said.

Noting that this is the seventh consecutive quarter when the GDP has fallen, Sharma said it is a matter of “grave concern” that the nominal GDP of India continues to be in single digit. If 7.7 per cent is the nominal GDP which includes the inflation then where is growth, he said.

“If you take out the expenditure on defence, public administration and other services of the Government, the actual GDP growth of third quarter is 3.7 per cent whereas the third quarter historically shows the strongest growth because it is after the kharif crop so there is a growth in agriculture then it is factored in the gross value addition and in the nominal GDP and the real GDP,” he added.

Sharma said the third quarter numbers are generally good because it is the festive season when people go for purchases consumption shows a spike. “But that has not happened so even in festive season people have not spent because people have no money,” he added.

Sharma said there is 9.2 per cent fall in the investments, gross fixed capital formation which actually is the only measure of the economy growing and a tangible investments growing for creation of new assets, new factories and job creation that remains in the negative.

“We are also staring at a huge fiscal deficit, unmanageble revenue deficit. Revenue receipts are very low both when we look at the GST numbers and also the income tax. So direct and indirect taxes receipts are very low and the Government’s budgetary projections are based on revenue receipts of Rs 26 lakh crore whereas up to December the total revenue receipts have been Rs 11 lakh crore.

“So whether in the fourth quarter the Government can get Rs 15 lakh crore we have serious doubts because GST will come when factories are producing and selling, other taxes will come when people have the money,” Sharma said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-slams-govt-for-ruining-economy-by-monumental-mismanagement.html

100,01-3-20,BJP rakes up Aurangabad renaming,"In an attempt to corner the ruling Shiv Sena in the run-up to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the Maharashtra BJP on Saturday latched on to the Sena’s oft-raised issue and rooted for renaming of Aurangabad as Sambhajinar.

Talking to media persons at Aurangabad after holding a meeting with his party’s district office bearers on preparations for the AMC polls scheduled to be held in March-April, State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said: “We are descendants of Maratha warriors Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahataj and Sambhaji Maharaj and not of Aurangazeb. Hence, Aurangabad should be named after Sambhaji Maharaj.”

“There is a case pending in the Supreme Court about renaming of Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar. We have to take steps to take the case to a logical conclusion and see that Aurangabad is renamed after Sambhaji Maharaj,” Patil said.

The BJP’s demand should be seen in the context of the fact that the BJP, after the Shiv Sena snapped ties with it, joined hands with the NCP and Congress and formed a government in the state in the last week of November last year, has been desperately trying to usurp the legacy of Shivaji – much to the discomfort of the Sena which has espoused the ideals of the great Maratha warrior ever since it was founded 54 years ago by late Bal Thackeray.

For more than three decades now, the Shiv Sena has been calling Aurangabad as ""Sambhajinagar"" at its party forums and also through the columns of its official mouth-piece ""Saamana"".

The BJP’s demand for renaming of Aurangabad comes both as a surprise and a act of hypocrisy, given that it could have gone through the process of renaming Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar while it ruled the state along with the Shiv Sena for the past five years.

Ever since the Shiv Sena-led MVA government assumed office in the state, political equations have changed in the AMC, a prominent civic body that the Sena ruled in alliance with the BJP since the 2015 polls. However, the Shiv Sena severed its ties with the BJP in December last year.

After the break-up in the saffron alliance, Sena leader Vijay Autade resigned from the deputy mayor’s post. In the subsequent deputy mayoral poll held on December 31, the Shiv Sena recaptured the post with the support of the NCP and Congress, as party’s Rajendra Janjal trounced BJP-backed independent candidate Gokul Malke by 17 votes.

This time around, it will be three-cornered contest in the AMC polls – in which Sena-MVA, BJP and All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) will be three main contenders. Currently, the party-wise tally in the 112-member AMC is: Shiv Sena - 29 BJP 22, MIM 25, Congress 8, NCP 4 and others 24.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-rakes-up-aurangabad-renaming.html
101,01-3-20,Shaheen Bagh women: New awakening,"The Shaheen Bagh women have challenged the tradition and expectation of their non-engagement in the public sphere, which is reflective of the conservative patriarchal Muslim society

In a gentle way, you can shake the world, thus said Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of non-violence in India. And this is what the Muslim women of Shaheen Bagh seem to have set out to do. A motley group of powerless, politically insignificant Muslim women have spearheaded a women-all sit-in protest for the past 78 days in a Muslim middle-class locality. Of them, some are educated, some illiterate, some young, and some old, dadis as they are called. They are protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, claiming that the law is anti-constitutional and aimed at taking away their citizenship if combined with the NRC and the NPR.

For the protesting women of Shaheen Bagh, the sit-in is for their survival, to save their future generation. In doing so, the women have challenged the tradition and expectation of their non-engagement in the public sphere, which is reflective of the conservative patriarchal Muslim society.

Their grit and determination have given new strength to the protest, attracting people from other faiths, including some Hindus, to espouse their cause. A group of Sikh men and women have put up a langar (community kitchen) providing food to these women for the past one month.

The most striking feature of the protest is its Indian-ness. Indian freedom struggle heroes and other national icons are conspicuous by their presence in the wall paintings and posters at the protest site. They play national anthem and chant slogans of Vande Mataram and Inquilab Zindabad and hoist Indian tricolour. These give their protest an impression of struggle to save their Indian identity.

While Indian history is replete with the male activism, non-Muslim women too have spearheaded movements for gender and environmental rights like Narmada movement, Chipko Movement. But Muslim women have seldom led any movement. In fact, they have been discriminated at two levels: as Muslims in a plural society and as women within their community. Their voices have been either completely stifled or not given due consideration in the past even during issues of vital importance like the Ayodhya dispute, the Shah Bano case, the triple talaq, etc.

Aruna Asaf Ali and Hazrat Mahal were some exception, because they didn’t belong to the lower middle class unlike the women at Shaheen Bagh. In pre-Independence India, the first feminist movement in Asia was started by a Muslim woman Rokeya Sakahawat Hossain, a Bengali woman who was ranked by the BBC as sixth greatest Bengali in 2004. She advocated education as liberating force for women and started a school in Kolkata which she ran till her death in 1932. Her books Matichur and Sultana’s Dream have been part of great feminist literature.

The Shaheen Bagh protest has a different contour and context. This is a protest movement born out of particular situation which affects the protesting women’s existence, as they say. They are not only going through an emotional trauma of spearheading the protest but also staring at a future with dark possibilities.

Bereft of any charismatic leader, the Shaheen Bagh protest has sparked many other similar protests across India. They have all seen women participation. It is a protest which is not based on any ideology. Yet the protest has been able to break the “exclusive identity” tag with the support of many people from the other faiths.

The protest has immense social implications also. This could be harbinger of a liberating movement for the Muslim women from the clutches of patriarchy and spearhead the change in the Muslim society.

It is difficult to see how the protest will go further. The Government has stated its stance and the Supreme Court is yet to hear the matter. Moreover, skirmishes between anti-CAA protesters and others that culminated into communal riots a few days ago threatened the continuation of the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, but the peaceful manner in which the protest is going on have scotched such apprehension.

The protesting women, like their counterparts in other protests led by women, have invested their emotion into it and that is why they have refused to either budge from their demands. At the same time, they have not allowed anti-social elements to hijack their peaceful protest.

To recall again Gandhiji who said “strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will”, the women of Shaheen Bagh are fighting their battle with this indomitable spirit to save their children’s future and the idea of India which professes a unique pluralistic society with equal protection of law to all communities.

102,01-3-20,"Modi, Trump need to walk the talk","American interests in India and Asia have been limited to ensuring the US status-quo and its dominance in the India-Pacific region. Modi-Trump’s envisioned ‘Comprehensive Partnership’ needs concrete substance rather than rhetorical strategies

Making capital out of speeches are the skills of world leaders and there are few better at it than United States President Donald Trump. Having embarked on his maiden visit to India since assuming office in 2017, President Trump, along with First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump and son in law Jared Kushner, arrived in India on the of February 24, 2020. Making the visit a family affair was a move that was much appreciated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his welcome address at Ahmedabad’s Motera Stadium. Speaking before a gathering of hundreds of thousands of people for the lavishly organised “Namaste Trump” event, Modi stressed on how the presence of the entire Trump family accords a “family-like sweetness” to India-US ties and went on to individually welcome each member of the Trump family in his speech. The Prime Minister further stated that India-US ties are “no longer just another partnership; it is a far greater and closer relationship”.

It is this very connotation that brings to the forefront the different expectations India and the US have from each other. Such difference rests with their mutual perception where India sees the US more as a friend and the US perceives India as just another strategic partner in Asia that will facilitate its China containment strategy. The praise on India as a successful and progressive democracy in Asia had little to do with Washington’s India policy outreach that will strengthen the India-US ties. To what extent Trump’s wordings, known for their pompousness, will actualise into a serious policy outlook on India in Capital Hill needs to be seen.

The US outlook towards Asia has for almost a decade now been highly China-centric; the Obama Administration’s “pivot to Asia” stemmed from a growing alarm of Chinese footprints across the region. Having labelled China a revisionist power, the US has turned its focus on defence engagements in South Asia and maritime security in the India-Pacific, leaving aspects like technology, trade, cultural ties and economics into cold storage. President Trump’s “America First” policy, which saw admission into his address when he made clear that “a booming America is great thing for India and it’s great for the world”, exemplifies that American interests in India and Asia are limited to ensuring US status-quo and dominance. During his trip, not showing any willingness to discuss with India the trade tensions only validated his transactional approach of the current US policy.

Trump’s speech, which references to Bollywood, Swami Vivekananda and famous Indian cricketers, resembled to some extent the address by Prime Minister Modi in 2016 before the US Congress and also followed along the lines of what previous US Presidents have said. A continuity in India-US relations was maintained, while enunciating the “absolutely incredible” potential for India to grow. Stating that Modi is a “true friend” and that “America loves India”, Trump spoke highly of the progress Modi has delivered to India in his years as the Prime Minister.

There are other key takeaways from Trump’s Motera address; first is the American acceptance of India as an “economic giant” and a wider appreciation of India’s rise in the global world order; all while being “a miracle of democracy”. Although Trump did not mention China by name, his statement praising India’s rise by promoting the growth of its people indirectly drew a parallel against “a nation that seeks power through coercion, intimidation and aggression”. This non-mention of China was partly because of India’s decision to not officially endorse a US-led order in the India-Pacific which is based on the China-containment strategy; however, while saying that India and the US will together “protect a free and open India-Pacific”, Trump did put across American expectations from India in the maritime region, excluding “inclusivity”.

Secondly, Trump for the entirety of his speech did not address contentious issues of India’s internal politics like abrogation of Article 370 and conditions in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). The topic of Kashmir is still a matter of debate in the US echelons; India has made repeated attempts to try and smoothen the US perceptions. With four US Senators writing to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the question of Kashmir before President Trump’s upcoming visit to India, the prudence of the topic still remains high. The Indian Government’s decision to take groups of envoys on tours to J&K, while stressing that these tours will soon become a regular activity, is laced with attempts at proving that normalcy prevails in the Indian State. US Ambassador Kenneth Juster’s J&K tour helped smoothen diplomatic exchanges; the visit by President Trump is also partly thanks to the same tour. While not directly addressing these concerns, Trump made repeated references to India’s “extraordinary diversity” with “millions and millions of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, and Jews” praying together. His concluding remarks asked “every Indian — North and South, Hindu and Muslim” to be proud while highlighting that it is this very unity in India that makes it “admired around the Earth”.

Thirdly, speaking about the growing defence partnership between India and the US, Trump appreciated the recently conducted tri-service military exercise “Tiger Triumph” between the two countries. While saying that America’s relations with Pakistan “are very good”, Trump assured that India and the US are together when it comes to the fight against terrorism, building on India’s concerns regarding cross-border terrorism by Pakistan. Announcing the signing of defence agreements worth $3 billion with India over the course of his visit, Trump underscored his administration’s commitment to providing India with “some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet”. However, it must be noted that the deal is not one that is new; it is a pending purchase of 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters for the Indian Navy and 6 AH-64E Apache helicopters for the Indian Army from American giant Lockheed Martin.

Fourthly, by steering clear of discussions on the “mini trade war” India and the US have been engaged in for over seventeen months now, Trump made it clear that Indian expectation of any relaxations by the US are in vain. Trump said that efforts to expand economic ties between India and the US will be a primary focus area and that the countries will be “making very, very major —among the biggest ever made — trade deals”. India would be wise to note that Trump’s “America First” approach will be guiding the trade talks, as made clear by his emphasis on a “booming America”. Prime Minister Modi, for his part, seems to be holding his own as enunciated by Trump, who called Modi “tough negotiator” twice during his Motera address.

In the Joint Statement released in conclusion of Trump’s first state visit to India, the two leaders declared that India-US ties will be upgraded to the level of a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Trump and Modi’s personal chemistry, as fostered by Trump’s promotion of Modi as a great leader and Modi’s welcome of Trump in a familial manner espousing the ideals of his welcome-tweet “Atithi Devo Bhava” (guest is God), has presented a rosy picture of India-US ties. However, in order to reach the true potential of their envisioned “Comprehensive Partnership”, this relationship will need to have concrete substance rather than rhetorical wordings that their leaderships have chosen so far to orchestrate. Not to overlook, this must not dither away the focus on the trade tensions which are limiting the potential of the India-US relationship to emerge as the most effective partnership in Indi-Pacific region.

103,01-3-20,Torn fabric,"The last time Delhi was a witness to riots was back in 1984. The horrors revisited the Capital on February 23, 2020. It left 43 dead and scars that will take decades to heal. MUSBA HASHMI visits the riot affected places to dig deep into the mores of the area, what the residents have to say and what caused it to begin with

What was a usual weekend for most of the Delhiites but for the residents of North-east Delhi, the day will be etched in their minds for decades to come. The riots that shook the Capital has left everyone saddened that they took place in the first place. The question that the residents ask themselves is if this can happen in the Capital, which part of the country is safe for our children?

On Sunday, February 23, the area saw the worst riots after more than 40 years. Petrol bombs, iron rods, stones and acid — every possible item that could kill and burn was used by the rioters. Some say that it was the anti-CAA protesters who started it first while others say that it was allegedly followed after Kapil Mishra’s controversial speech. Now, blame one or blame all, the reality is that 43 humans or to be more specific 43 Indians lost their lives while 200 others were left injured.

The history of the protests started in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh dates back to December 14, 2019. The protests caused traffic snarls, hours of manhours lost not to mention the petrol that was wasted as cars idled and inched forward. However, these protests didn’t take a very ugly turn until a man carrying a pistol marched into the area on January 28, 2020 and allegedly threatened the protesters to vacate the area. All was quiet since then until last week.

The once congested streets are deserted even as the area is limping back to normalcy with some shopkeepers opening their shutters. Yet there is a strange silence in the streets of Jaffrabad, Chandbagh, Kabir Nagar and other adjoining areas. The silence is deafening. One can only imagine what terror the residents of the area had seen in the last seven days.

A resident of Jaffrabad, who witnessed the whole clash says that both Hindus and Muslims have been living in the area for decades but nothing of this sort ever happened between the two communities. “We have been living peacefully in the area with all our Hindu brothers. We are one big family. We don’t have any grudges against any religion. The people who are identified as anti-CAA protesters who pelted stones and caused nuisance are not from our area. We all were silently protesting until these outsiders came and the matter went out of everybody’s hands,” he tells you.

Another resident from the area had another take on why these riots took place in the first place. The silent protest turned violent and that resulted in this clash. “It was initially a clash of ideologies and nothing else but it ultimately turned into a Hindu-Muslim clash which should have not happened at all. People do have different opinions and there is no harm in it. Even in our families, we all do differ in our ideologies and opinions but that doesn’t mean that we will harm our family members. The same should have happened in this case too. The protesters should have come forward and talked about what they wanted instead of turning to violence,” he tells you.

But not all is lost here. The ray of hope in the dark clouds of the horrifying riots that has surrounded the Capital also had some great stories that spoke of Hindu-Muslim unity that stood the test of time.

While some neighbours protected their Muslim brothers and gave them shelter in their homes, other residents stood by their Hindu friends though thick and thin. Some Gurudwaras opened their gates for all the riot affected victims. This in itself is an example that how this senseless act of violence united people from all communities even as rioters did their best to destroy the peace and harmony in the area.

Raj Kumari, a widow who stays with her son Prabhat in a three-storey house in Kabir Nagar recalls the horror that the people of the area had seen last Sunday afternoon. “They destroyed my newly built house. What will I do now? So much of money went into it but those people didn’t think for a second before damaging it,” she says and bursts into tears. Though her neighbours, both Hindus and Muslims, tried a lot to safeguard the house but they couldn’t.

Another local alleged that it all happened after Kapil Mishra’s speech. “It was around 3:30 pm on Sunday when a mob of around 200 people came here and started throwing stones. All of them were outsiders. They damaged Kumari’s house thinking that she was a Muslim. We all tried to stop them but they were uncontrollable. This happened immediately after Mishra’s speech. We have lost four boys from our area in these clashes,” another resident, a neighbour of Kumari, recalls.

As one moved towards Chandbagh, one could see that there was some semblance of normalcy in the area with autos, bikes and cars moving as if the riots had never taken place here. But for some families in Chandbagh, they had no option but to flee out of fear. There were others who wanted to leave a swell but had to stay back because they had no option. A burnt mazaar is the first sight that one sees. One has to gather enough courage and walk a few steps here only to see a fruit shop burnt to ashes. Oranges, grapes and bananas lay scattered even as some people were trying to clean it. Amidst this chaos stood the shattered Noore Khan, the owner of the shop cum home. “See this dark building this was once my home and a way to earn my living. There is nothing left for me. I don’t have any other business. This was my only source of income. It is a loss of lakhs of rupees,” Khan, who has been living in the area for years, tells you.

Even though he tells you that there is some tension, Khan has no worries for altogether different reason. “Isse bura kya ho sakta hai? Ab kya darna. Jo thha sab chala gaya — mera ghar, meri dukaan. Ab kis cheez ke liye fiqr karoon ya ghabraoon? We have lodged an FIR. Let’s see what happens,” he tells you.

Almost 50 steps to the right of Khan’s shop is a small tea stall owned by Prabhu Singh. “Noore is like our brother. Those rioters have taken away everything from him. They first looted his house and shop and lit it,” Singh tells you.

Does mazaar also has a religion? “The rioters set that ablaze as well. Why did they do so? Mazaar toh sab ka hai, sab mante hain ise. Almost 90 per cent of the people who used to visit this mazaar were Hindus. Those rioters were not from our area they were outsiders,” he laments.

Bhaisahab aka Lala, a resident of Moonga Nagar who suffered head injuries during the clash alleges that the petrol bombs and stones were thrown from Tahir Hussain’s building.

“When the clash happened I was out of my home like all the others to stop the attackers and protect our families. It was then when a group of people came, all of them were known to me, woh sab Tahir ke aadmi thhe, they dragged me and two other boys to their area. They beat us up with iron rods and we became unconscious. They left us because they thought we were dead. When we came back into our senses, all three of us managed to flee the area and return to our homes. We tried contacting the police but to no avail,” Lala, who works as a taxi driver, recounts.

One of the locals from the same area too validated Lala’s claims that allegedly Hussain was involved in the riots. “No one has the access to the house cum factory. How was it possible for a mob of around 200 people to enter it without his permission? They were definitely his people who spared no one. Also, from the past few days some kind of suspicious activity was going on in his house. Though we didn’t see any petrol bombs or stones coming to his place but we doubt that he had arranged everything before hand. It was all planned,” he tells you.

Lala alleges that it was Hussain’s people who dragged Ankit Sharma, a 26-year-old IB officer and killed him. “It was around 5:30 pm on Tuesday when Sharma returned from his office. He went outside to assess the situation. It was then when he was attacked by a group of people who took him into Hussain’s factory and closed the gates. After that we don’t know what happened inside the doors. Later, they came and threw his body in the drain,” he says.

No doubt that the violence has left the people of Moonga Nagar in distress who want a strict action should be taken against Hussain and his associates.

Given the situation in the area, security personnel have been deployed at every nook and corner to keep a check. But still there is a strange kind of fear among the people who are awake all night just in case something goes wrong again.

Not that the violence was limited to the aforesaid areas. It spread its wing to Vijay Park too where people had to vacate their houses and leave out of fear.

“Petrol bombs and stones were thrown into our houses by a group of people who chanted religious slogans. They threatened us to go back to our native countries. But, where I ask? India is my motherland, my forefathers have lived here. We were fortunate enough to have managed to flee at the right time,” a resident of the area tells you.

Whosoever must have been the mastermind of these riots but it is only the common people that has suffered losses and will continue

to suffer.

“We don’t feel safe anymore in any part of the country. These riots has shaken us to the core. Whenever we think about that fateful day, it sends shivers down our spines. We are not able to sleep at night. Whenever we hear an unusual sound we are alarmed,” a traumatised local of Chandbagh tells you.

A local resident of Bhajanpura who was at his home when the clash happened says that it was on Monday when a group of people entered the area and started putting the shops on fire. “Many Muslims have rented shops in our area. They have never had any fear in living in a Hindu dominated area until now. That was one of a fateful day when a mob came and burnt the shops of Muslims. We too were in fear and locked ourselves in the homes until everything seemed silent,” he tells you.

Surender, vice-president, Delhi MCD, says that all possible efforts are being made to prevent any thing that would disturb the communal harmony in the Capital. “First of all we strongly condemn such riots. It should have not happened in the first place. But now, our team has been picking up all the stones that could possibly be used for pelting. We also organised a Hindu-Muslim peace and harmony meet day-before-yesterday (February 28, 2020) in Seelampur and received a positive response from both sides. Every one came forward to be a part of the meeting that aimed to promote harmony,” he tells you.

Everything may have come to normal by now but the damaged cause and the lives lost is disheartening. The scenes of the areas will continue to sadden anyone to the core. Burnt vehicles and petrolpumps, broken windows and damaged houses continue to scream of the horror even after three-four days of the incident.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/torn-fabric-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/torn-fabric.html
104,01-3-20,‘Malang broke monotony’,"kunal kemmu He made his debut as a child artist back in 1993 with Sir. Since then it has been a long journey for this actor. He speaks with Shalini Saksena about what the success of Malang means to his career, why Golmaal franchise is popular and his upcoming films

What is your role in Lootcase?

I am very excited about this film that is slated to release in April. It is such a uique comedy. I have done so many but it has a different flavour to it. It has such a great ensemble of starcast — Gajaj Rao, Vijay Raj, Ranvir Shorey. It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Even my character, Nandan, is endearing and relatable. He is just funny, he is not trying to be funny.

What made you agree to Malang?

There were so many things going for this film. First, Mohit (Suri) came to me for this film, he was my first director, and cast me as a lead actor in Kalyug back in 2005. I wanted to work with him. I loved the story and the part that I was offered. Michael (Rodriguez) is so different from the character that I had played in the past. This role was breaking the monotony of the comedy films that people had got used to seeing me in. My character was so interesting with layers to it. I had no reason to turn it down.

You are great at comedy. Why play a negative character?

Why not? As an actor, we get a chance to live different parts. I don’t want to be slotted as one kind of actor. I wanted to play Michael and I am lucky that a part like that came my way. We are in interesting times where we get to see the anti-hero within the hero. We want to see a human side to the character as well.

How tough was it to play this role?

The tricky part was to land correctly even though the role was interesting and inticing. There are so many shades to it that one didn’t know how to go about playing them. Second, how the audience will look at this character. Both Mohit and I followed our instincts. We were sure what we wanted to do. I went with my gut and did it with a lot of honesty. I am happy that it worked and people have given me so much love.

Will the success help further your career graph?

I am happy that not just the film but the character is being loved as well. I am sure it will open up avenues. More importantly, I hope people and makers will see me in a different light and not just one kind of an actor.

You have been in the industry for so long. Have you got your due?

A due is something when your career ends and you look back and decide. I definitely felt that I was not getting chances to utilise my potential to the optimum. With Kalank and Malang, it is at least a beginning. The acceptance has validated my belief in myself. It should have validated the belief of makers in me and see me as an actor who can do multiple genres.

Is Bollywood quick to typecast and restricts potential of actors?

It is a yes and no kind of answer. We can’t talk about this for every person in the industry. Sometimes there are some front leaders who make certain calls, who are bigger players in the business; it depends on how much knowledge they have. I have met some makers who weren’t aware of my earlier work. When they saw Malang, they told me that they never realised that I could play an intense character as well.

Has the changing content opened up roles other than the hero?

Sure. We are in interesting times where the audience has an appetite to accept so much more. This is letting us do interesting films that are not just about heroes and heroines. We are venturing into an area where we are looking at grey characters as opposed to black and white.

What is propelling this change?

It is a symbiotic relationship. It took makers to take that risk. When it worked, it created a demand. The OTT platforms were responsible as well. They started showing content that we are seeing in films. Once the viewership for this increased, there was realisation that people wanted to see more work and filmmakers started taking more risks. If you make a film with honesty, it will be appreciated.

What is the worst thing about Bollywood?

Every industry has some good and bad. Sometimes, it can be unfair and we are judged every Friday. It doesn’t matter how good one is. Everybody’s future rides on that Friday.

Upcoming projects.

I have started working on season 2 of Abhay, the web series. There will Golmaal 5. Then there is talk about Go Goa Gone.

What makes Golmaal series makes so popular?

The movie is more than just about comedy. That is why we put that line in part 4 — that in certain things there is no logic, there is magic. The kind of love that people have towards the characters, one feels blessed to be part of it. We really have a good time when we shooting for it. We don’t have fear on a Friday when this film releases. It is a lovely feeling to be part of this film.kunal kemmu

105,01-3-20,Connect with Nature,"At the two-day international conference on sustainability of natural dyes, a small town, 127 km away from Kochi is setting the benchmark when it comes to using material found in nature, says SHALINI SAKSENA

As one travels through the winding roads from Kochi to Munnar, the spice, cashew laden, noseberry (chiku) trees, the waterfalls on the way and miles and miles of tall greenery all around, one wonders how the idea of doing anything with natural dyes and organic fabric ever came up in this small town? One of course, can’t forget that the region is known for its tea and homemade chocolates. Or the fact that the State has to offer some of the best dishes from the Hindu, Muslim and Syrian Christian cuisine.

Interestingly, the region is also home to empowering specially-abled children through sustainable livelihood development. To celebrate 25 years since Aranya Natural, Srishti Charitable Trust supported by Tata Consumer Products Ltd and Tata Trusts, a two-day international conference on Sustainability of Natural Dyes was held in Munnar, Kerala. The conference also saw workshops by some of the attendees on the techniques of natural dyes. Some of them who showcased the techniques were Michel Garcia, Kyoko Nishimoto and Linda Labelle.

Nishimoto talked about how they made indigo from the plant – by creating the colour in the vat for 10 days. Once the colour is skimmed, the rest of the vat with the water is thrown away without any worry since the dye itself is organic and would not harm the soil. They also showcased the 100 colours they had made from indigo.

Labelle, the owner of The Yarn Tree, a teacher, entrepreneur, author, photographer and; career fiber artist specialising in natural dyeing and weaving talked about what the meaning of sustainability should actually mean instead of it being just used as a buzz word. For her, the word has a deeper connotation since besides being strong on social, economic and environment front, the word must involve everyone concerned —down the person at the grassroot level for it to be sustainable in its truest form.

Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Ayog at the inaugural address to over 200 delegates who had gathered there from across the globe said: “Corporate existence is about society. The Srishti model has shown how long-term sustainability can go a long way in the development of an area. What we have seen here, can be replicated in different areas as well.”

Aranya Natural, one of the units of Srishti Charitable Trust’s mission is to provide employment to specially-abled young adults in the tea plantations of Munnar, while adopting environment-friendly and conscientious practices. These eco-friendly practices include use of forest discards like seeds, flowers, fruits, nuts, pigments from leaves and other raw natural ingredients like turmeric and indigo in the dyeing process.

Ratna Krishnakumar Srishti’s Managing Trustee, tells you that Aranya Natural has become a household name with world famous designers like Ralph Lauren, Eileen Fisher and regular customers.

“Even after 25 years, I am amazed at the talent and creativity displayed by the youngsters here. Their dedication and hard work has led to where it is today — a recognised brand as a 100 per cent natural dyeing unit,” she says.

She tells you that 60 per cent of their products are exports and the rest is sold in the domestic market. Since they are not-for-profit organisation, every penny that the trust earns goes back into bettering the lives of workers including DARE (Developmental Activities in Rehabilitative Education) School for the specially-abled.

In fact, the trust’s journey began with the school that had five-six specially-abled students. Today, 25 years down the line they have over a hundred specially-abled workers employed in various activities like baking, handmade paper, food processing and of course Aranya Natural.

At the global conference, it brought together subject experts and professionals from around eight countries and saw them presenting their papers on the subject, followed by panel discussions. Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada, Dominique Cardon, Axel Becker, Jenny Balfour Paul, Jagada Rajappa, Uzramma and Vikram Joshi were some renowned speakers who talked about sustainability of natural dyes and what more needs to be done to further its presence in the market.

Wada, an internationally celebrated Shibori artist, curator, historian and teacher in the contemporary textile and fiber art field talked about Looking ahead in textile and fashion: What we sustain and how? Michel Garcia, a botanist. chemist, dyer and naturalist, Jagada Rajappa — an independent textile entrepreneur/consultant on natural dyes, LaBelle and Nishimoto were part of a panel discussion Dominique Cardon, the author of Natural Dyes: Sources, Tradition, Technology and Science.

There was some great violin performance by Dr Aneesh Vidyashankar popularly known as India’s walking violinist, followed with a fashion show of collections by reputed designers Sunita Shanker, Sreejith Jeevan and Riddhi Jain showcased by the special associates of Srishti. A dance and music programme the next day brought down the curtains on the conference.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/connect-with-nature-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/connect-with-nature.html
106,01-3-20,‘It’s an exciting time for musicians’,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with SHALMALI KHOLGADE, who debuted in Bollywood with the song Pareshaan, about what music means to her and the latest single Kalle Kalle

What made you come up with Kalle Kalle?

I’ve always felt that the Indian music industry doesn’t have enough songs that have female expression. Now I get to do that through my independent music — I have often experienced a lot of joy and self growth when I’ve been between relationships and that’s precisely where this song stems from — the most important thought behind this song being, staying happy with oneself is most important, before involving anyone else in to seek love from or give love to.

Having sung so many songs, which one comes close to your heart?

All the songs I’ve sung are close to my heart, but off late I’d say, my two singles Ruka Ruka and Kalle Kalle make me the happiest.

How did your music career begin?

My journey till date has been the one that has only taught me how to keep looking ahead and making more of myself every day. I’m grateful for the opportunities that came my way and the people who made it possible. I began my career in Bollywood with Pareshaan thanks to the amazing Amit Trivedi. Pritam, Vishal Shekhar, Sajid Wajid, Sachin Jigar have been instrumental in shaping my career. Now, having signed to Big Bang Music I embark on a new journey of self expression — through independent music.

What does music mean to you?

It’s been over 10 years since I decided that I want to make music my life. The love I have for music keeps growing, it makes me reach newer heights, try new things, goes beyond just using my vocal chords, but the performance and the presentation of it. It’s a whole world in itself. Music is what I live in and will always remain in.

Where is Indian music heading today?

It brings me a lot of excitement to say this — our music industry is turning to independent music with its beautifully shot music videos and the pop culture that was missing for a long time. It’s a very exciting time for musicians and I’m so happy to be part of it.

Was there a song which you were initially apprehensive about but it did well?

I didn’t know Besharmi Ki Height would do as well as it did. From that album I had thought that Shanivaar Rati would do better.

Some best moment from your journey.

Being called by Amit Trivedi to sing Main Pareshaan is the one. Not knowing that Arijit Singh was recording me for Daru Desi when I went to dub the song. To top that thinking that Arijit was Pritam! That is a memory that isn’t going anywhere. Vishal Dadlani laughing away making me sing Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai is the most enjoyable experience in YRF studios. Recently singing Kalle Kalle at DA-IICT, a college audience that knew the lyrics and sang along was also a great experience.

What are your upcoming projects?

I plan to release more independent music this year. I want the audience I’m building to know that I’m going to constantly give them good music to listen to and groove to.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---it---s-an-exciting-time-for-musicians----2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---it---s-an-exciting-time-for-musicians---.html
107,01-3-20,Health and taste is in the roots,"There is an adage — health is wealth. Frank Rand said: Everything good in life is either illegal, immoral, or fattening. This is so apt when it comes to food. The general perception is that anything that is healthy can’t be tasty. But what if someone were to tell you that this is possible? That one can eat a Risotto? That one can eat a burger? That one can desserts without worrying too much about the calorie intake? All this and much more is possible if one heads to Taj Vivanta Surajkund. Their restaurant — Oasis — has introduced a menu which you back to the days when ragi, bajra and millets were an everyday part of the meal.

One is told that the idea is to introduce people to these grains that are high in nutritive value but have now almost disappeared from our kitchens. If you are a vegetarian, the salad is a good choice to begin with. The red rice and barley is surprisingly good. One would not thought that a salad with this grain would be good. With the goodness of vitamins and minerals, this salad makes for a great way to whet one’s appetite and get the taste buds going for the next course that can be a soup. The vegetable quinoa soup is perfect blend of spices that has healthy dosage of veggies.

Those who though that a burger is full of calories couldn’t be more wrong. The multigrain burger of kado millet chicken burger is no different than the normal wheat flour burger that we are used to. The chicken patty is just as good. The spices and the patty more than make up for the fact that it is sans the cheese and mayonnaise.

But the surprise and the must try is the barley risotto. If one didn’t know that it was barley, it would be difficult to distinguish when it comes to taste. This risotto is just as creamy without adding the Cheddar cheese when cooking. Of course, those who are watching their weight will love this dish. Those who are not so conscious need not stay away from this dish since the risotto comes with a generous bowl of Cheddar on the side.

If one lands up for breakfast, there is a choice there as well. The ragi flour dosa may put off some due to the dark brown colour of the dosa, there is nothing wrong the taste or the sambhar and the chutneys that come with it. One can go for Teff pancakes with whipped cream and fruit compote. The twist of replacing maple syrup with fruit compote is interesting.

No meal is complete without dessert. While the apple infused crème brulee with barley granola is on the sweet side, the granola bar made from jaggery is full of goodness and is healthy. The Amaranth cupcakes with almond milk reduction is not too sweet and a great way to end a perfect meal.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/health-and-taste-is-in-the-roots-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/health-and-taste-is-in-the-roots.html

Of the total 2,98,907 names of farmers figured in the second list of beneficiaries in the “Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karj mukti Yojana”, as many as 2,52,483 are from Ahmednagar district, while Wardha district accounts for 46,424 farmers.

However, the names of farmers in two villages –Babudi Dhumat and Vilad – in Wardha district did not figure in the second list as Gram Panchayat elections are being held in these two villages.

Like in the first list of farmers released early this week, the loans taken by 2.99 lakh farmers - ranging from Rs Rs have been waived in the second list of beneficiaries.

In the first list of beneficiaries in the farm loan waiver scheme released by on Monday, the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had written off the loans of 15,358 farmers from 68 villages from across the state. The names of farmers from 68 villages in the districts of Parbhani, Ahmednagar and Amravati districts, had figured in the first list of loan waiver beneficiaries

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced that the state government had collated the names of 34,83,908 farmers who were eligible for farm loan waiver.

As per the latest information, the State Government is estimating that the total number farm loan waiver-beneficiaries will be 36.45 lakh. “Of the estimated 6.45 lakh farmers, the accounts of 34.98 lakh farmers have been uploaded on the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karj mukti Yojana,” a senior State Government official said.

The MVA Government has made an allocation of Rs 24,723 crore for implementing the farm loan waiver scheme. In the supplementary budget demands presented in the Assembly, the State Government has set aside Rs 15,000 crore, while the Government had allocated Rs 10,000 crore for the loan waiver scheme from the exigency funds.

109,01-3-20,ED attaches Rs 2.6 cr worth of assets in JKCA fraud case,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs 2.6 crore in a money laundering case related to the alleged embezzlement of funds of the Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA).

A provisional order for attachment of assets has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against former treasurer of JKCA Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and its finance committee member Mir Mansoor Gazanffer, the agency said on Saturday.

Former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah has been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in the case.

Abdullah has been slapped with the Public Safety Act (PSA) and is under detention since August 5 last year when the Union government abrogated Article 370 provisions that accorded special status to the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir and bifurcated it into Union territories of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh.

“The attached assets consist of three FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) totaling Rs 1.29 crore with J&K Bank branch in Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi in the name of Mirza Sons, a partnership firm of Mirza and his father.

“11 Kanals of land with structure and commercial shopping complex at Pandrethan, Srinagar to the tune of Rs 1.31 crore has also been attached,” the ED said in a statement.

The ED case is based on a CBI FIR as part of which the latter probe agency booked former office-bearers of JKCA, including general secretary Mohd Saleem Khan and Mirza.

The CBI later filed a charge sheet against Farooq Abdullah, Khan, Mirza, Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali, Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh (former accountant of JKCA) for “misappropriation of

JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore” from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to the association for promoting the sport in the state between 2002-11.

The ED said its probe found that during financial years 2005-2006 to 2011-2012 (up to December 2011) JKCA received Rs 94.06 crore from BCCI in three different bank accounts.

“However, several other bank accounts were opened in the name of JKCA into which these funds were transferred. Such other bank accounts along with the existing bank accounts were later used for laundering funds of JKCA,” the ED alleged.

Besides, it said, Mirza transferred huge amounts into his personal bank accounts and then these amounts were further transferred or withdrawn in cash.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ed-attaches-rs-2-6-cr-worth-of-assets-in-jkca-fraud-case.html
110,01-3-20,Bengali actor resigns from BJP,"A popular Bengali actor, who joined the BJP in 2013, has resigned from the primary membership of the party expressing dismay over the “recent hate-filled situation” in the country.

She put in her papers on Friday. The BJP, however, hoped she will reconsider the decision. “I had joined the party with a lot of hope and optimism. But, the recent violence in Delhi, the growing atmosphere of hatred and violence, made me feel disturbed,” Subhadra Mukherjee told reporters on Saturday.

Mukherjee, who has already sent in her resignation letter to BJP State unit president Dilip Ghosh, also said, “Why should brothers cut each other’s throats in the name of religion? I was disturbed after hearing the news of deaths of over 40 people.”

The actor said she did not want to be associated with “this brand of politics” where people can be judged by their religion and not as fellow humans.

111,01-3-20,Nitish to give pep talk to JD(U) rank & file on b’day today,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will give a pep talk to the rank and file of the JD(U), which he heads, at the massive conclave of party workers from across the State here on Sunday, sources said on Saturday.

The ‘Karyakarta Sammelan’ at the Gandhi Maidan will be a virtual show of strength by the party before the assembly elections due later this year, a source said.

“We are looking forward to receiving inspiration from the Chief Minister. His addresses are always special. But this time, it is more so as it falls on his birthday,” JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad told PTI.

Kumar, who is just a few months shy of becoming the longest-serving Chief Minister of Bihar, turns 69 on March 1.

“We cannot think of a better birthday gift than ensuring his return to power with a resounding majority. The party has set a target of securing more than 200 seats for the NDA out of the total 243. This includes putting up a spectacular performance ourselves and helping our alliance partners to win handsomely,” Prasad added.

The NDA in Bihar comprises the JD(U), BJP and Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the coalition had won 39 out of 40 seats in the State and established leads in more than 220 Assembly segments.

JD(U) had come into being in 2003 with the merger of three breakaway factions of the Janata Dal which was founded, but soon abandoned by former Prime Minister VP Singh.

Initially, it was headed by the late socialist leader George Fernandes, while Sharad Yadav, who was the president of one of the splinter groups who came together to form the new entity, headed the parliamentary board.

However, it was Kumar —the master negotiator seen as the driving force — that caused the formerly squabbling factions to come together. He came to be acknowledged as JD(U)s de facto leader.

In the course of time, Fernandes faded into oblivion after an attempt at revolt instigated by Kumar’s detractors within the party. Yadav, who took over as the party chief, was shown the door a few years ago when he defied Kumar.

Kumar’s stock rose further after becoming the chief minister of Bihar.

Over the last decade he has survived many setbacks. Frequent change of alliance partners have made detractors question his credibility, though his polar position in the state’s politics remains unquestioned. After his controversial decision to abruptly end the alliance with the Congress-RJD combine and return to the NDA fold, Kumar has been able to keep communal incidents like cow vigilantism and riots under check.

Though staying in the NDA coalition, he has refused to toe the BJP line on issues like the instant triple talaq and Article 370.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nitish-to-give-pep-talk-to-jd-u--rank---file-on-b---day-today.html

116,01-3-20,Mukesh Ambani meets Jagan; Parimal Nathwani accompanies him,"Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani on Saturday made a sudden visit to Andhra Pradesh and met Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.

The State Government has kept Mukesh’s visit a ‘top secret’ until he arrived in Gannavaram airport and proceeded to meet Jagan at CM’s camp office in Tadepalli.

Both were closeted for about one and a half hour.

Jagan’s close aide and Rajya Sabha member Y Vijayasai Reddy received Mukesh at Gannavaram airport and both travelled by road to reach CM’s camp office.

Mukesh was accompanied by his close friend, industrialist and Rajya Sabha member Parimal Nathwani and his son Anant Ambani.

Parimal Natwani accompanying Mukesh to meet Jagan fuelled political speculations that Mukesh lobbied for Rajya Sabha seat for Parimal under AP quota with the help of YSRCP.

This is because Parimal is currently serving as Rajya Sabha member from Jharkhand. His tenure is set to end on April 19. The notification for Rajya Sabha polls in AP was issued recently. Four Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant in AP and YSRCP will win all these four seats based on its brute majority the party secrured in the Assembly elections. YSRCP won 151 seats in the 175-member Assembly in May 2019 elections.

In this backdrop, it is learnt the Mukesh wanted Jagan to renominate his friend Parimal from AP to the Rajya Sabha and for that reason he brought Parimal along with him to meet Jagan. It was learnt that Parimal’s renomination from his home state Jharkhan as an independent turned difficult with former Union Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) president Shibu Soren deciding to take a plunge back into politics with the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls.

Besides, sources said, Jagan and Mukesh also discussed about reviving the Reliance electronic manufacturing hub at Tirupati.

Reliance has business interests in Andhra Pradesh and in 2018, Mukesh Ambani had made the grand announcement of starting an electronics park in Tirupati, spread over 150 acres. The park was supposed to manufacture mobile phones and television sets.

Reliance in February 2019 had signed an MoU with plans to set up a Rs 15,000 crore electronics manufacturing hub at Tirupati. The MoU was signed by the previous TDP government, which allotted 150 acres. However, the land could not be handed over due to controversy over compensation package after some farmers approached courts on this issue.

Subsequently, TDP lost Assembly polls in May 2019 and after YSRCP government came to power, the project could not make any headway with no initiative from both the sides.

Mukesh is learnt to have expressed his desire to go ahead with the Tirupati project if the state government hands over 150 acres at the earliest.

There was also a talk that Ambani was unhappy over the allegations levelled by YSRC leaders against him over the untimely death of Jagan’s father and former chief minister late Y S Rajasekhar Reddy in September 2009.

There were reports in Jagan’s media group “Sakshi” those days, quoting a Russian magazine Exile, which claimed that YSR’s death was not an accident but a pre-planned murder, conspired by Mukesh Ambani and others, including some leaders in the Congress party.

It alleged that Ambani had spent nearly Rs 1,000 crore to eliminate YSR for opposing allotment of natural gas and oil reserves worth Rs 38,000 crore in Krishna-Godavari basin to Reliance group. However, the allegations were never substantiated and it turned out to be a fake story.

The Saturday’s meeting between Mukesh and Jagan is learnt to have helped both to clear the air and also to restore the confidence of investors in Andhra Pradesh at a time when Opposition is alleging that industries and investors are shying away from AP after Jagan became CM.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mukesh-ambani-meets-jagan--parimal-nathwani-accompanies-him.html

""His shop is located near Lethpora bridge, and as advised by Mohammad Umar, he started conducting reconnaissance of the movement of CRPF convoy on Jammu-Srinagar Highway in January 2019, and informed Mohammad Umar and Adil Ahmad Dar about it,"" it added.

The NIA statement further said that Magrey was also involved in modifying the Maruti Eeco car and fitting the IED in it in early February 2019.

""During investigation, the make, model and number of the car used in the attack was quickly ascertained by NIA to be a Maruti Eeco through forensic examination of the tiny remnants of the car, which were seized from the spot during extended searches. This has been corroborated by Magrey,"" the statement said.

It added that explosives used in the attack were determined to be Ammonium Nitrate, Nitro-Glycerin and RDX.

""Investigation has also confirmed the identity of the suicide bomber to be Adil Ahmad Dar through DNA matching with that of his father,"" the statement said.

Other key militants involved in the attack have been found to be Muddasir Ahmad Khan, (JeM's divisional commander in South Kashmir who was killed in an operation by security forces on March 11, 2019), Pakistani militant Muhammad Umar Farooq and IED expert Kamran, (both killed on March 29, 2019), the owner of the car Sajjad Ahmad Bhat from Anantnag (killed on June 16, 2019) and Qari Yassir, JeM's commander for Kashmir (killed on January 25, 2020).

The suicide attack on the CRPF convoy moving from Jammu towards Srinagar on February 14, 2019 near Pulwama had claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.

Magrey was produced before a Special NIA court in Jammu on Friday and remanded to 15 days NIA custody for detailed interrogation.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-raids-jem-aide-s-residence-in-pulwama.html

“Our party fought against the misrule of BJP Government in Chhattisgarh for 15 years and now we are ready to fight against (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi’s Government at the Centre,” Markam said.

“The Centre is misusing Central agencies and hatching a conspiracy to defame and destablise a strong Congress Government in the State,” he alleged. “The State Government has exposed the misdeeds during the BJP rule. Therefore, in frustration, they conducted raids with a malafide intention to create an atmosphere of fear,” Markam claimed.

123,01-3-20,SBI for insurance cover for lending to jewellery industry,"Country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said on Saturday that the gems and jewellery industry should have insurance cover for banks to “lend courageously” to the sector.

He said the presence of an insurance cover will also lower capital requirement of the industry for jewellery exports.

“Absence of an insurance cover is hurting lending to the gems and jewellery industry by banks. If there is an insurance cover, it will help the bank to lend courageously to the sector,” SBI deputy managing director (clients group-I) PN Prasad said here.

Speaking at an event, organised by ICC here, he said the exposure of SBI to the jewellery industry is around Rs 20,000 crore, adding that the lending growth to the sector has been muted at present.

124,01-3-20,Turkey raises migrant pressure on EU over Syria conflict,"Turkey on Saturday threatened to allow tens of thousands of refugees to leave for Europe and warned Damascus will ""pay a price"" as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stepped up pressure after dozens of Turkish troops were killed inside Syria.

At the Turkish border, Greek police clashed with several thousand migrants who were already gathered at the entrance into EU territory.

Young migrants lobbed rocks at Greek riot police as tear gas wafted through the trees on the frontier. Turkey and Russia, which back opposing forces in the Syria conflict,

held talks to try to defuse tensions triggered after the Turkish troops were killed, sparking fears of a broader war and a new migration crisis for Europe.But Erdogan raised the stakes on Saturday and vowed to allow refugees rkey which he said can not handle new waves of people fleeing Syria.

It already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.

The comments were his first after 34 Turkish troops were killed since Thursday in the northern Syria province of Idlib where Moscow-backed

Syrian regime forces are battling to retake the last rebel enclave.

""What did we do yesterday? We opened the doors,"" Erdogan said in Istanbul.

""We will not close those doors ...Why? Because the European Union should keep its promises.""

He was referring to a 2016 deal with the European Union to stop refugee flows in exchange for billions of euros in aid. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held an emergency meeting to discuss the border.

Erdogan said 18,000 migrants have amassed on the Turkish borders with Europe since Friday, adding that the number could reach as many as 30,000 on Saturday.

Thousands of migrants stuck on the Turkish-Greek border at Pazarkule were in skirmishes with Greek police on Saturday who fired tear gas to push them back, according to AFP photographer in the western province of Edirne.

Ahmad Barhoum, a Syrian refugee, said he was trapped at the border since Friday.

""If they do no open we will try to cross by illegal means. It's out of the question for us to go back to Istanbul,"" he told AFP.

""I hope that they will end up letting us in so that we can start a new life in Europe worthy of human beings,"" said one Egyptian refugee.

In 2015, Greece became the main EU entry point for one million migrants, most of them refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. The pressure to cope with the influx split the European Union.

""Greece yesterday came under an organised, mass, illegal attack...

A violation of our borders and endured it,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas said Saturday after the emergency meeting with Mitsotakis. ""We averted more than 4,000 attempts of illegal entrance to our land borders.""

A Greek police source said security forces fired tear gas Saturday against migrants on the Turkish side because they had set fires and opened holes in border fences.

Armed policemen and soldiers patrolled the Evros river shores- a common crossing point - and warned with loudspeakers not to enter Greek territory. Drones also monitored migrant movements.""I believe that the borders have been protected,"" Defense Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told Skai television.

According to Hellenic Coast Guard, from early Friday to early Saturday 180 migrants reached the islands of Eastern Aegean, Lesbos and Samos in sea crossings. The UN said nearly a million people -- half of them children -- have been displaced in the bitter cold by the fighting in northwest Syria since December. Turkey said its forces destroyed a ""chemical warfare facility,"" just south of Aleppo, in part of its military retaliation after its soldiers were killed in Idlib.

125,01-3-20,US court suspends its block on Trump's ‘Remain in Mexico' policy,"A US court Friday suspended its decision to block a key asylum policy of Donald Trump's administration which has forced many applicants to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed, allowing border officials to continue enforcing the White House directive.

The policy - known as ""Remain in Mexico"" and part of the US president's signature crackdown on migration -has been used to send tens of thousands of asylum seekers from Central America back to Mexico, but was placed on hold by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday.

The court initially ruled the policy ""is invalid in its entirety"" under US law concerning migrant rights and UN refugee protocols, and should be blocked ""in its entirety.""

But just hours later, the court unanimously voted to stay its order, US media reported, with the three-judge panel telling the government and the plaintiffs to file written arguments by Monday and Tuesday next week.

After welcoming the court's initial ruling the American Civil Liberties Union -- one of the groups that challenged the government in court -- said the suspension was a ""temporary step.""

""We will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy,"" attorney Judy Rabinovitz said in a statement to US media.

Earlier, the White House had blasted the block, warning it could ""flood the nation's immigration system"" and ""present unchecked coronavirus entry risk.""

The San Francisco court had allowed the policy to go ahead last year, pending the appeal, overruling a district judge who had ruled against the measure.

The district judge had heard evidence that migrants returned to Mexico under the policy faced discrimination, physical violence, sexual assault, corruption and lack of food and shelter.

More than 60,000 people have been returned to Mexico under the program since it was introduced in January 2019, according to the White House.

""The policy is facially and flatly illegal,"" tweeted Harvard Law School constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe.

On Friday, the US Customs and Border Security shut down the Paso Del Norte crossing in southern Texas as news of the court's block spread on social media.

""CBP stopped traffic at Paso Del Norte bridge at 7:20 pm Friday preventing the ability for a group of migrants to illegally and forcefully surge through the port of entry,"" the force tweeted.

The West Texas branch of the CBP added that the crossing - one of the busiest - would remain closed overnight, although no other ports were shut.

Earlier, a Department of Justice spokesman said the Trump administration had ""acted faithfully"" and slammed the court's ruling which ""highlights the consequences and impropriety of nationwide injunctions.""

The White House said it was ""considering all available legal options to seek further review of this decision,"" and called the asylum policy ""hugely successful.""

The number of detained migrants soared in recent years as hundreds of thousands of people, mostly from Central America, poured into the United States, with many seeking asylum.

A crackdown including the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy has seen border apprehensions plunge in recent months.

The figure stood at fewer than 37,000 last month, from more than 58,000 a year earlier.

But Refugee International warned Friday that the asylum policy ""means the difference between life and death"" for migrants ""cruelly pushed into harm and deprivation in Mexico.""

In a separate ruling Friday, the same appeals court also struck down the Trump policy of blocking anyone entering illegally without going through an official port of entry from applying for asylum.

""Together, the two decisions represent a significant setback for the Trump administration's efforts to restrict asylum applications,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor.

""This issue is surely headed to the Supreme Court,"" he added.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-court-suspends-its-block-on-trump-s----remain-in-mexico--policy.html

Philip Rutnam, Permanent Secretary in the department led by 47-year-old

Patel, said there had been a “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him over the last 10 days and pointed the finger of blame at the minister.

“The Home Secretary (Patel) categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her,” he said in a statement.

“Even despite this campaign, I was willing to effect a reconciliation with the Home Secretary, as requested by the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Prime Minister. But despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this,” the statement said.

Rutnam said his experience formed part of a wider pattern in government and that he plans to take legal action on the grounds of constructive dismissal. “I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal, and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts. My experience has been extreme, but I consider there is evidence that it was part of a wider pattern of behaviour,” his statement adds.

The resignation comes just days after he and Patel had issued a joint statement in an effort to quell media reports of discord within the Home Office. “The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media,” a UK Home Office spokesperson said on Monday, when the government took the rare step to issue a formal statement to quash rumours circulating around the frosty relationship between the minister and her top civil servant.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-civil-servant-at-centre-of-home-secy-priti-patel-row-quits-post.html

129,01-3-20,Japan cherry blossom festivals cancelled as virus fears grow,"Major cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been cancelled due to the deadly new coronavirus, the latest in a growing list of events quashed as the epidemic spreads globally.

The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April.

""We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing... But please give us your understanding,"" the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday.

Other cherry blossom events -feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists -are likely to follow suit, according to local media.

130,01-3-20,Japan's Abe vows fresh emergency package,"Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday pledged another emergency package to tackle the coronavirus, appealing for cooperation as he faces criticism over drastic prevention measures.

The plan comes as the Government ramps up its response to the virus, which has infected at least 230 people across the country and been linked to five deaths. ""We will swiftly compile a second emergency package"" by using reserve funds worth more than 270 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in around 10 days, Abe told a news conference.

In mid-February the Government set aside an initial 15.3 billion

yen for the fight against the virus, including money to boost testing, strengthen inspections at borders and support manufacturers of face masks.

""On my own responsibility, I will take the best possible measures against various issues,"" Abe said Saturday. He also vowed to speed up the introduction of legislation aimed at easing the impact of the virus on people's lives.

But Abe added that ""we cannot score a victory in this battle only with the government's efforts"".

""It is not easy to battle against the enemy that you can't see or know well,"" he said.""But I'm convinced we will certainly overcome this."" On Thursday Abe urged schools nationwide to close for several weeks to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

The government cannot order schools to shut, a power that belongs to local councils, and authorities in many regions said they were not consulted about the decision.

Some local governments expressed opposition to the idea along with parents in need of child care.

Authorities say the coming two to three weeks will determine whether the outbreak can be contained, a major concern in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics in July.Abe pledged ""full preparations by maintaining close coordination"" with the Tokyo government and the International Olympic Committee.The Japanese government has asked organisers to consider cancelling

or postponing other major events, with everything from football matches to concerts already cancelled in recent days.But a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping planned for the spring ""remains unchanged right now"", Abe said.

Japan has also fielded criticism over its handling of a quarantined cruise ship where more than 700 people tested positive for the virus.

Interacting with the chairpersons of major port trusts during the ‘Chintan Baithak’ being held by the Ministry of Shipping in Mamallapuram, the Vice-President stressed upon the need to harness India’s vast coast for the sustainable growth and development of the country.

He called for developing all Indian ports on par with other global ports and said the creation of world-class infrastructure at ports was important for India to become a $5 trillion economy.

He added that India has an excellent opportunity for port-led development as ports were inevitable for exports and imports.

Further, he advised the ports to adopt best practices to effectively utilise their financial resources to derive maximum benefits.

Naidu asked them to reduce logistics cost, dredging expenditure and also improve turnaround time.

“We need to create more transshipment hubs on either side of the coasts,” he said.

135,01-3-20,Oil prices fall as virus spreads outside China,"With the viral outbreak spreading to more countries, the price of oil has dropped precipitously as global demand weakens even further. That has sent shares tumbling for oil giants like Exxon and Chevron while smaller producers with idling rigs continue to slash jobs.

Hundreds of new cases of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease have been announced in recent days outside of China. The list of countries touched by the illness has climbed to nearly 60 as Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Iceland and the Netherlands reported their first cases. More than 85,000 people worldwide have contracted the illness, with deaths topping 2,900. Oil industry analysts fear that what they thought was a contained disruption may instead lead to more travel restrictions and even less oil consumed.

“That was the fear all along, that the virus would not be contained in China,” said Claudio Galimberti, head of demand, refining and agriculture at S&P Global Platts.

“There are entire cities, and in some cases regions, that are in a lockdown. When you begin to have a lockdown, people work from home, factories shut down, people don’t travel. The impact on oil is very, very bad.”

Oil prices fell dramatically in mid-February, but had been steadily climbing back as the number of new cases of the virus in China slowed. In the last week, however, reports of the spreading virus knocked prices down. The benchmark for US crude oil fell 16 per cent during the week, settling Friday at $44.76 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 14 per cent for the week to its lowest levels since July 2017, closing Friday at $50.52 a barrel. Meanwhile, shares of Exxon Mobil tumbled to $49.82 on Thursday, reaching a 15-year low, before rebounding more than 3 per cent on Friday. Chevron Corp. Shares hit their lowest level in nearly four years on Friday.

The Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia is pushing for deep cuts in oil production to help stabilise prices in the face of falling demand. The newspaper, citing people familiar with the talks, said the Saudis propose to bear most of the brunt of a cutback of 1 million barrels per day but want Russia and other big producers to join them. Representatives of OPEC and allies like Russia plan to meet next week.

If demand for oil and the price of a barrel continues to fall, that may result in lower gasoline prices — a potential bright side for consumers, who account for about 70 per cent of US economic activity.

Gasoline prices have been fluctuating in recent weeks, but nothing significant that could be attributed to the coronavirus, said Jeanette Casselano, director of public relations at AAA. Prices tend to rise for the summer driving season, but the effects of coronavirus on the price of oil could mitigate that.

Lower prices at the pump, however, aren’t necessarily good for the US economy overall. When energy prices fall, energy companies tend to cut back on investment and jobs. A freefall in gasoline prices led to a sharp drop in US business investment in 2016, for instance — one reason the country’s economic growth slowed to 1.6 per cent that year from 2.9 per cent in 2015.

When the coronavirus first hit, the Energy Information Administration predicted global oil demand would fall to 100.3 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020, down about 900,000 barrels, or 1 per cent, from what was estimated in January.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oil-prices-fall-as-virus-spreads-outside-china-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-prices-fall-as-virus-spreads-outside-china.html
136,01-3-20,Labour ministry keen to retain 8.65 pc interest rate on EPF deposits for 2019-20,"The labour ministry is keen to retain an interest rate of 8.65 per cent paid on provident fund deposits to around six crore subscribers of retirement fund body EPFO for the current financial year, a source said.

The apex decision making body of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) -- Central Board of Trustees -- is likely to consider the rate of interest on EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) deposits in its meeting scheduled on March 5, 2020.

""The proposal to provide interest rate on EPF deposits for 2019-20 may come up for consideration and approval in the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) meeting on March 5,"" a source said.

The source further said that the ministry is keen to retain the interest rate at 8.65 per cent, as was provided in financial year 2018-19.

Speculations are rife that the interest rate on EPF may be lowered to 8.5 per cent for the current fiscal, a tad lower than 8.65 per cent provided for 2018-19.

According to the source, the agenda for the CBT meeting has not yet been finalised and it is difficult to predict EPFO's income projections for the current fiscal, which will be the basis for fixing the interest rate.

The finance ministry has been nudging the labour ministry for aligning the EPF interest rate with other small saving schemes run by the government like the public provident fund and post office saving schemes.

The labour ministry requires the finance ministry's concurrence to provide a rate of interest on EPF deposits in a fiscal year. Since the Government of India is the guarantor, finance ministry has to vet the proposal for EPF interest rate to avoid any liability on account of shortfall in the EPFO income for a fiscal.

The EPFO had provided 8.65 per cent rate of interest to its subscribers for 2016-17 and 8.55 per cent in 2017-18. The rate of interest was slightly higher at 8.8 per cent in 2015-16.

It had provided 8.75 per cent rate of interest in 2013-14 as well as 2014-15, higher than 8.5 per cent for 2012-13.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/labour-ministry-keen-to-retain-8-65-pc-interest-rate-on-epf-deposits-for-2019-20-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/labour-ministry-keen-to-retain-8-65-pc-interest-rate-on-epf-deposits-for-2019-20.html
137,01-3-20,"FPIs invest Rs 6,554 cr in Indian capital markets in Feb","Overseas investors invested only Rs 6,554 crore in Indian markets on net basis in February, as they adopted a cautious stance amid coronavirus scare, subdued economic data and disappointing corporate earnings.

According to the depositories data, Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pumped in a net amount of Rs 1,820 crore into equities and Rs 4,734 crore into the debt segment between February 3 to 28.

This took the total net investment to Rs 6,554 crore during the period under review.

On a positive note, the data, however, showed that FPIs have been net buyers in the Indian markets since September 2019.

“Like other global markets, the Indian markets too came in the line of fire by the coronavirus scare. FPIs have been wary of investing in markets which rely on tourism as the spread of virus can adversely impact their prospects and economic growth.

""From this perspective, Indian equity market is better positioned among such group of countries and hence it has been attracting foreign flows,” Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Analyst Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India said.

Market participants, however, believe that headwinds to foreign investment flows are expected to continue over the coming weeks.

FPIs have adopted a cautious stance on the back of lack of growth in the domestic economy, disappointing corporate earnings and social unrest that the country is facing, he added.

The 30-share sentitive index Sensex logged its second-biggest one-day fall in history on February 28 on coronavirus concerns.

According to Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww, an online Mutual Fund Investment Platform, ""India's GDP increased to 4.7 per cent in the last quarter, which is a good news. But given the influence this virus has on the global markets, it is doubtful that FPIs will make any solid investments in the next few weeks.""

On the economy front, India's GDP growth slipped to a nearly 7-year low of 4.7 per cent in October-December 2019, weighed by a contraction in manufacturing sector output, according to official data released February 28.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-invest-rs-6-554-cr-in-indian-capital-markets-in-feb-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-invest-rs-6-554-cr-in-indian-capital-markets-in-feb.html

139,01-3-20,Shafali has freedom to play natural game,"India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Saturday said the team management has given Shafali Verma the freedom to play her natural game, which has set the Women’s T20 World Cup ablaze.

The 16-year-old announced her emergence on the global stage by becoming the second highest run getter in the ongoing tournament. She has so far scored 161 runs, hitting 18 fours and nine sixes in four matches at an astounding strike rate of 161.

“Shafali is someone who loves to play big shots, and we don’t want to stop her. She should continue doing the same and she should continue enjoying her game,” Harmanpreet said after the match.

India entered the semifinals with an all-win record and the captain insisted it is important to continue the winning momentum.

“It’s really important to keep the momentum when you are winning games. You really work hard, so you can’t afford to lose that momentum.”

The skipper, herself known to be a power hitter, has endured a poor start to the tournament by failing to reach double digit scores. However, against Sri Lanka, she hit two boundaries and a maximum.

“Today I tried to be positive and got a few boundaries. In the upcoming games I’ll try to give my best,” Harmanpreet said.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Atapattu rued the reprieves given by her side to Shafali in the form of two dropped catches.

“I think that score was not enough, we lost couple of chances, specially Shafali, it was hard to stop her,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shafali-has-freedom-to-play-natural-game.html
140,01-3-20,India remain unbeaten,"Spinner Radha Yadav flummoxed the rival batting line-up with a career-best 4/23 before Shafali Verma’s blistering 34-ball 47 powered India to a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Saturday. Opting to to bat, Sri Lanka were restricted to a modest 113 for nine in their final Group A match with left-arm spinner Radha (4/23) running through the rivals’ batting line-up, including claiming the prized scalp of skipper Chamari Atapattu.

Shafali, then, top-scored as India chased down the target in just 14.4 overs.

The win meant India entered the semifinals with an all-win record. This was India’s fourth successive victory in the tournament as the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side consolidated their position on top of the group with eight points.

The 16-year-old Shafali, who was dropped twice in the second and fourth over, hit seven fours and a six in her knock but was unable to reach her maiden fifty for the second time in the tournament, getting run-out in the 11th over.

She had scored 46 against New Zealand in her previous outing.

Kaur and opener Smriti Mandhana again squandered their good starts, departing for 15 and 17, respectively.

Mandhana mistimed the ball to Kavisha Dilhari in the fifth over while the skipper departed while trying to clear the long on fielder in the 10th over.

For Sri Lanka, Udeshika Prabodhani (1/13) and Shashikala Siriwardene (1/42)picked up a wicket each, before the duo of Jemimah Rodrigues (15) and Deepti Sharma (15) sealed the victory.

Earlier, Sri Lanka were dealt a blow when opener Umesha Thimashini (2) tried to go for a big shot off a Deepti Sharma delivery, only to be caught by Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the third over.

In-from skipper Atapattu (33) continued to attack, hitting five fours and a six, and stitched a 30-run partnership with Harshitha Madavi (12).

However, left-arm spinner Gayakwad tightened the screws in the eighth over, bowling a wicket maiden while dismissing Madavi.

The introduction of Radha in the ninth over worked as immediately after hitting a six over deep wicket, the Sri Lankan captain was caught at square leg.

Sri Lanka then suffered a batting collapse as Radha accounted for Hansima Karunaratne (7) and Hasini Perera (7) in her next over. She also dismissed wicket-keeper Anushka Sanjeewani (1).

The Indian spinners dominated the proceedings as besides Radha, Gayakwad (2/18) picked up two wickets, while Deepti (1/16), Shikha Pandey (1/35), and Poonam Yadav (1/20) took one apiece.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-remain-unbeaten.html

Daniel Farke's side ended a four-game winless run as they took three points for just the second time in 15 league matches.

The hosts ended the day at 63 for no loss with both the Toms—Latham (27 batting) and Blundell (29 batting) hardly troubled by Indian pacers.

The pitch will be best for batting on days two and three which means that for Virat Kohli and his men, the catch-up game starts from the second day itself as ignominy of a 0-2 series loss looms large.

On a green-top, three Indian batsmen showed that scoring runs wasn’t difficult.

Shaw’s lunging drive after his second half-century in Tests and Vihari and Pujara’s ill-timed pull shots were a testimony that their dismissals were more about profligacy than New Zealand’s bowling.

Rishabh Pant, who has been preferred over a much-accomplished Wriddhiman Saha, purely on batting skills, played a lazy shot to find his stumps rattled.

From 194 for four with a standard first innings total of 350 looking imminent, India lost five wickets for 22 runs in a period of six overs and it could well have a decisive impact in the final outcome of the contest.

Jamieson, in his post-tea spell, got rid of Pujara, Pant and Umesh Yadav in quick succession as India lost a golden opportunity to press home the advantage.

The 32 boundaries and three sixes with a run-rate of 3.84 in 63 overs will not able to tell the story how Indians fluffed their lines during the day.

The immensely talented Shaw displayed improved footwork that saw him drive elegantly as the likes of Trent Boult (2/89) and Colin de Grandhomme (0/31) were guilty of over-pitching in trying to get some swing.

There were square drives and a few on-drives while he also played and missed a few. He did live dangerously but more importantly had the scoreboard ticking even when Pujara was stuck at the other end.

Neil Wagner bowled a bouncer and Shaw hooked him for maximum to reach his half-century. Having added 50 runs with Pujara, the senior partner should have ideally calmed the inexperienced one, who instead of playing for lunch, lunged at a fuller delivery from Jamieson to be brilliantly caught by Latham.

Kohli’s poor tour just got worse when Tim Southee (2/38) got one to shape in slightly finding him plumb in-front. Ajinkya Rahane jabbed with limited footwork as Pujara looked more assured about his off-stump even as he hit occasional drives but mostly holding one end up.

It was young Vihari, who changed the course by counter-attacking the trio of Boult, Southee and Wagner in quick time.

Interestingly, when Pujara was on 49, Vihari was on 13 and by the time he got out for 55, having hit 10 boundaries, India’s number three was on 53.

Vihari looked comfortably against Wagner as he played a slash over point to complete his fifty and then another pull-shot off the very next delivery. But Vihari played one shot too many as Wagner bowled a slow bouncer to take him out of equation.

Once India came out to bat after tea, Jamieson changed the tactic from bowling fuller to his usual back of the length line that could create disconcerting bounce or the batsmen.

Pujara got a good bouncer and there was no balance while going for the pull-shot. Indian innings was in total disarray by then and result was another day where stars promised a lot and delivered too little.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jamie---s-fifer-puts-kiwis-on-top.html
143,01-3-20,Chennaiyin crush Goa 4-1 in semifinal 1st leg,"Chennaiyin FC came up with a clinical display to crush FC Goa 4-1 in the first leg of the Indian Super League (ISL) semifinal at the Nehru stadium here on Saturday.

After a goalless first half, goals from Lucian Goian (54th minute), Anirudh Thapa (61st), Eli Sabia (77th) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (79th) delivered the goods for the hosts and secured a crucial lead ahead of the second leg fixture away from home.

Saviour Gama (85th) came off the bench to score a vital away goal for FC Goa, as the League Winners endured their worst defeat of the season so far.

Skipper Lucian Goian opened the scoring with a header in the 54th minute, rising over the Goa custodian Mohammed Nawaz.

Seven minutes later, Anirudh Thapa underlined his class with a stunning strike to the top right corner to put CFC 2-0 up.

The visiting team, which finished on top of the league stage, attempted to pull things back but some poor defending let it down.

Another strike by Chennaiyin in the 77th minute, this time courtesy a goal by Eli Sabia, pushed Goa into further despair.

Thapa set Chhangte up inside the box with a simple pass and the Indian winger struck the ball hard into the net to score Chennaiyin’s fourth goal as Goa looked shell-shocked.

The visitors, however, pulled a goal back in the 85th minute to keep the contest alive.

Goian failed to clear a lofted ball into the box by Jahouh and it fell to substitute Saviour, who found the net with an easy finish.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chennaiyin-crush-goa-4-1-in-semifinal-1st-leg.html
144,01-3-20,Nadal strolls into Acapulco final,"Rafael Nadal used a steady stream of blistering forehand winners and a heavy dose of precision serves to book his spot in the ATP Mexico Open final with a convincing 6-3, 6-2 win over Grigor Dimitrov.

The two-time tournament champion will be the favorite to claim his third Acapulco title when he faces unseeded Taylor Fritz in final. It has been 15 years since world No 2 Nadal won for the first time here. He also won in 2013 and improved to 18-2 at this event overall.

“I’m very happy. A great victory against one of the best players in the world and a good friend,” Nadal said after his one-sided victory. “I think I’ve increased my level during the match, so it’s positive for me.” The top seed Nadal continued his dominance of Dimitrov, improving to 13-1 lifetime. Nadal has only lost 20 games in his first four matches this week and is yet to lose a set.

The unseeded Fritz defeated fellow American John Isner in the other semi-final 2-6, 7-5, 6-3.

“He’s playing well. He has a great serve, fantastic shots from the baseline. It’s going to be a tough one,” Nadal said of Fritz. “I know I’m going to have to be at my best and I hope to be ready for it.”

This will be the first meeting between Nadal and 22-year-old Fritz.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nadal-strolls-into-acapulco-final-nadal-strolls-into-acapulco-final.html
145,01-3-20,Chelsea stumble in Vitality,"Chelsea needed a double from Marcos Alonso to salvage a 2-2 draw at struggling Bournemouth as West Ham boosted their chances of survival with a 3-1 win over Southampton on Saturday.

After a 3-0 thrashing on home soil by Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, Frank Lampard was hoping for a response after what he called a “reality check” for the Blues.

Instead, Bournemouth were minutes away from securing just their third league win since they also beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in December.

Philip Billing missed two big early chances for the Cherries and Eddie Howe’s men were punished as Alonso’s calm finish after Olivier Giroud hit the bar gave Chelsea a half-time lead.

Two goals in three minutes from Jefferson Lerma and Josh King turned the game around and inflicted another blow to Chelsea's chances of holding onto their place in the top four.

Alonso’s predatory header after Aaron Ramsdale parried Pedro Rodriguez’s shot at least ensured the visitors left the Vitality Stadium with a point.

However, Lampard's men have now won just five of their last 16 league games and could see their lead over fifth-placed Manchester United cut to just a point if the Red Devils win at Everton today.

At the other end of the table, Aston Villa dropped into the bottom three ahead of taking on Manchester City in the League Cup final today courtesy of a much-needed win for West Ham.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chelsea-stumble-in-vitality.html

The new cases, which include a domestic worker from the Philippines, were all linked to the Wizlearn Technologies cluster, a technology hub here, Channel News Asia quoted a statement from the health ministry as saying.

The deadly virus epidemic which broke out in China has so far claimed the lives of 2,835 people while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 79,251, Chinese health officials said on Saturday.The virus has also spread across the world, with a rising number of cases reported in more than 50 countries and territories, the report said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/singapore-confirms-four-new-cases.html
147,01-3-20,S Korea coronavirus cases surge as WHO sounds max alert,"South Korea reported its biggest surge in new coronavirus cases on Saturday as concerns grew of a possible epidemic in the United States and the World Health Organisation raised its risk alert to its highest level.

The virus has rapidly spread across the world in the past week, causing stock markets to sink to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis over fears that the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy.

More than 2,900 people have died and over 85,000 have been infected worldwide since it was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

The vast majority of infections have been in China but more daily cases are now logged outside the country, with South Korea, Italy and Iran emerging as major hotspots.

South Korea has the most cases outside China, with 3,150 infections as 813 more patients were reported on Saturday - the country's biggest increase to date.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Unwarned top party officials of the ""serious consequences"" of failing to prevent an outbreak on their side of the border.

The impoverished nation, with a weak and ill-equipped healthcare system, has closed its borders to prevent the spread of the disease into its territory.

The virus has also spread to new zones in recent days, reaching nine new countries including Azerbaijan, Mexico and New Zealand, as well as reaching sub-Saharan Africa with Nigeria reporting its first case.

""We have now increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at global level,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Friday. European nations are scrambling to contain the outbreak as new infections mounted in several countries - many linked to virus hotspot northern Italy - including in France where a surge of new cases was confirmed Friday.

President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday chaired a Ministers' meeting on curbing the outbreak, after officials warned the epidemic had reached a ""new stage"".

""The virus is circulating in our territory and we must curb its spread,"" French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Friday.

Meanwhile in the US, health officials reported three more cases of the new coronavirus transmitted to people who did not travel overseas or come in contact with anyone known to be ill, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.

There are now four such cases in the United States, all on the Pacific seaboard, in addition to some 60 other infections in the country.

""The virus is here, present at some level, but we still don't know to what degree,"" said Sara Cody, director of public health for California's Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley where tech giants like Apple and Google are based. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the central bank stood at the ready to intervene if needed, given the ""evolving"" risks to the world's largest economy posed by the outbreak. Official data released in China on Saturday showed the extent of the damage caused to the world's second-largest economy, with manufacturing activity falling to its lowest level on record as key industries ground to a standstill under drastic containment measures.

More global events were disrupted due to the epidemic, with the United States delaying a regional summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations due in Las Vegas next month.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/s-korea-coronavirus-cases-surge-as-who-sounds-max-alert.html
148,01-3-20,NCA physio faces heat after Ishant injury,"The resurfacing of Ishant Sharma’s ankle injury has left the BCCI red-faced and National Cricket Academy head physio Ashish Kaushik under the scanner.

The 31-year-old speedster could miss the first part of the IPL in case he is required to undergo rehabilitation at the much-maligned NCA.

Ishant joined the Indian team in New Zealand 72 hours before the first Test and bowled nearly 23 overs for a five-wicket haul.

The Indian team management has remained tight-lipped about the outcome of his scan results but according to sources in the BCCI, the same ligament injury on his right ankle has flared up once again.

The BCCI media team issued a release after 24 hours which didn’t state anything other than what the covering media in Christchurch already knew.

A few questions have popped up in the BCCI circle with this latest injury fiasco.

“Once Ishant was ruled out for six weeks by the Delhi team physio after his scan reports revealed Grade 3, how did Kaushik and the NCA team come to conclusion that three weeks is good enough for return to competitive cricket?,” a BCCI insider questioned.

The second question is: was there a greater push from the player himself to get fit in time for the Test series?

The third and the most important point is: how thorough was the rehabilitation given that the team’s most senior pacer didn’t play a single competitive match, which is the norm for any player coming back into the national fold from an injury.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nca-physio-faces--heat-after-ishant-injury.html

The 24-year-old will be out of action for four weeks after suffering the injury during the final T20I against Australia on Wednesday.

“Kagiso sustained a groin muscle strain in the T20 series against Australia, he was assessed by the medical staff, assisted by an MRI scan,” Cricket South Africa (CSA), Chief Medical Officer, Shuaib Manjra said in a media statement.

“The significant injury means that he will take approximately four weeks to heal, which effectively rules him out of both the Australia and India ODI series,” he added.

150,01-3-20,Majumdar’s ton revives Bengal,"Anustup Majumdar struck an unbeaten century to once again become Bengal’s saviour after a familiar top order collapse as he single-handedly took his side to 275 for nine on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against a star-studded Karnataka at Eden Gardens on Saturday.

Fresh from his career-best 157 from a similar position in the quarterfinals, Majumdar slammed an unbeaten 120 (173 balls; 18x4, 1x6) to revive Bengal innings after they were asked to bat first.

In an almost action replay of the Odisha match, Bengal were staring down the barrel on Saturday also with their top batsmen, including skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran (15) and Manoj Tiwary (8), back in the pavillion after playing reckless shots.

The scoreboard read a precarious 62/4 when the onus fell once again on Majumdar after Tiwary departed in trying to hit spinner K Gowtham across the line.

There was worse to follow for Bengal when Ronit More (2/45) gave a double blow, dismissing a well-set Sudip Chatterjee (20) and Shreevats Goswami (0) in four balls as the home side were tottering at 67/6 at lunch.

But the veteran Majumdar, who returned to Bengal in 2016 after poor form with the Indian Railways, was full of poise as he revived the innings in the last two sessions with a century stand for the ninth wicket with Akash Deep (44).

All-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed also played his part with a 72-run partnership with Majumdar that came in quick time (119 balls).

Majumdar spent four hours and 11 minutes during his unbeaten knock from 173 balls. He notched up his ninth first class hundred, seventh in Ranji Trophy, with a flick in the square leg boundary off Mithun.

Karnataka were also lacklustre on the field and dropped two catches — by wicketkeeper S Sharath and skipper Nair as Bengal scripted an amazing recovery.

Saurashtra make 217/5

Rajkot: Led by Arzan Nagwaswalla' three wickets, Gujarat bowlers produced a disciplined show and restricted Saurashtra to 217 for five on the opening day in other last four game.

For the hosts, only Sheldon Jackson (69 not out) was able to convert his start at the SCA stadium.

Initially, it seemed Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel's decision to put Saurashtra in backfired, but the bowlers made a splendid comeback and pegged the hosts back on two occasions.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/majumdar---s-ton-revives-bengal.html
151,01-3-20,NZ win low score thriller,"Seamer Hayley Jensen and off-spinner Leigh Kasperek took three wickets apiece as New Zealand produced a tremendous comeback to beat Bangladesh by 17 runs in a low-scoring match on Saturday.

The White Ferns were left at a spot of bother having been bowled out for 91 in 18.2 overs but their bowlers produced a stunning display to dismiss Bangladesh 17 runs short of the target in the first meeting between the teams.

Ritu Moni’s (4/18) first four-wicket haul, the best figures of the tournament so far, was not enough to steer Bangladesh to a historic victory. Bangladesh battled in the modest chase but were dismissed for 74.

It was only the third time the White Ferns had been kept under 100 runs at a World Cup but it was clear they weren’t going to go down without a fight as Jensen (3/11) and Kasperek (3/23) made amends.

152,01-3-20,Dismissals due to batsmen’s errors: Vihari,"Hanuma Vihari on Saturday said poor shot selection led to India getting bowled out for a below-par 242 on a “fair pitch”, dealing a blow to their hopes of a comeback in the two-Test series.

Vihari, who was very impressive in his 55 off 70 balls, said that he wanted to attack so that Cheteshwar Pujara can play his natural game of grinding the bowling.

“Yes, obviously as the pitch didn’t do as much as we expected,” Vihari was honest in his assessment of the green top.

“They bowled in good areas and knew what to expect from this track. Prithvi set the tone, Pujara spent time. All dismissals happened at wrong time. None of the dismissals were because of the pitch. Mostly it was because of batsmen’s error. Pitch was fair,” the dependable middle-order batsman said.

On this track, a total in excess of 300 would have been an ideal first-innings score.

Vihari looked in command while playing the short ball and he said leaving them would have also hampered Pujara’s natural game.

“As Pujara was playing at one end and I wanted to take that lead and play positively because he is a player who will play for a lot of time. We know that.

“So I didn’t also want to take time and put pressure on Pujara or on our innings because if you don’t keep scoreboard moving you will get stuck like in the last game. That’s why I decided to play positively and take them on,” Vihari explained his game plan.

He regretted getting out at the wrong time as his dismissal at the stroke of tea triggered a collapse in the final session.

“It was a wrong time to get out obviously just before tea as we had a good session. We scored 110 runs and lost only one wicket prior to that. I was batting positively but I played one shot too many.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dismissals-due-to-batsmen---s-errors--vihari.html

First-half goals from Luis Alberto and Joaquin Correa sent Lazio two points clear of reigning champions Juventus and extended their unbeaten league run to 21 matches.

Bologna had two second-half goals disallowed following VAR reviews.

Lazio have played a game more than Juventus while Inter, who are eight points adrift, have two matches in hand on the leaders after their fixture with Sampdoria last weekend was also postponed.

157,01-3-20,"NDA united in Bihar, will win more than 200 seats in assembly polls: Nitish","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday asserted that the ruling NDA is and will remain united in the state, dispelling ""confusions"" that had arisen in the wake of his recent meeting with RJD's Tejashwi Yadav followed by some opposition Grand Alliance leaders beckoning him to cross over.

Addressing a 'karyakarta sammelan' of the Janata Dal (United), of which he is the national president, Kumar exhorted party workers to strive towards ensuring the NDA's win in ""more than 200 seats"" when elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly are held this year.

Disapproving of political ""controversies"" around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which his party had supported in Parliament, Kumar called for ""patience"" as the matter was sub judice.

Anxieties in some sections of society, particularly among the minorities, have been addressed with a resolution passed by the Bihar assembly against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and insertion of contentious clauses in National Population Register (NPR) forms, he said.

The JD(U) chief also reiterated his commitment towards ensuring justice and welfare of all, including minorities, and slammed the opposition Congress-RJD combine, which keeps attacking him over his alliance with the BJP, by recalling the Bhagalpur riots of 1989 that had claimed over 1,000 lives.

""It is well known who was in power when the riots took place and how justice eluded the victims for 15 years thereafter. We brought the guilty to book and justice was ensured to the victims. I am more concerned about working for the minorities than getting their votes,"" said Kumar as he highlighted the various schemes being run by his government for minority communities.

The chief minister, who spoke for close to an hour and a half, also dwelt at length on his government's accomplishments with regard to improving law and order, and bringing in all round development.

Kumar asked party workers to apprise the common people about the same and debunk the opposition's propaganda.

On allegations of deterioration in law and order levelled by opposition parties and the concern expressed of late by ally Chirag Paswan, who heads the Lok Janshakti Party, the chief minister quoted National Crime Records Bureau statistics to suggest that the crime rate in Bihar, when taken into account in proportion to the population, was among the lowest in the country.

Sore over widespread criticism of the poor health and education scenario in the state, Kumar highlighted his government's success in reducing school dropout rates and mentioned the adulation from Microsoft founder Bill Gates who, during his visit to Patna last year, had praised the state's efforts towards ""fighting poverty and disease"".

The chief minister, who will aim at a fourth consecutive term in power in the assembly elections due by November, urged his party's workers to draw inspiration from the NDA's stupendous performance in the Lok Sabha polls last year when the BJP, the JD(U) and the LJP had together won 39 out of the 40 seats in Bihar.

Indirectly referring to his one-to-one meeting with Tejashwi Yadav inside his chamber at the Bihar assembly complex, which had prompted Grand Alliance leaders like former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi to ""welcome"" him to the opposition formation, Kumar said, ""There is no scope for confusions. We met over the NPR and the NRC debate, and the matter has been settled with a unanimous resolution passed by the assembly"".

""Now there should be dhairya (patience) as the CAA is before the court. Stirring a controversy is not proper,"" said the JD(U) chief in a veiled admonition to the opposition.

He also pointed out that the law providing for citizenship to refugees fleeing adjoining countries out of religious persecution was conceptualised when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister.

Flaying the RJD-Congress combine for their agitations over the citizenship law, Kumar said, ""I was a member of Parliament then. And, what I am saying can be verified from the records of the proceedings of the time. Leaders like Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh and Lalu Prasad all were in favour of such a legislation back then.""

He also spoke of the ""Jal Jeevan Hariyali"" campaign which aims at combating climate change through environment preservation and expressed delight over the enthusiastic public participation in the human chain that was formed in its support in January.

Kumar also asserted that prohibition, brought in force four years ago, has had many positive social and economic efforts and reiterated his commitment to securing special category status for Bihar which, he holds, is necessary for accelerated development of a state that has been historically backward.

The chief minister paid tributes to Valmiki Nagar MP Baidya Nath Prasad Mahto, who died in Delhi earlier this week.

Chairman and Managing Director of HAL R Madhavan said the aim of the mega project is to stop import of more than Rs 4 lakh crore worth of military helicopters for the three services in the coming years.

In an interview to PTI, Madhavan said the HAL has completed the preliminary design of the helicopter and that initial plan is to produce at least 500 units with the first prototype set to be ready by 2023 if the government gives the go ahead to the project this year.

""One major project we are focusing on is to produce a helicopter in 10 to 12 tonnes category to replace the Mi-17 fleet. It will be an indigenous platform with the potential to manufacture around 500 helicopters. It will stop import of more than Rs 4 lakh crore worth of platforms from foreign countries,"" he said.

Madhavan said an amount of Rs 9,600 crore will be required for design as well as to produce the prototype of the helicopter.

""If we get the approval in 2020, we will be able to manufacture the first chopper by 2027. We are looking at producing at least 500 helicopters of the variant. It will be a major project we are working on,"" he said.

A military expert described the project as the biggest by the HAL after development of the Tejas military aircraft.

""We have done the preliminary design. We have also been in discussion with the Air Force and the Navy. The 10-12 tonnes category will have two basic structures on similar platforms. The naval version will have different dimension compared to the one for the Army and the Air Force,"" Madhavan said on the proposed mega project.

""Like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) we developed from the Dhruv platform, a similar variant of 10-12 tonnes category can be produced to make it an Apache equivalent,"" said Madhavan.

The helicopter will be powered by twin engines and will feature blade folding option for ship deck operations. The planned roles for the helicopter will be to support air assault, air transport, combat logistics and combat search and rescue. The chopper will also have a very superior weapons package.

Madhavan said the helicopter will have a huge potential for export.

The Mi-17 helicopters make up the backbone of the IAF's helicopter fleet and they are planned to be phased out by 2032.

The HAL's product range includes a number of helicopter like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) and multi-role ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter) and Chetak choppers.

India is one of the largest importers of arms and military platforms globally. The government has been focusing significantly on promoting defence indigenisation by taking a slew of reform initiatives including liberalising FDI in defence sector.

The Indian Air Force is procuring a total of 22 Apache Guardian attack helicopters from aerospace major Boeing under a multi-billion dollar deal. Additionally, the Army is procuring six Apache helicopters along with weapons systems, a deal for which was sealed during US President Donald Trump's visit to India last week.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hal-finalises-plan-to-produce-military-helicopter-on-par-with-boeing-s-apache-guardian-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hal-finalises-plan-to-produce-military-helicopter-on-par-with-boeing-s-apache-guardian.html
159,01-3-20,"You are lying, says Anurag Thakur on hate chant","Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Sunday said strict action should be taken against those involved in the violence in north-east Delhi that claimed over 40 lives. But he said he was not involved in delivering a hate speech.

Refuting that he has ever raised controversial ""shoot the traitors"" chant in the run-up to elections in Delhi, Thakur said: ""You are lying.""

""I think sometimes there is lack of information in the media too regarding the way some things are projected,"" he replied to the media here on being asked about his hate speech that was also blamed for flaring up the violence.

Asking the media to limit their questionnaire to his department only, the BJP leader replied: ""The matter is sub-judice. You should have full facts. Half-baked truth is dangerous -- be it the propaganda of media or somebody else. I feel that you guys should have complete knowledge.""

""What clarification you want on this? Strict action should be taken against those who are accused of inciting the riots and were involved in riots,"" he said.

""From Monday, Parliament session will begin, questions are raised there also from economy to various other issues and on that platform, answers will be given on various matters,"" an angry Thakur said.

""If you have questions on the economy, you should ask those,"" he summed up.

The Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs was interacting with the media after meeting stakeholders from trades and industries during an interactive session organised by the Income Tax Department.

Saying the police was on the job in Delhi, Thakur said: ""Strict action should be taken against those involved in the riots. The strength of our country is that people of various faiths coexist and live unitedly contributing towards building the nation.""

On the economy front, he replied the government is determined to make India the third largest economy by 2025 with all-out efforts of Team India.

The recently launched initiative 'Vivaad se Vishwas' aimed at substantially reducing the litigation in the Income Tax Department, he said.

160,01-3-20,US leaves Af in Taliban’s hands,"Peace deal requires US to pull out troops within 14 months

The United States signed a landmark deal with the Taliban on Saturday, laying out a timetable for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months — with the initial drawdown of American forces from a total of 13,000 to 8,600 in the next 4 months— as it seeks an exit from its longest-ever war.

The agreement is expected to lead to a dialogue between the Taliban and the Kabul Government that, if successful, could ultimately see an end to the grinding 18-year conflict.

However, the pace of American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan is conditions-based and will depend on how well the Taliban comply with the commitments they have made, the White House said on Saturday after the US and the militant group signed a landmark peace deal.

Pakistan needs to help the US solve problem in Afghanistan for a better bilateral relationship, a senior administration official has said, asserting that Washington expects Islamabad to play a constructive role in helping implement the historic peace deal with the Taliban.

Taliban fighter-turned-dealmaker Mullah Baradar signed the accord alongside Washington’s chief negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad, at a gilded desk in a conference room in a luxury Doha hotel.

The pair then shook hands, as people in the room shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest). US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looked on as the two inked the deal, after urging the insurgents to “keep your promises to cut ties with Al-Qaeda”.

On the eve of the signing, President Donald Trump urged the Afghan people to embrace the chance for a new future. “If the Taliban and the Government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,” he said.

But the position of the Afghan Government, which has been excluded from direct US-Taliban talks, remains unclear and the country is gripped by a fresh political crisis amid contested election results.

The Doha accord was drafted over a tempestuous year of dialogue marked by the abrupt cancellation of the effort by Trump in September.

The signing comes after a week-long, partial truce that has mostly held across Afghanistan, aimed at building confidence between the warring parties and showing the Taliban can control their forces.

The US is committed to withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States, its allies, and coalition partners, including all non-diplomatic civilian personnel, private security contractors, trainers, advisors, and supporting services personnel within 14 months following announcement of the deal.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg heralded the agreement as a “first step to lasting peace”. “The way to peace is long and hard. We have to be prepared for setbacks, spoilers, there is no easy way to peace but this is an important first step,” the Norwegian former prime minister told reporters in Kabul.

Since the US-led invasion that ousted the Taliban after the September 11, 2001 attacks, America has spent more than $1 trillion in fighting and rebuilding in Afghanistan.

About 2,400 US soldiers have been killed, along with unknown tens of thousands of Afghan troops, Taliban fighters and Afghan civilians. The insurgents said they had halted all hostilities Saturday in honour of the agreement.

Any insurgent pledge to guarantee Afghanistan is never again used by jihadist movements such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group to plot attacks abroad will be key to the deal’s viability. The Taliban’s sheltering of Al-Qaeda was the main reason for the US invasion following the 9/11 attacks.

The group, which had risen to power in the 1990s in the chaos of civil war, suffered a swift defeat at the hands of the US and its allies. They retreated before re-emerging to lead a deadly insurgency against the new government in Kabul.

After the NATO combat mission ended in December 2014, the bulk of Western forces withdrew from the country, leaving it in an increasingly precarious position.

While Afghans are eager to see an end to the violence, experts say any prospective peace will depend on the outcome of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government. But with President Ashraf Ghani and rival Abdullah Abdullah at loggerheads over contested election results, few expect the pair to present a united front, unlike the Taliban, who would then be in a position to take the upper hand in negotiations.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-leaves-af-in-taliban---s-hands-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/us-leaves-af-in-taliban---s-hands.html
161,01-3-20,Clasico will not decide title: Zidane,"Zinedine Zidane said the Clasico today will not decide the title race even if Real Madrid lose to Barcelona and fall five points behind them in La Liga.

Yet opposite number Quique Setien believes Barca’s two-point cushion at the top makes the match at the Santiago Bernabeu “much more important for Madrid” than his team.

Victory for the Catalans would effectively give them a six-point advantage over Madrid, given what would be a superior head-to-head, with 12 games left to play.

But Zidane insists there would be still be a way back. “I don’t think anyone will lose anything this weekend,” he said in a press conference on Saturday.

“There are still 12 games left, we’ll still be in the title race regardless of the result. But we’re going to try to win, 100 per cent.”

Setien, also speaking on Saturday, said the pressure was all on Real.

“For Madrid this match is certainly much more important than for us. In relation to their situation in the table, it is a key match, I don’t know if it’s decisive, but it’s very important.”

After Madrid, Barcelona will only have one away game left against the top six, when they face Sevilla in April, yet Setien thinks there will be more twists to come.

“A victory would give us an advantage but I don’t know if it would be enough,” said Setien. “I think probably not because we’ve already seen a lot of surprises.”

Both teams have endured a bumpy few weeks but Barcelona arrive in a better mood after Madrid’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday made it one win from five games for Zidane’s side.

Asked if his job would be under threat if they fail to win the title this term, Zidane said: “I don’t know, that’s a question for someone else. I know what I have to do.

“We’re going to try to win something, thats what we’re working for but you can only have one winner.”

“You lose two games, you get criticised,” Zidane added. “I get it, I am responsible. It’s what is happening, it’s nothing new. But I have the strength to continue, I have faith in my players and I believe we can turn this around.”

Jordi Alba was given the green light on Saturday to play after recovering from an adductor injury while Setien confirmed Gerard Pique is fit, despite turning his ankle against Napoli on Tuesday.

“It’s not damaged and he will not have any problem,” Setien said about Pique. On Alba, he added: “We’re feeling positive, it’s just whether we start him or not. We’ll see how he feels tomorrow.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/clasico-will-not-decide-title--zidane.html
162,01-3-20,Title race is on,"Bayern, Dortmund and M’Gladbach win as Bundesliga race heats up

Bayern Munich thrashed Hoffenheim 6-0 on Saturday in a game that bizarrely finished with the teams passing the ball between each other after a lengthy delay for an insulting banner in the crowd.

Players from both sides stood on the field but refused to play for the final 10 minutes of the match as the clock wound down, after a section of Bayern away fans unfurled an offensive banner which was critical of Hoffenheim benefactor Dietmar Hopp.

The entire Bayern team —along with coach Hansi Flick and chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge — approached the ultras block and pleaded with them to remove it.

The fans refused, prompting a surreal conclusion to a match in which Bayern overcame the absence of injured striker Robert Lewandowski.

With five names on the scoresheet, first impressions suggest that Bayern will have few problems replacing Lewandowski’s 25 goals during his expected month-long absence.

Bayern burst out of the blocks, with Serge Gnabry scoring the visitors’ first after just two minutes when he connected with a floating ball from Thomas Mueller.

Joshua Kimmich made it 2-0 just five minutes later, side-footing a loose ball in the box past Oli Baumann. From there on it was one-way traffic for the 28-time Bundesliga champions.

Dutch teenager Joshua Zirkzee scored his third goal in the top flight, chipping in a ball from Kimmich in the 16th minute, before Philippe Coutinho made it 4-0 in the 33rd minute with a trademark curling strike into the top corner.

The Barcelona loanee scored his second and Munich’s fifth just two minutes after the break, toe-poking in a superb assist from Mueller, giving the latter his second of the match and his 17th assist of the season.

Leon Goretzka was the next to get on the scoresheet, profiting from an excellent team movement. Coutinho and Corentin Tolisso combined perfectly in the box before Goretzka chipped the ball over Baumann to rack up Bayern's sixth for the day.

Sancho scores

Elsewhere, Dortmund kept pace with the league leaders with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Freiburg at a windswept Signal Iduna Park.

Dortmund grabbed the lead through Jadon Sancho in the 15th minute, with the Englishman converting a pinpoint assist from Thorgan Hazard to bring up his 14th goal of the season.

Freiburg went close to finding the equaliser in a nervous final 15 minutes for the home side, however their defence held firm as they drew level on points with second-placed RB Leipzig.

Borussia Moenchengladbach also kept pace with the top of the table, moving into outright fourth with a 3-2 win away at Augsburg.

Lars Stindl scored two for the visitors, while Ramy Bensebaini also got on the scoresheet.

Alfred Finnbogason’s 83rd minute strike — after Eduard Loewen scored the home side's opener in the 57th minute -- reduced the deficit to one, but the visitors closed the game out to pick up a valuable three points.

In Mainz, the home side also snared a crucial victory with a 2-0 win over fellow relegation battlers Paderborn.

Two first-half strikes from Robin Quaison (29th minute) and Karim Onisiwo (37th) were enough to take Mainz to 15th in the table, giving them a four-point buffer on the relegation places.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/title-race-is-on-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/title-race-is-on.html
163,01-3-20,Extend Oly qualification period in view of cancellation of events due to coronavirus: Saina,"Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap feel that the BWF should extend the Olympic qualification period in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak wrecking havoc on the qualifying events for the Tokyo Games.

Concerns over the rapid spread of the deadly virus had forced the postponement of the four Olympic qualifying events so far -- Lingshui China Masters (February 25 to March 1), Vietnam International Challenge (March 24 to 29) and German Open (March 3 to 8) and Polish Open (March 26 to 29).

""Qualification period can be extended if the tournaments are getting cancelled cause of #coronavirus,"" Saina wrote on her twitter handle, tagging the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

""It will be unfair for most of the players who are really close to qualifying for Olympics 2020.""

Saina, the London Olympic bronze medallist, is currently lying at 22nd in Race to Tokyo list and need a rapid rise in the rankings to qualify for the Games.

Her husband Kashyap, a 2014 Commonwealth Games champion, and former world no. 1 Kidambi Srikanth are at 24th and 21th spots respectively in Race to Tokyo list.

For them and several top players around the world, including China's two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan (currently placed at 30th), the next few tournaments will be crucial as they try to squeeze into the top 16 to qualify for Tokyo.

The prestigious All England Championships (March 11 to 15), offering 12,000 ranking points for the winner, is next in line, followed by Swiss Open, India Open (Super 500), Malaysia Open (Super 750), and Singapore Open (Super 500) before qualification period ends on April 28.

Kashyap, who is recovering from a back injury that he suffered during the Spain Masters earlier in the month, wrote on his twitter handle: ""We all had 7 events starting from Spain Masters until the Singapore Open and few have the Asian Champs too.

""Now that German Open is cancelled and Swiss Open looking doubtful and Singapore and Malaysia Opens also with the same worries, it will be completely unfair for so many athletes who are on the borderline of qualification at this moment.

""7 events are a lot of events considering the best 10 performances in a qualifying period are chosen. If at all the virus is contained and slowly everything comes back to normalcy in a few months and the Olympics takes place on same dates, then BWF and IOC have to revise and extend the qualification dates and make sure they add on the events later or make it a fair qualification.""

The deadly coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has so far killed close to 3000 people and infected nearly 83,000 globally.

Most of the countries which are to host these Olympic qualifying tournaments, like United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore, have all reported multiple cases of coronovirus.

Kashyap hoped given the situation, players get a fair chance to qualify for the Olympics.

""I understand that everything has to be assumed at this moment but I hope all the athletes have a fair chance to qualify for the Olympics. Many players were injured in the last year when the qualification period started and now if they're fit and hope to do well in the next events, what happens to their qualification chances if most the events are doubtful as of now?"" Kashyap wrote.

Badminton's world body (BWF) on Friday said it has currently no ""plans to make any adjustments"" to the regulations relating to the Tokyo Games qualification period.

The BWF said it's monitoring the situation and as of now other events will go as per schedule.

""All other tournaments on the BWF calendar within the Olympic qualification period are scheduled to run,"" it said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/extend-oly-qualification-period-in-view-of-cancellation-of-events-due-to-coronavirus--saina-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/extend-oly-qualification-period-in-view-of-cancellation-of-events-due-to-coronavirus--saina.html

The curfew was imposed since 9 pm Saturday, following the death of two persons in separate attacks in Ichamati area in East Khasi Hills district on Friday and at Shillong's Iewduh market on Saturday, they said.

The situation is tense following the two deaths, especially of a Khasi Students' Union (KSU) activist in a clash between members of the students' body and non-tribals during a rally in Ichamati area, which is close to the Indo-Bangladesh border.

East Khasi Hills District authorities said the curfew was extended in areas under the jurisdiction of Lumdiengjri and Sadar police stations Cantonment Beat House over fears there might be a serious breakdown of law and order in those places.

""There is a likelihood of a serious breakdown of peace and tranquillity which may lead to loss of life and property... I do promulgate curfew in these areas from 8 am on March 1 until further orders,"" District Magistrate Matsiewdor W Nongbri said in an order.

Mobile internet and messaging services have been temporarily suspended in six districts of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills region to curtail rumours that could deteriorate law and order, officials said.

Clashes broke out between KSU members and non-tribals during a rally organised against the Citizenship Amendment Act and demanding implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP), at Ichamati on Friday, district Superintendent of Police Claudia Lyngwa said.

Eight persons have been arrested in this case and a magisterial inquiry has been instituted to probe into the incident, she said.

One person was stabbed to death at the Iewduh market under Cantonment Beat House on Saturday when unidentified persons went on an attacking spree that left seven others seriously injured, the SP said, adding that no one has been arrested so far in this connection.

After the clashes, curfew was imposed at noon in the two police station areas in Shillong while night curfew was imposed in the entire city.

Three companies of central forces have been deployed in the sensitive areas of the district, including in the affected areas of the city, officials said.

Governor Tathagata Roy and Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma have appealed the citizens to maintain peace. Both had taken to social media to issue their appeals even as mobile internet services were suspended in the six districts.

Chief Minister Sangma reviewed the law and order situation in the state and appealed for peace.

""I appeal to all our citizens and people of the state to ensure that peace returns and urge upon different organisations to refrain from any violent activity. A magisterial inquiry has been set up. We have ensured that enough manpower is put in place in the affected areas,"" he had said.

However, earlier the Delhi Government said that in view of violence in the area, schools would remain closed in North-east Delhi till March 7 and the annual class exams had also been postponed since the situation was not conducive for conducting examination in riot-affected areas.

170,01-3-20,Omega-3 supplements won't protect you against cancer,"Turning conventional wisdom on its head, new research has found that consuming omega-3 supplements may actually increase the risk of some cancers instead of reducing it.

Omega-3 supplements may slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality and events, but slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer, according to two systematic reviews published in the British Journal of Cancer and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

""These large systematic reviews included information from many thousands of people over long periods,"" said lead author Lee Hooper from the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School in Britain.

""This large amount of information has clarified that if we take omega 3 supplements for several years we may very slightly reduce our risk of heart disease, but balance this with very slightly increasing our risk of some cancers. The overall effects on our health are minimal,"" Hooper said.

The researchers found that both beneficial and harmful effects of omega-3 supplements are small.

If 1,000 people took omega-3 supplements for around four years, three people would avoid dying from heart disease, six people would avoid a coronary event (such as a heart attack) and three extra people would develop prostate cancer.

Omega-3 is a type of fat. Small amounts are essential for good health and can be found in the food that we eat including nuts and seeds and fatty fish, such as salmon.

These fats are also readily available as over-the-counter supplements and they are widely bought and used.

The research team looked at 47 trials involving adults who did not have cancer, who were at increased risk of cancer, or had a previous cancer diagnosis, and 86 trials with evidence on cardiovascular events or deaths.

More than 100,000 participants were randomised to consume more long-chain omega-3 fats (fish oils), or maintain their usual intake, for at least a year for each of the reviews.

They studied the number of people who died, received a new diagnosis of cancer, heart attack or stroke and/or died of any of the diseases.

""The evidence on omega 3 mostly comes from trials of fish oil supplements, so health effects of oily fish, a rich source of long-chain omega 3, are unclear. Oily fish is a very nutritious food as part of a balanced diet, rich in protein and energy as well as important micronutrients such as selenium, iodine, vitamin D and calcium - it is much more than an omega 3 source,"" Hooper said.

""But we found that there is no demonstrable value in people taking omega 3 oil supplements for the prevention or treatment of cancer. In fact, we found that they may very slightly increase cancer risk, particularly for prostate cancer,"" Hooper added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/omega-3-supplements-won-t-protect-you-against-cancer-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/omega-3-supplements-won-t-protect-you-against-cancer.html
171,01-3-20,"Skipping breakfast, snacking at night may lead to delay in burning body fat: Study","The time of the day when food is consumed may determine how many calories in it will be burned by the body, according to a study which suggests that a daily fast between the evening meal and breakfast can optimise weight management.

The researchers, including Kevin Kelly from Vanderbilt University in the US, said the balance between weight loss and gain is predominantly determined by diet, the quantity of food consumed, and the amount of exercise a person gets.

They said the time of the day when most food is eaten also determines how well a person burns dietary calories.

According to the study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, the human body's daily biological clock and sleep regulate how the food is metabolised.

It added that the choice of burning fats or carbohydrates also changes depending on the time of day or night.

The scientists said the circadian rhythm, or the body clock, is programmed to assist the body burn fat when people sleep.

As a result, they said, when people skip breakfast and then snack at night, it may lead to a delay in burning the fat.

In the study, the researchers monitored the metabolism of mid-aged and older subjects in a whole-room respiratory chamber over two separate 56-hour sessions.

In each session, they said, lunch and dinner were presented at the same times but the timing of the third meal differed between the two halves of the study.

In one of the 56-hour sessions, the additional daily meal was presented as breakfast whereas in the other session, a nutritionally equivalent meal was presented to the same subjects as a late-evening snack, the scientists said.

However, they said the duration of the overnight fast was the same for both sessions.

While the two sessions did not differ in the amount or type of food eaten, or in the subjects' activity levels, the daily timing of nutrient availability, coupled with sleep control of metabolism, flipped a switch in the subjects' fat/carbohydrate preference, the study noted.

The late-evening snack session resulted in less fat burned when compared to the breakfast session, it said.

Based on these observations, the scientists said the timing of meals during the day/night cycle may affect the extent to which ingested food is used versus stored.

According to the researchers, this study has important implications for eating habits, suggesting that a daily fast between the evening meal and breakfast may optimise weight management.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/skipping-breakfast--snacking-at-night-may-lead-to-delay-in-burning-body-fat--study-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/skipping-breakfast--snacking-at-night-may-lead-to-delay-in-burning-body-fat--study.html
172,01-3-20,"China's coronavirus deaths reach 2,870, confirmed cases surge to 79,824","China's coronavirus death toll climbed to 2,870 with 35 new deaths, while the confirmed cases increased to 79,824 even as the infections outside the worst-hit Hubei province dropped with only three positive cases reported in a single day, continuing the trend of slowdown in the rest of the country, health officials said Sunday.

The National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports of 573 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 35 deaths on Saturday from the Chinese mainland.

Among the deaths, 34 were in Hubei and one in Henan Province.

COVID-19, which at one time started spreading rapidly all over China, showed a declining trend with three new confirmed cases reported outside Hubei on Saturday.

Of the 573 confirmed cases, 570 were reported from Hubei and its capital Wuhan, which remained a battle ground for the virus ever since it originated from there in December last year.

Meanwhile, 132 new suspected cases were reported, it said, adding that the number of severe cases decreased to 7,365.

Among the 79,824 confirmed cases, 2,870 people have died, 35,329 patients are still being treated while 41,625 have been discharged after recovery.

However, some recovered patients are showing relapse of the virus.

The commission added that 851 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

The commission said 51,856 close contacts were still under medical observation.

By the end of Saturday, 95 confirmed cases including two deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 39 in Taiwan, including one death.

Meanwhile, an official report on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) released jointly by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and China's National Health Commission identified the infection as a zoonotic virus, meaning an infectious disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that spread from animals to humans.

The report, which is based on analysis of data the WHO and Chinese health authorities gathered from February 16-24, said human-to-human transmission is largely occurring in families.

The report also found that people with COVID-19 generally show symptoms within five to six days, on average, after contracting the infection, and most people infected have mild symptoms and could recover.

However, individuals, including people aged over 60 and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension face the highest risk of severe conditions and even death, the report said.

COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact with those who are infected with the virus.

Airborne transmission has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major source of transmission based on available evidence.

The lockdown of virus-hit Wuhan and 18 other cities in Hubei with over 50 million people since January 23 has effectively prevented further exportation of infected individuals to the rest of the country, the report said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-s-coronavirus-deaths-reach-2-870--confirmed-cases-surge-to-79-824-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-s-coronavirus-deaths-reach-2-870--confirmed-cases-surge-to-79-824.html

174,01-3-20,"S Korea reports 376 more coronavirus cases, total 3,526","South Korea confirmed 376 more coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the national total to 3,526 infections, the largest in the world outside China.

Nearly 90 per cent of the new cases were in Daegu, the centre of the country's outbreak, and its neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

The national total is expected to rise further as authorities screen more than 260,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country's cases.

The streets of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million -- have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.

Authorities have urged the public to exercise caution and anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms to stay home.

But officials say they are not considering a citywide quarantine for the city in the manner of the lockdown imposed on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged.

The government has imposed a one-week extension on school breaks nationwide.

175,01-3-20,Will be meeting Taliban leaders soon: Trump,"US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he planned to meet Taliban leaders in the ""not-too-distant future"", asserting that it was time that the war against terrorism was fought by someone else, particularly the countries in the region.

""I will be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future. And we will be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they are going to be doing: they will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going,"" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference.

""We have had tremendous success in Afghanistan in the killing of terrorists, but it is time, after all these years, to go and bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home,"" the president said hours after the United States signed an agreement with the Taliban in Doha, under which it has committed to withdrawing all its troops from Afghanistan in 14 months' time.

""We just signed an agreement that puts us in a position to get it done, bring us down to in the vicinity of 8,000 troops. The United Nations was informed of everything,"" Trump said.

The US currently has some 13,000 troops in Afghanistan.

The president said it had been a long journey in Afghanistan.

""It's been a very long journey. It's been a hard journey for everybody. We are, very largely, a law enforcement group. And that is not what our soldiers are all about. They are fighters. They are the greatest fighters in the world,"" he said.

""As you know, we have destroyed, in Syria and Iraq, 100 per cent of the ISIS caliphate. One hundred per cent. We have thousands of prisoners. We have killed ISIS fighters by the thousands and, likewise, in Afghanistan. But now it is time for somebody else to do that work and that will be the Taliban and it could be the surrounding countries. There are many countries that surround Afghanistan that can help. We are 8,000 miles away,"" Trump said.

""So we will be bringing it down to 8,000 to approximately 8,600 -- in that vicinity -- and then we will make our final decision (at) some point in the fairly near future. But this was a very spirited agreement. There was a lot of talk. There was a lot of everything. They have been trying to get this for many years,"" he said.

The president said he really believed that the Taliban wanted to do something to show that they were not wasting time.

""If bad things happen, we will go back. I let the people know: we will go back and we will go back so fast, and we will go back with a force like nobody has ever seen. I do not think that will be necessary. I hope it is not necessary,"" he said.

Responding to a question, Trump said the Taliban wanted this to happen.

""The Taliban wanted it to happen. President (Ashraf) Ghani was very much involved in this, as you know. And he is now dealing with the Taliban,"" he said.

The Taliban, Trump said, had given a very strong pledge.

""We will see how that works out. We hope it is going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We will be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end.

""But the job we have done has been a fantastic one in terms of terrorists and terrorism, and it is time for our people to start coming home,"" he added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/will-be-meeting-taliban-leaders-soon--trump-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/will-be-meeting-taliban-leaders-soon--trump.html
176,01-3-20,"India conveys its support to peace, stability in Afghan","On a day the US and the Taliban inked a peace deal, India on Saturday said its policy is to support all opportunities that can bring peace, stability and end violence in Afghanistan. But at the same time, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, India underscored that sustainable peace there requires an end to externally-sponsored terrorism.

As a major stakeholder in Afghanistan, India conveyed to Kabul that its support is for enduring and inclusive peace and reconciliation which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. New Delhi said it will continue to extend all support to the Afghan people for realising their aspirations.

The US-Taliban deal has serious security implications for India with Pakistan using Afghanistan as strategic depth to counter New Delhi’s military strength and backing the Taliban for years. Hence, India has also conveyed to the US that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad’s cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.

With Islamabad playing a major role in the US-Taliban peace accord, India fears that given Pakistan’s influence over the Taliban, the powerful Pakistan military establishment will now fuel cross-border terrorism.

Over the last two days, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla met President Ashraf Ghani, whom he handed over a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, Vice President-elect Amrullah Saleh, National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib and acting Foreign Minister Haroon Chakhansuri. The political leadership was apprised about India’s views on the peace deal as well as its commitment for all-round development of the country.

India reiterated the Government’s commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan besides further strengthening of economic and human resources development partnership with it.

While the Indian ambassador to Qatar P Kumaran attended the US-Taliban inking ceremony in Doha, India all along has maintained that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

India has been a key stakeholder in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan. In a significant move, India had sent two former diplomats in “non-official” capacity to a conference on Afghan peace process in Moscow in November 2018.

The conference organised by Russia was attended by a high-level Taliban delegation, representatives of Afghanistan as well as from several other countries, including the US, Pakistan and China.

Major powers such as the US, Russia and Iran had reached out to the Taliban as part of efforts to push the stalled Afghan peace process. India supported a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled.

On Saturday, the Foreign Secretary met Afghanistan’s acting Finance Minister Abdul Habib Zadran and Deputy Minister of Transport Mohammad Zekria and witnessed signing of agreements for road projects being carried out with India’s assistance.

In a series of tweets, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said India remains committed to economic and human resource development partnership with Afghanistan.

177,01-3-20,Nirbhaya rapists seek stay on March 3 hanging,"Two of the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case on Saturday moved a Delhi court seeking stay on the execution of the death warrants, scheduled for March 3.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana issued notice to Tihar Jail authorities on the pleas moved of Akshay Singh and Pawan Kumar Gupta, directing the officials to file their response by March 2.

In his plea, Singh claimed that he has filed a fresh mercy petition before the President of India, which is pending.

Advocate AP Singh, appearing for Singh, said his earlier mercy petition that was dismissed by the President did not have complete facts.

Gupta told the court that he has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court, which is pending. He said that he also has an option to file a mercy petition.

The court had on February 17 ordered that the four convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Kumar Sharma, 26, and Akshay Kumar, 31 — be hanged on March 3 after it issued fresh death warrants, observing that deferring the execution any further would be ‘sacrilegious’ to the rights of the victim for expeditious justice.

It directed that the four men be hanged by neck on March 3 at 6 am until they are dead.

This was for the third time that the death warrants were issued by the court against them.

The court had noted that death warrants were earlier issued on January 7 and the execution was later deferred twice, i.e., on January 17 and January 31.

“Now deferring it any further would be sacrilegious to the rights of the victim for expeditious justice,” it had said.

Pawan was the only one among the four convicts who had not yet filed the curative petition — the last legal remedy available to a person, which is decided in-chamber by judges. He has not filed the mercy plea either.

The first date of execution, January 22, was postponed to February 1 by a January 17 court order.

Then the trial court, on January 31, stayed, ‘till further orders’ the execution of the four convicts as they had not exhausted all their legal remedies.

The court is hearing the applications by Nirbhaya’s parents and the Delhi government, seeking fresh death warrants for the convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of fresh date for the execution of these convicts.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi.

She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nirbhaya-rapists-seek-stay-on-march-3-hanging.html

180,01-3-20,Bundelkhand e-way a road to progress: PM,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said Bundelkhand Expressway will prove to be the development expressway of the region. To link Bundelkhand region to national Capital Delhi through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and the Yamuna Expressway, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the 296-km-long Bundelkhand Expressway to be built at a cost of Rs 15,000 crore.

The expressway will pass through Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur and Jalaun districts.

“The project will put Bundelkhand on the development expressway. It will definitely change people’s lives in this entire region,” Modi said after laying the foundation of the expressway here by pressing a button.

“To come up at a cost of around Rs 15,000 crores, this project will create thousands of job opportunities and connect the common people with facilities in bigger cities,” said the Prime Minister.

Be it the Bundelkhand Expressway, the Purvanchal Expressway or the proposed Ganga Expressway, they will all increase connectivity in Uttar Pradesh and increase job avenues, Modi said.

Recalling the state of affairs in the Bundelkhand region in the past, he said, “You must have seen in the past decades how in the name of Bundelkhand and farmers, packages worth thousand of crores of rupees were announced but farmers did not benefit.”

“But now the country has come out of that phase and every single paisa is reaching its right beneficiary,” the Prime Minister said.

Lauding the Uttar Pradesh Government, Modi said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his Government is working in “express speed (express gati)” mode.

“Earlier, expressways could be seen in bigger cities like Delhi and Mumbai. But, now, people from Chitrakoot, Banda, Mahoba, Hamirpur and Jalaun will avail the benefit of the expressway. This modern infrastructure will develop new industries here,” he said.

The Prime Minister said that “a provision of Rs 3,700 crore has been made for the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor in this year’s Budget.

These two schemes — the defence corridor and the expressway — have a deep relationship. The Bundelkhand Expressway will give speed to the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor, Modi said.

He said that “at one point of time, this region produced revolutionaries of India’s freedom struggle, and in the coming time it will make India self-reliant in ammunition and equipment”.

“This area of Bundelkhand is going to become a big centre of ‘Make in India’. The things produced here will be exported across the world. Once big factories are set up, smaller industrial units will also gain,” Modi said.

The expressway will be supplementing the nodes of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor announced by the Central Government in February 2018.

“Farmers of this place will also gain, there will be job avenues and income of every family will rise. The tourism sector will also benefit,” said the Prime Minister, who also launched 10,000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) all over the country.

Bundelkhand is getting ready to not only change its destiny, but also of India, he said raising the slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisaan’.

“Today, you have seen the defence corridor, this is ‘Jai Jawan’. Beginning of FPOs is ‘Jai Kisaan’. May Bundelkhand march ahead with ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisaan’,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister said he was confident that “from Chitrakoot, from Bundelkhand, the aspirations of Uttar Pradesh and the entire country will get express speed”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bundelkhand-e-way-a-road-to-progress--pm-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bundelkhand-e-way-a-road-to-progress--pm.html
181,01-3-20,A thappad on patriarchal mindset,"Thappad staring: Taapsee Pannu, Pavail Gulati, Ratna Pathak Shah, Tanvi Azmi, Dia Mirza, Ram Kapoor, Manav Kaul

Rated: 7/10

When the trailer was out for this film, the first thought that most people would have had is will this movie have any takers? Will the audience even like the uncomfortable subject that the the film deals with given that we live in a patrichal society and the woman, once she is married, has no identity of her own?

The Indian society lays so much stress on how and what the woman of the house must do in order to ensure her family doesn’t break even if the very same family neglects to see what the woman really wants, where her happiness lies and if she has any aspirations as a woman and wants to pursue them that gives her the respect and trust that she has put in an instituition called marriage.

Thappad is definitely a slap on all our faces. Because we allow our mothers to bring us up with the notion that once we are married, we have no identify of our own. That it is okay for the man to take out his frustration on his woman.

That it is okay for him to justify that act by saying that he was stressed and frsutrated. That he couldn’t have hit his boss with whom he was angry and took that out on the wife. That it was a must for the wife to forget and move on even though the husband dared to raise his hand on the wife in front of everyone.

Tanvi Azmi’s character says: Thoda badarsht karna sikhna chahiye auraton ko, is such a archiac thought. Do we ask the men to tolerate? No. Why a woman?

Thodi bahut maar peet toh expression of love hi hai na sir? is yet another stereotypical mindset of men.

Like Tappsee Pannu’s character said: Tum apne company mein itne emotionally invested thhey you could not move on..maine toh apni puri life invest kari hai tumhare saath kaise move on karoon? And adds: Pata hai uss thappad se kya hua?..uss ek thappad se na muje woh saari unfair cheezein saaf saaf dikhne lag gayi jisko main andekha karke move karti jaa rahi thi.

Kudos to Anubhav Sinha, who is also the director and Mrunmayee Lagoo to have come up with such a story. We need more such subjects that break the patriachal mindeset.

Sinha has done a great service by making this film. There may be many men who will not agree and feel that a slap is a ground for a divorce but the fact remains that while it was just a slap par nahi maar sakta.

It is a movie that every man must watch. And the woman too so that she knows that she has an identity of her own.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-thappad-on-patriachal-mindset-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/a-thappad-on-patriarchal-mindset.html
182,01-3-20,‘I have never given an audition',"Her acting journey began when she was a finalist in Splitsvilla. PAVITRA PUNIA has been a part of shows like Yeh Hai Mohabbatein and Naginn 3. She speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about how she entered the industry, her love for playing negative characters and what made her play Timnasa in Baalveer Returns

What made you say yes to play Timnasa?

First, it is a very powerful evil role. Second, I love playing negative roles. So actually there was no reason to turn down this role.

What attracts you towards such roles?

When it comes to positive roles, there is not too much of versatility in them. You have to give certain expressions and play it in a certain way. But when it comes to playing negative ones, there is a lot of space for the actors to experiment with it. You can give a whole lot of different expressions. This is the one thing that is extremely important for me. I want that space so that’s why I choose negative roles.

From Splitsvilla 3 to Baalveer Returns, how has the journey been thus far?

It has been an amazing one. God has been kind enough to me that till now I have never given an audition for any role. The audience and the production houses appreciated and liked my work so much so that I keep getting work without having to go through auditions. There’s nothing else that I could have asked for in all these years.

How did Splitsvilla happen?

It was never a plan to join be a part of TV industry. Back in 2009, I was flying with Kingfisher Airlines and one day while I was working on my laptop, a pop-up advertisement appeared on the screen that said ‘if you want to be a part of Roadies click here’. I just clicked the link and filled the form. But the team called me and asked me to be a part of Splitsvilla instead. That’s how I came on board for the show and became a part of the industry. And till now I never plan anything. I just go with the flow.

What was the most challenging role that you have ever played?

Timnasa has been the most challenging role till now. I did a lot of exercises for it, I learnt sword fighting among other things to bring in that reality in the character.

Was there a moment when you had to go out of your comfort zone?

No. There was no such moment as such. When I am dressed as a character, I automatically get into the skin of the character. I don't have to put in too much of efforts for the role. I believe it's like an inbuilt quality.

A role that you would say no to?

Anything that involves nudity and or boldness.

And a role that you would like to experiment with?

A gangster. Something like Haseena Parkar or Mafia Queens of Mumbai interests me a lot.

Your fondest memory in the industry.

Since 2009, the best time that I am having in the industry is now. Playing Timnasa has been my fondest memory. The role comes close to my heart. If I go back in time, then when I got my first show Love U Zindagi that aired on Star Plus is the fondest memory.

Is there a checklist that you follow before taking up projects?

No, not at all. I just go by my gut feeling. Fortunately whatever roles I get are so good that there is no reason to say no to them.

Apart from acting, what keeps you busy?

I am an entrepeneur and a business woman. My brain only works when I am doing business. Acting is all by heart and business is all by brain. That’s how I work.

Future projects?

I will be doing a web series that will release this year. It is a gangster-based role and people will get to know about it soon.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-have-never-given-an-audition--2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-have-never-given-an-audition-.html

185,01-3-20,Samsung Galaxy S20+: Android flagship to outpace the rest,"The fight in the India premium smartphone segment has intensified and Samsung which enjoys a tremendous brand loyalty in this price range in India has now brought in Galaxy S20 series -- Galaxy S20 Ultra, the S20+ and the S20 with powerful cameras -- to the country.

According to the South Korean tech giant, it has completely reimagined the camera system in the new Galaxy S20 series to entice users to upgrade from previous gen Galaxy phones.

We reviewed the Galaxy S20+ (8GB+128GB storage variant) launched for Rs 73,999. Here's how it fared.

The new device is pretty much like the flagship Galaxy S flagship device -- usual big displays, small bezels and a glass sandwich design with a metal rail pressed between two sheets of glass.

Like previous generation Samsung flagships, the S20+ also has an impressive screen with ample RAM for smooth performance.

All the new Galaxy S20 models have a display panel refresh rate of 120Hz. And that does make a huge noticeable difference in user interface (UI) smoothness.

Notably, the 120Hz rate is only accessible at FullHD resolution.

The Samsung Galaxy S20+ has a 6.7-inch display, which is quite a leap from its predecessor's 6.4-inch display size.

The Galaxy S20+ misses out on the 108MP camera and 100X zoom feature that the pricier Ultra has. It, instead, has a time of flight (ToF) sensor, a 12MP primary camera, 64MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultra wide camera. We especially liked the 3x hybrid optical and 30x digital zoom range.

The S20+ took excellent images in almost every lighting conditions. The images lost details in yellow lights though.

The camera has a wider hump, which makes it look more proportional. The S20+ can also capture 8K video like the Ultra which makes sense from a performance point of view.

The selfie camera brings in a nifty addition that detects more people outside its default cropped frame and automatically toggles into wide mode. The selfies looked a little over-processed though.

Also, the blur on the portrait mode looks more artificial than before.

The new 'Single-Take' mode essentially takes both an image and a video. It shoots a variety of shots over a 10-second span -- photos, ultra-wides, portraits, hyperlapse video, regular video, and so on.

It let us clip 33MP photos from video, which was really handy.

The Samsung Galaxy S20+ has the same 4,500mAh battery that the recently launched S10 Lite also houses. Battery depletion on S20+ was quick and strictly lasted a day on a single charge with heavy to moderate usage.

The device comes with Samsung's own UI 2.0, on top of Android 10 OS.

Samsung is also working on a future update to improve the camera experience so be ready for more seamless experience with your photos.

Conclusion: The new Galaxy S20 series is Samsung's big bet on a new camera system with premium internals and hardware. Like its predecessor, the new Galaxy S20+ is also an Android flagship that is here to stay and be remembered.

S20+ can easily be called one of the most impressive among 2020 Android flagships.

186,01-3-20,PS5 controller to feature wireless charging: Report,"Even as Sony has confirmed that the company will be launching its next-generation gaming console 'PlayStation 5' soon now a latest patent has revealed that the upcoming console may feature wireless charging via the use of an attachable adaptor.

Sony filed a controller patent with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in the summer of last year, and the full document is now available for public viewing, complete with pictures and a detailed description of the product itself, news portal Gamesradar reported recently.

The patent describes Sony's plans to develop ""a wireless charging adapter that can snap onto a computer game controller can be inductively coupled to a charging base to wirelessly recharge a battery in the controller.""

Recently, a report claimed that the upcoming console may feature a microphone on the controller for voice assistant on-board.

This new feature will make the device capable of interpreting commands and requests while it is in use, much like smart speakers such as Amazon' Echo range.

Additionally, the latest model is also expected to add two new buttons to the design.

It looks remarkably similar to the current DualShock 4 but with a couple of extra buttons on the rear and one major omission -- the PS button on the front.

On the other side, the back is exactly the same, but includes two new configurable buttons, which means one can program them to perform the same function of another button.

The latest design also shows a USB Micro-B charger, suggesting that this new controller could work with the PlayStation 4.

187,01-3-20,Bowlers bring India back as NZ dismissed for 235 at tea,"The deadly combination of Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah brought India back in the second Test match, dismissing New Zealand for 235 at tea on day two of the second Test here on Sunday.

Shami (4/81 in 23.1 overs) and Bumrah (3/62 in 22 overs) were brilliant throughout the second day and also got good support from Ravindra Jadeja (2/22 in 10 overs) as India now enjoy a slender seven-run lead.

The visitors had scored 242 in their first innings.

Jadeja took a stunning one-handed airborne catch at deep mid-wicket to end the useful ninth wicket partnership of 51 runs between Kyle Jamieson (49) and Neil Wagner (21) at the stroke of tea.

The New Zealand tail wagged once again and stopped India from having at least a 50-run lead.

Just like the first session, India got five in the second session as Bumrah quickly removed BJ Watling (0) and Tim Southee (0) just after lunch.

Colin de Grandhomme then got a classical left-arm orthodox delivery from Jadeja which pitched on middle and spun away enough to dislodge off-stump.

Wagner and Jamieson then defied the Indian bowlers for nearly 12 overs before a moment of inspiration from Jadeja saw the end of Wagner and Jamieson fell a run short of his maiden Test half-century.

For New Zealand, Tom Latham (52 off 122 balls) scored a gritty half-century but never looked settled since the start of the morning session as Bumrah beat him on multiple occasions.

The pace trio hit the right length from the start with Yadav removing Tom Blundell (30 off 77 balls) with one that came back in with the angle as the bowler went slightly wide off crease.

Bumrah, who was deadly since morning, then removed Kane Williamson (3). The New Zealand skipper was caught in two minds to a delivery that jagged back and took the outside edge when he went for a half-hearted jab.

Ross Taylor (15) lost his patience and stepped out to hit Jadeja against the turn and the ball ballooned towards backward point with Yadav taking a well-judged catch.

Shami, who has been off-colour in this tour so far, was finally back in the mix when he deceived Latham with a classic.

The left-hander was prodding to the away going deliveries and the wily speedster got one to move in. The opener shouldered his arms, not factoring in the late movement which disturbed the stumps.

Shami then got the jittery Henry Nicholls (14) with a delivery that bounced a shade more and the thick edge was taken superbly by a diving Virat Kohli at second slip.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bowlers-bring-india-back-as-nz-dismissed-for-235-at-tea-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/bowlers-bring-india-back-as-nz-dismissed-for-235-at-tea.html
188,01-3-20,Second Test: India 90-6 after dismissing New Zealand for 235 on day 2,"India struggled to 90 for six in their second innings after dismissing New Zealand for 235 on day two of the second Test at the Hagley Oval here on Sunday.

At stumps, Rishabh Pant (1) and Hanuma Vihari (5) were at the crease with India leading by 97 runs with four wickets in hand.

Earlier, Indian pacers led India's fightback on the second day with the trio of Mohammed Shami (4/81), Jasprit Bumrah (3/62) and Umesh Yadav (1/46) sharing eight wickets.

Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja (2/22) claimed two wickets and also took a stunning one-handed airborne catch at deep mid-wicket contribute to the team.

Tom Latham (52) and Kyle Jamieson (49) were the top-scorers as New Zealand ended their first innings seven runs short of India's first innings total of 242.

In their second essay, India once again found the going tough against the New Zealand pace battery with Mayank Agarwal (3), Prithvi Shaw (14) and skipper Virat Kohli (14) returning to the hut quickly.

Earlier, resuming at 63 for no loss, New Zealand were reduced to 142 for five at lunch with the Indian pace trio dominating the proceedings.

India claimed the rest of the five wickets in the second session which ended with the dismissal of Jamieson, who fell a run short of his maiden Test half-century.

Brief Scores:

189,01-3-20,I didn't even realise that I took catch to dismiss Wagner: Jadeja,"Spin-bowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja on Sunday said he wasn't expecting the ball to travel so quickly towards him before he pulled off an absolute stunner to dismiss New Zealand's Neil Wagner in the second Test here.

Jadeja took a sensational one-handed airborne catch at deep mid-wicket to end the useful ninth wicket partnership of 51 runs between Kyle Jamieson (49) and Neil Wagner (21) at the stroke of tea.

""I was expecting him (Wagner) to score towards deep square leg. But I didn't expect the ball to come at that pace,"" said Jadeja, who claimed two wickets for 22 runs in the New Zealand first innings.

""It came so quickly with the wind and I just stuck my hand out. I didn't even realise when I took the catch. We bowled well as a unit. We will look to bat well and bowl them out again.""

On Sunday, India dismissed New Zealand for 235 to take a slender seven-run lead.

The pacers led India's fight back on the second day with the trio of Mohammed Shami (4/81), Jasprit Bumrah (3/62) and Umesh Yadav (1/46) sharing eight wickets among them.

190,01-3-20,"Don't want to play blame game, Bumrah on India's poor batting show","Indian bowlers' impressive performance in the second Test has been largely undone by a dismal batting show, but pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah doesn't want to indulge in a ""blame game"" which he believes is an exercise in futility.

Bumrah and Mohammed Shami took seven wickets between themselves to bowl out New Zealand for 235 only for the batsmen to lose six wickets in the final session for 90 runs on the second day.

India were staring at a defeat as they reached 90 for 6 in their second innings at stumps on the second day for an overall lead of 97 runs. This was after New Zealand were bowled out for 235 in their first innings.

""See we don't play the blame game. In our (team) culture, we don't look at blaming anyone. Some days if as a bowling unit we don't pick up wickets, then that doesn't give the batsmen liberty to take our case, isn't it?"" asked Bumrah, trying his best to defend the dismal show by the top-order batsmen.

Bumrah said he has faith in Rishabh Pant and Hanuma Vihari's ability to push the opposition hard on the third day even though it will be easier said than done.

Pant and Vihari were batting on 5 and 1 respectively at the close of second day's play.

""We, as a team, want to push it hard and do well but the situation is what it is. We have two batsmen left and we would look to push tomorrow as well. We can try and work hard and score as many as we can and we will see how it goes,"" said Bumrah who took three wickets for 62 runs in New Zealand first innings.

""We, as a unit, are very close and we are working hard. We lost more wickets than we wanted to but we don't play the blame game and we try to keep everyone together,"" he said, stressing on the ""blame game"" part multiple times.

He had copped a bit of criticism for his dry spell in the ODI series as well as the first Test but Bumrah said that he doesn't bother as long as he knows that he is bowling well.

""I don't look at personal performances as I told you. You look to do the processes right and you look to bowl well. You look to create pressure. Some days, I will get wickets and some days, someone else will. My focus is always on what I could do,"" the 26-year-old slinger from Gujarat said.

The only thing that bothers him is whether the mindset is correct or not.

""If there's some problem in my execution and my mindset is not correct, then you address that. You don't focus on the results, you focus on the processes you can control,"" he said.

About the Hagley Oval pitch, Bumrah felt that moisture on the first day helped New Zealand bowlers make dents on the track and that kept them in the game on the second day too.

""On first day, there was a bit of moisture and because of that when they bowled in the first innings, dents were created. There was a bit of seam movement for both the teams and bowlers were there in the game and you bowl good areas, you create good pressure. We were also creating a lot of chances and that (dents) could have played a role.""

Bumrah was happy that as senior pacers, he and Shami were consistent in creating chances that saw New Zealand trail by seven runs in first innings.

""As a bowling unit, when we bowled, I thought we created a lot of chances. We will keep on doing that and creating pressure. We will create enough chances and we could get wickets. We were very happy with that as senior members of the team, we have to bowl long spells and we were up for it,"" he signed off.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-want-to-play-blame-game--bumrah-on-india-s-poor-batting-show-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/don-t-want-to-play-blame-game--bumrah-on-india-s-poor-batting-show.html
191,01-3-20,"Peace, but not at our cost: Afghan women fear Taliban return","As US troops prepare to leave Afghanistan, opening the door for a potential Taliban comeback, women across the war-torn country are nervous about losing their hard-won freedoms in the pursuit of peace.

The militants were in power for around five years until the US invasion of 2001. They ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist that turned women into virtual prisoners under a strict interpretation of sharia law.

The Taliban's fall transformed women's lives, much more so in urban areas like Kabul than in conservative rural Afghanistan.

But across the country, women remain wary of the insurgents, desperate to see an end to the violence, but fearful of paying a heavy price.

Under the Taliban, women were barred from seeking education or work -- rights that Afghan female professionals are fiercely protective of today.

In the western city of Herat, saleswoman Setara Akrimi, 32, told AFP: ""I will be very happy if peace comes and the Taliban stop killing our people."" ""But if the Taliban come back to power... With their old mentality, it is a matter of concern for me,"" the divorced mother of three added.

""If they tell me to sit at home, I will not be able to support my family,"" she said.

""There are thousands of women like me in Afghanistan, we are all worried."" Akrimi's anxieties are echoed by Kabul-based veterinarian Tahera Rezai, who believes ""the arrival of the Taliban will affect women's right to work, freedom and independence"".

""There has been no change in their mentality,"" the 30-year-old told AFP. Passionate about her career, Rezai said she was pessimistic about her prospects if the insurgents return to government, even in a truncated capacity.

""Looking at their history, I feel less hopeful... I believe the situation will get harder for working women like me,"" she said.

In the run-up to the US deal, the militants made a vague commitment to respect women's rights in line with ""Islamic values"", prompting warnings from activists that the pledge was mere lip service and open to broad interpretation.

The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and while they now allow girls to attend primary school in some areas, occasional reports of floggings and even the public stoning of women persist, fuelling fears they will turn back the clock if they return to power.

Many ordinary Afghans are struggling to balance their desire for peace with their dread of the insurgents.

""Every family here is grieving because they have lost their children, sons, husbands, brothers in the war,"" government official Torpekay Shinwari told AFP in eastern Nangarhar province, which witnessed fierce battles between the Taliban and the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate.

The 46-year-old said she was praying for peace, but was increasingly concerned that ""women would be looked upon as the second sex and suppressed"" if the militants gain ground.

But in Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, schoolgirl Parwana Hussaini struck a rare optimistic note.

""I am not worried. Who are the Taliban? They are our brothers,"" the 17-year-old told AFP.

""We are all Afghans and want peace.""

Furthermore, she added: ""The young generation has changed, and will not allow the Taliban to enforce their old ideology upon us.""

For those who bore the brunt of the insurgents' merciless rule, however, there is little doubt that a Taliban comeback will bring anything other than a repeat of ""dark and painful memories"".

Factory worker Uzra, from the mainly Shiite Hazara ethnic minority, sobbed as she recounted life as a young mother, alone at home with her children when the Sunni-fundamentalist Taliban arrived in her village.

""I still vividly remember the day... They massacred all the men, and then came to my house,"" the 40-year-old said, too frightened to give her full name.

The militants threatened to behead her then three-year-old daughter, she told AFP from her home in central Bamiyan province.

The family survived and fled to Pakistan, but her husband was disabled and traumatised by the brutal beatings he suffered.

""To this day, when the word 'Taliban' comes up, he starts crying,"" she said. ""Everybody wants peace, but not if the Taliban returns. I don't want this so-called peace.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/peace--but-not-at-our-cost--afghan-women-fear-taliban-return-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/peace--but-not-at-our-cost--afghan-women-fear-taliban-return.html
192,01-3-20,"Afghanistan's partial truce will continue, 'with goal' for full ceasefire: Ghani","Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said Sunday that a seven-day partial truce would continue, but he rejected a key component of a new US-Taliban deal that calls for the release of thousands of insurgent prisoners.

The so-called ""reduction in violence"" period ran for the week preceding the signing of a historic accord between the US and the Taliban in Doha on Saturday.

The agreement spells out a withdrawal timeline of 14 months for all foreign forces, provided the Taliban honour several pledges and enter talks with Kabul for a more comprehensive peace deal.

""The reduction in violence will continue with a goal to reach a full ceasefire,"" Ghani told a press conference.

""General (Scott) Miller has told Taliban to do so. It is expected (to continue),"" he added, referring to the US commander in charge of foreign forces in Afghanistan.

But, in a sign of a bumpy road ahead, Ghani pushed back against a clause in the deal that calls for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan government to release up to 5,000 prisoners.

""There is no commitment to releasing 5,000 prisoners,"" Ghani said.

""This is the right and the self-will of the people of Afghanistan. It could be included in the agenda of the intra-Afghan talks, but cannot be a prerequisite for talks."" He added that any prisoner release was ""not in the authority of the US, it is in the authority of the Afghan government.""

The president, who is mired in a political crisis following fraud allegations in his re-election, was referring to upcoming talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government that were agreed to as part of the deal.

The Taliban had until now refused to negotiate with Ghani's administration, which they considered a US puppet regime, but the withdrawal agreement hinges on Kabul and the insurgents reaching a separate peace deal through ""intra-Afghan"" negotiations.

Ghani's questioning of the prisoner release points to tough negotiations ahead in a country where leaders seem incapable of coalescing around important issues.

In order to boost religious harmony, the Border Security Force (BSF) has decided to rebuild its constable Mohammad Anees’ house, which was burnt in the riots in North-east Delhi, and hand it over to him as a wedding gift.

According to a senior BSF official, Anees (29), who is presently posted at a BSF camp in Radhabari near West Bengal’s Siliguri will be transferred back to Delhi to be with family and prepare for his wedding.

Anees house in North-east Delhi Khajuri Khas had suffered extensive damage as it was burnt by rioters during the recent communal clashes. While his family members are safe, the house needs re-building and renovation work. BSF officials got to know about the damage to the constable’s parental house in Khajuri Khas from media reports.

Meanwhile, Pusphendra Rathore, the Deputy Inspector General (DIG), BSF, on Saturday met parents and other family members of Anees. “The BSF chief VK Johri has directed that all help be provided to the constable’s family following which we have decided to provide an assistance amount of `10 lakh to the jawan from our welfare fund,” said Rathore.

Also, the engineering wing of the force will rebuild the house within a fortnight, said the DIG.

“I think we should be able to put the house in good shape before April when the jawan is scheduled to marry,” he said, adding that it will be like a “wedding gift” to him.

“The BSF is a family and whenever a member needs help, all resources are put together for the task. We have requested the constable’s family to inform them about any other help they require. We are also posting constable Anees to Delhi very soon so that he can be with his family and also prepare for his wedding,” said the DIG.

The jawan had joined the 2.5-lakh personnel strong BSF in 2013 and officials said he did not mention a word to his seniors about the damage to his house in the riots.

Anees was posted to West Bengal after he completed a stint in the anti-Naxal operations grid in Odisha. His family is also very brave and composed. They were thankful for the help extended by the BSF to them and all they wanted was peace, brotherhood and normalcy is restored, another official of the force said.

194,01-3-20,Hailey Baldwin's 'party trick' made Justin Bieber call her,"Model Hailey Baldwin has shared the party trick that made her now-husband Justin Bieber give her a call and reconcile after the two took a break from their relationship.

During her appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"", the model was asked ""Did you do any party tricks?""

""Well, I say this because the last time you were on our show, you did something that was the most amazing thing ever. Everybody was talking about it, you opened a beer bottle with your teeth,"" said Fallon, reports people.com.

Hailey found it ""really fun and there's actually another funny story behind this and that is that last time I was here, we did this little party trick where I opened a Corona bottle with my teeth"".

""The next morning -- after the interview had aired -- I got a certain phone call from a certain someone and it was a little like, ‘Hey, how are you? I saw you on Jimmy Fallon last night. You were looking really good. I loved that trick that you did, I had no idea that you can do that. It was so cool'. Cut to, I'm now married to that certain someone,"" she said.

Fallon later said that the model initially met Bieber when she was just 13 years old in 2009.

""I know, it sounds like this weird arranged marriage situation. We met because my dad, he brought me to the 'Today' show when Justin performed there. He was no more than 15 I think,"" she recalled.

When asked if she was a fan of the singer at the time, she said that she was not.

""To be honest, this is the truth. He was so new that I didn't really know a lot about him yet,"" she said.

""It was really kinda before anything. I met him and his mom and my dad kind of just connected as friends and we invited them over to our house the next day. Him and his mom just came over for family dinner with me and my family and we went bowling.""

196,01-3-20,Daniel Radcliffe won't play Harry Potter in 'Fantastic Beasts' films,"Actor Daniel Radcliffe is not interested in reprising his iconic role of Harry Potter in the fantasy franchise's spin-off films, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".

The actor, who fronted the movie series created by JK Rowling for 10 years, said the new films are ""doing fine"" without the original characters.

Asked if he would return as Harry in the ""Fantastic Beasts"" series, Radcliffe told Variety, ""I don't think so. I don't like say no to things, but it's not something that I'm rushing to do. I feel like those films have moved on and they're doing just fine without us. I'm happy to keep it that way.""

""I like what my life is now. I'm not saying that I'll never go back into any franchise, but I like the flexibility that I have with my career now. And I don't want to get into a situation where I'm signed up for one series for years in advance,"" he added.

Based on Rowling's fantasy books of the same name, ""Harry Potter"" series translated into eight movie installments, released between 2001-11, and starred Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint in the lead.

A spin-off prequel series started with 2016's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", also penned by Rowling, marking the beginning of the Wizarding World shared media franchise.

197,01-3-20,Proud to be known for action films: Rohit Shetty,"Action-packed films are director Rohit Shetty's forte and the filmmaker says he is proud that his name is synonymous with high-octane stunt-laden movies.

Rohit, son of legendary stuntman-actor M B Shetty, said he always knew action was his calling.

""My father was doing it. My mother and I knew, I will also do it. I started at the age of 16, I am 45 today. Stunts and action have become my identity now. I never thought it would go up to this level.

""I am happy and proud about it. The only thing is even if others are doing action today, people say, it is 'Rohit Shetty' style. That makes me happy and proud,"" Rohit told PTI in an interview.

The director, best known for actioners such as ""Singham"" series, ""Simmba"", and action-comedies like ""Golmaal"" films, ""All The Best: Fun Begins"" and ""Chennai Express"", currently hosts action-adventure show ""Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi"".

Rohit said the Colors TV reality series, shot in Bulgaria, suits his personality.

""When I do a show like this it looks real as people relate it with me. It works for me as well. I enjoy it and look forward to it. Every year has been great. The action is great. I had explored Bulgaria in 'Dilwale' so I know the team and it became a bit easier to design the stunts this time,"" he added.

For the director, safety is the top priority while doing stunts.

""There is a lot of calculation that goes into designing a stunt. You need to be calm and calculative, and that comes with experience. It is very important to be prepared both mentally and physically. We train ourselves physically but mental strength is more important,"" he said.

On the direction front, Rohit's next directorial venture is the much-awaited ""Sooryavanshi"", featuring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif.

This is the third film in the filmmaker's cop universe, which will also see Ajay Devgn as Singham and Ranveer Singh as Simmba in special appearances.

""Sooryavanshi"" is slated to be released on March 24.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/proud-to-be-known-for-action-films--rohit-shetty-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/proud-to-be-known-for-action-films--rohit-shetty.html
198,01-3-20,"Nice to see Virat making errors under pressure, says Trent Boult","Forcing a world class batsman like Virat Kohli make errors after piling pressure on him was extremely satisfying, senior New Zealand pacer Trent Boult said on Sunday after his side took control of the second Test here.

Boult had figures of 3 for 12 as India were reduced to 90 for six in their second innings for an overall lead of 97 runs at the end of the second day.

The hosts have successfully kept the dangerous Kohli quiet throughout the Test series, as the India skipper failed to reach even 20 runs in the four completed innings.

""He (Kohli) is one of the best players in the world, no doubt about that,"" Boult said, when asked about the secret of keeping Kohli under check.

He said his team's strategy was to put pressure on Kohli by limiting the boundary balls.

""Obviously, he is a big player for them and we just tried to put enough pressure on him, keep him quiet and soak up those boundary balls, and it was nice to see him make a few errors. We were lucky to get two that lined up and hit him on the pads nicely and it was a good feeling to see the back of him.""

Boult also seemed sympathetic with the Indian batting line-up's woes against moving deliveries.

""Probably, they are used to playing on low and slow pitches in India and it took time for them to get adjusted. Just like if I bowl in India, it will be foreign conditions for me,"" Boult said.

The 30-year-old said that conditions were favourable for seam bowling and he didn't mind that the ball moved around through and through, which resulted in 16 wickets falling on the second day.

""Sixteen wickets, I am not sure if that's up there with a record in Test cricket in terms of day two but the bowlers obviously pitched the ball up nicely and got rewards. Seeing the ball move around like it did, I feel we are in a decent position,"" he said.

He said it augurs well for the team that the entire bowling department was contributing.

""We are all enjoying hunting out there as a pack, getting the ball to move around. I think the bowling unit is very clear about how they are trying to target the opposition.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nice-to-see-virat-making-errors-under-pressure--says-trent-boult-2020-03-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/nice-to-see-virat-making-errors-under-pressure--says-trent-boult.html
