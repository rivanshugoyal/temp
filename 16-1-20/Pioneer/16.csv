6,16-1-20,Dolphin census at B’kanika on January 19,"n After a five-year break, the annual headcount exercise of dolphins inhabiting along brackish water bodies of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary in Kendrapada district would be conducted on January 19, according to a forest official.

A survey of these animals is vital for the study of the growth pattern of the aquatic species living in these water bodies and shallow sea waters of this Ramsar international wetland site.

Equipped with binoculars, GPS sets and rangefinders, nine teams comprising over 40 wildlife experts would conduct the dolphin census, said Rajnagar Mangrove (Wildlife) Forest Division DFO Bikash Ranjan Dash.

Enumerators had sighted 270 dolphins in the sea and deltaic zones during the last census conducted in 2015. A total of 58 Irrawaddy dolphins, 23 Bottlenose dolphins, 123 Sousa Chinensis, 50 Sousa Plumbera dolphins, 15 pantropical spotted dolphins and one Finless porpoise were found at that time.

Headcount of dolphins could not be undertaken during the past five years because of inclement weather and rough sea, the official said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dolphin-census-at-b---kanika-on-january-19.html
7,17-1-20,Amazon to create one million jobs in India by 2025,"E-commerce major Amazon on Friday said it plans to create one million new jobs in India over the next five years through investments in technology, infrastructure and its logistics network.

These jobs are in addition to the seven lakh jobs Amazon's investments have enabled over the last six years in the country.

""Amazon plans to create one million new jobs in India by 2025,"" the company said in a statement, adding that the jobs - created both directly and indirectly - will be across industries, including information technology, skill development, content creation, retail, logistics, and manufacturing.

Amazon.Com Inc chief Jeff Bezos had on Wednesday announced USD 1 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) investment in India to help bring small and medium businesses online and committed to exporting USD 10 billion worth of India-made goods by 2025.

""We are investing to create a million new jobs here in India over the next five years,"" Bezos said.

""We've seen huge contributions from our employees, extraordinary creativity from the small businesses we've partnered with, and great enthusiasm from the customers who shop with us—and we're excited about what lies ahead,"" Bezos added.

The India has prioritised job creation and skilling initiatives – including the training of more than 400 million people by 2022 – in rural and urban areas.

""Amazon's job creation commitment and investment in traders and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) complement these social inclusion and social mobility efforts by creating more opportunities for people in India to find employment, build skills, and expand entrepreneurship opportunities,"" the statement said.

8,16-1-20,Lessons for China,"Tsai’s presidential poll win and the Hong Kong local elections last year show the weakness of the Chinese regime, which remains dependent on propaganda and influence to bully its neighbours

The just-concluded presidential and legislative elections in Taiwan might remain a turning point in the life of not only the island but the entire region. President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) defeated Han Kuo-yu from China-friendly Kuomintang by more than 2.5 million votes (57.1 per cent for Tsai and 38.6 per cent for Han). The former became the first-ever candidate to capture more than eight million votes. James Soong Chu-yu, chairman of the People First Party (PFP) close to China performed poorly with only 4.2 per cent of the votes. More than 14 million (out of 19 million eligible voters) participated in the vote, which also saw the DPP retain its majority in the legislature, winning 61 out of 113 seats.

Many observers saw this as a slap in the face of China and its President Xi Jinping. The problem for Beijing is that this is a second debacle in a row — in November 2019, the Hong Kong District Council elections were held for 18 seats when a record 71 per cent of the electorate had voted. The election was viewed by many as a referendum on pro-democracy protests that continued for six months. The results came as a jolt for Beijing; the Communist regime had never expected a “tsunami” in favour of the pro-democracy movement, which took control of 17 of the18 district councils.

At first, it looked as if Beijing did not know how to react. According to The South China Morning Post: “Xinhua waited [two days] to release a two-paragraph news report on the polls. It only stated that the elections took place and 18 districts produced results.” The next day, the People’s Daily went on talking about the history of US intervention in foreign elections. In the weeks preceding the elections, the Global Times repeatedly claimed that a “silent majority” in Hong Kong was condemning the protests.

An important common factor, the country’s mobilising youth, has been pointed out by Juang Wen-jong, professor of public policy and management at Shih Hsin University in The South China Morning Post: “Young people — or those between 20 and 39 — were the key to the weekend’s elections as they made up at least 6.6 million of the eligible voters in Taiwan… They helped bolster the turnout rate, which helped increase both the vote for Tsai and her party.”

Many considered the Taiwan’s presidential election to be a proxy contest about its national identity. This probably explains why Beijing was not amused. What has made matters worse for China is that many countries sent congratulatory messages to the new Taiwanese President. “China cried foul, claiming that their actions violated the ‘one-China’ principle,” wrote the Taiwan News.

The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) had announced that officials from some 60 countries had greeted Tsai via phone call and email. It included US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. “In a released statement, Pompeo congratulated Tsai on her well-deserved win and praised Taiwanese voters for demonstrating the spirit of democracy.”

The word “democracy” makes China see red. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang spoke of elections in “Taiwan region of China” and asserted that it was a “sub-national affair in China.” He added that Beijing deplores and firmly opposes “those countries” which violate the “one-China principle” by “offering the congratulations and lodged solemn representations.”

Geng declared that Beijing opposes any official relations between “the Taiwan region” and countries that have diplomatic ties with China. He asked these countries to deal with the issue “properly and with caution to avoid sending the wrong message to Taiwan’s independence forces.”

Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) released a communiqué asking Taipei to adhere to the “1992 consensus” between China and Taiwan. Ma Xiaoguang, the TAO spokesman, said: “Our political policy towards Taiwan is clear and consistent. We adhere to the basic principles of peaceful reunification; one country, two systems and one China.” We will resolutely safeguard China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resolutely oppose any plot or act of “Taiwan independence” and resolutely promote the interests and “well-being of Taiwan compatriots.”

At the same time, Xinhua blamed Tsai and the DPP of using “dirty tactics such as cheating, repression and intimidation to get votes.” The official news agency claimed that it exposes “their selfish, greedy and evil nature.” In a Chinese language op-ed, Xinhua even accused Tsai of “buying votes and blamed the election results on external dark forces.”

The “dark forces” are obviously the “West”, which has sinned for “inventing” democracy (incidentally, is it the West which “invented” the “evil” democracy? Serious historians believe that elected village councils existed in India centuries before it was introduced in Ancient Greece).

The “two slaps” show the weakness of the Chinese regime, which depends too much on “propaganda” and “influence” to bully its neighbours — whether “Chinese ones” like Hong Kong or Taiwan or foreign ones such as Australia, Vietnam or the Philippines.

Once again, the billions of dollars used to change the mind of the voters did not help Beijing. To the contrary, it looks as if it had the reverse effect and this may not change in the near future. Beijing is facing a dead end without even realising it.

Chinese leaders are unfortunately incapable of changing their tactics. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was recently in India to discuss the boundary issue with the National Security Advisor, went on the same old track. In Zimbabwe during an African tour, Wang affirmed that Tsai’s win would not stop Taiwan’s reunification with the mainland: “A local election on the Taiwan island will [not] shake [China’s determination] despite erroneous words and actions by some Western politicians… The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the reunification across the [Taiwan] strait is inevitable. Going against the trend is bound to reach a dead end. Anyone separating the nation will stink for 10,000 years.”

Well, the human spirit for freedom and the aspiration to choose one’s own destiny is also difficult to suppress or extinguish. It is true not only for Hong Kong or Taiwan but places like Tibet and Xinjiang, too.

According to the official Tibet Daily, on January 12, the legislative branch of the Tibetan Autonomous Region voted in favour of new regulations to “strengthen ethnic unity” in Tibet. Four years ago, similar rules were introduced in Xinjiang. It was later used to justify crackdowns on the Muslim Uygur minority. But once again, it is not easy to tame the human spirit and change the hearts of the masses. Beijing will have to learn one day.

9,16-1-20,SC to the rescue,"Kerala’s suit on CAA in the top court may be an opportunity to clarify grey areas and assumptions around the new law

Many may interpret the Kerala Government’s challenging of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court under Article 131 as pointless or even a deterrent to nationalist design. But what many are missing is that it also provides an opportunity to seek the apex court’s detailed clarification on the matter once and for all rather than confining the law to the domain of subjective assessment and selective interpretation. Article 131 allows a State or even several States to file a suit in the Supreme Court in case of any dispute that it/they may have with the Union Government. What the suit does is make it morally incumbent upon the court to undertake a more rigorous examination of the subject concerned than moving it to the outbox of a blanket dismissal. The Chief Justice of India (CJI) may have to constitute a larger Bench to hear the case, considering that a decision is pending on the 2015 verdict by a two-judge Bench that Article 131 could be used to examine the constitutionality of a statute. Although the ruling party and the Opposition have been peddling and politicising their own interpretations of the new law, the fact is there are too many questions that need answers. Most mistaken is the perception that civil society protests are anti-Hindu. Nobody seems to have any issue about repatriating and rehabilitating persecuted Hindus in other countries in their homeland. But the fact is the CAA, given its exclusionary clause against Muslim minorities, codifies a religious classification in governance policies, something that experts argue violates Article 14 of the Constitution and can set a wrongful precedent inimical to the secular character of India. They say it also challenges the right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practise religion under Article 25. Since much of this is implied and not categorically stated, the top court’s informed views would settle the raging debate of the times. This is much-needed considering that the law can be referenced to explain multiple situations and misguide identity politics. And if indeed saving religious minorities in countries with civilisational contiguity is the pivot of the argument, the Kerala Government has asked why leave out Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan? The other grey area concerns the law’s linkage with the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), whereby disqualified settler Hindus with inadequate legacy papers could still seek clemency under CAA but Muslims in the same boat would not. Besides, the economic cost of the influx mandated by CAA, even rehabilitating immigrants with jobs, has not gone down too well in the North-east, which is protectionist about rights of indigenous people and their political relevance through economic stakeholdership. The ability to apply for citizenship on the basis of a self-declaration and fast-tracking of procedures virtually aim to undo the complexities and systemic harassment that disempowered many Hindu citizens during the compilation of the Assam NRC. It is these anxieties and derivatives that need transparency, considering it suits both the ruling party and the Opposition to hunt through the haze. Most importantly, it would settle the threat perception to India’s real civilisational pride, that of multiple heritage, a rarity of co-existence that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is proud to uphold but is dismissed as an “uneducated” opinion of dissenters.

Most significantly, a comprehensive rather than selective interpretation would help law enforcement in classifying protests as seditious or democratic. After all, CAA protesters got legitimacy because of the Delhi High Court upholding their rights to do so. Another city court, while hearing the bail plea of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, also reminded the Delhi Police that he had a constitutional right to protest. Judge Kamini Lau even observed that people were out on the streets as what should have been said inside the Parliament was “not said.” That’s why the Kerala Government’s suit becomes significant, for it forces the powers that be to lay down the rationale of the CAA rather than dismiss protests as divisive anti-Government propaganda. Politically, the Kerala Government, which has urged other Opposition States to challenge the Act in a court of law, has even made way for each protesting Chief Minister to seek a rational legal redress and escape the anarchist allegations being levelled by the ruling BJP. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, an ally of the BJP, has spoken against CAA/NRC, joining Madhya Pradesh’s Kamal Nath, West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee and Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren in opposing the law. Similar suits would lend weight to their agenda than appearing as compulsive disruptors of public life.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-to-the-rescue-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/sc-to-the-rescue.html
10,16-1-20,The Donald is coming,"Is Trump’s proposed India visit an attempt to deflect from the constant coverage of his impending impeachment trial?

No matter what you think of Donald Trump — almost everybody in the world has an opinion about the one-time real estate mogul and reality television star who is now the 45th President of the US — one cannot deny the fact that the man has a nose for news. Rather he ensures that he stays in the headlines. After becoming the third President to be impeached by the US Congress, his impending trial in the Senate, the Upper House of the US legislature, is scheduled to begin shortly. The controversial targetting of Iranian General Qasim Solemani set in motion a series of events that led to the Iranians accidentally downing a Ukrainian civilian airliner, killing 176 people. At the same time, the race to choose who will stand against Trump in the 2020 US presidential election from the Democratic Party is getting hotter with the first few US States going to the polls in February and March. It may not be a bad time for Trump to spend a few days outside, particularly in a country whose leader is very close to him. Indeed, Trump was more impressed than most leaders when he attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally, Howdy Modi, in his country.

It is highly unlikely, although not impossible, that Trump’s impeachment will be passed by the US Senate given that the Republican Party has a majority in the Upper House. Trump’s visit to a major US collegiate event earlier this week also displayed how he remains popular among his base, no matter what the media might say. He remains the favourite in the presidential election, particularly with the US being one of the few large economies in the world that is continuing to do very well. His visit to India in late February will also shore up Modi’s image, which has taken a battering after widespread anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests. Of course, there is the old adage that birds of a feather flock together with regard to Trump and Modi. But there’s no doubt that India-US ties have been on the mend over the past decade with the Modi Government only strengthening it. If Trump visits with Melania, he could always go to the Taj Mahal for a photoshoot on the “famous” chair, something that his predecessor could not manage. But Trump should realise one thing: This is one country where his favourite fast food, a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, is not available. One wonders if he will still visit India after discovering this fact.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-donald-is-coming-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-donald-is-coming.html
11,16-1-20,Don’t curb lawful expression,"Section 144 of the CrPC cannot be invoked arbitrarily only with an intention to prevent a peaceful demonstration. If so, the same constitutes abuse of power

The curbs imposed in the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) after the Centre’s abrogation of provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution of India were challenged and a plea was filed in the Supreme Court (SC). The apex court, in a recent judgment held that disagreement does not justify destabilisation and power under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) — restricting five or more people from gathering at one place — cannot be used to curb legitimate expression of democratic rights.

The apex court also observed that, “Liberty and security are always at loggerheads. It is the court’s job to ensure that the citizens are provided all rights and security.” It further held that Section 144 of the CrPC is a remedial and preventive measure and must be subject to the test of proportionality. Any order must adhere to the principle of proportionality and would be subject to judicial review.

Of late, we have witnessed that across the country, and not just in Kashmir, Section 144 is being invoked indiscriminately to contain legitimate protests against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), by the State police machinery and by the powers that be. Once Section 144 is imposed in any area, all civilians are barred from carrying weapons of any kind, including sticks, sharp-edged metallic objects or firearms in public places and only the police and other security personnel are allowed to carry weapons in areas under Section 144. More importantly, violation of Section 144 is liable for punishment of up to three years in jail.

As prevention of a crime or riot is the duty of the administration, the power conferred under Section 144 is absolute in terms of maintaining law and order. In some cases the Magistrate or the officer concerned may perceive a threat based on the material evidence available, which is invariably disclosed in the order.

However, it cannot be presumed that there would be a breach of peace merely because there is a protest. Hence, if there is no material evidence available for invocation of Section 144, such an order is in violation of Article 19 (1) of the country’s Constitution and therefore it would amount to infringement of the basic fundamental right of freedom of expression. Hence, Section 144 cannot be invoked with an intention to prevent a peaceful demonstration.

Section 144(1) contemplates that in cases where — in the opinion of a District Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other executive Magistrate specially empowered by the State Government in this behalf — there is a sufficient ground for proceeding under the said Section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, such a Magistrate may, by a written order, stating the material facts of the case and served in the manner provided under Section 134, direct any person to abstain from a certain Act.

The Magistrate is also empowered to take a certain order with respect to certain property in his/her possession or under his/her management, if he/she considers that such a direction is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of public tranquillity or a riot or an affray.

Sub-Section 2 contemplates that an ex-parte order can be passed in case of emergency and Sub-Section 3 specifies that such an order may be directed to a particular individual or to persons residing in a particular place or area or to the public generally or visiting a particular place.

A reading of the aforesaid order shows that the Magistrate or any officer passing an order under Section 141(1) of the CrPC has to state material facts and also his consideration that such an order would prevent disturbance of public tranquility. The emphasis is on the likelihood of breach of public peace. Though the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 repeals the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (Act Number V of 1898), Section 144 of the old code was retained in the new code.

Freedom of expression is an indispensable component in a democratic society. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, in his historical resolution containing aims and objects of the Constitution to be enacted by the Constituent Assembly, said, “The Constitution should guarantee and secure to all the people of India among others, freedom of thought and expression.”

Article 19(1) of the Constitution is a segment of Part III of the Constitution which pertains to fundamental rights under which all citizens shall have a right to freedom of speech and expression, to assemble peacefully and form associations. Any infringement of such a right would constitute violation of fundamental rights available to the citizens. Article 19 (2) empowers the State to make any law imposing a reasonable restriction on the exercise of such a right. When Section 144 is invoked, it may amount to a reasonable restriction imposed under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. But if the mandatory requirements under Section 144 are not complied with i.e., existence of real threat of breach of tranquility, the very invocation of Section 144 is in violation of Article 19(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court, in the Madhu Limaye case, while examining the scope of Section 144 of CrPC of the old code vis-à-vis Article 19 of the Constitution, had held that the power extends to making an order, which is either prohibitory or mandatory in nature and the urgency “is the only criteria that can justify the order under the said Section.”

The urgency should have a nexus with the likelihood of breach of tranquility. The Magistrate has to pass an order reflecting his objective consideration. The apex court also held that the power under Section 144 is not flowing from the administration but is a power to be used in a judicial manner and it should stand further judicial scrutiny.

The apex court, in the Ramlila Maidan incident, had emphasised that the degree of threat involved for invoking the provision should be a real threat to public peace and tranquillity. The provision cannot be invoked merely on imaginary or mere likely possibility. The material facts that are to be stated in the order should disclose that there is a real threat to peace or else the Magistrate or any officer does not have any power to invoke the said provision.

Similarly, the court in the State of Karnataka Vs Gowri Narayana Ambiga case held that the freedom of speech and expression must be broadly considered to include the freedom to circulate views by word of mouth, in writing or audio, video instrumentalities. This means that a gathering of a group of people raising slogans falls within the ambit of Article 19(1) of the Constitution.

In the Baldev Singh Gandhi Vs. State of Punjab case, the top court held that situations may arise where responsible persons or those who hold elected offices feel that it is their duty to criticise the law promulgated as unconstitutional and against public interest and invite people to come forward

for discussion and the same is protected by Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution.

While invoking Section 144, the Magistrate or any other officer should be conscious of the fundamental right of a citizen under Article 19(1) of the Constitution. The Magistrate has to rarely invoke such a provision in a democratic society which always takes into its fold healthy dissent. It cannot be invoked arbitrarily only with an intention to prevent a peaceful demonstration. If so, the same constitutes abuse of power. Therefore, the State police machinery henceforth has to be conscious of the aforesaid law laid down and should not indiscriminately invoke Section 144 to prevent a legitimate peaceful protest.

12,16-1-20,Involve the consumers too,"Businesses incorporating customers into the circularity story can leverage the brand value of their products to influence buyers

Fiscal growth occurs due to the two economic activities of production and consumption. So far, the circular economy has largely concentrated on the production aspect, by redesigning processes so that they become restorative and regenerative. This is in view of the increasing depletion of our natural resources and the detrimental impact on social ecosystems. There have been wins in terms of introducing circular business models that go beyond recycling, which use minimal resources along the value-chain, maximise their time in circulation and recover and reuse the product’s elements after its end-of-life. Europe has been the hotbed for such production innovations. Norway’s Tomra introducing a plastic recycling machine and the UK’s Jaguar using recycled aluminium for their vehicles, are just two examples of this. However, economic growth is as much about consumers as it is about producers, especially in densely populated emerging markets, which are now the epicentre of opportunities for global producers. Thus, the applicability of the circular economy to consumers can be no exception. They are the very agents through whom the components of circularity are often achieved. Thus, it is necessary now to look at the consumers’ perspective also, i.e. the ways in which their behaviour and demand can be moulded to create a faster migration towards circular economy products.

One requirement is the ability of the producers to understand and incorporate the customers’ product-related behaviour and expectations into the redesigned (circular) product and value-chain. This would require continuous dialogue, user-testing and iterations during production planning. The successful convergence of the product’s circular features with the customer’s requirements would aid long-term consumer loyalty. Several customers, especially millennials who comprise the lion’s share of the base in emerging economies, are becoming increasingly aware of sustainability and climate change. They seem willing to change their buying habits and preferences, even if it means paying a higher price. But there is still a large section that remains unaware. This situation has twin implications for businesses attempting to involve consumers in the circular model. One, they need to incorporate the customer’s expectations and preferences into their redesigned product, thus going back to the point mentioned previously.

Second, it implies a need for education and awareness-building to mould the preferences of those hitherto unaware or unappreciative of circularity, towards such products. The objective is to create a buzz about all the pieces of the circular model, like reduce, reuse, recycle and repair. That would speed up the migration towards redesigned products, which would not only help businesses win market share but would also help reduce the price-point of such redesigned products for middle-class consumers. This will democratise its demand through better affordability. At the same time, the producers’ attitude towards a circular economy would depend on the arithmetic, i.e. the cost of incorporating circularity vs. its benefits and impact on short-term profitability. This is despite the fact that some circular economy products can have exponential value in the long-term, if one incorporates the value created by all the peripheral activities like repair, maintenance and reuse. Till this arithmetic is in the red, the long-term sustainability of our natural and social ecosystems would remain at risk. As a result, consumer education and awareness that creates a faster migration towards the circular economy would result in higher projections in terms of the business volumes, which would augur well both for those ecosystems and the longevity of the business. Lastly, influencing consumer behaviour towards circular products would also require stricter policies and enforcement of product labelling. It should not offer loopholes to producers to influence consumer behaviour through inaccurate or misleading labelling. That would create a negative perception, stalling client migration. Businesses incorporating consumers into the circularity story can leverage the existing brand value of their products to influence customer behaviour. For instance, some products are deemed aspirational, thus many buyers are willing to pay a premium. But the consumers who are unable to pay that premium, may otherwise be willing to pay a lower price for the reused or repaired version of it, just to enjoy the brand’s aspirational quotient. Take the case of luxury cars for instance. Thus, products that enjoy immense brand value and aspiration can create that initial trigger for influencing the consumers to start thinking about circular economy and products. As demand unfolds it could influence further migration towards a broader suite of products.

In the end, the circular economy offers significant headroom for growth, both from the core product and from peripheral pieces in the value chain. For instance, repair and maintenance may become a major job-driver since circularity is all about keeping the products in circulation longer. But involving the consumers in the circular economy flow would be as instrumental as the producers to realise that growth.

13,16-1-20,Quantify the effect on each person,"A dynamic per capita impact index can help nations narrow down on particular areas where human beings are suffering the most due to climate change, the major perpetrators of it and those who are being able to adapt to it

The impact of climate change is usually seen in relation to the adverse cumulative consequences witnessed around the world in the form of rising temperatures, extreme weather events and spiralling green house gas emissions. But seldom are the consequences of climate change whittled down to the individual level to understand the specific impact it has on the quality, prosperity and health of the individual. A dynamic per capita climate change impact index can help nations narrow down on particular areas where human beings are suffering the most due to climate change. This analysis can be taken to more interesting levels when one can dissect the per capita impact of climate change on the basis of demographics such as gender, occupation, geographical location and so on.

The assessment of the cost of climate change is always generalised. However, given the scale climate change is reaching in these times it is becoming crucial to quantify the same and understand how each individual in the country is dealing with the effects of climate change. In simple terms, how many are adapting to it and more importantly how many are succumbing to it.

Another important aspect is to also find out who are the highest per capita generators of climate change in the form of nations, who are generating the maximum per capita green house gas emissions.

A well-researched study on these dimensions will yield irrefutable evidence that some people in this world are paying the price for the high levels of carbon emissions being generated by somebody else.

In fact, given that not all people in the world are equally responsible for climate change, some sections of environmental scientists are already terming this as a climate related inequality. This new aspect needs more research and studies so that the exact responsibility is fixed on the nations and people who emit more carbon per person but preach to others about how to achieve a cleaner environment. Global environmental events such as the COP25 must focus on subjects of climate-related inequality in order to provide some much-needed relief and concessions to those individuals across the world who are suffering the most due to climate change and are doing the least to precipitate it. This will help in providing some much-needed achievement for the event.

For a nation like India, the utility of a per capita impact of climate change index for the population will have immeasurable benefits. The wide spectrum of people with various levels of economic class structure continue to suffer due to a plethora of problems, some man-made and some caused by climate change. The index can help in identifying and segregating those issues and problems that have been caused due to environmental degradation and climate change.

This is crucial, because it is only when the problem and its source is identified that it can be solved. Such an index must dwell upon a wide angle of costs being paid by an individual and a family. This could be social costs, health related issues or financial costs. Based on the index, the Government can then announce more meaningful policies and schemes that can alleviate the problems of the affected people.

The Government can then provide them relief and rehabilitation against the effects of climate change. This would possibly be the first of its kind initiative in the world where a Government provided relief and aid to an individual who suffered due to carbon emissions and lost his health or livelihood and became economically-challenged.

The rehabilitation of climate change-affected people is a very important aspect of adaptation. Though fighting for reduction of green house gas emissions, carbon footprint and encouraging sustainable energy development are critical for climate change mitigation, all these measures do little for those who have already fallen victim to the devastating effects of global warming and environmental degradation. This negates the humanitarian approach, which mandates that as humans we must first care for the fallen who were unable to escape the harmful impacts of climate change and lost everything. This approach will bring back humanity into the fight against climate change.

India — given its tropical location and not being part of the usual set of nations having a traditionally high level of carbon emissions — is in an ideal position to set the ball rolling and start an exhaustive research-backed national index on the per capita impact of climate change. This can encourage other nations in the southern hemisphere to follow suit. Before long, the world will have a clear demarcation between the emitters of green house gases and those who are paying the price for it. This will alter the symmetry in inter-nation climate change-related discussions and give developing nations a much-needed moral high ground to put forth their case convincingly.

The court further said that if Vedanta’s bid is accepted, the company can use the raw material at its Jharsuguda plant after taking it from the Visakhapatnam Port.

It may be pointed out that the Nalco had challenged an order of the Orissa High Court last year allowing the Vedanta to take part in tenders for sale of the former company’s surplus alumina.

Notably, the Vedanta Ltd has an alumina refinery at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district and a smelter plant at Jharsuguda. But the company lacks adequate bauxite supplies as tribals of the Niyamgiri Hills in Kalahandi and Rayagada districts stopped its bid to extract the mineral in the hills.

31,16-1-20,Maya: BJP toeing Cong line to suppress people’s voice ... spares SP from criticism,"Maintaining a silence over Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of toeing the political line of the Congress to suppress the people’s voice.

She said the anti-people stand taken by the government had brought the country in the headlines for negative reasons.

“Congress and BJP are two sides of a coin and now the act of the BJP too proves that they are also adopting wrong policies which are affecting the 130 crore people of the country,” the BSP chief said.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday on her 64th birthday which was celebrated as ‘Jan Kalyan Divas’ by the BSP, Mayawati said people of the country had punished the Congress after which BJP came to power. “Now the BJP seems to have adopted the policies of the Congress, leading to increase in the miseries of the people due to poverty, unemployment, inflation and anti-constitutional steps which will force the masses to show them the door,” she said.

“The protests against CAA/NRC in the country have given wrong and negative message to the world about a peaceful country like India,” she claimed.

On the occasion, Mayawati also released the 15th edition of her penned book “A travelogue of my struggle-ridden life and BSP movement’.

Mayawati focused her attack mostly on the Congress, saying that the party was trying to take mileage from the failures of the BJP but the people of the country were yet to forget the misrule of the grand old party.

“The BSP has never joined any Central government as it has never compromised with the anti-people ideology of the Congress and the BJP,” she said, adding that the BJP would survive only if it gave jobs to the youths and shed its divisive ideology.

“The BJP has to push industrial growth, control prices of essential commodities and end poverty,” she said.

However, the BSP chief accused the present BJP government of promoting select industrialists and said that there was a conspiracy to end reservation by handing over the service sector to the private companies.

On the occasion, the BSP chief also alleged that the concern shown by the Congress over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens was totally fake and they ware falling in line with the BJP.

“Congress’ involvement in violent anti-CAA protests is not supported by BSP as we only go for peaceful opposition,” she said.

Asking the Narendra Modi government to withdraw the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act as it was unconstitutional and singled out a particular community, Mayawati claimed that her party had opposed the bill tooth and nail in Parliament and outside.

The BSP president asked the government to clarify why it had excluded Muslims in the CAA when the Constitution gives equal rights to all.

“Why single out Muslims from the CAA. Everyone knows how the Muslims, who had shifted from India after partition, are facing atrocities in Pakistan. Should they not be allowed to come back to India like other people,” she questioned.

The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was also critical of the police commissionerate system introduced in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), saying it was “just a drama of the BJP government”.

“Law and order in the state is deteriorating day by day and jungle raj prevails. This new system is nothing but an eyelash as law and order cannot be controlled unless there is political will power,” she said, alleging that most of the criminals were linked with the ruling party.

“You all have seen my government when MP, legislators and officials were not spared if they were found involved in crime,” she told the reporters.

During her press meet, the BSP chief did not utter a single word against the SP and her attack mostly centred on Congress and BJP.

When questioned, Mayawati said she was only talking about national parties so she was silent on SP.

She also did not gave any specific reply when asked about her party’s future strategy and whether she would go for an alliance with any party in the New Delhi assembly elections.

Later in the noon, Mayawati left for New Delhi where she was to celebrate her birthday. Meanwhile, reports of the BSP chief’s birthday celebrations were pouring in from all over the state with leaders cutting cake and distributing sweets and fruits among the poor and needy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maya--bjp-toeing-cong-line--to-suppress-people---s-voice------spares-sp-from-criticism.html
32,16-1-20,Right to equality is bigger than right to religious practices,"By the time the Supreme Court was beginning to decide the fate of Triple Talaq in 2017, as many as 19 Muslim-majority countries including typical Islamic states of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan had banned the discriminatory practice in their countries. Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen had trashed the inhuman, male-chauvinistic divorce practice quite when modern times had set in. In the Southeast Asia too, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines had banned this anti-women practice since long. Point being driven here is that even hardcore Muslim countries are fair to women as they constitute half the mankind.

Women in India have always occupied high positions in family and society. Since ancient times until the mediaeval period, young women in aristocratic families chose their grooms from among aspirants in full public glare in a tradition called ‘Swayambar'. The commoner too enjoyed being parents to a grown girl as the suitors had to pay a fat fee to take a girl for bride. The practice is still prevalent in all the tribal communities of India like elsewhere in the world.

Vedanta and Upanishad pundits have invariably said Hinduism has flourished over centuries on logic rather than blind practices. ‘Sanatana Dharma', now called Hinduism, has been rated as one of the most human as well nature-friendly faiths for being unsuperstitious and fair to all in all its religious practices and prescriptions. Traditionally, Hindus engage in goddess-worshipping rituals when they need to gain power. Even in the most famous Jagannath Temple, food offerings assume sublime status only after the dishes are offered to Goddess Bimala.

Unfortunately, the women became weakest during the mediaeval age when the Brahmin hegemony led to subjugation of monarchs to the priestly class which had the last word in all critical matters of the state. Muslim invaders had settled down earlier in the 11th century with their glaring male-dominating traditions.The Indian priestly community perhaps had been influenced by Muslims. The British came later with their male-chauvinistic lifestyle; and the Indian priestly fraternity may have been further inspired to put women-domestication practices in place. Even in the West, after successful industrialisation, women were treated as second class. They were deprived of voting rights and pursuing higher education.

The Sabarimala matter is specific to equal rights of women. It was once for all settled by the Supreme Court in 2018. As is customary, several review petitions were filed. The apex court, strangely, at the outset, said the five-judge Bench was inadequate to decide the enormously-sensitive matter and ruled that a nine-judge Bench would review the verdict.

“Hinduism is based on logic; Sabarimala shrine must allow entry of women” emphasises Swami Bhoomananda Theertha, a Sannyasi and a social reformer. He is known for his talks and discourses on Vedanta, Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads and Srimad Bhagavatam, and their practical application in daily life.

The whole of the Hindu world is famous for the Shakti cult, which places the female entity above the male for the simplest reason of we being stronger in all human attributes, the best example of which is bearing, delivering and rearing children. Nowhere in any of the ancient scriptures, including the Bhagwat Gita, Vedas or Upanishads, is it mentioned that women and men are not equal. Now, women are excelling in all hitherto male domains like fighting as soldiers and flying planes with the same expertise as men.

The Kamakshya temple near Guwahati is one of the principal Shakti shrines where the genital of Goddess Sati had fallen the same way as the naval did to become Goddess Biraja at Jaipur in Odisha. Interestingly, the genital-shrine does not forbid men to visit the temple. But Lord Ayappa at Sabarimala, a god symbolising an absolutely celibate status, projected as a deity dreadful of women in the sexually-active age. Gods and goddesses behaving fallibly like errant human creatures is the strangest phenomenon in any religion.

When the pro-woman verdict came, there was a great deal of hue and cry by fundamentalist Hindus, who kept screaming that Muslim groups conspired to get this court order. The Sabarimala shrine is open to all devotees, no matter what faith. People may not know that in 2006, a group of five women lawyers, Bhakti Pasrija, Prerna Kumari, Laxmi Shastri, Sudha Pal and Alka Sharmhad, filed the petition demanding women of all age groups be allowed to enter the Sabarimala temple.

Now, the Supreme Court seems to be keen on deciding which Constitutional provision between ‘Right to Equality' and Freedom of Religion' is more primary and non-negotiable as both are Fundamental Rights. These rights appear to be competing for precedence in view of controversies surrounding entry of women at certain places of worship including fire temples of Parsis and mosques as well as the issue of genital mutilation among Bohra Muslims. Hence, the hearing has commenced like in a fast-track court after putting away other urgent matters like review of scrapping of Article 370 and CAA.

The Chief Justice of India set up the nine-judge Bench instead of a seven-judge one set up by the previous CJI obviously because at the back of his mind, there seems to be a ‘clash' between fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 15 and religious rights under Articles 25 and 26, more so Article 26.

However, in recent times, the courts seem to have given the right to equality more weight. In 2016, a Bombay High Court Bench opened the sanctum sanctorum of the Haji Ali Dargah to women, prohibited until then on the ground of religious freedom under Article 26. The court held that rights under Articles 14 and 15 were superior. In 2017, the Supreme Court declared Triple Talaq as unconstitutional. The argument that Muslim personal law enjoyed protection of the rights to religious freedom did not hold against the right to gender equality.

Though religions have given birth to ethics which developed into rules over time eventually to be part of the constitution of respective countries, religious freedom is only basic in historical context, never in the principle of equality.

Many cases similar to the Sabarimala issue are pending before the Supreme Court. Genital mutilation of women belonging to the Bohra Muslim community, entry of Muslim women into mosques for prayer and similar unfettered access to women into the fire temples of Parsis are a few which are equally sensitive and critical in a secular democracy with freedom for religious practices.

Hopefully, the apex court will have the right to equality established in a manner as shall never be challenged ever again when weird religious practices without scriptural endorsement or any acceptable logic come up in conflict with the non-negotiable right to equality before law.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/right-to-equality-is-bigger-than-right-to-religious-practices.html
33,16-1-20,Will BSP support Indian citizenship to infiltrators?: Shrikant,"The Uttar Pradesh government has dared Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati to announce that her party will support infiltrators to get Indian citizenship and also criticised her for equating BJP with Congress, saying her party had supported the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.

“Does Mayawati oppose citizenship to Hindu and other refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan? She should also clarify whether she wants infiltrators to be Indian citizen,” UP government spokesperson and state Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma said in a written statement here on Wednesday.

The statement was in response to Mayawati’s statement on her 64th birthday in which she asked the Centre why Muslims of Pakistan facing atrocities were not covered in the recently passed Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“The BSP chief’s statement clearly shows that she is trying to take political mileage in the name of infiltrators,” he said.

Sharma also slammed Mayawati for equating BJP with Congress by calling them “two sides of the same coin”.

“Mayawati has no right to say this because she had extended support to the UPA from outside for 10 years and now she was trying to confuse people by criticising the Congress. During its 10-year regime, the UPA looted the country and the BSP did the same in UP,” he said.

Sharma said the basic difference between the BJP and the Congress was the Narendra Modi government cared for the poor while the Congress’ policies are anti-people.

However the BJP leader wished Mayawati on her birthday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-bsp-support--indian-citizenship-to--infiltrators---shrikant.html

50,16-1-20,Punjab Opposition SAD and AAP mount attack on Govt over power tariff hike,"Punjab opposition parties on Wednesday upped the ante against the government over the hike in electricity tariffs with the AAP demanding the ""scrapping"" of power purchase agreements while the SAD sought a CBI probe into it.

Power tariffs in Punjab were increased by 36 paise a unit from January 1 for domestic consumers on account of coal-washing charges.

A delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party led by Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema met Speaker Rana KP Singh, urging him to allow them move a private member''s bill against the hike during the two-day assembly session starting January 16.

They claimed that the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous SAD-BJP government led to the hike in tariffs.

The delegation submitted a call attention motion to the speaker, seeking the termination of the PPAs.Sunam MLA Aman Arora accused the Congress-led regime of having failed to ""scrap"" the PPAs with private power plants despite promising it before 2017 assembly polls.

""Until anti-people agreements are not tweaked, people would continue to face high power tariffs,"" he said.

""Due to these agreements, the state would have to cough up a whopping Rs 70,000 crore even if private thermal plants do not produce a single unit of power,"" claimed Arora.

Meanwhile, leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal met Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore, urging him to direct the Congress-led state government to recommend a CBI probe into the alleged Rs 4,100 crore ""scam"".SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that the state suffered a loss of Rs 4,100 crore due to ""willful connivance and large-scale corruption"" by Congress leaders, ministers, higher officials and private power companies.

Sukhbir alleged that the state had ""deliberately lost"" important cases in the court after ""hefty amounts were taken by certain persons from private companies"".He said this was achieved by concealing important information from the courts and misrepresenting facts to benefit private players.

Earlier, the SAD had accused the state government of not pursuing the case against the release of coal-washing charges to private plants appropriately in the Supreme Court and had asserted that it was during their regime that Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Corporation and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity had ruled in the favour of state-owned power utility.Through coal washing, impurities like ash, soil and rock are removed from coal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-opposition-sad-and-aap-mount-attack-on-govt-over-power-tariff-hike.html

52,16-1-20,Home department is toothless without CID: Vij,"With ministerial control on Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Haryana triggering a row, Home Minister Anil Vij on Wednesday said that CID is very important and without it, the Home Department is like a wing without having its eyes and ears.

""As of now according to the existing rules, CID is still with the Home Department"", said Vij, adding that ""Chief Minister is supreme and can take away or divide any department"".

A controversy erupted a few weeks ago when some official websites of the State showed CM Manohar Lal Khattar as the minister in charge of the CID.

The Home Minister reacted sharply to this. Vij said that a mere mention on a website cannot divest him of the CID charge and a process has to be followed for reallocating any department to a minister.

The Government later removed the websites’ content showing the CID among the Chief Minister’s portfolios.

The Chief Minister had sought to play down the row over who was in charge of the CID.

A retired Bureaucrat from Panchkula opined that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is an intelligence arm of the State police.

It deals in collection of political and criminal intelligence. Moreover, the Haryana Police Act says that the State police shall have a State intelligence wing for collection, collation, analysis and dissemination of intelligence. The CID, as per the Act, also has a separate State Crime Investigation Wing.

CID as per the Business of the Haryana government (Allocation) Rules-1974 is incorporated as a part of the Home Department.

The functions of security, intelligence including espionage and counter espionage which the State CID also looks after are also under the control of the Home Department.

The business allocation rules only specify home, jails and administration of justice as three separate departments.

Sources said that Chief Minister’s office (CMO) is working on creating new department of CID by separating it from the Home Department.

A draft is being prepared, which can be passed in the Haryana Cabinet meeting and presented in the Legislative Assembly. The CID will be legally separated from the Home Department under this draft. If this happens, the CID will remain with the Chief Minister and it will have nothing to do with the Home Department.

Asked if grounds were being prepared to take away the CID from him, Vij had recently said, “The Chief Minister is supreme. If he wants to divide a department, he can do that. If he wants to take away a department, he can do that. I never raised any objection to this.”Reacting on this issue, the Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had recently said the CID remained under the Chief Minister’s charge during Bansi Lal and Devi Lal governments.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/home-department-is-toothless-without-cid--vij.html

55,16-1-20,Mugger population rises in Ghodahada dam,"The number of muggers, an endangered crocodile species, in Ghodahada irrigation reservoir and adjoining waterbodies in Ganjam district has increased, much to the delight of wildlife activists and officials.

The number of the crocodile species in and around the reservoir was counted at 65 in a three-day-long census that ended on Saturday, a senior forest official said.

While 44 muggers were found in the 5 sq km reservoir, 21 were counted in the nearby water bodies, said Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Brahmapur, Amlan Nayak. Last year, the population of muggers in the area was at 58, which included 43 in the Ghodahada reservoir.

The population of the muggers had remained stagnant in 2017 and 2016, while their number was 49 in 2015, official sources said.

The census was conducted with the participation of around 50 persons who were divided into 20 teams. Improvement in their habitat was stated to be the cause of the increase in the population, said the officer.

Singh further said the Act was modified in 2019 through amendment which was discussed by the Congress and other opposition parties, giving support to make it more effective and passed in the parliament.

BJP leader asked, “why such a delirium. It is showcasing the double political character.” The Congress-led state government since coming to power has been continuously attacking the federal structure of the country.

He said earlier Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was banned in the state, then on issues like Motor Vehicles Act, CAA and NPR the state has been indulging in direct confrontation with the central government, which shows political immaturity and disrespect.

86,16-1-20,UT Admin hikes bus fare,"Passengers travelling in the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) buses will have to shell out more as the UT Administration has increased the fare of both AC and non-AC buses.

The new charges are applicable on both local and long-route CTU buses and will come into effect from January 16, 2020.

The fares of the CTU non-AC local buses, which are divided into three slabs, were earlier fixed at Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20. While the first slab (upto 5 kms) has been kept same, the second (5 to 10 km) and third (above 10 km) slab rates have been increased by Rs 5 each. Similarly, in the AC local buses, the first slab of Rs 15 has been kept the same. But, in second slab, the fare has been increased from Rs 20 to Rs 25 and in third slab of above 10 km, from Rs 25 to Rs 30.

Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had last week given approval to the increase in bus fare to neutralise the impact of imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on tickets. GST was imposed on bus fares in 2016.

89,16-1-20,"Road Safety Week: ‘No Helmet, No Petrol' campaign in Jamshedpur","As a part of Road Safety Week, the petroleum outlets in steel city for the third consecutive day refused fuel to helmetless riders. There were many two-wheeler riders who were refused the fuel at the petroleum outlets in Bistupur and other places in the city.

The police have made mandatory for petrol pumps not to sell petrol to two-wheeler riders without helmets and drunken four-wheeler drivers. But people of Jamshedpur especially youngsters are not happy with the decision of police to enforce 'no helmet, no petrol' policy. According to them, police never enforced traffic rules strictly but now they are passing the onus on petrol pump owners. The officials recently said that petrol pump owners have been told not to sell fuel to two-wheeler riders without helmet and drunken four-wheeler drivers.

Meanwhile, the district administration flagged off a motorcycle rally as a part of the ongoing Road Safety Week celebrations. Deputy Commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla and other officials flagged off the rally which moved through the city streets to spread awareness among the people regarding road safety.

The DC said the purpose of road safety week celebration is to make people aware of their duties on road.

He said road mishaps could be prevented only by following traffic rules. He appealed to drivers to use helmet and seat belt without fail.

A local resident said that police failed to perform their responsibility so they are thinking to enforce such rules and put the onus on petrol pump owners. She said that it's the duty of traffic police to check people, who are drunk or without helmet.

The rule should be implemented for those people who consumed liquor while driving not for the one who are without helmet.

Kalpna Das, a student, said that implementing such rule will create a lot of problems for the people who are in emergency. ""Such policy has exposed failure of the police to perform their duty. It is not the duty of petrol pump owners to solve traffic problems.

Public will only follow the rules if police itself will follow them properly,"" he added. Another local resident Ravindra Bisht said that implementing such rule will create chaos on petrol pump premises.

""It is the duty of police to punish people who are violating traffic rules not the duty of petrol pump owners. When police will start doing their job properly people will definitely support them in every situation,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/road-safety-week-----no-helmet--no-petrol--campaign-in-jamshedpur.html

91,16-1-20,AJSU Party MLAs to stay in Opposition,"AJSU Party has decided to sit in the Opposition and mount pressure on the Government to address ground issues affecting the rural masses of Jharkhand, party spokesperson Deosharan Bhagat said on Wednesday, adding that his party will be on its own in the Jharkhand Assembly and not unite with any other bigger party.

“Uniting with other parties is not an option. JVM (Jharkhand Vikas Morcha) may merge with the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), but it is not in our nature to merge with a stronger force in the Assembly after contesting elections against it,” Bhagat said.

The AJSU Party – an old ally of the BJP and partner in almost all the Governments formed in the State till date – went to polls on its own in Jharkhand last year.

While it fielded candidates in at least 52 Assembly constituencies, the party managed to win only two seats – Silli and Gomia. However, the party Chief Sudesh Mahto managed to pull off a win in Silli after a series of losses since 2009.

In 2014, the party contested the elections as an ally of BJP and it was because of AJSU Party’s six MLAs that BJP managed to form a Government here.

However, over the years, the party’s senior leadership has had its share of differences with the policies and decisions of BJP.

Mahto openly criticised the BJP’s efforts to make changes to the tenancy laws in Jharkhand despite his MLAs being a part of the treasury bench dominated by BJP leaders.

Another regional party that contested elections in all the 81 constituencies and managed to win only three seats – former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi-led JVM-P – is in the news for its possibility of joining the BJP.

While AJSU Party has always been a BJP ally, JVM-P has been among the staunchest critics of the BJP’s policies and decisions in the past five years or so.

“There is no comparison between JVM-P and AJSU Party. We have our own ideology and we will stick to our slogan of Abki Baar Gaon Ki Sarkar. Our priority will be rural development,” Bhagat said.

Sources said that the AJSU Party looked to find a new identity in the recently concluded elections in Jharkhand. The party, they added, has made inroads to many areas where it did not have a support base in the past.

In a meeting of leaders held soon after the elections, it was decided that the party will stick to its village-centric politics and prepare for the next elections.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ajsu-party-mlas-to-stay-in-opposition.html
92,16-1-20,Opp trying to destabilise Modi Govt: Poddar,"BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar on Wednesday said that there is nothing new or objectionable in the citizenship amendment act, but the defeated and dejected Opposition is trying to destabilise Modi Government and the country. Poddar was speaking at a function organised at FJCCI attended by intellectuals, entrepreneurs, businessmen. Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth also spoke on the occasion.

Seth claimed that Opposition is protesting Modi Government schemes and policies as the PM has successfully solved several problems pending for decades one after the other. As the Opposition does not have any issue against Modi Government, there is an attempt to disturb social fabric of country by spreading confusion over the citizenship law. He clarified that CAA is a law related to granting citizenship of India to minorities from three neighbouring countries and there is no question of snatching anyone citizenship.

Poddar said that through the CAA, the Modi Government is correcting the mistakes of Congress Governments. He said that if the Congress had not divided the country on the basis of religion at the time of Independence, there would have been no need to bring this bill.

“During the partition, there was an agreement between Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammad Liaquat Ali of Pakistan, which said that in both the Countries, minorities will be given protection, India seriously followed on this front giving protection to minorities while Pakistan never followed it,” added Poddar.

“The purpose of this bill is to give citizenship to such minorities who have been harassed from other countries. We are not taking away any of their rights from any Muslim. But if any Muslim of these three countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh) applies for citizenship on the basis of our law, then we will consider it,” added Poddar.

Poddar said that according to the 2016 report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are more than two lakh refugees in India. In 1947, the number of minorities in Pakistan was 23per cent and in 2011 it was reduced to 3.7per cent.

In 1947, the number of minorities in Bangladesh was 22per cent and in 2011 it came down to 7.8per cent. On the other hand, India had 84per cent Hindus in 1951 and in 2011 they came down to 79per cent whereas the number of majority there has increased in the rest of the countries. In 1951, the number of Muslims in India was 9.8 per cent and today the number of Muslims is 14.23 per cent.

The strange situation is that the Congress which always advocated giving citizenship in India to non-Muslim minorities tortured in neighboring countries, is today opposing CAA for vote bank politics.

In 2003, the Home Ministry committee of the Parliament recommended that religious minorities from neighboring countries be given asylum in India, and specifically excluded the Muslim community as majority in these countries.

The chairman of this committee was former President Dr. Pranab Mukherjee and members were - Kapil Sibal, Hansraj Bhardwaj, Motilal Vora, Ambika Soni, Lalu Prasad etc.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opp-trying-to-destabilise-modi-govt--poddar.html

However, in our initial investigation we have learnt that the reason of murder was outcome of illegal betting during recent India-Australia match. Even the parents of the deceased have alleged that there was some dispute over a bet between match played between India and Australia,” said the official.

“Yes a racket is involved in it as it helps to make easy money for both who operate and the other puts money on betting.

Apart from betting on a win, hundreds are likely to place their money on who wins the toss, fall of wickets, number of boundaries, runs of individual players. There are already a few enquiries about betting on scores and who will bowl the first over,” said a source.

The cricket betting net has raised its ugly head in the city and has posed a big challenge for police to crack down on the racket. Electronic and physical survelliance systems have been beefed up and existing links with various intelligence agencies have been put on alert.

“We have increased our vigilance. Those with history of involvement in such rackets have been identified. Policemen will keep a close tab activities and movements of these during matches,"" said another official. He went on to inform that markets that have a lot of bars,hotels, and restaurants, are under close scrutiny.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/youth-shot-dead-over-cricket-betting-dispute.html

Two persons — Manoj Shah and Pradeep — are accused of allegedly raping the girl and shoving off objects in her private parts on April 15, 2013.

Both the accused, currently in judicial custody, had fled after allegedly committing the crime, leaving the victim at Manoj's room believing her to be dead. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17, 2013.

Manoj and Pradeep were later arrested by Delhi police separately from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar respectively in 2013.

The court had framed charges of raping a minor, unnatural offence, kidnapping, attempt to murder, destruction of evidence and wrongful confinement with common intention under the IPC against the two accused. It had also framed charges of aggravated sexual assault under the POCSO Act which entails a maximum punishment of life term.

Charges of rape and unnatural offence were also slapped on the two accused by the court as these two sections were not invoked by the police in its charge sheet.

The police had said some foreign materials — three pieces of a candle and one hair oil bottle — were taken out from the body of the victim, which was also proved by doctors during recording of their statements in the court.

Comparing BJP and AAP model of education, he said that budget allocation on education in States like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab is reduced by 2, 3 and 4 per cent respectively. While in Delhi the budget allocation was increased by 10 per cent.

Quoting the data compiled by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation), he said three countries have allocated highest budget towards education- Bhutan (24.04), Uzbekistan (23.03) and Malaysia (21.7 per cent). ""The AAP Government is the first to spend 26 per cent on education.

""The AAP Government has made a huge effort to raise the standards of the capital city India in the domains of finance, delivery and results. The basic principle driving this growth is the investment in education. We believe that investments made in the educational sector are of utmost importance for the future of the nation,"" he said.

Presenting two models of education, he said according to Department of Finance (Delhi Government), and RBI (Reserve Bank of India) study of state finances report 2019 in 2013-14; the quantum allocated to education in Delhi amounted to 16.6 per cent of the budget, whereas it has risen to 26 per cent of the total state budget. In the same period, in Haryana, only 15.4 per cent was allocated to education for the corresponding period and it was reduced to 13 per cent.

""In the case of Uttar Pradesh, the budget allocated has been slashed from 16 per cent to a mere 13.4 per cent In Punjab, the budget has been decreased from 14.2 per cent to 10.3 per cent,"" he said.

Sisodia said that these figures manifest BJP's mind-set and the youth of this country can no longer be swayed by the empty promises of the Government. This deliberate attempt by the BJP Government to reduce outlays for education is to ensure that our youth remains uneducated and powerless to aspire to a good future,"" he said.

He also challenged the BJP to participate in the upcoming Delhi elections based on providing quality education, thereby presenting their model for education. ""I heard recently that the Central Government faced a deficit in tax collection, following which; it was decided to reduce education budget.

132,16-1-20,"Besides mutual allegations, EVM one common issue in MP","Besides mutual allegations, Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is one common issue which has come up in Madhya Pradesh politics whenever there is any election around and same is the case ahead of urban local body polls due in the Central Indian State in near future.

While the urban bodies elections are scheduled in next few months, the ruling Congress now wants these polls to be carried out through ballot papers.

The Opposition BJP was also quick to slam the ruling party for demanding phase out of voting machines which were used in Assembly polls when Congress returned to power.

The reason behind raising the demand is that the local body polls recently held through ballot papers in neighbouring Chhattisgarh garnered sizable success.

Meanwhile it is not the first time EVMs have cropped up as bone of contention for the BJP and Congress in Madhya Pradesh as the Congress party was extremely critical of EVMs ahead of assembly polls in 2018 and also blamed the EVMs for massive defeats of its candidates in Lok Sabha polls where the party ended up winning a lone seat out of 29 seats. Several losing candidates of the Congress party had moved the High Court pointing fingers at EVMs over possible tampering.

In this regard, a delegation of Congress party led by organisational vice president Chandra Prabhash Shekhar, had called on the State Election Commissioner BP Singh in Bhopal on Tuesday conveying a demand for forthcoming polls through paper ballots.

Later, talking to media persons, Shekhar told that though the last local body polls were held through EVMs but the experience of these machines used in assembly and parliamentary polls was not satisfactory so the Congress workers and leaders across the state are of the view that ballot papers should be used for upcoming polls.

For obvious reasons, the opposition BJP has hit back at Congress party over the demand.

“A government elected through EVMs should first resign and then should seek local body polls through paper ballots,” BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/besides-mutual-allegations--evm-one-common-issue-in-mp.html

134,16-1-20,No parking charge for pick-and-drop vehicles at airport,"Pick-and-drop vehicles will be freed from parking charges at the Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi soon, Airport Director Vinod Sharma said on Wednesday, adding that the decision was officially announced at the meeting of the Airport Advisory Committee (AAC) recently.

However, Sharma added that the vehicles will have to drop or pick passengers and leave within a stipulated period of time in order to avoid parking charges. “We do not wish to charge any money from the pick-and-drop vehicles, but we have to fix a maximum time for which the vehicles can stay on the airport premises without paying for parking as no upper limit on the free-parking-period will cause overcrowding of vehicles,” Sharma said.

The vehicles, he added, will be given three to four minutes for dropping or picking up passengers, so the free-parking period will be around five minutes. On Tuesday, an AAC meeting was presided over by Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and attended by Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar, who has been an active member of the committee. Hatia legislator Navin Jaiswal also attended the meeting.

Besides taking the decision of relieving pick-and-drop vehicles from parking charges, the AAC also decided to use funds from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) treasury of the airport to rehabilitate the villagers who had lost land due to construction and expansion of the airport and beautify the villages surrounding the airport.

Poddar highlighted loopholes in the parking arrangements at the Ranchi airport and said that the airport needs to fix all the anomalies in the system in order to leave a good impression on visitors. “The visitors coming from other cities and countries get the first impression of the city by seeing the arrangements at the airport. Any mismanagement at the airport leaves a bad impression,” said Poddar.

The Birsa Munda Airport is fast growing in terms of connectivity with other cities. The largest airport in Jharkhand already has 30 flights connecting Ranchi to important cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The airport also has an international bay, but is yet to get any international flights. The increasing passenger traffic in Ranchi demands for better facilities and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) is consistently working on finding new ways to enhance the travel experience of passengers, said airport officials.

Meanwhile, the airport authorities here have also floated tenders for restaurants and bar in the airport premises.

As the feisty bulls, one after the other started racing towards the lengthy sporting arena from the entrance, known as 'vadivasal,' young men waiting with bated breath strained every nerve to latch on to the hump of the animals.

Interestingly, as many as 397 bulls of the total 641 that entered the arena could not be dominated by tamers and these animals emerged successful, an official told PTI.

""Don't touch the horns,"" ""many men don't chase one animal,"" ""allow the bull to go; it has won,"" were among the instructions that reverberated in the arena for participants.

The Jallikattu at Avaniapuram held here today marks the start of the once a year bull taming sport in many rural and semi-urban regions of Tamil Nadu.

Similar events will be held at Palamedu tomorrow and in Alanganallur on January 17 and these are among the hugely popular bull taming contests in the state.

If the participant hangs on to the hump of the bull for a determined distance, he is declared a winner and if not, the animal emerges the victor.

In each of the nine rounds, about 60 to 70 participants with colour coded T-shirts and shorts took part.

Festivity marked the event and scores of spectators from the gallery craned their necks to have a glimpse of determined men trying to get the better of the animals in a matter of seconds as soon as they were released into the arena.

A huge number of spectators, including many foreign tourists with cameras, were glued to the event.

Keenly watching the game, organisers quickly declared -over the public address system- if the animal or the man was the winner and the prize.

The sporting arena was barricaded from the enclosures marked for spectators.

The official said medical examination of both the men and animals decided their participation.

He said 62 men were injured, including 34 participants and 28 spectators, of whom eight were referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital.

However, no bull was injured, he added.

Out of the total of 730 bull tamers who were issued tokens, five were rejected for consumption of alcohol and only 607 participated in the event.

""As regards bulls, due to paucity of time only 641 could take part"" and 118 could not. Eight animals were disallowed for reasons like restlessness, the official said.

Elaborate security arrangements were made and access to medical facilities were made readily available. The event was held under the supervision of a panel, led by a retired judge.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---jallikattu--kicks-off-amid-fanfare-in-tn.html

Mayawati at a press conference on her 64th birthday accused the BJP and the Congress of playing “dirty politics” and alleged that the BJP-led central Government follows the pattern of the previous Congress dispensation, which was punished for its wrongdoing.

Terming both parties “two sides of the same coin”, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief said the Congress does not have the moral right to criticise the BJP.

“You (Mayawati) had extended support to the Manmohan Singh Government for 10 years. In the State, you had taken the support of the Congress,” BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Minister Shrikant Sharma said.

The basic difference between the BJP and the Congress is that “our Government bothers about pro-poor welfare schemes reaching the poor. The Government of which you had been a part...Instead of reaching the poor, reached the homes of those in power, especially the Congress, through the back door”, he said.

Mayawati told reporters that under the current regime, poverty, unemployment, anarchy, violence and tension have exceeded that during the tenure of the Congress at the

Centre.

She also alleged that the amendments to the citizenship law were brought without taking others into confidence.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bsp-had-supported-cong-at-centre--bjp-on-mayawati-s----two-sides-of-same-coin--remark.html

Shiv Sena",": The Shiv Sena on Wednesday questionned its former ally BJP's ""separate yardsticks"" of ""freedom of expression"" on the JNU violence and the controversial book comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

In an editorial in the party's Marathi mouthpiece ""Saamana"", the ruling party demanded that Union Home Ministry issue orders to file cases against those who make derogatory comments on Hindutva ideologue VD Savarkar, and demanded Bharat Ratna for him.

The book ""Aaj Ke Shivaji, Narendra Modi"", written by Delhi BJP leader Jay Bhagwan Goyal, has triggered a political storm in Maharashtra, where the 17th Century founder of the Maratha empire is a reverred historical figure.

After the January 5 attack on JNU students, the Sena had said that what Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah wanted was happening.

The Sena, which has demanded that the book be banned, wondered why the BJP has not yet expelled Goyal from the party.

146,16-1-20,C’garh Govt moves SC challenging NIA Act 2008,"Chhattisgarh Government on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court demanding that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act 2008 should be declared unconstitutional.

The State Government has filed an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution, which provides for the state to move directly to the Supreme Court in matters of dispute against the Centre.

According to Chhattisgarh Advocate General Satish Chandra Verma the Indian constitution clearly says that policing is a matter of state government.

However, the NIA Act empowers NIA to interfere with police investigation in the state. This makes the act unconstitutional, Verma claims

“The question is that the central government has made a ‘police system’ through the NIA Act. Do we need a centrally empowered agency for the offenses committed in the local area (eight categories of crimes have been kept in it). And does the constitution allow this? We believe that the Central Government cannot do this under the constitution, because the constitution says that police is a state subject,” Verma said.

As per the Advocate General, the Act empowers Central Government to launch any investigation as per their wishes and also abandon it without any explanation.

“No act and law can be made outside the provision of the constitution and if it has happened then such act should be abolished as being unconstitutional,” Verma added.

He also claimed that Chhattisgarh is the first state to move against the NIA Act 2008.

Notably, in November 2019 Chhattisgarh high court had dismissed a writ appeal filed by the State Government that challenged the order of a court which had directed that the investigation into killing of BJP MLA Bima Mandavi should be done by the NIA.

It may be also mentioned that the NIA Act was introduced by the Congress-led UPA Government following the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/c---garh-govt-moves-sc-challenging-nia-act-2008.html

Around 40 lakh people have congregated here for the pilgrimage, “breaking all previous records”, a senior state government official said.

“Till noon, more than 31 lakh people have taken dips in the holy waters. The final count could even exceed this figure,” he said. Every year on Makar Sankranti, lakhs of Hindus flock to the Sagar Island in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district to take the holy dip and offer prayers at the Kapil Muni temple.

“Last year, we had a record number of 20 lakh pilgrims visiting the island.

This year, that record has been broken. It was peaceful and the pilgrims have also appreciated our arrangements,” the official said.

Security has been beefed up in the island, around 100 km from Kolkata, and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is monitoring the situation, officials said.

Besides deploying senior officers, around 10,000 police personnel and civic volunteers have been posted for the gathering — the Ganga Sagar Mela.

Security officials are also keeping a watch on the waters and patrolling is being done, they said. Drones and around 1,000 CCTV cameras have been put to use, and several watch towers set up.

150,16-1-20,"Murasoli means DMK, Tuglaq intelligentsia: Rajni","Rajinikanth, the leading super star of Tamil moviedom, made his first political statement on Tuesday evening since he announced his intention to launch a political outfit on December 31, 2017.

Addressing the readers and staff of Tuglaq, Tamil’s leading socio-political magazine launched by late “Cho” Ramaswamy, Rajnikanth declared that Tuglaq was the magazine read by the intelligentsia in Tamil Nadu. “Those who read Murasoli (the mouthpiece of DMK of which late Karunanidhi was the editor) are known as DMK activists while the readers of Tuglaq are known as the intelligentsia,” said Rajinikanth while delivering the keynote address in the meeting held in connection with the 50th anniversary of the magazine.

The Tuglaq annual meeting is considered as the State’s most important cultural event and sets the political agenda of Tamil Nadu for the next year. Rajinikanth pointed out that even late Karunanidhi was an ardent reader of the magazine Tuglaq.

He also said that he would not make any political announcement or observation considering the solemnity of the occasion. M Venkiah Naidu, vice president was the chief guest and was present when Rajinikanth made the announcement.

It may be remembered that Rajinikanth was lampooned by Murasoli daily for his political dreams. The DMK mouthpiece had declared in an unsigned article in October 2018 that the party does not welcome Rajnikanth’s intention to launch a political outfit. But the DMK is yet to tell anything against the other super star Kamal Haasan who launched his political party Makkal Neethi Meiam.

Though Rajinikanth had not reacted to the article at that time, he chose the venue of Tuglaq to tell the people of the State that his respect and regards were with “Cho”, who has been his close friend for more than three decades. Cho Ramaswamy had told his readers many time in the past that Rajinikanth is the ideal person to be the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

S Gurumurthy, leading chartered accountant, who is the chief editor of Thuglaq since the passing away of Cho Ramaswamy, reiterated his stance that Rajnikanth’s entry into political arena would mark a tectonic shift in Tamil Nadu. “The situation is same as that of 1977 when Tamil Nadu was fed up with the kind of politics played by the DMK and its first family. It was at that juncture that MG Ramachandran entered the scene and politics was not the same afterwards.

Rajinikanth is the modern day MG Ramachandran and he can work wonders in the State,” said Gurumurthy.

Kolahala Srenivaas, political commentator, who was present during the meeting was of the view that with his speech on Tuesday, the die has been cast by Rajinikanth and the political spectrum is all set to become active in the coming days itself.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/murasoli-means-dmk--tuglaq-intelligentsia--rajni.html

And I will again say that we will shoot at them when we come to power if they don’t stop destroying national property.”

When reminded how the Left, Congress and the Trinamool Congress have openly criticized him for harbouring such “Nazi mindset,” Ghosh recalled how “scores of brilliant students belonging to naxalite groups were shot dead by the police during the Siddhartha Shankar Ray Government in 1970s… Often these naxal activists were first released from jails and then shot dead from behind as they walked back to freedom… Was it a legal act?”

He then asked “how about the communists shooting dead 6 Forward Bloc members and eliminating the refugees in Marich Jhampi Islands?’ reminding as well how “Mamata Banerjee’s police shot dead 11 Gorkhas in Darjeeling Hills.”

If those acts were legal then “how my suggestion of shooting like dogs the anti-national elements — who destroy and torch public properties as they did by setting trains afire while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act— become illegal,” he added saying, “while the Assam and Uttar Pradesh Governments exhibited the right intent by shooting anti-nationals the Trinamool Congress not even filed an FIR or arrest anyone, or charged lathis, let alone opening fire.

This was done with an eye on the vote-bank politics which they have been pursuing since their inception.”

Ghosh had on Sunday told a crowd at Nadia that when the BJP would come to power it would shoot anti-nationals dead like dogs as it did in Assam, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh kicking off a storm of criticism and leading his party colleague and Union Minister Babul Supriyo to disapprove of his statement as a “personal view.”

Ghosh’s reiteration of the same view on Sunday and sudden silence of Supriyo clearly indicated on whose side the BJP high command was, the TMC leadership said. “Without the permission of the top leadership they do not speak.

So you have to understand from where Dilip Ghosh is getting his strength to speak all that non-sense.” Meanwhile in a related development Ghosh on Sunday trained his guns at the Bengal civil society for making symnbolic statements: vowing not to show “documents” apparently for verification on CAA.

“In a video-graphed blank verse that went viral a host of Bengali cine stars have iterated that they “will not show our papers” come what may. Reacting to the poetic presentation of their views against CAA Ghosh said “these are Namak Harams (traitors) who are reluctant to show their papers. They are inciting people. But do they not have to show papers at the air port, do they not shot tickets in cinema halls or do you not have to present your ration cards at the ration shop? These are mostly communists who are anti-nationals by nature.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/those-criticising-have-opened-fire-on-protesters--dilip-ghosh.html
153,16-1-20,Politics without principles equivalent to sin: Raj Guv,"Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday said politics without principles, work without morality and life without character are equivalent to sins.

During an event related to the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of the Father of the Nation, Mishra said Mahatma Gandhi had a strong sense of Indianness and his philosophy was 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (whole world is one family).

“He was a brave man and non-violence was his principle. Politics without principles, work without morality, life without character and humanity without science are equivalent to sins,” Mishra said.

Gandhi’s grandson Rajmohan Gandhi while addressing the gathering said that Mahatma was fearless. He was a priest of non-violence.

He was always ready to go to jail and take a bullet. He said that he always spread friendship and worked to eliminate hatred.

Mishra also urged the people to perform their fundamental duties to play an active role in the development of the nation.

On this occasion, the Governor got about 1,000 children of 30 schools of the city to read the Preamble and Fundamental Duties of the Constitution.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/politics-without-principles-equivalent-to-sin--raj-guv.html
154,16-1-20,"Nitish refuses to comment on CAA, NRC controversy","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday refused to comment on the (Amendment) Act urging journalists not to ask him questions on the auspicious Makar Sankranti day on issues about which people may have different opinions that may lead to squabbles.

Kumar, who also heads the Janata Dal (United), made this comment with a broad smile playing on his lips and both his hands joined together in response to frantic queries from scribes at a feast organised to mark the Makar Sankranti festival.

""Do not rake up the issues on an auspicious day, about which people may have different opinions and expression which may lead to squabbles"", the Chief Minister said while he was treating himself to curd, flattened rice, jaggery and 'tilkut' (a sweetmeat made of sesame).

Requesting the journalists to enjoy the feast and write about the state-wide human chain scheduled on January 19 instead, he said, ""I urge you to take part in it as well"".

The Chief Minister was flanked by top leaders of the NDA and seated next to him was his deputy and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.

They were at the residence of state JD(U) president and Rajya Sabha member Vashishtha Narayan Singh, whose annual 'dahi-chura' feast has become a much-anticipated event since it had provided clues in the past few years about dissidents from other political groups willing to join the ruling party.

All eyes were, therefore, on RJD MLA Faraz Fatami when he arrived at Singh's residence.

Fatami said, ""I have come here upon invitation as a matter of courtesy and no political meaning should be attached to it."" On the CAA-NRC controversy, he said the Bihar Chief Minister has already made things very clear on the floor of the Assembly and after that there is no need for stretching things further.

Kumar on Monday had said a country-wide implementation of National Register of Citizens was ""needless"" and had ""no justification"".

Asked about RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav's Statewide tour against the contentious measures from Thursday, Fatami said, ""I think the honourable leader of the opposition should do a rethink"".

Fatami's father Mohd Ashraf Fatami, a former Union Minister, had snapped his ties with the RJD ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year when he took exception to Tejashwi Yadav ordering his suspension from the party after he filed his nomination papers from Madhubani after being denied ticket on his home turf of Darbhanga.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nitish-refuses-to-comment-on-caa--nrc-controversy.html
155,16-1-20,Interested in diplomacy but not in negotiating with US: Iran,"Iran on Wednesday said that it was interested in diplomacy but not in negotiating with the US and that the killing of its General Qasem Soleimani showed ignorance and arrogance of America. Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also pointed out how 430 cities in India witnessed protests against the killing.

Zarif met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor(NSA) Ajit Doval besides Russian Foreign Minister and apprised them of the situation in the Gulf region.

“PM reiterated India’s continued commitment to developing strong and friendly relations with Iran. He thanked Iranian leadership for the progress in Chabahar project, including through designating it as Special Economic Zone,” a PMO statement said.

“The Foreign Minister shared his perspectives on the recent developments in the region. The Prime Minister mentioned India’s strong interest in peace, security and stability in the region,” the PMO added.

In a related development, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar referred here to tensions between the US and Iran and said they are two individualistic countries and what finally happens will depend on the players involved. He made this observation while addressing the ongoing Raisina Dialogue. Ministers and diplomats from several countries including Iran and Russia are attending the meet on geo-politics.

Making his country’s position clear, Zarif said at the event “Iran is interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiating with the US. US did not keep its commitments under the nuclear deal. We had a US deal and US broke it. If we have a Trump deal, how long will it last?”

He also said “We need to create hope in the region. We have to get rid of despair,” adding Iran incurred hundreds of billions of dollars in damages because of current tensions.

Pointing out that Soleimani was the single biggest threat to ISIS and his killing was now being celebrated by the terror group and US President Donald Trump.

He also said India can play a role in de-escalating tensions in the Gulf region as New Delhi is an important player. India has so far maintained that it would like the situation to de-escalate as soon as possible and the country has been in touch with key players, including Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, as it has important interests in the region.

Signifying New Delhi’s growing influence in the region, the Iranian minister also met Doval and gave him a firsthand account of the situation prevailing in the Gulf region, sources said adding the overall security scenario figured prominently in the talks, they said.

The deliberations between them come amid the global focus on Iran and the US over the confrontation between the two countries following the killing of Soleimani. Meanwhile, Zarif also met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and the two leaders discussed the evolving situation in the Gulf. Jaishankar said India’s way is not to be disruptive and it is more of a decider than an abstainer. In remarks that come at a time several countries have called for a greater Indian role in the Indo-Pacific, the minister also said it is not the India way to be mercantilist.

Discussing ties with China, he said it is vital for neighbours to reach understanding on crucial issues. “Neither India nor China can get India-China relations wrong. Our relationship is unique. Each country has gone up in the world simultaneously. It is necessary that the two countries find equilibrium,” Jaishankar said. Stating that India is a “prisoner of its past image” and must get over it, the external affairs minister said “it is not the India way to be disruptive. It is not the India way to be mercantilist. It is the India way to be more of a decider and not an abstainer. I would pick on climate change. India owes it to itself and to the world to be a just power.”

On India pulling out of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), he said the onus was on countries which were part of it. “Where RCEP is concerned, we have to look at cost and benefit. We will evaluate RCEP on its economic and trade merit. We have not closed our mind to it,” Jaishankar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/interested-in-diplomacy-but-not-in-negotiating-with-us--iran.html

Mentioning his visit to Siachen last week, the Army Chief said he was extremely happy to see all the ranks brimming with confidence at the post. “In last few days, some of our soldiers achieved martyrdom due to avalanche. We will always remember their sacrifice,” he noted.

Dhanush and K-Vajra gun systems were showcased for the first time in the Army parade. Besides Naravane, IAF chief RKS Bhadauria, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat were present on the occasion.

Protests against the Act have been raging in the state since it was passed in the Parliament in December last year.

The then Manmohan Singh Government had come out with the law in the aftermath of the November 26, 2008, Mumbai attack, when Congress leader P Chidambaram was the Union Home Minister.

The legislation provides NIA concurrent jurisdiction to probe terror attacks in any part of the country without any specific permission from states and in the last one decade it has been involved in the investigation of all such cases.

The move comes a day after the Kerala government challenged the Citizenship Amendment Act under the same Article 131.

165,16-1-20,No docs will be asked for NPR: Ministry,"Amid concerns expressed by opposition parties and states like West Bengal on the National Population Register (NPR), the Home Ministry on Wednesday said no documents will be asked or biometric taken while updating the register.

A form carrying questions as part of the NPR exercise will be finalised soon, ministry officials said.

They said “no papers will be asked” and “no biometrics will be taken” during the exercise.

However, the information available on the website of the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, the NPR database would contain demographic as well as biometric details.

“The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars,” it said.

Meanwhile, West Bengal and Kerala have put works related to the updating NPR “on hold” for the time being amid furore over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The ministry officials said most of the states have notified provisions related to the NPR.

The NPR is a register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), subdistrict, district, state and national levels under provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

The rules have a provision for fine of up to Rs 1,000 on those violating it.

The data for NPR was last collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase of the Census 2011. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door to door survey.

While updating the register in 2015, the government has asked details like Aadhaar and their mobile number.

This time, the information related to their driving licence and voter ID card may also be gathered, the officials said, adding that PAN card details will not be collected as part of this exercise.

For the purposes of the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more, or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months. The law compulsorily seeks to register every citizen of India and issue a national identity card. The NPR exercise will be carried out between April and September 2020 in all states and UTs, except Assam, along with the house listing phase of the census exercise.

Assam has been excluded because the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise has already been conducted in the state.

The demographic details of every individual are required for every usual resident: name, relationship to head of household, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of usual residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation, educational qualification.

The Union Cabinet has approved Rs 3,941.35 crore for the NPR exercise.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-docs-will-be-asked-for-npr--ministry.html
166,16-1-20,Mumbai: Height of Ambedkar statue to be raised by 100 ft,"In a move that will gladden the hearts of Dalits across the State, the Maharashtra Government on Wednesday decided to increase the height of proposed statue of late BR Ambedkar at the Indu Mills compound in north-central Mumbai, by 100 more feet taking it to a height of 350 ft.

Talking to media persons after the Sate Cabinet approved the increase in the Dalit icon’s statute, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said: “The height of Dr Ambedkar’s statue will be raised from the earlier 250 feet to 350 feet. It will be erected on a pedestal of the height of 100 feet. In essence, the collective height of the broze statue will be 450 feet”.

The defunct Indu Mill plot is located right next to the Chaityabhoomi at Dadar Chowpatty, where late Dr Ambedkar was cremated a day after he passed away on December 6, 1956.

“The work on the construction of the Ambedkar had been hanging fire for the last couple of the years. In order to expedite the construction, we took several important decisions today. We expect to complete the construction of memorial in the next two years. Once completed, we will get to see a beautiful and architecturally fabulous memorial, a monument we will all be proud of,” Pawar said.

“Being the Finance Minister, I will ensure that there will not be any dearth of funds for the project,” Pawar said.

There will be elements of the Buddhist architecture in the Ambedkar memorial, which is coming up on a 12 acre plot of land. While 68

per cent of the land will be open lawn, there will be a training centre that can accommodate 400 people, a state-art auditorium and a museum-cum-exhibition hall at the memorial.

The State Government has appointed M/s Shashi Prabhu and Associates as Consultants for the project.

167,16-1-20,Khadi rumal to help J&K women artisans,"On December 17 last year, Minister for MSME Nitin Gadkari launched the sale of ‘Khadi Rumal’ stitched by militancy affected women of Jammu & Kashmir at Nagrota near Jammu, a center

established by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) to provide employment to local women. In his inaugural address, Gadkari requested the Chairman KVIC, Shri VK Saxena to increase the stitching charges of Khadi Rumal from Rs 2 per piece to Rs 3 per piece to increase their income.

The KVIC Chairman has now approved the enhancement of wages from Rs 2 to Rs 3 per piece.

Each each women artisan at Nagrota used to earn around Rs 170 - Rs 200 stitching 85-90 Khadi Rumals on an average working four hours per day. With the revised wages, each woman will earn around Rs 250 - Rs 300 per day, increasing their income by around 50 percent.

Since the launch of the sale of Khadi handkerchief on December 17, the KVIC has sold approximately 30,000 of these items.

Highlighting this as a major step towards nation building Chairman KVIC said, “Since the inception of this training center, the intention of KVIC has been to promote ‘Khadi Rumal’ and contribute meaningfully to the families of militancy affected areas of J&K. Currently the stitching center has a production capacity of 10,000 ‘Khadi Rumals’ per day stitched by 130 women artisans.”

Speaking about the initiative, Saxena said, “’Khadi Rumal’ is a symbol of trust that the women in militancy-hit areas residing in Nagrota, have on the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Modi, who is working towards ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. Currently we have been able to employ 130 women and as the sale of Khadi Rumal increases, we plan to reach out and empower 4000 women of this area.”

White Khadi Rumal, made of pure cotton, is being sold across various Khadi outlets in India. To increase the

outreach and availability of these Rumals PayTM has agreed to sell 2 Crore pieces of ‘Khadi Rumals’ with the help of its online platforms.

Outlining the impact potential of this initiative, Saxena said, “We have targeted to sell 5 Crore pieces of Khadi Rumal by 2020. To create 5 Crore pieces of Khadi Rumal, around 15 Lakh Kg’s of cotton will be consumed and it will require 25 lakh man-days of spinning, 12.5 lakh man-days of weaving and around 7.5 lakh man-days for cutting, stitching and packaging of Rumals. Thus creating 44 lakh man-days of livelihood, yielding wages amounting to Rs. 88 Crores for various artisans”, Saxena said.

168,16-1-20,Fallout deepens as DMK dares Cong to quit alliance,"A day after it said only time will tell whether ties with the Congress would go back to normalcy, the DMK on Wednesday upped the ante, saying if the national party wants to quit the alliance, it can do so.

Party veteran Duraimurugan, when asked about Congress’s charge that DMK violated coalition dharma and that the grand old party might leave the alliance, said “if they want to quit, let them do so. How are we concerned, what is the loss for us?”

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a Pongal event here, the DMK treasurer said the party was not worried about Congress leaving the alliance and in particular he was notconcerned.

Asked whether it would not impact the votes in favour of DMK, Duraimurugan, flanked by his son Kathir Anand, said his party will not be affected at all.

In his sarcastic style, he said the Congress does not have a vote bank to make a dent on his party’s prospects.

“Do they have votes to make an impact?” he asked. On his party colleague and former Union Minister TR Baalu saying that only “time will tell” on ties, he said: “Baalu said only time will tell. But I have answered the question.”

Reacting to it, Congress Lok Sabha MP Karti Chidambaram, son of senior leader P Chidambaram, asked in his twitter handle: “Why didn’t this wisdom dawn before the Vellore parliamentary bye election? @DuraimuruganDmk @dmkathiranand.” The Vellore Lok Sabha election was held in August last and Duraimurugan’s son Kathir emerged victorious by a margin of 8,141 votes.

169,16-1-20,Shah should accept that India is democracy: Raut,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah is a “staunch nationalist”, but he should accept the fact that there is democracy in the country, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said here on Wednesday.

The Sena’s Rajya Sabha member was speaking at an awards ceremony of the media group Lokmat.

During a public interview, he was asked to describe the qualities of some prominent leaders and also to give them advise in a rapid-fire session.

About Narendra Modi, Raut said he was a very hard working man. “I do not have the right to give him any advice. He is the Prime Minister,” he said. “But as ajournalist, I would like to say that he should check what is going on among his colleagues,” the Sena leader said in a cryptic remark.

When it came to Shah, Raut said the BJP president was a “staunch nationalist” and some of his decisions, such as the scrapping of Article 370, were commendable. “But in some cases he should accept that there is democracy in the country and understand the opposition’s view,”he said.

On Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Raut said, “He is good at heart, but he should spend at least 15 hours in the party office.”

Asked about Nitin Gadkari, he said the senior BJP leader should work more in Delhi. “We need a BJP leader from Maharashtra like him to stand strongly in Delhi,” Raut added.

He had good relations with Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, Raut said, adding that he should not do anything that benefits the BJP.

Assauddin Owaisi, leader of the All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen, is a fine legal expert, but he should change his image as a “vote-cutting machine”, Raut said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/shah-should-accept-that-india-is-democracy--raut.html

The Kiev-bound Boeing 737 was shot down last week in a catastrophic error shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Iran had for days denied claims based on US intelligence that the plane had been downed by a missile, triggering four days of demonstrations as well as international calls for a full and transparent investigation.

One week on from the disaster, Rouhani called for ""national unity"" in an address broadcast live on state television.

""If there was a delay"" by the armed forces to release information about the air disaster, ""let them apologise,"" he said.

Rouhani also called for a full explanation of what happened in the air disaster, which came hours after Iran's military fired a wave of missiles at US troops stationed in Iraq.

173,16-1-20,IMA writes to PM on pharma firms bribing doctors with women,"The Indian Medical Association (IMA), an apex body representating over 3.5 lakh doctors in the country has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking clarification if he in a meeting recently warned the pharma firms of bribing doctors and breaching ethical market practices. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) has, however, outrightly rejected the allegations, stating that no such matter was discussed in the meeting held on January 1.

Citing media reports that Modi in a recent interaction with the top pharmaceutical companies had warned them against bribing doctors with women, foreign trips and gadgets,” the IMA in its letter titled ‘Deny or Prove or Apologise’, has sought a clarification from the “office of the Prime Minister if such a meeting ever happened” and that “such a statement was made by the Prime Minister”.

In response to the IMA allegations, the IPA tweeted that “There was no discussion on alleged bribes being given by pharma companies to doctors as being reported in media. Meeting was constructive one where discussion was limited to initiatives to boost industry. News reports to contrary are baseless.”

The Prime Minister had convened meeting with healthcare industry on January 1. It was attended by industry leaders including Satish Reddy (Dr Reddy’s), Ajay Piramal (PiramalGroup), Dilip Shanghvi (Sun Pharma), Dr Habil Khorakiwala (Wockhardt) &others, the IPA tweeted.

On the other hand, the IMA letter read, “IMA demands to know that if the Government had details of the companies involved in supplying woman to doctors why it chose to invite them for a meeting rather than initiate a criminal proceedings. Moreover, it is imperative on the PMO now to release the names of doctors convicted or otherwise as well.”

“The state medical councils should initiate appropriate action if the doctors have been convicted on moral turpitude.”

The letter signed by IMA President and General Secretary Dr Ranjan Sharma and Dr RV Asokan respectively also demanded “details of the companies involved in supplying women to doctors” while noting that “the government will not be able to prove these allegations”. In fact, it alleged that the purpose (of taking up such issues) seems to divert the attention from unresolved issues regarding heal of the people and the medical education in the country.

It enlisted various issues such as government’s flagship health scheme Ayushmaan Bharat, calling it a non-starter in the private hospitals and was operating more in the government hospitals where the treatment was anyways free. Also, “there is no investment either in infrastructure or human resources. Violence on doctors has increased. The Government has failed to provide security the doctors….hence the IMA has reasons to believe that such crude tactics is to divert the attention of the people from the real issues in health sector,” said the letter.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ima-writes-to-pm-on-pharma-firms-bribing-doctors-with-women.html
174,16-1-20,"SIT: No intention to punish culprits, acquittals given in routine manner","In a scathing report on the way the 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases were handled by the police, administration and even judiciary, a Supreme Court appointed SIT has said there was no intention of punishing the culprits and acquittals were “handed over by judges” to the accused in a “routine manner”.

The report of the SIT, headed by retired Delhi High Court judge Justice S N Dhingra, has said that “whole efforts” of police and administration “seem to have been to hush up the criminal cases concerning riots”.

The cases were registered to give “clean chit” to certain persons, it said.

The report, which was submitted in the apex court, dealt with 186 anti-Sikh riots cases referred to the SIT which was set up by the top court on January 11, 2018 to supervise further probe into these cases in which closure reports were filed earlier.

It said the basic reason for these crimes remaining unpunished and culprits getting scot-free was lack of interest shown by the police and the authorities in handling these cases as per law or to proceed with the intention of punishing those involved.

The report is also critical of the way these cases were handled by trial courts here and said: “It is not understood how the courts proceeded with trial of several crimes of rioting, murders, arson, looting having taken place at different locations, different times and even different dates together.”

The SIT has recommended exploring possibility of filing appeals, along with application for condonation of delay, against the trial court orders of acquittals in some of these cases.

“Acquittals were handed over by judges to accused of 1984 riots in a routine manner,” the report said. “None of the judgements on record show that the judges were alive to the situation of 1984 riots and were alive to the fact that for delay in lodging FIRs and statement of witnesses, the victims were not responsible”.

It said that due to protracted trial in these cases, the victims and witnesses were so tired of coming to the courts time and again that most of them had given up and those who had not given up, the courts refused to give credibility to their testimony on grounds, including delay in lodging of FIR and in recording evidence.

The report said the scrutiny of files reveals evidence of involvement of the then inspector Survir Singh Tyagi, then SHO of Kalyan Puri police station, in a conspiracy with rioters.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sit--no-intention-to-punish-culprits--acquittals-given-in-routine-manner.html

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “The Government is flouting norms and the defence procurement procedure 2016 (DPP-2016) in awarding the contract to the Adani-HSL joint venture”.

The party alleged five companies - L & T, Reliance Naval & Engineering, the Government-controlled Mazgaon Dock Shipbuilders, HSL and Adani-HSL JV — replied to the expressions of interest (EoIs) invited by the Government for building the submarines.

“The empowered committee of the Navy, whose head is controller of warship acquisition, short-listed L&T and Mazgaon Dock Shipbuilders, but the Government is pressurising it to include the Adani-HSL JV. The meeting for the same is on Friday,” Surjewala alleged.

On September 28, the companies announced formation of the joint venture, he said referring to certain media reports.

“According to rules, the joint venture has to get clearance from the Ministry of Defence. But it had not been taken at the time submitting the EOI.

179,16-1-20,Jeff Bezos commits USD 1 bn to digitise small business in India,"Amazon.com Inc chief Jeff Bezos on Wednesday announced USD 1 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) investment in India to help bring small and medium businesses online and committed to exporting USD 10 billion worth of India-made goods by 2025.

Before this, the online retail giant had committed USD 5.5 billion investments in India — Amazon’s most important market outside of the US and a key growth driver.

We are committed to being a long-term partner of India. And actions speak louder than words, he said.

“Over the next five years, Amazon will invest an incremental USD 1 billion to digitise micro and small businesses... across India, helping them reach more customers than ever before. This initiative will use Amazon’s global footprint to create USD 10 billion in India exports by 2025,” he said.

He added that part of this goal is to ensure that more people can participate in the prosperity of India. “We are making this announcement now because it is working... When something works you should double down on it. And that is why we are doing it.”

Amazon hopes that this investment will “bring millions of more people into the future prosperity of India and at the same time expose the world to the ‘Make in India’ products that represent India’s rich, diverse culture.”

The company had previously said it expected e-commerce exports from India to reach USD 5 billion by 2023 under its global selling programme.

Bezos, who began a three-day visit to India on Tuesday by visiting Mahatma Gandhi memorial at Rajghat here, was speaking at the SMBhav summit — an Amazon India gathering for small and medium businesses.

“The 21st century is going to be the Indian century,” the Amazon founder said, adding: “This country has something special: its dynamism. I also predict that the most important alliance in the 21st century will be between India and the United States.”

Bezos is expected to meet top government functionaries and business leaders during the trip.

His visit has been marked by Competition Commission of India initiating a formal investigation into alleged deep discounts, preferential listing and exclusionary tactics adopted by Amazon and Flipkart, and small store owners demonstrating on the streets against online retailers driving them out of business by offering sharply discounted products.

The Confederation of All India Traders, an association of about seven crore brick-and-mortar retailers, has said it will protest across 300 cities during his visit.

Last year, the government had tightened rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investment. These rules barred such platforms from offering products of sellers in which they hold a stake and banned exclusive marketing arrangements among other clauses. Following this, Amazon restructured its joint ventures to ensure compliance.

Bezos is likely to take up these issues in his various meetings with government officials.

Despite huge losses, Amazon has been pumping millions of dollars across various operations like marketplace, payments, infrastructure and supply chain management as well as marketing and promotion as it looks to strengthen its position in the fledgling Indian e-commerce market.

In December last year, Amazon invested over Rs 1,700 crore into its payments and wholesale business units in India, while in October it had infused over Rs 4,400 crore (more than USD 600 million) in its various units in India, including marketplace and food retail.

Bezos last visited India in 2014 when he presented Amazon’s Indian unit with a giant cheque for USD 2 billion.

Since then, Amazon has pledged a further USD 3.5 billion to expand in the country and the USD 1 billion investment announced Wednesday would take the total committed investment to USD 6.5 billion.

The USD 1 billion investment would be to digitise 10 million micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and traders across India, including manufacturers, resellers, local offline shops, and brands.

As part of this effort, Amazon will establish 100 Digital Haats in cities and villages throughout India.

“Today, there are more than 5,50,000 sellers on the Amazon India marketplace and more than 60,000 Indian manufacturers and brands are exporting their ‘Make in India’ products to customers worldwide on Amazon,” as per a company statement on the event.

“With today’s announcement, Amazon will help Indian MSMEs grow their cumulative exports to USD 10 billion by 2025 through the Amazon Global Selling program, which enables businesses to sell on Amazon marketplaces globally.”

The Digital Haats will provide services like e-commerce onboarding, imaging and cataloguing, warehouse space, logistics, digital marketing, and compliance. Digital Haats will be in local neighbourhoods and available to MSMEs irrespective of their association with Amazon.

“The micro, small and medium-size businesses selling on Amazon.in are located across the country including Tier 2 and 3 cities, where they are generating jobs and transforming the retail landscape of the country,” the statement added.

According to a report, India is among the fastest growing markets for the e-commerce sector. Revenue from the sector is expected to increase to USD 120 billion in 2020 from USD 39 billion in 2017, growing at an annual rate of 51 per cent.

Competition in the sector is also set to intensify as India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has announced plans to launch his own e-commerce venture.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/jeff-bezos-commits-usd-1-bn-to-digitise-small-business-in-india.html

Iran initially denied Western claims that the airliner had been downed by a missile but eventually conceded that the plane had been accidentally shot down.

Tsai won a second term over the weekend with a record 8.2 million votes, an outcome that was seen as a forceful rebuke of China's ongoing campaign to isolate the self-ruled island.

China's leadership had made no secret of its desire to see Tsai turfed out because she and her party refuse to acknowledge their view that the island is part of a ""one China"".

Beijing regards Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary — especially if it declares independence.

But in her first interview since Saturday's re-election, Tsai told the BBC there was no need to formally announce independence because the island already runs itself.

""We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,"" she said in the interview, which aired on Wednesday.

""We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China, Taiwan."" Modern Taiwan has been run separately from the mainland for the last 70 years.

For decades, it was a dictatorship under Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists following their 1949 defeat to the communists in China's civil war.

A man named Robert F. Hyde disparaged Yovanovitch in messages to Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cell phone use, raising questions about possible surveillance.

Democrats released the files Tuesday as they prepared to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for Trump's trial. The documents add new context to their charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Democrats as he withheld military aid.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/democrats-release-new-documents-on-eve-of-impeachment-trial.html

187,16-1-20,"Market pauses, banks slide on NPA woes","Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty took a pause after a four-session record run on Wednesday, as higher bank NPAs in ongoing quarterly results weighed on banking stocks coupled with a caution ahead of US-China trade deal.

At the closing bell, the BSE gauge Sensex was down 79.90 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 41,872.73; while the NSE barometer Nifty was 19 points, or 0.15 per cent, lower at 12,343.30.

Both indices — Sensex and Nifty — had closed at their life-time high levels for the second day in a row on Tuesday.

IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 5.44 per cent. Other major laggards were Infosys, SBI, PowerGrid, Tech Mahindra, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank.

In contrast, Hero MotoCorp, Titan, Maruti, Asian Paints, M&M, TCS, Bajaj Auto and Ultratech Cement closed on the winning side.

Sectorally, BSE bankex, finance, telecom, energy and teck indices fell up to 0.70 per cent. On the other hand, consumer durables, realty, auto, utilities, metal and healthcare indices rose up to 1.37 per cent.

In the broader market, BSE midcap and smallcap indices outperformed benchmarks, rallying up to 1.04 per cent.

Analysts are of the view that overall market sentiment was also affected by comments from a top US official that the trade truce with China, set to be signed on Wednesday, does not include a deal to roll back tariffs imposed on most Chinese goods.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said, “After the solid pre-budget rally, market is getting a bit sceptical post higher than expected NPA numbers in the recent Q3 banks results and very high consumer inflation which may stay for another month or two. Market would watch the Q3 results & actual budget, for further direction.”

188,16-1-20,Making efforts to strengthen bank further: Yes Bank,"Allaying concerns over reports of its weakening financial health, Yes Bank on Wednesday said the lender’s capital adequacy is at a comfortable level and efforts are being made to further strengthen it.

The bank has asked its customers not to pay heed to rumours about its financial health.

“The bank’s overall Capital Adequacy Ratio is comfortably above regulatory requirements and all efforts are being made to financially strengthen the bank even further. Kindly, therefore, pay no heed to these unfounded reports,” Yes Bank said in a statement.

The bank plans to convene an extraordinary general meeting on February 7 to get shareholders’ nod for raising Rs 10,000 crore, and to increase authorised capital from existing Rs 800 crore to Rs 1,100 crore, already cleared by the board.

Last week, Uttam Prakash Agarwal, an independent director of Yes Bank resigned from the board and stepped down as head of its audit committee citing major corporate governance concerns.

The capital-starved bank also reported setbacks in its USD 2-billion fundraising plans. Canadian investor Erwin Singh Braich’s USD 1.2 billion offer will not be pursued further, the bank had said.

It had further said a USD 500-million offer from Citax Holdings and Citax Investment Group, which was being favourably considered, is also facing headwinds.

The bank, which was waiting for regulatory approvals as Citax’s offer entailed over 10 per cent ownership, has not been able to get a clearance yet on the “conditions precedent”. Without specifying timelines, it said the Citax offer will be taken up “during the next round”.

The troubled bank has been forced to shrink its book due to capital paucity and was hoping to close the fundraising by December.

Need for capital has been necessitated as under new CEO Ravneet Gill, the lender has had to provide for sour loan bets taken under his predecessor Rana Kapoor whose term was cut short by the RBI in 2018 over concerns on corporate governance.

189,16-1-20,"1,200 exporters untraceable","Revenue Department using its data analytics has discovered a fraud in GST refunds with as many as 1,200 exporters, who have have claimed Rs 350 crore refunds, are now untraceable.

The department has reasons to consider that nefarious elements among the customs broker community may be connected with these frauds, involving fictitious entities, existing only in virtual space through identity thefts with fake and morphed documents, according to sources.

The detection of fraud has resulted in saving the exchequer over Rs 350 crore of refunds, they added.

Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has obligated customs brokers under their licensing conditions to independently verifying the KYC of exporters, the sources noted. However, going by the cases detected in recent months, at least 50 customs brokers have been found to have dealt by and large with such exporter entities which are untraceable at their registered addresses and such custom brokers are also under the lens, the sources said. As investigators probe deeper, newer modus operandi are surfacing, they said, adding that a company by the name of SSR Export was investigated and led to discovering a fraudulent refund claim of Rs 9.88 crore.

As per the investigation, the firm was ostensibly exporting readymade garments to an special economic zone (SEZ).

Now, with newer techniques of data analytics-based risk management being available to officers, the taxpayer was selected for physical scrutiny and found non-existent at his declared address, they noted.

Using a web of fake invoicing of over Rs 847 crore, the firm created a fraudulent credit of Rs 195 crore and investigations led to discovering untraceable suppliers.

Department of Revenue is carrying out continuous risk evaluation of exporters with the help of predictive modelling, the sources said, adding regular strategy meetings are being held at a very high level by the Revenue Secretary himself with data analytic experts, state and centre tax investigators.

Over 800 entities have been interdicted during the last five months while exporting overvalued merchandise of Rs 1,500 crore to claim fake IGST refunds have been suspended in these cases.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/1-200-exporters-untraceable.html
190,16-1-20,"US, China set to sign vital trade truce","The world's two dominant economic powers, the United States and China, are poised to sign a trade truce on Wednesday, letting businesses around the globe breathe a sigh of relief. After a nearly two-year battle, the signing could give US President Donald Trump an election-year boost as well. Still, tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in imports remain in place, leaving many Americans to foot the bill.

The ""phase one"" agreement -- which includes pledges from China to beef up purchases of American crops and other exports -- also comes just as Trump faces an impeachment trial in the US Senate, giving him a victory to trumpet at least in the short term.

The easing of US-China trade frictions has boosted stock markets worldwide in recent weeks, as it takes the threat of new tariffs off the table for now. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's negotiating stance led to a ""fully enforceable deal"" which could bring additional tariffs.

If China fails to abide by the agreement, ""the president has the ability to put on additional tariffs,"" Mnuchin said on CNBC Wednesday as part of a media blitz promoting the new pact. However, the most difficult issues remain to be dealt with in ""phase two"" negotiations, including massive subsidies for state industry and forced technology transfer.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us--china-set-to-sign-vital-trade-truce-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/us--china-set-to-sign-vital-trade-truce.html
191,16-1-20,"ED summons Air Asia executives, CEO Fernandes in PMLA case","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned senior executives of Air Asia including CEO Tony Fernandes for questioning in connection with a money laundering case, officials said on Thursday.

The agency had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the airline and its officials in 2018.

Officials said while Fernandes has been summoned on January 20, few others have also been asked to depose for questioning in the following days.

The fresh summons have been issued to take the probe forward, officials said.

The ED probe is related to allegations that the airline tried to manipulate government policies through corrupt means to get international licence for its Indian venture Air Asia India Limited.

The ED case was registered after the CBI filed an FIR to probe these allegations.

The ED is also probing this case under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

Investigation in the case was initiated on the basis of the claims of ousted Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry's allegation that fraudulent transactions of Rs 22 crore, involving non-existent entities in India and Singapore, were carried out in an instance involving the airline.

The CBI and ED, in their criminal FIRs, had booked Group CEO of Air Asia Fernandes, Tharumalingam Kanagalingam also known as Bo Lingam, former Deputy Group CEO of Malaysia-based Air Asia Berhad, and R Venkataramanan, Director Air Asia India Ltd, Bengaluru, besides companies Air Asia India Pvt Ltd and Air Asia Berhad.

192,16-1-20,Iran warns Europe as diplomat says officials ‘lied' on crash,"Jallikattu,' the annual bull taming event slated to be held in several parts of Tamil Nadu got off to a colourful start here on Wednesday, the Pongal day, in which 641 bulls and 607 tamers took part.

As the feisty bulls, one after the other started racing towards the lengthy sporting arena from the entrance, known as 'vadivasal,' young men waiting with bated breath strained every nerve to latch on to the hump of the animals.

Interestingly, as many as 397 bulls of the total 641 that entered the arena could not be dominated by tamers and these animals emerged successful, an official told PTI.

""Don't touch the horns,"" ""many men don't chase one animal,"" ""allow the bull to go; it has won,"" were among the instructions that reverberated in the arena for participants.

The Jallikattu at Avaniapuram held here today marks the start of the once a year bull taming sport in many rural and semi-urban regions of Tamil Nadu.

Similar events will be held at Palamedu tomorrow and in Alanganallur on January 17 and these are among the hugely popular bull taming contests in the state.

If the participant hangs on to the hump of the bull for a determined distance, he is declared a winner and if not, the animal emerges the victor.

In each of the nine rounds, about 60 to 70 participants with colour coded T-shirts and shorts took part.

Festivity marked the event and scores of spectators from the gallery craned their necks to have a glimpse of determined men trying to get the better of the animals in a matter of seconds as soon as they were released into the arena.

A huge number of spectators, including many foreign tourists with cameras, were glued to the event.

Keenly watching the game, organisers quickly declared -over the public address system- if the animal or the man was the winner and the prize.

The sporting arena was barricaded from the enclosures marked for spectators.

The official said medical examination of both the men and animals decided their participation.

He said 62 men were injured, including 34 participants and 28 spectators, of whom eight were referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital.

However, no bull was injured, he added.

Out of the total of 730 bull tamers who were issued tokens, five were rejected for consumption of alcohol and only 607 participated in the event.

""As regards bulls, due to paucity of time only 641 could take part"" and 118 could not. Eight animals were disallowed for reasons like restlessness, the official said.

Elaborate security arrangements were made and access to medical facilities were made readily available. The event was held under the supervision of a panel, led by a retired judge.

Tehran (Iran): Iran's president warned on Wednesday that European soldiers in the Mideast ""could be in danger"" after three nations challenged Tehran over breaking the limits of its nuclear deal.

Tehran's top diplomat meanwhile acknowledged that Iranians ""were lied to"" for days following the Islamic Republic's accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian jetliner that killed 176 people.

President Hassan Rouhani's remarks in a televised Cabinet meeting represent the first direct threat he's made to Europe as tensions remain high between Tehran and Washington over President Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the deal in May 2018.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's admission, which came at a summit in New Delhi on Wednesday, represents the first time an Iranian official referred to earlier claims from Tehran that a technical malfunction downed the Ukraine International Airlines flight as a lie.

The shootdown — and subsequent days of denials that a missile had downed it — sparked days of angry protests in the country.

The current tensions between Iran and the US reached fever-pitch two weeks ago with the American drone strike in Baghdad that killed the powerful Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani.

The general had led Iranian proxy forces abroad, including those blame for deadly roadside bomb attacks on US troops in Iraq.

Iran retaliated with a ballistic missile strike targeting Iraqi military bases housing US forces early last Wednesday, just before an anti-aircraft battery shot down the Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport.

Amid all of this, Britain, France and Germany launched the so-called ""dispute mechanism"" pertaining to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Speaking before his Cabinet, Rouhani showed a rarely seen level of anger in his wide-ranging remarks Wednesday.

""Today, the American soldier is in danger, tomorrow the European soldier could be in danger,"" Rouhani said.

""We want you to leave this region but not with war. We want you to go wisely. It is to your own benefit."" Rouhani did not elaborate.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-warns-europe-as-diplomat-says-officials----lied--on-crash.html

Actor Raveena Tandon says sensuality is not about shedding your clothes, but about how one carries it off.

The actor says, “You can be sensuous in whatever you wear. It's all about how the outfit is designed and how you carry it off.”

Talking about films, she said: “A lot of films have been offered to me but very few are the kind I would want to do.” She is keen on balancing her time between family and work. “I used to FaceTime my kids and teach them when I was not around.”

The actor opened up about her views when she appeared in chat show Not Just Supper Stars along with designer Rocky S.

‘I don't ever feel I can be fully prepared for a part. It's always a work in progress and that's what's exciting about it. Spending even a day at the police station is a blast of reality and a reminder that we live in a bubble. And also a reminder that reality is way more entertaining than fiction.’

196,16-1-20,The legacy goes on,"From talking about how children need to be provided the right exposure for family businesses to growing them, entrepreneurs Sunil Kant Munjal, Ajay S Shriram and Venu Srinivasan reveal what they expect from Union Budget 2020. By Chahak Mittal

Once my uncles came around to the idea of manufacturing, a confident, Yeh bhi kar lenge (We can do this too), pledge resounded around the Munjal residence and workplace. It was, of course, easier said than done.’ The lines from Sunil Kant Munjal’s book The Making of HERO: Four Brothers, Two Wheels and a Revolution that Shaped India in more ways than one sum up the can-do attitude of the business family. Unveiled recently by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, it traces the journey of how Munjal brothers created the business empire after losing everything amid the brutality of Partition.

The panel discussion organised by the publisher, Harper Collins, had the likes of Sanjiv Goenka, Venu Srinivasan, Ajay S Shriram along with the author and was moderated by Dr Prannoy Roy. They discussed how family businesses sustain, survive and grow over the passage of years and change in generations. Munjal, who is the youngest son of Hero group founder Brijmohan Lall Munjal, and chairman of Hero enterprise, said, “The way a family uses the given resources actually determines the future of its growth. If a child sees his elders doing certain things, it becomes an individual’s second nature, more than even a habit, especially when it concerns family businesses. Hence, the tradition continues. We have to appreciate every little thing that goes into the making and growth of family businesses. For instance, I observed how my father wouldn’t let anybody else pick up his office bag. He always did it himself since he felt that it was his work. So there are these little things that add up and become a big idea.”

Talking about how building family relationships boost businesses, Ajay S Shriram, chairman and director, DCM Shriram, said, “When it reaches the fifth generation, a lot of it has already changed. So trust and passing on the legacy the right way is very crucial for a family business to grow. There are certain families for whom money becomes god. And at that moment, the family needs to stop and think, look after itself and restructure its plans, otherwise it will get shattered into pieces. It’s not always possible that business profits also lead to personal gains.”

Venu Srinivasan, chairman of the TVS Group, added that passing on the right values to future generations is crucial in helping family businesses grow. “Maintaining families and grand businesses together isn’t as easy. There are also some families who send off their children abroad to get the right exposure before they completely get into the business. This not only helps them acquire the right skill set but they are also able to pitch modern and innovative business ideas which the seniors might not have thought of.”

Moving further, the panel also delved into the long-standing debate on merit versus inheritance. Munjal pointed out, “Inheritance is not just limited to businesses or politicians. It is there in every profession. Be it lawyers, doctors, actors, engineers, and even journalists, to some extent. And this is because the conversation about that particular profession or work goes on long after one has reached home. For instance, parents often come home and relate incidents from their workplace to their children. As I said, the youngsters learn what they see. Looking at their elders, the children tend to follow the same track. And many a times, there are cases when the child doesn’t want to follow the most common family profession or does something of his/her own. But there’s no hard and fast rule that a businessman’s son would be a businessman too or a doctor’s daughter would be a doctor too. The familial bond often determines the child’s preference but not always.”

The three business leaders shared personal anecdotes on how their fathers and uncles advised them to approach work. Shriram said, “I had a habit of going to my father’s factories since a very young age. For my father, work was worship. He always taught me that professional relationships are very crucial, be it between the dealer and the customer or the employer and the employee. You should always work in a way that you could create a win-win situation for both. Otherwise, it wouldn’t work.”

While Srinivasan pointed towards maintaining trust with employees, customers and family, Munjal said that one learning he paid the most attention to has been to never look at anybody as being senior or junior since one can never guess a person’s potential. “Good ideas can come from anywhere and at anytime. Just keep that in mind.”

Discussing about what the three expected from the Union Budget 2020, Shriram said, “There needs to be a special law for the development of the agricultural sector as it is suffering a lot. The policies are not moving in terms of governance or in terms of coordination with the states. A GST kind of system is needed to get all the agri ministers involved in its implementation.” Srinivasan said, “One of the most important issues that need attention is job creation. The most fundamental development drive will come from a good employment level.” On the other hand, Munjal said, “I would like to see a slippage in the fiscal deficit and that slippage moving towards the betterment of the infrastructure sector in India.”

The German, a former world number one who won the Australian Open in 2016, pulled out when behind 6-3, 2-0 in her second-round clash with Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska.

The ninth seed began showing serious signs of the back problem early in the second set then stopped after two points in the third game on her own serve, calling for the trainer.

A medical evaluation on court ended with the 31-year-old world number 18 calling it quits against her teenaged opponent.

Yastremska kept calm during the delay, reading what she called “secret” notes.

“I didn’t want to lose focus,” said the world number 24, who has won three titles over the past two seasons.

On other courts, Croat Donna Vekic rallied past Maria Sakkari of Greece 2-6, 7-5, 6-1, winning in two hours and overcoming six aces while breaking four times. She moved into a quarter-final against Yastremska.

The Gabon international, who opened the scoring in Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace, was booked for a tackle on Max Meyer but the video assistant referee upgraded the punishment to a red card.

Arsenal appealed against Aubameyang’s dismissal but the punishment stands.

The former Borussia Dortmund player, 30, has scored 14 of Arsenal’s 29 Premier League goals this season.

“Players have to step up,” Arteta said on Wednesday when asked if the team would miss their suspended captain.

""You know, when one of your big players is not there, they have to take responsibility. I'm sure when they're not playing, they want a chance and they talk.

“It’s time to talk on the pitch, not outside. You come on there, you make the impact that he made and you show me that you are as good as him or even better. You have the chance.”

Arteta has also been hit by an injury to defender Sead Kolasinac.

The left-back is a doubt for Saturday's Sheffield United game due to a thigh injury, with fellow left-back Kieran Tierney and right-back Calum Chambers both long-term absentees.

Arsenal have been linked with a move for Manchester City’s John Stones, with whom Arteta worked at the Etihad Stadium, but he said there would be no move for the England international.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/arteta-challenges-gunners-to-fill-aubameyang---s-void.html
200,16-1-20,Kohli named captain of ICC’s ODI and Test teams of year,"India skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli was on Wednesday named captain of the International Cricket Council’s ODI and Test teams of the year, capping off a memorable season for the world No.1.

Apart from Kohli, there were four other Indians who were picked in the ICC’s Test and ODI Teams of the Year.

While the Test team featured double-centurion Mayank Agarwal, opener Rohit Sharma, speedster Mohammed Shami and left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav found a place in the ODI side.

Kohli enjoyed a tremendous run in both the formats in 2019. The 31-year-old hit his seventh Test double hundred on the way to a career-best unbeaten 254 against South Africa in October last year.

It was a breakthrough year for opener Agarwal, who smashed two double tons, one century and went beyond the fifty-run mark twice. He hit a career-best score of 243 against Bangladesh in November.

Limited overs vice-captain Rohit had a splendid ODI World Cup campaign, slamming a record five hundreds and a half century in the United Kingdom.

Kuldeep, too, enjoyed a memorable year as he joined the golden list of bowlers with two hat-tricks. The chinaman claimed his second ODI hat-trick of his career against the West Indies last month.

In the absence of Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, Shami rose to the occasion making the best in the business hop, skip and jump with his pace, swing and bounce through the season. He scalped 42 wickets in 21 ODIs over the last 12 months.

201,16-1-20,Tennis stars swing racquets for relief,"Tennis superstars Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal jointly donated Aus$250,000 (US$172,000) for Australian bushfire relief at a charity fundraiser in smoggy Melbourne on Wednesday.

The two tennis legends, with 39 Grand Slam singles titles between them, were at the Rod Laver Arena in a bid to swell the vast sums already donated to help victims of the devastating disaster.

They were joined by a who’s who of the tennis world, including Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki, Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka, Petra Kvitova, Dominic Thiem, Coco Gauff, Nick Kyrgios, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev.

“Twenty years this has been my home and I've had so many great matches on this court and in this country,” said Williams, whose young daughter Alexis Olympia was thrilled to meet some firefighters this week.

“And that’s we’re all here tonight to support and help out.”

Tennis Australia said it expected the “Rally for Relief” to raise “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to add to the more than Aus$2.8 million (US$1.9 million) already stumped up by the global tennis community.

That has included personal pledges and Aus$100 for each ace hit during the Australian tennis swing. Some of the big names also donated merchandise for an online auction Wednesday.

Williams led a team in Fast4 doubles, a shortened version of the game, boosting Thiem and Kvitova, along with Nadal and Djokovic playing together on the same side of the net.

They met Wozniacki’s side that featured Gauff, Osaka, Zverev and Tsitsipas.

But the evening’s star turn saw Federer play a set against Australian bad boy Kyrgios, who has been driving force behind the fundraising effort.

“It’s emotional stuff,"" said Kyrgios. “I just want to have a little fun out here tonight and hopefully we can overcome this.”

The bushfires, unprecedented in their duration and intensity, have claimed 28 lives, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and razed vast tracts of land.

Toxic haze from the blazes has disrupted the build-up to next week’s Australian Open, with qualifying delayed over the past two days and some players taken ill.

A cool change bringing rain swept through on Wednesday afternoon, raising expectations of clearer air for Thursday.

Tennis chiefs have insisted any delays to the Grand Slam's scheduled start on Monday were unlikely given Melbourne Park has three roofed stadiums and eight other indoor courts which could be used in an emergency.

The roof of the Rod Laver Arena was closed for the charity evening.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tennis-stars-swing-racquets-for-relief.html
202,16-1-20,A Treasure trove,"Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, managing director, Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board, says that efforts are being made to showcase the state as a mix of wildlife, heritage, culture and cuisine. By Team Viva

vHow will the MSME Development Policy help tourism in the state? Will it encourage homestays which would also increase accommodation facilities for tourists?

In India MSMEs, with a growth of 13.9 per cent, were the largest job creators as compared to all the other sectors during the last four years. In this segment, it was the hospitality and tourism sectors which were the highest contributors. In developing countries tourism is a contributor to small scale enterprises thus lifting the standards of living as well as acting as a catalyst for community development.

Homestays, a concept which involves the local community, aims to encourage households to earn an income from tourism directly. We have seen that a majority of local people are usually eager to be involved in activities related to tourism and would like to take a leading role as entrepreneurs and workers at all levels.

Homestays can provide a reliable income for host families while also supporting local accommodation providers by offering extra beds in locations where hotels may be in short supply. They provide viable alternative livelihood and represent a definite link between protecting the local environment and economic benefits that eco-tourism can bring, helping to pave the way for further conservation and sustainable management initiatives.

How does ecotourism benefit the state by protecting forest and supporting economic growth simultaneously?

Ecotourism is a more sensitive form of travel which incorporates ecologically sustainable activities, supports conservation measures and involves local communities in tourism. It helps in protecting the environment, brings about poverty alleviation and leads to overall socio-economic development as locals are made aware of the importance of conservation and protection of environment for their own benefit. It can also go a long way in supporting wildlife conservation efforts. In Madhya Pradesh, our focus on eco-tourism is to help provide jobs for local people (thereby reducing migration to larger cities) and create a market for locally produced items.

We are making efforts to encourage cultural sensitivity of visitors by enhancing guest-host interactions. Undoubtedly, eco-tourism can enhance wildlife conservation by involving tribals and forest-dwellers and encouraging them to become a part of the industry. This would bring about a more equitable sharing of benefits while helping to conserve natural, cultural and built resources which in turn, would maintain the quality of life in the area. The most important aspect of eco-tourism is that it balances sustainable economic development and biodiversity conservation, thereby positively affecting environmental, social and economic components of the community.

What are the new initiatives by the government to create world class infrastructure to attract high-end tourists?

Madhya Pradesh is already a well-known destination among domestic travellers in India because of the famous Khajuraho temple complex and the various spiritual destinations that are a part of the pilgrimage circuit. Our effort now is to showcase the state as a treasure trove of wildlife, heritage, culture and cuisine. With the largest tiger population in the country, we are promoting jungle safaris not only in India but also to a very keen and excited international market. Our lesser-known but equally breath-taking tourist offerings such as Orchha, Mandu, Maheshwar and Chanderi are being showcased effectively as locations where one can get a glimpse of the “real India”, the hinterland. We have launched several festivals such as Jalmahotsav, Namaste Orchha and Mandu Utsav which highlight the different facets of the destination. At the same time, we are also keen to depict the state as a global “Foodie” destination with the exquisite offerings of Bhopali cuisine and Indore’s bustling street food scene. We have seen a great deal of interest in the luxury jungle lodges which are located in Bandhavgarh, Pench and Kanha from experienced and well-heeled travellers from India and abroad who found the jungle safari experience in Madhya Pradesh comparable, if not better than those in the African safaris. Our effort is to ensure that we continue to improve the tourists’ experience in every aspect — from increased air connectivity to improved on-ground transport with better wayside amenities, knowledgeable guides and ensuring greater security and comfort of tourists visiting the state.

What are the steps being taken to encourage adventure and culture tourism in the state?

Madhya Pradesh has a huge untapped potential for both adventure and culture tourism in addition to being a huge attraction for wildlife and heritage lovers. The varied topography of this huge state includes hills, rivers, large forest areas and lakes which makes it an ideal location for undertaking both soft and hard adventure activities. Trekking can be undertaken in Kanha, Pachmarhi and Amartantak. The gushing waters of the Betwa river offer a challenge to even the most intrepid river-rafter. Rock climbing is gaining momentum in the Pachmarhi range while mountaineering is becoming more popular in the Maikal region with its dense and unexplored jungles.

The culture of the state is ancient and deep-rooted and therefore our offerings are immense — ranging from textile and handicraft to tribal art and music/ dance. Our efforts are focussed on bringing attention to the age-old handloom weaves of Chanderi and Maheshwar (fabrics which are globally popular today), block printing techniques such as Bagh and Nandna, tribal art such as Gond paintings, dhokra and jute craft among many others. We have several music and dance festivals which are conducted throughout the year such as the Gwalior Samaroh, Hridaya Drishyam and Khajuraho Dance Festival, all aimed at popularising these art forms across the world.

What are the opportunities for film tourism given that there are beautiful locations across the state?

The popularity of Madhya Pradesh as a destination for film shooting has grown progressively over the years. The backdrop of Khajuraho and Sanchi, the jungles of Kanha and Bandhavgarh, the forts and monuments of Gwalior, Orchha and Mandu, the culture of Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior offer filmmakers the most diverse filmmaking experiences. Various Bollywood films from Dilip Kumar’s Aan (1952) to more recent Padman, Stree, Sui Dhaga, were shot at some of the most exquisite locations in Madhya Pradesh. From 1952 till date more than 75 Bollywood movies have been shot in Madhya Pradesh.

The state is a perfect combination of natural settings, ancient heritage, huge water bodies and a helpful administration which are a filmmaker’s delight and make it the most preferred destination. A key factor which has led many filmmakers and actors to trust MP for shoots is the support extended by the local authorities in granting permissions and access to various heritage and protected structures. Besides the scenic locations, filmmakers unanimously agree that they are heartened by the support extended by the locals. As the teams travel with a lot of equipment from Mumbai and Delhi, they look for support from the local artistes too. Since Bhopal and Indore have a very active theatre scene, artistes can offer the support that filmmakers seek.

The state government also offers capital investment subsidy for expenditure on creating infrastructure of permanent nature and installation of equipment for film studio and film production. If the shooting crew opts for an accommodation at MPSTDC hotel, they can avail a discount of up to 40 per cent in lodging tariff. Madhya Pradesh Tourism is the nodal agency to assist the film producers for procuring various clearances and permissions extending complete support and encouragement to the film fraternity.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-treasure-trove-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-treasure-trove.html
203,16-1-20,For a cause,"Retired vice president of Shri Ram Group, KK Sharma, is making a difference by imparting free healthcare, education and self-defence training

Who says there cannot be a hole in the sky, a stone hurts you guys. This phrase is a reflection on a social worker in Ghaziabad, who has been constantly working on grass root level, away from the glare of publicity for the last thirty years. We are talking about KK Sharma, who after retiring as the vice president of Shri Ram Group started social services.

Currently, under his supervision, OPD service is being operated in five dispensaries where hundreds of economically backward people are treated on a regular basis. The special thing is that two of these dispensaries are mobile, this means that they can go to areas where there is a lack of health services. Out of these, three dispensaries are running permanently in Sanjaynagar Sector 23, Nandagram and Shahpur. Sharma had obtained MBA, LLB and a master’s degree in social service. There is Polytechnic Center on Meerut Road for the economically-backward girls too, who are not able to pursue higher studies because of financial constraints. It has been running for the last several years where 120 daughters are trained and nurtured every year. Not only this, overwhelmed by the slogan of Modi’s Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao, his team is also offering martial arts training in many government schools of the city. Out of this, some of the girls have even won various medals in several state and national level competitions.

Sharma also provides free legal aid. Apart from this, they have also constructed toilets in government schools. His next mission is to repair the deteriorating environment of the city, for which he has already started working.

He is certainly making a difference through free healthcare, employment generation, education and self-defense training. This will make more and more students self-reliant.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/for-a-cause.html

205,16-1-20,Happiness is...a book fair,"The last day of the World Book Fair saw a huge rush of young and old crowd thronging the fair grounds to buy their favourite books as the 28th edition of this festival came to an end. The nine-day fair saw a footfall of more than ten lakh people in the fair grounds. Amidst all this rush, many programmes were also held at Pragati Maidan.

On the concluding day, a play in Maithili language, Ek Muthia, written by Dr Usha Kiran Khan was performed by Prakash Jha and his group. The play revolves around establishment of Gandhi Ashram at Darbhanga in 1919. The programme was organised by Maithili Machaanand National Book Trust, India.

A discussion on the book, Diabetes with Delight, authored by Dr Anoop Mishra was also organised by Bloomsbury Publishing at the author’s corner. Moderated by Praveen Mishra, the other speakers on the were Alok Mehta, Satyadev Pachauri and Suman Kumar. Alok Mehta remarked that this book is a primer which contains all the information that any patient of diabetes will ever need. Dr Anoop Mishra said that he has tried to fill the gaps and voids of the problem of diabetes that people face by providing extra information that will help in rarest situations.

A discussion on “Historical and Mythological Fiction” was organised by Readomania. Moderated by Dipankar Mukherjee, the other panelists on the occasion included Sutapa Basu and Pranab Mullick, well known authors of historical and mythological fiction.

Pranav Mullick focusing on his book From Kanha to Krishna, said that Lord Krishna took a form of a human being and destined his journey to kill Kansa. He added that he has been entrapped by many mythological loops and queries and looks forward to writing more exciting books.

A session on “Women’s writing” was also organised. The discussion focussed on the emergence of feminism in India. The speakers talked about the struggles that women face while making important decisions in their lives. On this occasion, women writers, Dr Harshali Singh, Anupama Jain and Tripti Sharan interacted with the visitors and shared their views on women writings.

A storytelling session on “The Little Girl” was organised at the Children’s Pavilion. Vikas Dave and Manjri Shukla interacted with the children and narrated interesting stories. Through them, they tried to highlight the struggles that a girl child often faces.

A skit on “Pradushanki Samasya,” was organised by Chetna India. The event began with Rishabh, a student affiliated to Chetna India singing a traditional folk song, while Pulkit Jain narrated a story.

206,16-1-20,The first wealth is health,"In a clear indication of achieving significant progress, Jammu and Kashmir has shown considerable improvement in public health parameters against the corresponding national average for the last few years.

According to the recently released state wise fact sheet by National Health Systems Resource Centre (NHSRC) on the basis of National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 75th round report, J&K has significantly improved its performance in outpatient care, in-patient care, child birth, Antenatal Care (ANC), Post Natal Care (PNC) by utilising its existing Public Health Facilities and Out Of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE).

As per the highlights of the report, all women in Jammu and Kashmir are availing Antenatal Care Services (ANC), out of which 80 to 92 per cent services are being provided by public health facilities, which is higher than the national average. The trend of availing Post Natal Care (PNC) has also increased from 81 to 99 per cent and there is significant increase in utilisation of public health facilities for availing PNC services from 60 to 97 percent since 2014.

Over 96 per cent Inpatient Department (IPD) care in rural areas of J&K is provided by public health facilities, which is highest against the country’s average of 85 percent.

In 2016, according to the data released by the Registrar General of India custodian of census data, Jammu and Kashmir has surpassed Kerala with the highest life expectancy in India for all ages, barring life expectancy at birth. Pointing towards good health seeking behaviour, J&K has emerged as one of the top performers in terms of the utilisation of the Public health facilities, as 80 per cent people avail OPD services from there, especially in rural areas, showing a 15 to 30 per cent increase in OPD cases in the last few years. “Home deliveries and private sector deliveries have significantly decreased since 2014 with only 10 to 15 percent taking place in private health facilities,” the report stated.

According to the report, the Out Of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) per OPD patient in public and private facilities has significantly decreased in both rural and urban areas since 2014, besides the percentage of diagnostic and drug expenditure as a proportion of IPD medical expenditure has also decreased.

For tackling the issue of OOPE and fulfilling the commitment to make the healthcare services cashless in public health facilities, J&K government is implementing various interventions in mission mode, like streamlining the procurement of drugs and consumables, implementation of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana through public and empanelled private hospitals for providing cashless IPD services to the golden card holders and operationalisation of health and wellness centres under Ayushman Bharat, free drug and diagnostic initiatives, Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, Biomedical Equipment Management and Maintenance Program and National Pradhan Mantri Dialysis Programme.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-first-wealth-is-health-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-first-wealth-is-health.html

208,16-1-20,Trophy wars,"While selections tread the familiar biases, nomination of Netflix’s films may be the clutter-breaker

Upping its game from 15 last year, Netflix dominated the 2020 Oscar nominations by snagging 24 total nods, the most of any other studio. The Irishman led the way with 10 nominations, while Marriage Story got six.

Then there were others as well The Two Popes, the documentary American Factory and the animated series I Lost My Body which ensured that the Netflix juggernaut beat its closest competitor Sony, which earned 20 nominations in total.

Netflix also beat Disney, whose blockbuster hit Frozen II was not nominated in the animated category, which shocked fans and critics alike.

The OTT has been upping its game and spent a record $15 billion on original film and TV content in 2019. The Irishman is the platform’s biggest bet, with reported production costs north of $160 million though it scored only one win at this year’s Golden Globes despite 17 nominations.

Another notable trend in the 2020 Oscar nomination was the lack of diversity. Actor Issa Rae was ready with her quip, as if she had predicted the Oscar nominations. “Congratulations to those men,” she said dryly, as the best director nominees — yes, five men — were announced.

Rae’s expertly thrown comment echoed through social media as observers took stock of what was, yet again, a pretty bad day for diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. Not only were there no female nominees in directing for the 87th time in Oscar history — a direct snub to Greta Gerwig, director of the acclaimed Little Women, as well as several other worthy candidates. There was also only one person of colour, Cynthia Erivo, among the 20 acting nominees.

Those slights overshadowed the happier news across all categories, a record 62 women (about a third of nominees) made the cut. They also had people asking: Why is this happening again, when diversity has been on the front burner for years now, and the academy has taken steps to overhaul its overwhelmingly white, male membership? And what will it take to accomplish real change? “So here we are again,” said Stacy L Smith, director of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, of the nominations. She said the results were particularly frustrating because 2019 was a breakout year for female directors. “They were out in strong numbers. This was the year of the highest percentage of female directors that we’ve seen. And yet they’re not allowed to be lauded by these cultural institutions for their directing prowess,” she said.

In terms of race and ethnicity, there was disappointment that only Erivo’s nomination for Harriet prevented an entirely white slate in all four categories — a scenario that first happened in 2015, resulting in the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag and again in 2016. The Academy sought thereafter to diversify ranks. Since 2015, the group’s overall female membership has grown from 25 to 32 per cent and overall membership of people of colour has doubled from eight to 16 per cent.

Erivo, a double nominee for both, best actress and best original song, said in an interview from Japan that she hoped this year would be a “stepping stone to opening the doors” to honouring the work of a more diverse group of artists. She paid special tribute to “so much good work specifically by women” like Gerwig and other female directors who were overlooked.

Gil Robertson, president of the African American Film Critics Association, said he wished the acting nominations had been more diverse, but he felt hopeful they were more of a blip than a slide backwards. “I think we’re making strides in the right direction,” he said.

Among the most glaring snubs was that of Jennifer Lopez, who had been seen as a sure-shot nominee for a supporting actress role for playing a stripper in Hustlers. In the lead actress category, Awkwafina, who a week ago won a Golden Globe, was denied a nod for her role in The Farewell. She would have become just the second Asian American nominated for best actress (the first, 1936 nominee Merle Oberon, hid her South Asian heritage). The omission was a reflection of the difficulty Asian Americans in Hollywood have long had in cracking the acting categories in particular.

“It’s been a long, slow battle,” said Chris Tashima, an actor-director and a member of the Academy Asians Action Committee, an informal group of Asian and Pacific Islander members of the Academy. “We’ve been very much absent. We’ve been trying to create opportunities for years. But you can’t even get nominated if you don’t get the roles.” Tashima added, though, that progress is happening, albeit slowly — with television leading the way in terms of new opportunities. “It’s night and day from five years ago,” he said.

Smith said: “Research globally suggests that when people think “manager,” they think male. We found the exact same thing with directors...The research is very clear. Women aren’t being considered for top leadership positions, and when they are, they are often criticised more sharply. We’re seeing that playing out right now in the awards process.”

Coming to the less controversial ones, there is Randy Newman who won two Oscars for best original song in the past — If I Didn’t Have You from Monsters, Inc and We Belong Together from Toy Story 3. It is a double nominee this year. He’s up for best original score with Marriage Story and best original song with I Can’t Let You Throw Yourself Away from Toy Story 4, which is also up for best animated feature film.

Frozen 2 didn’t make it in the animated category, but the Lopez’s song from the film, Into the Unknown, is nominated for best original song.

Erivo follows in the footsteps of Lady Gaga and Mary J Blige — stars who were nominated for both acting and music trophies in the same year at the Academy Awards. Erivo shares her best original song nomination for Stand Up from Harriet with Joshuah Brian Campbell and the bid brings her closer to EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards) status since she’s already won an Emmy, Grammy and Tony for her work in Broadway’s The Color Purple.

However, Beyoncé’s Spirit from The Lion King didn’t roar loud enough. The song didn’t earn a nomination for best original song, though Randy Newman, Elton John and the husband-wife duo Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez have a shot at winning another Oscar for songwriting.

The five nominees for best original song are Diane Warren, earning her 11th bid with no wins and Cynthia Erivo, who also picked up a nomination for best actress for Harriet.

Warren could finally win an Oscar with her 11th try: She’s nominated for I’m Standing with You from the Christian drama Breakthrough. The song is performed by the film’s star, This Is Us actor Chrissy Metz.

Nominees for best original score include Alexandre Desplat for Little Women, Thomas Newman for 1917, John Williams for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Hildur Guðnadóttir for Joker. If Guðnadóttir wins, she could the first woman to do so since Anne Dudley picked up best original score for The Full Monty at the 1998 academy awards.

Apart from all this the nomination for a Brazilian documentary about the impeachment of then President Dilma Rousseff has laid bare the polarisation of Latin America’s largest democracy. In The Edge of Democracy, 36-year-old filmmaker Petra Costa uses her personal story to argue that Brazil’s democracy is at risk after the abrupt end to the government led by the leftist workers’ party between 2003 and 2016.

Leftists argue the accusation of fiscal manipulation of the budget against Dilma Vana Rousseff, the former Brazilian President, is not a crime and not an impeachable offense. Right-wingers insist that is the case, and some of them argue there were enough problems in her administration to do away with it anyway.

The other films nominated for best documentary are American Factory, The Cave, For Sama and Honeyland.

Here are the reactions from some of the nominees for the academy awards:

“Ultimately, I’ve been fortunate enough to get to work with some great filmmakers. It has always been the driving force. First, of course, the story and character, from an actor’s perspective. I feel like we see films through the eyes of the director. (It is) The director’s medium. I’ve been able to work with some amazing directors. Quentin (Tarantino) is in the lineage of one of the best of our times. It’s amazing to be a part of this film that’s a celebration of our actors and the countless people behind the scenes,” — Leonardo DiCaprio, nominated for best actor for his role in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, which was nominated in just about every category including best film, directing and supporting actor and screenplay.

“It makes me feel very, very, very young.” — Antonio Banderas, about being a first-time nominee at the age of 59. He earned the best actor nomination for his role in Pain and Glory.

“I feel a little giddy. It’s so crazy. I was on a plane to Japan, so I found out after everyone else did. I was able to log into Wifi and suddenly my phone started going crazy, with all the messages coming in. I had to recalibrate my entire brain...I don’t think I expected any of it. To actually have realised it is just a dream. I actually had a dream where there were no nominations.” — Cynthia Erivo, a double nominee for her acting and singing in Harriet.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trophy-wars-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trophy-wars.html

The tournament’s organising committee, as well as the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot), revealed that the tournament will be played from January 9 to February 6, 2021 after a meeting with Confederation of African Football (CAF) chief Ahmad Ahmad in Yaounde.

A statement published on the CAF’s website said organisers had asked for the dates to be changed because of “the unfavourable weather conditions during the period initially scheduled”.

The tournament was moved to a June-July slot for last year’s first 24-team edition in Egypt, in large part to avoid clashing with the European club season.

However, the change may not be viewed so positively by leading European clubs, who now risk losing key players to the competition for up to five weeks midway through next season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/afcon-2021-to-be-played-in-jan.html
210,16-1-20,Lukaku can't stop scoring,"Romelu Lukaku scored after just 21 seconds as he bagged a brace in a 4-1 thumping of Cagliari that fired Inter Milan into the last eight of the Italian Cup, while Lazio and Napoli are set for a quarter-final clash after easing past second-tier opposition.

Belgian Lukaku has looked a player reborn since moving to Italy and his double took his hot streak to six goals in his last four appearances in all competitions, with his Serie A tally standing at 14 in 19 games.

“Inter was the best choice for me, here I can grow as a player and help the club go after its goals,” Lukaku told broadcaster RAI.

“I give everything for the team and that’s how I play — that’s what the fans like.”

The 26-year-old lashed home his opener with the match barely underway and then, after Borja Valero had made it 2-0 in the 22 minute, headed home his side's third from Nicolo Barella's corner just three minutes after the break as Antonio Conte’s side ran riot at the San Siro.

Their were nerves among the home fans when Christian Oliva pulled one back for the Sardinians in the 73rd minute with a fierce drive, but Andrea Ranocchia headed in Cristiano Biraghi's corner to seal the win.

The victory helped Inter bounce back after letting Juventus take top spot in Serie A with a 1-1 home draw with Atalanta at the weekend, and the return of Alexis Sanchez after an injury lay-off will also boost coach Conte.

Inter will face either Atalanta or Fiorentina in the next round.

Lazio stroll

They will be joined in the quarters by Lazio and Napoli, who both cruised through with comfortable wins over second-tier sides Cremonese and Perugia to set up a mouth-watering last eight tie with each other.

Holders Lazio, who are on a club-record run of 10 straight wins in Serie A and well in the title discussion, made short work of Cremonese in their easy 4-0 victory in Rome.

The hosts were ahead in less than 10 minutes in front of a sparse crowd at the Stadio Olimpico thanks to Patric, who tapped home the opener after Cremonese stopper Michael Agazzi palmed the ball to him in the box, and the tie was done and dusted 16 minutes later when Marco Parolo bundled home the second from a Jony cross.

Simone Inzaghi made eight changes from the side that beat Napoli 1-0 at the weekend but kept Saturday's goalscorer Ciro Immobile, who took his tally to 23 in all competitions from the penalty spot 12 minutes after the break.

The impressive Jony turned provider again for the goal that rounded off the scoring, his fizzing cross from a set-piece being met with Bastos' bullet header in the final minute.

Troubled Napoli meanwhile are languishing in 11th in Serie A after winning just one league game since mid-October but eased into the quarters with a 2-0 win over Perugia thanks to two Lorenzo Insigne penalties.

Insigne struck the opening goal from the spot on 26 minutes after Mexico’s Hirving Lozano went down inside the area under a challenge from Mardochee Nzita.

The Italy international added a second when Pietro Iemmello handled at a corner, with a penalty awarded following a VAR review.

Napoli goalkeeper David Ospina, whose blunder proved costly in their league loss at Lazio, then saved an Iemmello penalty before half-time following another VAR intervention.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lukaku-can-t-stop-scoring.html
211,16-1-20,Fit-again Prithvi set to join Ind A,"Young opener Prithvi Shaw will join the India A squad in New Zealand in the next 48 hours, having recovered from the shoulder injury he sustained during a Ranji Trophy game last week.

Unlike recent times, Prithvi’s rehabilitation programme was handled by the National Cricket Academy (NCA) which has cleared his return to competitive cricket.

“Prithvi Shaw will leave for New Zealand either on Thursday or latest by Friday. He has been declared fully fit,” a senior BCCI source told PTI on Wednesday.

The 20-year-old return to competitive fold will give the national selectors an opportunity to consider him for the two Tests against New Zealand.

A source said both Prithviu and Shubhman Gill will now compete for the slot of reserve opener in Indian Test team.

“Shubman became the reserve opener because Prithvi was serving doping ban. He was ahead of Shubman if we go by pecking order. He was not out of the team because of poor form but due to injuries and some off-field reasons. Now he along with Shubman will be fighting for the reserve opener’s slot,” a source privy to selection matters said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/fit-again-prithvi-set-to-join-ind-a.html
212,16-1-20,Rohit best in One Days,"Sharma's stellar 2019 performance earns him ICC ODI Cricketer of the year award; Stokes takes top prize

India’s swashbuckling opener Rohit Sharma was on Wednesday named the ICC’s ‘2019 ODI Cricketer of the Year’ for his incredible run of form, while English all-rounder Ben Stokes walked away with the overall honours.

Indian skipper Virat Kohli was named captain of both the ICC’s Test and ODI teams of the year besides winning the ‘Spirit of Cricket’ award for his gesture of trying to stop the fans from booing Steve Smith during a World Cup match. Smith was returning to international cricket from a one-year suspension for ball-tampering at that time.

England’s World Cup-winning all-rounder Stokes got the biggest prize — the ‘Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy’ for Player of the Year, while Australia fast bowler Pat Cummins was named the Test Player of the Year.

India seamer Deepak Chahar won the T20 International Performance of the Year, Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne was named as Emerging Cricketer of the Year, while Scotland’s Kyle Coetzer was declared the Associate Cricketer of the Year.

The 32-year-old Rohit hit a purple patch in the World Cup amassing 648 runs in nine games at an average of 81.00 with five hundreds and a half-century. In the United Kingdom, he became the first batsman in World Cup history to score five centuries in a single edition.

Rohit looked forward to carrying his form in the coming year, after an aggregate of 1409 runs from 28 matches with seven hundreds in the ODI format.

“It is great to be recognised in this fashion. We are very happy with the way we performed as a team in 2019. We could have done better but we have a lot of positives and a lot to look forward to in 2020,” Rohit said.

India captain Kohli was surprised to win the Spirit of Cricket Award and explained his reasons for backing Smith the way he did.

“It is part of camaraderie that sportsmen must have with each other,” Kohli said.

“That moment was purely understanding an individual’s situation. I don’t think a guy who is coming out of a situation like that needs to be taken advantage of,” he recalled.

“You can sledge, can have have banter on the field, you say things to the opposition in wanting to beat them. But booing someone is not in the spirit of any sport, I don’t endorse it.”

Chahar said his haul of six for seven against Bangladesh in Nagpur, which included a hat-trick, would always be cherished by him.

“Taking six wickets conceding only seven runs was a dream performance for me and will always remain close to my heart,” Chahar said.

Cummins grabbed 59 wickets in 12 Test matches during the period and finished the year as the top-ranked bowler in the Test rankings.

“It’s a tremendous honour to be considered the best player of last year and one which was certainly unexpected. I owe much to my team, team-mates and all those involved in Australian cricket for what was a really successful year for the team,” he said.

Stokes was rewarded after a fabulous 12 months that saw him play a decisive role in England’s dramatic victory at the World Cup final along with a host of other memorable performances, including an epic Ashes hundred.

“This award is testament to my teammates and the support staff that have been there every step of the way. Fundamentally, without the support of these individuals, we would never achieved our objective of lifting a major trophy,” he said.

Labuschagne was an easy winner of the Emerging Player award after scoring 1,104 runs in 11 Tests, which saw him zoom in the ICC Test Player Rankings from 110 at the start of the year to fourth by the end of the year.

England umpire Richard Illingworth became the seventh person to win the David Shepherd Trophy for Umpire of the Year.

Sania and Kichenok defeated the American duo of Vania King and Christina McHale 6-2 4-6 10-4 in a contest that lasted one hour and 24 minutes.

215,16-1-20,"Bhuvneshwar undergoes sports hernia surgery in London, rehab in NCA","Injury-plagued Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has undergone a sports hernia surgery in London and will begin his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after returning to the country, the BCCI said on Thursday.

The Board did not specify any timeline for his recovery but it is learnt that he will return to action during the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is scheduled to start on March 29. Bhuvneshwar plays for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the T20 event.

""Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar travelled to London on 9th January and underwent a successful sports hernia surgery on 11th January. He was assisted by Team India physiotherapist Yogesh Parmar,"" read a statement from Board Secretary Jay Shah.

""Bhuvneshwar will now return to India and commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru,"" it added.

He was not named in the T20 squad for the upcoming tour of New Zealand due to the injury.

The 29-year-old, who has played 21 Tests, 114 ODIs and 43 T20Is for India, missed the home ODI series against the West Indies days after returning to action against the same opposition in the T20 format.

Last year, Bhuvneshwar claimed 33 ODI wickets from 33 matches, while his 17 T20 appearances fetched him 18 scalps.

Also, as reported by PTI on Wednesday, the BCCI said young batsman Prithvi Shaw has left for New Zealand to join the India A team after completing his rehabilitation for a shoulder injury.

""Opening batsman Prithvi Shaw has completed his rehab at the NCA and has recovered from his left shoulder injury. He has been made available for selection for all formats of the game. Prithvi has left for New Zealand and will soon join India A,"" the Board statement read.

217,16-1-20,ABD keen to make SA comeback,"AB de Villiers will be welcomed back into the South African team ahead of the T20 World Cup, captain Faf du Plessis said on Wednesday.

Batting star De Villiers, who retired from international cricket in 2018, was quoted on an Australian website on Tuesday as saying he was keen to return.

He said he had been talking with former captain Graeme Smith, South Africa’s interim director of cricket, as well as coach Mark Boucher and Du Plessis.

Speaking on the eve of South Africa's third Test against England, which starts on Thursday, Du Plessis hinted that De Villiers's return was almost a done deal, although both De Villiers and South African assistant coach Enoch Nkwe have emphasised that it is far from finalised.

He made himself available for the one-day World Cup last year, only to be rejected, with officials saying he left it too late and calling him up would be unfair to other players.

De Villiers 'keen'

Du Plessis first revealed last month that he had been talking to his one-time schoolmate, who is among the world's most in-demand T20 players.

“It’s the same as what I mentioned before,” said Du Plessis.

“We spoke and I was very keen to have him back even before the new coaching staff was on board.""

Now it seems the team's senior management are similarly keen.

“It was a process of what does the next year look like in terms of T20 cricket,” said Du Plessis.

“How many games, where, when, what? And then try to unfold that in a way that he can come back.

“He’s keen to come back. I don’t know when.

“In an ideal world, we would like to make sure we can play our best 11, 12, 13 players for a few games or in a few series leading up to a T20 World Cup.”

Du Plessis said he did not want a repeat of what he said happened ahead of last year's 50-overs World Cup when combinations were not settled before the tournament.

“There was a search to find the players and the combinations. I would like to settle into that combination a little earlier so the guys can play as many games as possible together,” he said.

De Villiers is currently playing in Australia’s Big Bash League, which ends on February 8, and is committed to playing in the Indian Premier League from March 29 to May 24.

South Africa have three T20 international series ahead of the World Cup in October and November.

They play three home matches against England from February 12, followed immediately by three against Australia. They are also scheduled to play a five-match T20 series in the West Indies in August.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/abd-keen-to-make-sa-comeback.html
218,16-1-20,Mou makes 1st move,"Portugal midfielder Gedson Fernandes became the first signing of the Jose Mourinho era at Tottenham on Wednesday as the manager bids to revive the club’s Premier League campaign.

The 21-year-old signed an 18-month loan deal with an option to make the transfer permanent for a reported £56 million ($73 million).

Fernandes will provide vital cover in midfield following a three-month lay-off for Moussa Sissoko, who has had knee surgery.

“We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for the 18-month loan of Gedson Fernandes from Benfica with an option to make the transfer permanent,” said a club statement.

Fernandes, capped twice at senior level, told Spurs TV he was looking forward to working with compatriot Mourinho.

“All young players want to work with Jose Mourinho because he’s one of the best. All of us as players want to stay near the best, so it’s fantastic to work with him.”

“I have no words to say about the stadium because it is fantastic,"" he added. ""I have never been or seen anything like this, It is unbelievable.”

Fernandes was offered to Spurs by Mourinho’s friend and super agent Jorges Mendes and they beat off competition from West Ham, who were keen to bring him to London.

The potential reported fee would mark a huge mark-up from the 250 euros ($278) and 25 footballs Benfica reportedly gave to Fernandes’ club, Frielas, when he was 10.

Mourinho will be hoping that more arrivals may follow, particularly a striker following Harry Kane’s potentially season-ending hamstring injury, with the club eighth in the Premier League, nine points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.

The club are understood to be interested in AC Milan’s Krzysztof Piatek while Christian Benteke, Edison Cavani and even former striker Fernando Llorente have been linked.

There could also be departures at Spurs this month, with Kyle Walker-Peters hoping to join Crystal Palace on loan while the club are trying to offload Christian Eriksen in order to get a fee for him",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mou-makes-1st-move.html
219,16-1-20,Dhawan ready to bat anywhere,"Regular India opener Shikhar Dhawan says he is ready to bat anywhere after skipper Virat Kohli’s move to drop himself down at No. 4 to accommodate him and K L Rahul backfired in the first ODI against Australia.

The visitors crushed India by 10 wickets in the first of the three-match series, chasing down a 256-run target with plenty to spare here on Tuesday.

“If they ask me to bat at No.3, of course I’ll do it. Anything for my country, for sure,” Dhawan said after the game in which K L Rahul came in at the critical position.

“You have to be mentally strong, all the boys are mentally strong, that’s why they’ve been playing international cricket and it’s part of the journey, sometimes you’ve to switch numbers as well.”

The senior player said it was completely the captain’s decision to drop himself down at No.4 from his usual No.3 slot.

“See that is a captain’s choice, KL is batting well, he did well in the last series and he played really well.

“I feel it is the captain’s choice where he wants to play and he has done amazing at No. 3, maybe I feel, he will think about it to go at number three again,” he said.

After the game, Kohli said he might have to rethink his plans going into the second and third ODIs.

Dhawan blamed the loss of four wickets in the middle overs for the mauling.

David Warner and Aaron Finch slammed unbeaten tons to power the visitors to a convincing win at the Wankhede Stadium.

“We handled those first 10-15 overs very nicely. We lost four wickets in a go, that is where the game changed for us, then we were behind and then we were trying to cover it, so that is where we went wrong,” said Dhawan, who made 74 off 91 balls, said.

Australia pulled things back to bowl India out for 255 and Warner (128 not out) and Finch (110) then did the rest.

India lost five quick wickets after Dhawan and K L Rahul (47) added 121 for the second wicket.

“K L (Rahul) got out. That time we planned to accelerate and those four wickets we lost, that’s where we lost the momentum. We were targeting 300 runs but we ended up scoring less runs. In bowling, we could not take early wickets. They outplayed us,” admitted Dhawan.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhawan-ready-to-bat-anywhere.html
220,16-1-20,Sindhu advances to second round,"World champion P V Sindhu advanced to the second round of the Indonesia Master with a hard-earned victory over Japan’s Aya Ohori but defending champion Saina Nehwal suffered a shock exit from the Super 500 tournament, here on Wednesday.

It was also curtains for world championships Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth, Kidambi Srikanth and Sourabh Verma.

The fifth seed Sindhu clawed back from a game down to notch up a 14-21, 21-15, 21-11 victory over Ohori.

Sindhu has never lost to the world No.20 Japanese in their 10 meetings so far. Ohori had lost to the Indian last week in the second round of the Malaysia Masters.

The 24-year-old will take on Japan’s Sayaka Takahashi, who defeated Saina, in the second round.

Saina, who won this tournament last year before going through a lean patch, lost 21-19, 13-21, 5-21 to Takahashi in a gruelling 50-minute contest.

The London Olympics Bronze medallist had reached the quarterfinals of the Malaysia Masters last week.

World No.12 Srikanth went down to local favourite Shesar Hiren Rhustavito 21-18, 12-21, 14-21 in a match that lasted one hour and three minutes.

This was Srikanth’s second consecutive opening-round defeat this season. He had earlier also made a first-round exit from the Malaysia Masters.

Praneeth, who like Srikanth had also been ousted in the opening round of the Malaysia Masters, lost to the eighth seeded Chinese Shi Yu Qi 21-16, 18-21, 10-21. Sourabh lost 21-17, 15-21, 10-21 to China’s Lu Guang Zu.

222,16-1-20,Spurs reach FA Cup fourth round,"Tottenham edged into the FA Cup fourth round as Giovani Lo Celso bagged a rare goal in their 2-1 win over Middlesbrough, while much-maligned Newcastle striker Joelinton scored for the first time since August in a victory against Rochdale on Tuesday.

Jose Mourinho’s side almost killed off second-tier Middlesbrough within the first 15 minutes of the third round replay at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Lo Celso, on loan from Real Betis, got Tottenham up and running with only his second goal of the season and his first since a Champions League strike against Red Star Belgrade in November.

It was an encouraging moment for the Argentine midfielder, who has endured a difficult season in north London.

Tottenham needed a Lucas Moura equaliser at the Riverside Stadium to avoid a shock exit in the 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough earlier this month.

But Mourinho still made five changes from last weekend’s defeat against Liverpool, with Christian Eriksen, linked with a January move to Inter Milan, starting despite the Dane’s form being affected by the transfer talk.

A gift from Middlesbrough keeper Tomas Mejias helped Tottenham open the scoring in the second minute.

Mejias tried to play a quick ball out and ended up passing straight to Lo Celso, who ran across the area before firing into the bottom corner.

Tottenham’s second came when Argentina winger Erik Lamela sliced through the Middlesbrough defence before slotting home in the 15th minute.

223,16-1-20,"Stokes will be key again, says Du Plessis","Rival captains Faf du Plessis and Joe Root were united in their praise of World Player of the Year Ben Stokes ahead of the third Test between South Africa and England starting at St George's Park on Thursday.

Stokes, man of the match when England levelled the four-match series with a 189-run win in the second Test in Cape Town, was named the world’s best player by the International Cricket Council on Tuesday. He is likely to be a key player in a pivotal match in the series.

“It was very well-deserved,” said South African captain Du Plessis. “He’s had a fantastic season where he played big moments really well. That’s when you really want to judge cricketers, when it really matters, and that’s why he has been so successful over the last year. He’s single-handedly won so many games for England.”

Du Plessis said Stokes had already made a mark on the current series. “He plays a big role, whether his team does well or not. For us, he is guy that we need to keep quiet because he’s that sort of player that takes the game away from you when he gets in, similar to what Quinton de Kock does for us.”

Unlike wicketkeeper De Kock, Stokes offers a strong bowling option. “He’s got a big tank,” said Du Plessis.

“England captain Joe Root added: “It’s hard to say any more superlatives. It’s the right decision, obviously. It couldn't really be anyone else the way he’s performed all year, across the formats.

“It’s just been fantastic to be a part of the same team. He’s affected games across all three formats. In my opinion he’s definitely the number one player in the world at the moment.”

Both captains said they were debating the final make-up of their teams.

Du Plessis said fast bowler Dane Paterson could make his debut on a pitch where reverse swing could be a factor. He said Paterson’s style of bowling could make him dangerous in the expected conditions - but added that it was a difficult choice, which would mean leaving out an all-rounder, probably Dwaine Pretorius, or left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.

He said weather conditions could play a role in the final decision. “It’s been hot the last few days. You need hot and dry weather for reverse swing but there’s talk of some rain on days three and four so that could affect it.”

Root said Jofra Archer and Mark Wood would be assessed after Wednesday’s final practice.

Unlike Du Plessis, Root said he was not contemplating going into the match without a spin bowler. “I’m pretty happy with the balance of our team,” he said.

That would leave room for only one of Archer and Wood to replace the injured James Anderson - or the steady Chris Woakes if there were doubts about both the speedsters. “We need to use today’s session to make sure going into a five-day game that they can stand up to it,” said Root.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stokes-will-be-key-again--says-du-plessis.html

Railway officials had earlier said that 25 passengers were injured in the incident but later officers who reached the site reported that four passengers were found to have suffered major injuries and 11 had received minor injuries.

Passengers with major injuries have been sent to Cuttack Medical College.All passengers are stated to be out of danger.

225,16-1-20,Dhoni dropped from BCCI's central contracts list,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni was on Thursday dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on the future of the former India captain who has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand last year.

The BCCI announced the central contracts for the period of October 2019 to September 2020. Dhoni was in the A category, which fetches a player Rs 5 crore, until last year.

Skipper Virat Kohli, his white-ball deputy Rohit Sharma and top pacer Jasprit Bumrah were retained in the highest A+ bracket of Rs 7 crore. Among others, batsman K L Rahul has been promoted from B grade to A.

Dhoni's contract not being renewed is not exactly a surprise as he has not played a competitive game since that World Cup semifinal on July 9. He has been on an sabbatical and has refused to divulge his future plans.

Head coach Ravi Shastri had recently said that Dhoni may soon end his ODI career but could be in contention for a spot in the T20 World Cup squad provided he does well in the IPL.

Test opener Mayank Agarwal, who has done well since making his debut during the tour of Australia in 2018-19, has been included in the list in Grade B, which also features Hardik Pandya and Yuzvendra Chahal along with two others.

Pacer Navdeep Saini and T20 specialist Washington Sundar are new entrants in Grade C alongside Shreyas Iyer, Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur.

The dropped list also includes the retired Ambati Rayudu and Dinesh Karthik.

Outgoing chief selector MSK Prasad has already made his stance clear on Dhoni, saying the World Cup-winning captain can only be selected again on the basis of performances.

While Dhoni has not revealed anything about his future, he is very much expected to captain Chennai Super Kings in the 2020 IPL.

Since the World Cup, he has missed the tour of the West Indies and the home series against South Africa, Bangladesh, the West Indies and the ongoing one against Australia.

One of the biggest names in Indian cricket, Dhoni led India to two world titles — the 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the 2011 ODI World Cup at home.

The veteran has played 90 Tests, 350 ODIs and 98 T20 Internationals for India, accumulating over 17,000 runs and effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.

BCCI Central Contracts for October 2019 to September 2020:

Grade A+: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah.

Grade A: Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, K L Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant.

Grade B: Wriddhiman Saha, Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Hardik Pandya, Mayank Agarwal.

Grade C: Kedar Jadhav, Navdeep Saini, Deepak Chahar, Manish Pandey, Hanuma Vihari, Shardul Thakur, Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-dropped-from-bcci-s-central-contracts-list-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/dhoni-dropped-from-bcci-s-central-contracts-list.html
226,16-1-20,Court directs Tihar authorities to file report on status of scheduled execution of Nirbhaya convicts,"A Delhi court Thursday directed Tihar jail authorities to file a proper report by Friday about the status of scheduled execution of convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora passed the directions after the jail authorities said they have written to the Delhi government on the issue of scheduled execution on January 22 in view of pending remedies.

The court was hearing a plea by one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Mukesh Kumar Singh, seeking postponement of the date of his execution on the ground that his mercy petition is pending with the President.

The lawyer appearing for Mukesh told the court that there are subsequent developments that necessitate setting aside the death warrants.

Mukesh's counsel moved the trial court immediately after the Delhi High Court declined to entertain his plea to set aside the January 7 order issuing his death warrant and asked them to approach the lower court.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.

Pakistan has repeatedly tried to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council with China's help, but it failed again to find any support. The latest attempt failed as other countries of the 15-member council felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

The overwhelming majority of the UNSC was of view that it was not the right forum for such issues, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said at a briefing when asked about the developments in the UNSC.

An attempt was made by Pakistan to misuse the UNSC, he said, adding that Islamabad has a choice to avoid such a global embarrassment in the future.

Pakistan's attempt to peddle baseless allegations and show an alarming scenario failed as it lacked credibility, he said.

On another question on whether Pakistan will be invited when India hosts the SCO heads of government meet this year, Kumar said all eight member countries and four observers will be invited.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-should-reflect-on-global-consensus--refrain-from-such-actions--mea-on-unsc-move-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/china-should-reflect-on-global-consensus--refrain-from-such-actions--mea-on-unsc-move.html

Sisodia's retort came hours after Union minister Prakash Javadekar blamed the AAP government's ""negligence"" for the ""delay"" in the hanging of the four convicts, saying it took more than two-and-a-half years for the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation to give notice to the rapists after the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the death sentence in 2017.

Terming it ""unfortunate"" that such a senior member of the Union Cabinet was ""lying"" on such a sensitive matter, the Delhi deputy chief minister said that he understands that the BJP ""does not have issues to raise"" in the upcoming polls but it does not mean that ""they would do politics on such issues"".

""Javadekar ji the police is under you, the responsibility of law and order is under you, the Home Ministry is under you, the Tihar DG and administration are under you and you are blaming us? Please don't stoop so low on a sensitive issue. This is a clear attempt to instigate people,"" he said.

""I want to ask you (Javadekar) why are you not taking responsibility. If you are not able to handle law and order of Delhi, give us Delhi police and law and order responsibility for two days and we will hang Nirbhaya convicts,"" Sisodia told reporters.

The AAP government told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday that Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Gupta (25) -- the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case -- will not be hanged on January 22 as scheduled because one of them has moved a mercy plea and according to the prison rules, they cannot be executed till they exhaust all of their remedies under the law.

The four rapists were to be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail. A Delhi court had issued their death warrants on January 7.

As authorities and the victim's mother contended that the four men were ""frustrating"" and ""intentionally"" delaying the legal process by filing curative and mercy pleas in stages to postpone their execution, the Delhi government recommended rejecting Mukesh Kumar Singh's mercy plea to the President and forwarded it to the Lieutenant Governor.

Sisodia told reporters that the action was taken at ""lightning speed"".

The Delhi government and prison authorities had told a bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal that under the prison rules, if death sentence has been awarded to more than one person in a case and if only one of them moves a mercy plea, the execution of the others too has to be postponed till the plea is decided.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/give-us-delhi-police-for-2-days--we-will-hang-nirbhaya-convicts--dy-cm-sisodia-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/give-us-delhi-police-for-2-days--we-will-hang-nirbhaya-convicts--dy-cm-sisodia.html

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said all eight member countries, four observers and dialogue partners of the grouping will be invited for the meeting.

""The meeting is held annually at the prime minister's level and it discusses the SCO's programme and multilateral economic and trade cooperation,"" he said at a media briefing.

""As per the established practice and procedure within SCO, all 8 members of SCO, as well as 4 observer states and other international dialogue partners will be invited to attend the meeting,"" Kumar said when asked whether Pakistan Prime Minister Khan will be sent an invitation to the meeting.

When asked specifically whether Khan will be invited, another official said, ""yes"".

For the first time, India will host the annual meeting of the council of heads of government of the SCO, the bloc's Secretary General Vladimir Norov said on Monday.

The government's announcement on inviting Pakistan to the mega event came in the midst of frayed ties between the two countries over India's withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories.

India and Pakistan became full members of the China-dominated grouping in 2017.

Usually, the heads of government meeting of the SCO are represented by foreign ministers while a number of countries send their prime ministers also.

India has always been represented by the external affairs minister in the heads of government meeting while the SCO heads of state summit is attended by the prime minister.

Kumar said the event will be preceded by a number of meetings in India including one of the SCO ministers of economic activities.

India was an observer at the SCO since 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region.

231,16-1-20,Suspense on Nirbhaya convicts hanging,"HC angry as Delhi Govt, prison authorities say Jan 22 execution not possible due to pending mercy plea

The four convicts of Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case will not be hanged on January 22 as one of the convicts Mukesh Kumar moved the trial court pleading that his mercy petition is pending before the President of India.

The Delhi Government and prison authorities on Wednesday told a Bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal in the Delhi High Court that under the prison rules, if death sentence has been awarded to more than one person in a case and if only one of them moves a mercy plea, the execution of the others too has to be postponed till the plea is decided.

However, in a related but significant development, the High Court (HC) refused to stay the death warrant issued against the convicts Akshaya Thakur, Mukesh Kumar, Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta by the trial court on January 7.

The HC came down heavily upon the Delhi Government for sitting over the case for a year and doing nothing in issuing notice on the mercy plea of the convicts. The HC also pulled up the Delhi Government and Delhi prison authorities for the delay on their part in informing the convicts that they can move mercy pleas before the President.

The Bench said the notice ought to have been issued after the apex court’s May 5, 2017 judgement, instead it was issued on October 29, 2019 and December 18, 2019.

After the HC observation, the Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia sought to clear the air and said, “The Delhi Government has recommended rejecting the mercy plea filed by Mukesh, and forwarded it to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) at lightning speed”.

Incidentally, convicts Vinay and Mukesh have already exhausted curative petition remedy and two others — Pawan and Akshay — are yet to move the Supreme Court (SC) with this plea.

The Bench said, “Your rule is bad if you cannot take action till all the co-convicts have moved a mercy plea. It seems there has been non-application of mind (while framing the rules). The system is suffering from cancer.”

The court declined to interfere with the trial court’s January 7 order as sought by Mukesh, who contended that the order issuing death warrant be set aside as being un-executable as he has moved a mercy plea before the President.

The HC further said there is no error in the trial court’s decision as on that date, none of the convicts had moved a curative petition or a mercy plea. The Bench said if the convict wanted the date of execution to be set aside based on a subsequent event — moving of mercy plea — then “he must approach the court that passed the order.”

The Bench said it is of the opinion that once the SC dismissed his criminal appeal, review plea and curative petition and confirmed his death sentence, he cannot challenge the January 7 death warrant before the HC as the order did nothing but carry the apex court’s decision to its logical conclusion.

Following the HC’s stand, senior advocate Rebecca John and advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Mukesh, said they will withdraw the petition and move the sessions court bringing to its attention the subsequent developments. Granting them the liberty to move the trial court, the bench disposed of the plea.

During the hearing, the Bench said challenging the January 7 order before it amounted to playing one court against another.

It said the petitioner ought to have brought the subsequent events to the notice of the trial court or ought to have moved the apex court, which had finally confirmed the death sentence and also dismissed his curative petition.

“We feel this is a stratagem devised on how to prolong the matter, since you had time since May 5, 2017, when the apex court dismissed their appeals, to move a mercy plea or file a review or curative petition. Why did you wait till now? What restrained you from doing so? What prevented you?” said the Bench.

“The intent of the law is to give you reasonable amount of time to approach the court. Your time started ticking from May 5, 2017. Even after October 29, 2019 (when first notice was sent to the convicts informing them they can move mercy plea), you did nothing. You cannot wait for the co-convicts pleas to be decided, to move the courts,” the bench said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/suspense-on-nirbhaya-convicts-hanging-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/suspense-on-nirbhaya-convicts-hanging.html

235,16-1-20,PMC Bank scam: SC stays HC order allowing shifting of HDIL promoters from jail to their residence,"The Supreme Court on Thursday partially stayed the Bombay High Court order allowing shifting of HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, accused in the multi-crore Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam case, from Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail to their residence.

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobe and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant took note of the submissions of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the high court order to the extent of allowing their release from prison needed to be stayed.

The law officer said the other aspect of the high court order such as sale of assets of the accused promoters under the supervision of high court appointed committee should be allowed to remain operative and the sole objection was with regard to their release from Arthur road jail.

The top court agreed with the submissions.

Earlier during the day the apex court had agreed to consider the plea of enforcement agencies against the high court order to release them from jail and keeping them in their residence under the constant watch of prison guards.

Mehta mentioned before the bench that the PMC bank scam involved Rs 7000 crore and the high court had on Wednesday passed a very ""unusual order"" while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL).

Mehta told the bench that the father-son are presently lodged under Arthur Road jail in judicial custody and if they are shifted to their residence as per the high court's order, it would be like bail to them.

The high court had on Wednesday set up a three-member committee for valuating and sale of encumbered assets of Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) to expeditiously recover dues payable by the firm to PMC bank.

The high court had directed the superintendent of Arthur Road Jail to shift both the accused to their residence under the supervision of two jail guards to ensure their cooperation to the committee.

The high court had passed the order while hearing a PIL seeking direction for expeditious disposal of HDIL assets and properties attached by the Economic Offence Wing and the Enforcement Directorate and repaying PMC Bank depositors at the earliest.

The fraud at PMC Bank came to light in September last year after the Reserve Bank of India discovered that the bank had allegedly created fictitious accounts to hide over Rs 4,355 crore of loans extended to almost-bankrupt HDIL.

According to RBI, the PMC bank masked 44 problematic loan accounts, including those of HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system, and the accounts were accessible only to limited staff members.

Deora, who is the former Union minister, described Gandhi as a ""true patriot who never compromised on India's national security"".

Raut, whose party is part of the ruling alliance with the Congress and NCP in Maharashtra, on Wednesday claimed that Gandhi met Karim Lala in Mumbai.

Karim Lala was one of the three top underworld dons of Mumbai for over two decades, from the sixties to the early eighties, the other two being Mastan Mirza alias Haji Mastan and Varadarajan Mudaliar.

Deora said politicians should refrain from ""distorting"" legacies of prime ministers who are no more.

""Indira ji was a true patriot who never compromised on Indias national security,"" he said in a tweet.

""As former @INCMumbai President, I demand that @rautsanjay61 ji withdraws his ill-informed statement. Political leaders must show restraint before distorting the legacies of deceased Prime Ministers,"" Deora further tweeted.

Former Mumbai Congress chief Nirupam said Raut will ""repent"" if he continues a ""false campaign"" against Gandhi.

Noting that Raut often shares ""poetry of others"", Nirupam said it will be better if the Shiv Sena leader focuses on entertaining Maharashtra with such poetic stuff.

""It will be better if Shiv Sena's Mr Shayar (poet) focuses on entertaining Maharashtra by sharing light-hearted poetry of others. He will have to repent if he carries out false campaign against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhiji. He should withdraw the statement he gave about Indiraji yesterday,"" Nirupam tweeted in Hindi.

China has demanded discussion on Kashmir during a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Wednesday, but the request is likely to be rejected as other member countries of the global organisation are set to oppose it.

The current move by China is third such attempt since August when the special status granted to Jammu & Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the Government, and the State was bifurcated into two Union Territories.

French diplomatic sources said France has noted the request of a UNSC member to raise the Kashmir issue once again in the powerful body and it is going to oppose it like it did on a previous occasion.

The closed-door meeting of the UNSC has been called to discuss an issue relating to Mali, an African country and China has made a request to discuss the Kashmir issue under the agenda of “Any Other Business Points”.

Asserting that France’s position has not changed and it is very clear that the Kashmir issue must be settled bilaterally (between India and Pakistan), French sources said this has been stated on several occasions, and it will continued to be reiterated to partners in the UN Security Council.

This is the third time, China, Pakistan’s ‘all-weather ally’, has demanded discussion on the Kashmir issue.

In August, China pushed for a UNSC meeting on Kashmir after the Government scrapped J&K’s special status. However, the meeting did not yield desired results for China as the member-states maintained that India’s move was an internal issue.

Last month, France, the US, the UK and Russia had foiled an attempt by China to discuss Kashmir at a closed-door meeting of the UNSC.

China has been critical of India’s reorganisation of J-K, and has particularly criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory. China lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.

India’s decisions on Kashmir had also cast a shadow over Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in October for the second informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, notwithstanding the acrimony over the issue between the two countries, Modi and Xi held “successful” talks in the ancient coastal town of Mamallapura, signalling a recalibration of bilateral ties.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-makes-fresh-pitch-to-raise-kashmir-in-unsc-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/china-makes-fresh-pitch-to-raise-kashmir-in-unsc.html
240,16-1-20,I eat just 7 dinner meals a week: Jack Dorsey,"In an update to his eccentric food habits, Twitter CEO has now revealed that he eats seven meals in a week, just dinner.

In an YouTube interview with Wired on Wednesday, Dorsey who follows Vipassana meditation and intermittent fasting, added to his long list of weird lifestyle that includes ice bath, almost daily.

Dorsey has previously charted out his food chart for dinner that includes fish, chicken or steak, and ""a lot of greens.""

""Then, I have mixed berries as a dessert, maybe some dark chocolate,"" he said in March.

Dorsey said he aims to meditate for two hours daily.

He, however, clarified: ""I definitely do not do a sauna and ice bath every day.""

Dorsey created a storm over social media last year with revealing a punishing health regimen that helps him ""stay sharper"".

""During the day, I feel so much more focused. You have this very focused point of mind... I can go to bed and actually knock out in 10 minutes, if not sooner than that,"" Dorsey said.

Dorsey walks to office and take ""lots of vitamin C"" every day.

According to Dorsey, ice-cold bath in the morning ""unlocks"" his mind and he can take on any challenge while a 15-minute ""sauna"" in the evening, followed by another three-minute ice-bath, relaxes him.

241,16-1-20,Trump refuses to roll back tariff despite Ph-1 of trade deal with China,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to roll back the massive tariff imposed on import of Chinese goods despite having succeeded to sign the first phase of a trade deal with China.

During a historic signing ceremony at the White House, Trump said he will roll back the tariffs only if the second phase of the trade deal is signed between the two economic giants.

The trade deal, considered as major political and diplomatic victory for President Trump, came on a day when the House voted to sent his impeachment trial to the Senate. Trump has used tariff as a leverage in trade talks with major economic powers of the world, mainly China.

Trump asserted that he will continue with his policies on tariffs.

""We are leaving tariffs on which people are shocked but it's great but I will agree to take those tariffs off if we are able to do phase 2. In other words, we are negotiating with the tariffs,"" Trump told the audience, which besides his cabinet colleagues and lawmakers included who's who of the American corporate sector.

""We have 25 per cent on USD 250 billion worth of goods and then we are bringing the 10 per cent down to 7.5 per cent on USD 300 billion worth of goods plus,"" he said.

""So I am leaving them on because otherwise we have no courts to negotiate with than negotiating with (Chinese Vice Premier) Liu He, is very tough but they will all come off as soon as we finish phase 2 and that will be something that some people on Wall Street will love but from what I see they love this deal the way it is now,” Trump said.

Describing the trade deal as more than an agreement, he said ""this marks a sea change in international trade"".

""At long last, Americans have a government that puts them first at the negotiating table 1st in trade, first in every deal, every decision and every action we take a long with incredible enforceability,"" he said.

""As we move on to phase 2, I look forward to continuing to forge a future of greater harmony, prosperity and really commerce, commerce and far beyond commerce between the United States and China,"" said the US President.

""This is something that far beyond even this deal it is going to lead to an even stronger world because we now have -- we now have a big investment in each other and in getting along with each other and this deal is phase one,"" he said.

Trump said there will be no phase 3.

""This is something that is going to be so special however to our manufacturers, our farmers, our bankers, our service people,"" he said.

The first phase of the trade deal signed by the US with China marked the conclusion of more than a year of tough negotiations including several months of suspension of talks between the two largest economies of the world.

The first phase of the trade deal includes Intellection Property (IP) Protection and Enforcement, ending forced technology transfer, dramatic expansion of American agriculture, removing barriers to American financial services, ending currency manipulation, rebalancing the US-China trade relationship and effective dispute resolution.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-refuses-to-roll-back-tariff-despite-ph-1-of-trade-deal-with-china-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-refuses-to-roll-back-tariff-despite-ph-1-of-trade-deal-with-china.html

243,16-1-20,"Rocky Johnson, famous wrestler and father of Dwayne Jonhson, dies at 75","Rocky Johnson, a former professional wrestler and the father of wrestler-turned-Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson, has died at the age of 75.

According to NBC News, the death of Rocky 'Soul Man' Johnson, whose real name was Wayde Bowles, was announced Wednesday by World Wrestling Entertainment.

His manager confirmed the news to the outlet but did not share details on the cause of death.

Rocky Johnson started his career in the 1960s with the National Wrestling Alliance before becoming an athlete with the WWE, formerly known as the Word Wrestling Federation, in 1983, according to the wrestling league's statement.

He partnered with fellow WWE wrestler Tony Atlas to form the duo The Soul Patrol, who would go on to defeat The Wild Samoans that year.

The duo became the first African American world tag team champions in WWE history.

""The 'Soul Man' retired from the ring in 1991, but his imprint continued to be felt on WWE for years to come. Post-retirement, Johnson had a hand in training his son, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson,"" WWE said in its statement.

244,16-1-20,Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires,"Rain fell across parts of bushfire-ravaged eastern Australia on Thursday and more wet weather was forecast, giving some relief following months of catastrophic blazes fuelled by climate change.

The fires, unprecedented for Australia in terms of duration and intensity, have claimed 28 lives and killed an estimated billion animals.

Sustained hot weather and only very rare periods of light rain in the affected areas have deepened the crisis.

So authorities had been looking forward to this week's rain hoping it would help contain or even extinguish some fires.

In the state of New South Wales, where many of the worst fires have burnt, there were ""good falls"" on some blazes early Thursday, the local meteorology bureau reported.

""Relief is here for a number of firefighters working across NSW,"" the state's Rural Fire Service said in a social media post accompanying video footage of rain falling in a burning forest.

""Although this rain won't extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way towards containment."" Before the rains, there were 30 blazes burning out of control in New South Wales.

Smoke from bushfires had also choked the southern city of Melbourne from Monday to Wednesday, disrupting the build-up to next week's Australian Open tennis tournament.

However, thunderstorms late on Wednesday cleared the smoke, with the wet weather then moving east towards fires in the southern state of Victoria.

""Storms have improved air quality in most parts of the state,"" the Victorian Environment Protection Agency said More rain was also forecast on Friday and the weekend which, if it does occur, would be the most sustained period of wet weather since the crisis began in September last year.

""This will be all of our Christmas, birthday, engagement, anniversary, wedding and graduation presents rolled into one. Fingers crossed,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said early this week in reference to the forecast wet weather.

The fires have destroyed more than 2,000 homes and burnt 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of land -- an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.

Australia endures bushfires every year but they started much earlier than normal last year and have lasted far longer.

Forests and farming land were already extremely dry due to a prolonged drought, providing the foundations for the fire crisis when extreme hot weather hit well before the southern summer.

Australia experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded in mid-December.

Scientists say the bushfires are the type of extreme disaster the world can expect more of as global warming intensifies.

The past decade was the hottest on record globally, the United Nations said on Wednesday.

""What's happening is persistent, not a fluke due to some weather phenomenon,"" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which provided one of the datasets for the UN report.

""We know that the long-term trends are being driven by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/relief-as-rain-falls-over-australian-bushfires-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/relief-as-rain-falls-over-australian-bushfires.html
245,16-1-20,Philippines says danger high despite volcano 'lull',"The threat of the Philippines' Taal volcano unleashing a potentially catastrophic eruption remains high, authorities warned Thursday, saying it was showing dangerous signs despite a ""lull"" in spewing ash.

Scores of earthquakes rattle the region daily and large fissures are opening up in the ground, which means the magma that would fuel a major eruption is still flowing beneath.

Authorities are struggling to keep evacuees, some 50,000 of whom fled to shelters after Taal burst to life on Sunday, away from the danger zone around the volcano.

People are trying to get back to homes they left in a hurry to get a change of clothes, feed livestock and pets and check on properties damaged by the fissures or covered with a thick layer of ash.

""Please allow us to observe the lull period for now. We are studying what that means,"" Maria Antonia Bornas, a scientist from the Philippines' seismology agency told reporters.

""A long lull could be just a break from volcanic activity,"" she said. ""The danger remains.""

Authorities have warned since Sunday that the volcano, which sits south of Manila and is one of the country's most active, could let loose a powerful eruption in ""hours or days"".

Taal's last eruption was in 1977, but it has a long history of activity. In 1965 an eruption at the volcano, which is a popular tourist attraction set in a picturesque lake, killed some 200 people.

The country's most powerful explosion in recent years was the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, about 100 kilometres northwest of Manila, which killed more than 800 people.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/philippines-says-danger-high-despite-volcano--lull--2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/philippines-says-danger-high-despite-volcano--lull-.html
246,16-1-20,Meghan Markle makes first public appearance since shock announcement,"Meghan Markle has made her first public appearance since she and Prince Harry sensationally decided to quit as full-time royals, visiting two women's charities in Vancouver as British media reported she could face her father in court.

Harry and Meghan are in the middle of a storm after making their bombshell announcement last week -- before they had discussed the plans with Queen Elizabeth II.

That followed Meghan launching legal action against The Mail on Sunday's publishers in October after the tabloid printed a handwritten letter it had been shown by Thomas Markle.

The weekly newspaper has now issued its defence, leading to the possibility that Meghan and her father could be called to testify against each another.

A crisis summit at Queen Elizabeth's Sandringham country residence on Monday was missed by Meghan, who was in Canada -- where she and Harry plan to live part-time.

The Duchess of Sussex on Tuesday visited the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre, a non-profit organization that provides support to women who are fleeing violence, dealing with homelessness or living in poverty.

Meghan met with the director and a handful of frontline staff to discuss the challenges women in the neighbourhood are facing.

""She was very interested in what goes on for women in this community, who we all know are marginalized women who've faced many challenges and barriers to their wellbeing,"" said Kate Gibson, the acting executive director of the centre.

The Vancouver-based non-profit Justice for Girls also said Meghan had stopped by, tweeting photos on Wednesday of the duchess during her visit.

""Yesterday, The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle visited to discuss climate justice for girls and the rights of Indigenous peoples,"" said the group, which helps teenage girls who live in poverty.

Final details on how Harry and Meghan's new roles might work are due in the coming days.

The prospect of a high court showdown only adds to the pressure on the couple.

Harry, sixth in line to the throne, married US former television actress Meghan at Windsor Castle in May 2018.

Her father, an award-winning former television lighting director now living in Mexico, did not attend the wedding after staging paparazzi photographs and suffering chest pains in the build-up.

The letter was written in August 2018 and published in February 2019 shortly after the US magazine People ran a story citing Meghan's friends talking about the letter, which shed light on her troubled relationship with her estranged father.

Meghan filed a claim in October last year against publishers Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018.

In an accompanying statement, Harry lashed out at negative press coverage, claiming British tabloids had mounted a ""ruthless"" and ""malicious"" attempt to vilify his wife.

Newly-revealed legal documents outlining The Mail on Sunday's defence show they will rely on evidence from Markle, including that he ""had a weighty right to tell his version of what had happened"".

The paper's sister publication the Daily Mail said on its front page Wednesday that Markle would be prepared to give evidence against his daughter.

The Mail on Sunday also argues that a ""one-sided"" article in the US magazine People meant the letter's existence was already in the public domain.

It could be months before any trial takes place.

More broadly, online and television debate has raged as to whether tabloid coverage had been racist towards Meghan.

Departing Labour main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn ""agrees"" there were ""to use Prince Harry's words, racial undertones"" in Meghan's press coverage, his spokesman said.

Harry, 38, is due to resurface at Buckingham Palace on Thursday to host the 2021 Rugby League World Cup draw.

He and Meghan, 38, want to step back as senior royals, work towards financial independence from the British taxpayer, split their time between the UK and Canada and ditch long-established pooled media access arrangements for royal engagements.

Despite Canadians' affection for the royal couple, a large majority (73 per cent) do not wish to foot security or other costs for their relocation, according to an Angus Reid Institute survey.

Canadian media have estimated the costs of protecting Prince Harry and Meghan at approximately 1.7 million canadian dollars (USD 1.3 million) per year.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/meghan-markle-makes-first-public-appearance-since-shock-announcement-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/meghan-markle-makes-first-public-appearance-since-shock-announcement.html
247,16-1-20,Bhim army chief gets bail; barred from Delhi visit for four weeks,"A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad who has been accused of inciting people during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid here on December 20, while restraining him from visiting Delhi for four weeks.

The court further directed him not to hold any dharna in the national Capital till the elections here and said “the nation cannot be exposed to anarchy”.

Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau granted the relief to Azad on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with two sureties of like amount.

The court also said that before going to Saharanpur if Azad wants to go anywhere, including Jama Masjid in Delhi in 24 hours, police will escort him there.

“There is no material in the form of CCTV footage or audio recordings to prima facie show the direct involvement of the accused with the alleged violence and it was admitted by the police that the CCTV footage upon which they were placing their reliance was of a very poor quality which does not even reflect the presence of other accused who have already been granted bail,” the judge said.

Special circumstances call for special conditions, the judge said.

During the verdict pronouncement, the counsel for Azad, advocate Mehmood Pracha, said the Bhim Army chief faces threat in Uttar Pradesh.

“Whenever the accused is required to come to Delhi for his medical treatment, he shall inform his schedule to the DCP of the crime branch and the SHO of Fatehpur police station at Saharanpur, who shall convey the same to DCP Crime Branch, Delhi. During the period of his visit, the accused shall be under an escort,” the court said.

It further clarified that the condition has been imposed till February 16.

“Violence or destruction of property was totally unacceptable and for any kind of damage to private or public property during the protest, it is the organisers who would be responsible for the damage and liable to compensate for the loss. There has to be zero tolerance for any kind of violence and lawlessness cannot be encouraged. The nation cannot be exposed to anarchy.

“Of course, it goes without saying that protests do lead to inconvenience but it has to be ensured that these protests do not last for a long time at places under public use,” the court said, in its order.

The court further said that while exercising one’s right, another’s should not be violated and no inconvenience should be caused to anyone.

“I may observe that in our democratic set-up, we have a fundamental right to peaceful protest guaranteed by the Constitution, which cannot be curtailed by the state. However, at the same time, our constitution strikes a fine balance between the rights and duties. While exercising our right of peaceful protest, it is our duty to ensure that no corresponding right of another is violated and no inconvenience was caused to anyone,” the judge said.

It further said that reading of the preamble to the Constitution of India cannot prim facie be taken as incitement.

“I may observe that for the judges, legal persons and the offices under the constitution, the Constitution of India is a sacred document and if this was correct, then reading this document cannot prim facie be taken as incitement.

“While on one hand the accused specifically affirms that he read out the preamble, the investigating officer claimed that he had made inflammatory statements, details of which have not been placed on record, so much so that there was no statement of any eye witnesses to affirm the same,” the judge said.

The court further said that the protest call was only for one day and the march was from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar and no assessment of damage has been made till date.

Earlier, the investigating officer of the Crime Branch of Delhi police had alleged before the court that Azad can be clearly seen giving “inflammatory speeches” at a large gathering at Jama Masjid, in the drone camera footage available with them.

The counsel appearing for the police, had said that the allegation were serious and sensitive in nature involving commission of offence against the nation and not against any individual, which in itself is a heinous crime.

Earlier, the court had said that people are out on streets as what should have been said inside Parliament was “not said”.

Asserting that it is one’s constitutional right to protest, it had also observed that Delhi Police was behaving “as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan”.

Azad’s outfit had called for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 20, without police permission. Other 15 people arrested in the case were granted bail by the court on January 9.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bhim-army-chief-gets-bail--barred-from-delhi-visit-for-four-weeks.html

Singh was caught red-handed on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway by the police team on Sunday while he was ferrying Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists out of the Kashmir Valley.

In the same vein, the police chief also clarified that a recommendation has been forwarded to the Government to hand over the probe of the said case to the premier National Investigation Agency (NIA) keeping in the mind the wider scope of investigation. The DGP, however, remained tight-lipped over nature of ongoing interrogation in the case.

Addressing a Press conference here at the police control room, the DGP also sent out a stern message to “men in khaki” involved in “unlawful” activities.

“We don’t believe in sheltering people, we don’t believe in protecting people who are on the ‘unlawful’ path. We are tough with them. In the past also we have removed so many people from the service. We have been very ‘ruthless’ and we will be ‘ruthless’ in this case also,” he said.

Responding to direct questions whether interrogators have been able to unearth his direct links with dreaded terrorists operating in the Kashmir Valley, details of ‘properties’ amassed by him, his role in Parliament attack case, as mentioned in one of the letters written by Afzal Guru, DGP Dilbagh Singh said, it is a matter of investigation and let the interrogators handle it.

Referring to morale of the police force, in the wake of arrest of a senior police officer, the DGP said, morale of the force remains high. Our operations are going on. Such incidents are not going to make any impact on our morale. Our morale will, rather, further get strengthened. Reacting to political statements being made in public domain over the religious identity of the arrested cop, the DGP said, “It is unfortunate that some people are making these statements. They are uncalled for”. He further clarified, “I am not there to react to political statements. My job is to take care of the morale of the police force. Despite this episode, we have carried out a number of operations and we will continue to perform our duties professionally”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/j-k-dgp--davinder---s-sacking-recommended--govt-to-take-call-now-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/j-k-dgp--davinder---s-sacking-recommended--govt-to-take-call-now.html
250,16-1-20,External Affairs Minister Jaishankar holds talks with Iranian FM Javad Zarif,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif on Thursday held extensive talks on fast-evolving situation in the Gulf region in the wake of frayed ties between Iran and the US over killing of Commander Qasem Soleimani.

In the meeting over breakfast, Zarif apprised Jaishankar about the overall situation and Tehran's position over it.

It is learnt that the two ministers also deliberated on various aspects of bilateral ties between India and Iran including progress of the Chabahar port project.

The Iranian foreign minister arrived here on Tuesday on a three-day visit in the midst of global focus on escalating tension between Iran and the US following the killing of Soleimani in an American drone strike.

On Wednesday Zarif told PTI that India can play a role in de-escalating tensions in the Gulf region as it is an important regional player

In an address at the Raisina Dialogue, he hit out at the Trump adminstration for killing of Soleimani and attributed the action as a ""sad reflection of a serious problem in Washington's thinking"".

""If you are an ignorant-arrogant or an arrogant-ignorant, with power, it brings disaster,"" he said on Wednesday, alleging that Soleimani's killing was a US attempt to unilaterally shape policies in the region.

The attack, he said, was ""unforgivable"".

India has been maintaining that it would like the situation to de-escalate as soon as possible and the country has been in touch with key players, including Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, as it has important interests in the region.

Maj Gen Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force, was killed when a US drone fired missiles on his convoy in Iraq on January 3.

China, Pakistan's 'all-weather ally', on Wednesday stood alone in the Pakistani corner to get the Security Council to focus on the Kashmir issue.

The attempt failed as other member countries felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

Earlier on the day, China made the fresh pitch to raise the Kashmir issue under ""other matters"" during closed consultations in the Security Council Consultations Room.

India's Permenent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said: ""We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others"".

""We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,"" Akbaruddin told PTI.

""We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,"" he said.

A European source, heading into the Security Council meeting, described the discussions on Kashmir during the closed consultations to be ""low key.""

A top European diplomat said the issue should be resolved bilaterally and it was a ""domestic affair"".

Akbaruddin further said, ""Pakistan's practice of using false pretences to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. We hope that Pakistan pays heed to the clear signals sent out here today and focusses on the hard tasks it has to address in order to ensure normal relations with India.""

Coming out of the meeting, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun said: ""We had a meeting on Jammu and Kashmir. And I'm sure you all know that Foreign Minister of Pakistan wrote letters to the Security Council asking it to pay attention to the current situation in Jammu and kashmir.

""The issue of India and Pakistan has always been on the agenda of the Security Council and today we have also seen some tensions, so the Security Council had a briefing and (it) heard at the briefing from the Secretariat concerning the current situation on the ground. Members exchanged views on that.""

Zhang later said China has stated its ""position very clearly. We remain concern about the situation on the ground (in Kashmir).""

When asked if the meeting advanced anything, he said: ""I am sure the meeting will help both the parties to understand the risk of further escalation and will encourage them to approach each other and have a dialogue and seek solutions through dialogue. I think that will be helpful.""

The current move by China was the third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue in the UNSC since August last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories.

In August, China pushed for a UNSC meeting on Kashmir. However, the meeting did not yield desired results for China as the member-states maintained that India's move was an internal issue.

Last month, France, the US, the UK and Russia foiled an attempt by China to discuss Kashmir at a closed-door meeting of the UNSC.

China has been critical of India's reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir, and has criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory. China lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.

New Delhi's decisions on Kashmir had also cast a shadow over Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India in October last for the second informal summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Notwithstanding the acrimony over the issue between the two countries, Modi and Xi held ""successful"" talks in the ancient coastal town of Mamallapuram near Chennai in Tamil Nadu, signalling a recalibration of the bilateral ties.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-again-fails-to-raise-kashmir-issue-in-unsc--members-say-bilateral-matter-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pakistan-again-fails-to-raise-kashmir-issue-in-unsc--members-say-bilateral-matter.html
252,16-1-20,Eating more vegetables will not cure prostate cancer: Study,"Patients with prostate cancer assigned to eat seven or more servings of vegetables and fruits daily saw no extra protection from the increased consumption of micronutrients, researchers have found.

Previous studies suggest that foods with high carotenoids have antioxidant properties, which can protect men from prostate cancer. Some of those foods include leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, carrots and tomatoes.

However, the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, shows that eating more produce won't cure, nor stop the disease.

""These data indicate that despite prevailing scientific and public opinion, eating more vegetables will not alter the course of prostate cancer. It will not, to the best of our knowledge, suppress or cure it,"" said study researcher J. Kellogg Parsons from University of California.

""However, while eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and getting more exercise may not cure cancer, it may keep the body stronger and healthier, which may help patients tolerate cancer treatments,"" Parsons added.

For The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) study, researchers enrolled 478 men aged 50 to 80 years at 91 sites in the US.

The patients had been diagnosed with early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma and enrolled in an active surveillance programme in which patients defer immediate treatment until the disease advances.

Patients were randomised to a control group that received written information about diet and prostate cancer or to a telephone counselling behavioural intervention programme that encouraged participants to eat foods high in carotenoids, such as leafy greens, carrots and tomatoes, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage.

Both groups were monitored for two years.

Patients assigned to the intervention increased their intake of fruits and vegetables to a statistically significant degree, and significantly more than what control patients did.

These findings were supported by significant changes in the blood carotenoid levels of the patients.

""Nonetheless, these data fail to support prevailing assertions in clinical guidelines and the popular media that diets high in micronutrient-rich vegetables improve cancer-specific outcomes among prostate cancer survivors,"" said study researcher James Marshall.

According to the researchers, scientific studies have identified a strong role for changing diet to improve outcomes in diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not in cancer.

Although the MEAL study revealed no positive impact on prostate cancer, it did demonstrate that behavioural modification can lead patients to make healthier food choices.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eating-more-vegetables-will-not-cure-prostate-cancer--study-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/eating-more-vegetables-will-not-cure-prostate-cancer--study.html
253,16-1-20,Interested in diplomacy but not in negotiating with US: Iran's foreign minister,"India can play a role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle-East as it is an important player in the region, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Wednesday, while terming the killing of General Quasim Sulemani by the US as an ""unforgivable act of aggression"".

In an address at the Raisina Dialogue, he came down hard on the US for assassinating Sulemani and attributed the action as a ""sad reflection of a serious problem in Washington's thinking"".

""If you are an ignorant-arrogant or an arrogant-ignorant, with power, it brings disaster,"" he said, alleging that Sulemani's killing was a US attempt to unilaterally shape policies in the region.

The attack, he said, was ""unforgivable"".

Zarif said unlike the common perception held by American lawmakers about Sulaimani's image, the global community at large voiced their dissatisfaction for the assassination and commemorated the General's demise.

The Iranian Foreign Minister accepted Iran's involvement in bringing down a Ukrainian flight killing 180 people and termed it an ""unfortunate incident"". He called downing of the aircraft as ""accidental shooting"".

Zarif also said his country was interested in diplomacy to de-escalate tension in the Middle-East, but not in negotiating with the US, remarks that come amid spiralling tensions between the two countries over the killing of Soleimani.

Hitting out at the US, he said Soleimani was the single biggest threat to ISIS and his killing was now being celebrated by the terror group and US President Donald Trump.

""Who is celebrating Soleimani's killing? President Trump, (US Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo and Daesh (ISIS). You wonder about strange bedfellows? Not really,"" he said, adding that Soleimani's killing had showed ignorance and arrogance on the part of the US.

The Iranian foreign minister claimed that 430 Indian cities saw protests and commemorative meetings after Soleimani's killing.

India can play a role in de-escalating tensions in the Middle-East as New Delhi is an important player, Zarif told PTI.

India has been maintaining that it would like the situation to de-escalate as soon as possible and the country has been in touch with key players, including Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, as it has important interests in the region.

Zarif, in his address, also said that European powers have violated the 2015 international nuclear deal -- Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that was signed between Iran and the P5+1 (China France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

His remarks came a day after after Britain, France and Germany launched a complaint against Iran for non-compliance.

""The future of the nuclear deal depends on Europe. JCPOA was one of the best deals... One of the best multilateral agreements. None of the 11 commitments given to Iran were fulfilled. Not only the US, but also EU failed to keep those commitments,"" Zarif said.

The EU is in violation of JCPOA commitments independent of American violations, he said.

""You (EU countries) are independent countries. Why do you let US bully you? So we triggered the dispute resolution mechanism. Nothing happened. They did not even respond,"" he said.

""We have said that once Europe reverses, we will reverse too. We have lost hundreds of billions of dollars. If they pay us those hundreds of billions we will reverse our decisions,"" Zarif said.

Referring to the Ukrainian jetliner that crashed earlier this week killing all 176 aboard, Zarif said shooting down of the civilian plane was a mistake.

""Why did it happen? Because there was a crisis. People make mistakes, unforgivable mistakes, but it happened in the time of the crisis,"" Zarif said.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard has acknowledged that it accidentally shot down the Ukrainian aircraft.

""We need to create hope in the region. We have to get rid of despair,"" he said.

Zarif's remarks come amid the global focus being on Iran and the US over the confrontation between them following Soleimani's killing.

Maj Gen Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force, was killed when a US drone fired missiles on his convoy in Iraq on January 3.

Last week, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces are stationed in Iraq.

Iran responded in self-defence, Zarif asserted.

The US accused Soleimani of threatening to attack US embassies, but now it is known there was no such threat, he said.

The US wants to get rid of international law and that is why it talks of international rules based system, Zarif said.

The US looks at things from their perspective, not from the perspective of this region, he said.

""The US is now negotiating with Taliban. To do what? To get out of Afghanistan. What has US brought to Iraq? Stability? For Afghanistan and Iraq, it is their choice. But to use Iraq to mount an attack on an official guest of Iraq? It was an unprovoked attack,"" Zarif said.

Secretary Pompeo says if Iran wants its people to eat, then it will have to listen to US and this amounts to war crime, Zarif said.

""We now need a new coalition against Daesh. We knew where Daesh was standing. We now know where US is standing,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/interested-in-diplomacy-but-not-in-negotiating-with-us--iran-s-foreign-minister-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/interested-in-diplomacy-but-not-in-negotiating-with-us--iran-s-foreign-minister.html

255,16-1-20,"Gul Panag: Writers, filmmakers must put out more stories of women heroes","Actress Gul Panag, who recently featured in the web series ""Rangbaaz Phirse"", says writers and filmmakers need to put out more stories of women heroes because there are enough stories of women heroes in society. She adds that such a step would have a multiplying effect on society.

""There are enough female stories out there that should be told because male heroes in the world are enough and many. I just feel symbolically, given all that we are going through as a nation and in the overall development stage of our nation, we need to put out more stories of women heroes because there are enough stories and there are enough women heroes. I feel the kind of heroes we create will in turn impact the kind of society we have. As filmmakers, it's a huge responsibility on our shoulders to create the kind of heroes we want to see in society,"" said Gul, at a promotional event organised by Zee5 for the show ""Rangbaaz Phirse"" that was also attended by her co-actor Spruha Joshi and director Sachin Pathak.

Gul won Miss India title in 1999, and was crowned Miss Beautiful Smile at the same pageant. She also participated in the Miss Universe 1999 pageant. She has appeared in films such as ""Dor"", ""Dhoop"", ""Manorama Six Feet Under"", ""Hello"", ""Straight"", and ""Ab Tak Chhappan 2"".

Gul Panag is also a serial half-marathon runner, a licensed pilot, an avid biker and was trained on a professional platform Formula E. She debuted on the racing track at the Mahindra Racing's all new M4Electro at the circuit de Calafat in Catalonia, Spain. She has also had her brush with politics in th 2014 general elections.

Her new show ""Rangbaaz Phirse"" is about a young guy who falls through the cracks because of politics. He is robbed of his youth, which subsequently ruins his life.

258,16-1-20,Xiaomi to go big on premium 'Mi' category in India in 2020,"Chinese handset maker Xiaomi, which has been known as the leader of the budget smartphone category, is going big on its premium ""Mi"" line up in India this year and the portfolio will see a sustained set of launches through 2020, a top company executive said.

""These launches will be across categories which we think will help 'Mi' maintain consumer interest in 2020. We also intend to bring the premium smartphones from the Mi line-up, which has recorded a substantial interest since we entered the market,"" Raghu Reddy, Head of Categories, Xiaomi India, told IANS on Thursday.

The smartphone maker has brought its flagship Mi Mix Alpha concept smartphone to India with a wraparound curved display design. The device previews some of the technologies that can be expected in forthcoming Mi series phones.

""With another wave of form factor innovations coming out (with devices such as Mi Mix Alpha), users can expect to see some sort of disruption in the form factor space as well. Of course, these innovations will take a few months more to reach the segment of the market where the mass resides,"" added Reddy.

Xiaomi's flagship Mi Mix Alpha is a concept phone that essentially uses a flexible OLED display that wraps around the device.

Asked about the company's retail strategy in 2020, Reddy replied: ""We believe in maintaining a proper balance for both offline and online.

""Both platforms online and offline are equally important for us and currently our online to offline ratio is 60:40. However, we aim to bring the same to 50:50 very soon in 2020,"" he noted.

The company is planning a strategic focus on expanding the width of distribution in the country for its offline sales this year.

According to the handset maker, more than 99 per cent of smartphones that are sold in India are manufactured locally.

""We have a production capacity of three smartphones per second during operational hours. We locally source and assemble PCBA in India. Even smartphone chargers, USB cables and batteries are nearly 100 per cent locally sourced,"" added Reddy.

Aiming to make India a manufacturing hub and increase exports from India to countries globally, the firm has launched small export pilot to Bangladesh and Nepal.

""We have requested the government to make India a more export-friendly destination. In order to become a global manufacturing hub, India needs to compete with hubs such as Vietnam and China that are preferred by investors given their attractive and stable export-oriented policies, coupled with better infrastructure and logistics network,"" Reddy informed.

""Few initiatives will work in favour of this initiative such as the Duty drawback refund for merchant exporters. We would also invest in laboratories, which allow for global standard testing, since BIS is not a globally accepted standard,"" he added.

259,16-1-20,2nd ODI: Kohli to be back at No.3 after all-openers-on-board strategy backfires,"Skipper Virat Kohli is set to be back at his regular number three position after the strategy of coming two-down boomeranged in the lung-opener as India take on a resolute Australia in the must-win second ODI here on Friday.

India go into the game 0-1 down after Australia registered a 10-wicket win in the lung-opener at Mumbai, courtesy David Warner and Aaron Finch, who hit unbeaten hundreds.

In a bid to field all three in-form players -- Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul --, Kohli dropped himself down the order but the plan backfired spectacularly as he was unable to convert his start.

Opener Dhawan later said he was ready to bat at number three if asked to by the team management, but since Kohli has been successful at that position, the skipper would be more than willing to walk in one-down.

Kohli batting at three also provides stability to the middle-order.

With a concussed Rishabh Pant out of the second game, Rahul is a certainty as he will keep wickets.

So, like in the last game, Rohit and Dhawan, who made a dogged 74 off 91 balls in Wankhede, could open, and there could be a toss-up between Rahul and young Shreyas Iyer at number four. Iyer had a rare failure on Tuesday.

Pant's absence could pave the way for the inclusion of Karnataka batsman Manish Pandey, who made optimum use of the opportunity that he got in the third T20 against Sri Lanka in Pune.

It would also be interesting to see which among the experienced Kedar Jadhav and rookie Shivam Dube makes the squad.

Rohit, who had a phenomenal 2019, failed in the first game, but given the form he is in, the opener is expected to bounce back strongly here.

Ditto for Kohli, who is just one hundred short of equalling cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar's record of most hundreds on home soil for India.

The bowlers led by Jasprit Bumrah had a forgettable outing at the Wankhede and they would be more than eager to make a strong comeback and prove their mettle.

Bumrah, since his comeback, has not been as effective as earlier and he would like to change the perception.

It would be interesting to see whether India play Delhi speedster Navdeep Saini or persist with Shardul Thakur, who gave away 43 runs in Mumbai.

Ravindra Jadeja looks a certainty and so the choice would be between chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who conceded 55 runs in the first ODI and Yuzvendra Chahal as the lead spinner.

On the other hand, a high on confidence Australia will be looking to seal the issue to register back to back series wins in India, a rare feat for any visiting team. The Finch-Warner combination will look forward to carry the momentum.

Their middle-order comprising the experienced Steve Smith, in-form Marnus Labuschange, Ashton Turner and Alex Carey looks more or less settled.

If all of them fire in unison, along with the openers, then it will hard for the opposition bowlers.

However, it will be quite a test of their middle-order at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium.

Australian bowlers also showed at the Wankhede, why they are considered among the best.

Led by pace spearhead Mitchell Starc, they bundled out India for a sub-par 255 and Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins would be raring to go once again.

Spinners Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar, not only contained the runs, but provided crucial breakthroughs and are expected to play a similar role again in the middle overs.

The track here is expected to be a belter and India can draw confidence from the home series against New Zealand in 2017, when they won 2-1 after losing the opener, co-incidentally in Mumbai.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul (wicketkeeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

Australia: Aaron Finch (Captain), Alex Carey (Wicket-keeper), Patrick Cummins, Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschange, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner and Adam Zampa.

260,16-1-20,Finch expects India to fight back hard in second ODI,"Australia captain Aaron Finch has no doubts that India will ""fight back"" in the second ODI here Friday after being battered in the series-opener in Mumbai.

Australia gave the hosts a reality check with a crushing 10-wicket win in the lung-opener on Tuesday, riding on David Warner and Finch's unbeaten hundreds.

But Finch said it would be silly to take India lightly as they boast of world-class players.

""That was a pretty good performance. I think our fielding was a little bit sloppy but all in all we ar really happy with how the boys went,"" he was quoted as saying by 'cricket.Com.Au' after the win in Mumbai.

""They (India) will fight back no doubt. They are a great side, got some world-class players,"" Finch said talking about what to expect from Friday's match.

Chasing a below-par 256, David Warner (128 not out) and Finch (110 not out) shared a record opening stand as Australia cantered home in the first ODI.

Asked about his opening partner's batting display, the Australia skipper said: ""He (Warner) is playing unbelievably well I think. It's so hard to bowl to him once he gets in. He hits the ball all around the ground, so stopping him from scoring is so hard.

""He is so clear with how he is going to bat, his footwork is pretty good. His mental state is unbelievable when he is out in the middle. He is so clear with his thoughts and his game. He is in top shape.""

While lauding his bowlers for their superb show in the middle overs, Finch hinted that Josh Hazzlewood could get a chance in the second ODI by resting either Pat Cummins or Mitchell Starc in an effort to manage their workload.

""To be able to control such a damaging top-order with their lengths is brilliant. The ball just swung enough to keep them in the game all the time. They were so accurate which you have to be in these conditions,"" he said.

""The bowling line-up will obviously be discussed with Josh (Hazzlewood) on the sidelines. With back-to-back games and pretty quick and a reasonably heavy Test load, I'm sure Josh will come in for one of them (Cummins or Starc) at some point.

""(But) Unless it's a forced change with a niggle or injury, I don't think it would be much,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finch-expects-india-to-fight-back-hard-in-second-odi-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/finch-expects-india-to-fight-back-hard-in-second-odi.html
261,15-1-20,Take the bull by the horns,"The architecture under which the newly-appointed CDS has been placed and the charter given to him is commendable, provided the system lets him do his work

As the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen Bipin Rawat has hit the ground running. He has been tasked with — or is expected to achieve — in three years what the country could not in 70. With all its fire and fury, the office of the CDS has finally arrived. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Government has fulfilled one more electoral pledge. The despatch with which 40 bureaucrats are being sidestepped from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to its own newly-created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) is breath-taking. As a founder member of the Defence Planning Staff, which was revamped into the existing Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), I am familiar with the colossal teething problems and bottlenecks in creating a new institution in spite of the goodwill of the three Service Chiefs. In this instance, the civilian bureaucracy is relocating for the first time under a military head. Unique to India, the DMA will correct the aberration of the three Service headquarters being outliers. It will become integral to the MoD, thus facilitating, absent so far, the military’s role in decision-making. Wisely, this re-location in MoD has mandated existing single-service structures; their charters should remain undisturbed.

The CDS is multi-hatted. He is the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (PC-CoSC), the head of IDS, Secretary to the DMA, Principal Advisor to the Defence Minister on tri-service matters, Advisor to the Prime Minister in the Nuclear National Command Authority (under which comes the Strategic Forces Command, which will be administered by the CDS), member of the Defence Acquisition Council and the Defence Planning Committee. The CDS’ charter is monumental. Essentially, he will prepare for the conversion of existing military commands in a phased manner (three years) to theatre commands; facilitate synergy and jointness in defence planning, operations, training and logistics, including prioritisation in inter-service arms procurement. Equally and importantly, the CDS will not exercise any military command, including over the three Service Chiefs, thus reducing him into the ultimate Chief of General Staff. He is clubbed with other Service Chiefs at Number 12 in warrant of precedence below Cabinet Secretary at Number 11.

The pivotal change has come in the MoD. That means grafting the extracted components from MoD that were dealing with service headquarters and other military agencies back into the MoD under the new DMA. The Defence Secretary, who is the principal secretary in MoD, has lost most of his military turf to the CDS. He is, thus, left with organisations like the Defence Estates, the National Defence College, the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses and, of course, the functional coordination of four other departments of defence. Curiously, the presumably amended Government rules of business still leave him responsible for defence of India, defence policy and war preparedness. The DMA will ensure that the CDS replaces the Defence Secretary, who acted as the de facto CDS in determining priorities in arms acquisition of services and other tri-service issues. At long last, the CoSC, which historically had a rotating chairman from among the longest serving Service Chiefs, will now have a permanent incumbent, the CDS, to address tri-service matters and engender jointness more effectively.

For the CDS, the major challenge will be to implement the five-year defence acquisition and two-year annual roll plan based on “anticipated budget.” Without any financial commitment, defence planning will enter the realm of wishful planning. Unless this is grounded and realistic yardsticks are provided, the planning process will remain stymied. The second challenge is to integrate single-service plans into a synergised tri-service plan. Till joint theatre commands are introduced — based on national security doctrine and national security strategy — the CDS will at best be able to fine-tune services plans into an optimally effective joint plan. This should be done better than was done till today.

The MoD will now have one more Secretary (fifth) rank officer, the CDS, but in the pay-band of a Cabinet Secretary heading the DMA. The CDS elevated from among the Service Chiefs will be head and shoulders above the Defence Secretary. Until now, all matters relating to defence were channelled through the Defence Secretary to the Raksha Mantri. Will the CDS have direct access to the Defence Minister as he should, or will the existing system of “routing” prevail?

Similarly, relations between the CDS and the three Service Chiefs are one of primus inter pares among Generals who are equal and yet unequal. A Government statement read: “The CDS will not exercise any military command, including over the three Service Chiefs so as to be able to provide impartial advice to political leadership.” This directive is badly drafted. Simply stated, the CDS will not ride roughshod over single-Service chiefs. But how this plays out on the ground only time and personalities of the Chiefs will tell. In the Army, three-star Lt Gen-rank Corps Commanders are subordinate to three-star Army Commanders of the same rank and pay-band. In the reporting channel, too, there is an implied problem. Would the Service Chiefs report to the Defence Minister through the CDS or access him directly, or via the Defence Secretary? Some of these wrinkles will no doubt get ironed out in the times to come.

Stripping the CDS of all military command has been done to serve a political purpose and requires re-thinking. He should at least “command” and not “administer” the tri-service commands like the Andaman and Nicobar Command that was established in 2001, the cyber-space and Special Forces Commands, when raised. As for the SFC, he should command it but without operational control. All tri-service military organisations and institutions (including the dormant National Defence University) that have been retained with the Defence Secretary should gradually be transferred to the DMA.

The CDS should over time improve civil-military relations. Equally, the exaggerated fear of the military acting unconstitutionally should go. Baring one or two past aberrations, including one with an Army Chief who is now a Minister in the Union Government, the military has behaved impeccably, displaying unique, apolitical, professional and secular credentials while maintaining allegiance to civilian control. Reducing tension between civilian and military bureaucracies will require unbiased political intervention. The choices for theaterisation are either the British or American models. Both require to be studied for their relevance to the Indian geo-strategic environment. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh should order the winding up of the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval-led high-powered Defence Planning Committee. It has contributed little to defence planning and sharpening higher defence management.

Whether the CDS, bereft of all command, will be a paper tiger and his advice binding on Service Chiefs, as is doing the rounds of South Block, only the future will tell. The biggest handicap for the CDS in streamlining military robustness will be the continuing paucity of funds for defence modernisation due to a shrinking economy. Overall, the architecture under which the CDS has been placed and the charter given to him is commendable, provided the system lets him do his work. Still for a change, the Government has hit the bull’s eye.

262,16-1-20,PM’s residence to get new address near PMO,"The Prime Minister’s residence is expected to shift from 7 Lok Kalyan Marg to South Block, closer to the Prime Minister’s Office and it will come up on 15 acre under the proposed revamp plan of Central Vista in New Delhi.

Similarly, the proposed building of new Parliament is to be a triangular design on 9.5 acre, close to the existing Parliament building. The Vice-President’s house and Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) at Man Singh Road is likely to be shifted.

The architecture firm HCP Design, which bagged the bid to finalise detailed project report, made a detailed presentation before the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry on Wednesday.

In its presentation, it stated the PM’s new residence has been proposed on 15 acre on Dara Shikoh Marg (formerly known as Dalhousie Road) near South Block. Sources said the use of this land has been changed. This would also help in easing traffic in the area as VIP movements cause inconvenience to people.

Similarly, the proposed building of new Parliament will come up on 9.5 acre. The building would be inside the present Parliament complex.

The new Lok Sabha will provide seating space for 900-1200 members. According to the plan, the seating area of MPs in the proposed building will also be more than the existing place. The existing Parliament building will remain the same, and offices of Ministers and MPs will be in a new building. The Government will construct 10 eight-storey buildings on Rajpath to accommodate offices of various Ministries, which would be built after demolishing a few major buildings. Sources said plan to shift the IGNCA, however, is yet to be finalised by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry.

The sources said all cultural institutions will be relocated near Jamnagar House, adding that the Government has also planned to set up a state-of-the art National Centre for Performing Arts there.

Under the plan, the proposed buildings will not be taller than 42-metre-high India Gate to maintain uniformity of structures. The Vice-President’s residence is set to move next to Rashtrapati Bhavan from the existing location, Maulana Azad Road. Vigyan Bhavan is to be demolished and will make way for a modern conference hall. However, no heritage buildings will be demolished. The common Central Secretariat will comprise eight buildings, four on each side of Central Vista. Each building will have eight floors, which will house various Ministries. Under the project, several subways will be constructed to ensure movement of pedestrians around common Central Secretariat, which will also be connected through Yellow and Violet line of the Delhi Metro.

Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and its secretary Durga Shankar Mishra were also present during presentation.

The plan involves restructuring the Central Vista in a move that will include a common Secretariat, a new Parliament complex, and a redesigned Rajpath, while also razing a dozen Government offices. The plan, which is being handled by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, involves having a new Parliament by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, and the entire project is slated to be finished by 2024.

The plan, estimated to cost about Rs 12,000 crore, includes razing buildings such as Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan that house important Government Ministries to build a common Secretariat for roughly 70,000 Central Government employees who are located in 30 buildings. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has recently changed the land use of over 100 acre in Luytens’ Delhi for this purpose.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm---s-residence-to-get-new-address-near-pmo-2020-01-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/pm---s-residence-to-get-new-address-near-pmo.html
