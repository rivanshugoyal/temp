0,13-4-20,The empty sky,"Never before has an industry moved directly from a golden age to a dark age in a matter of weeks. Will global aviation weather this crisis? Will it survive in any recognisable form?

The flight-tracking service, Flightradar24, is a very useful application for frequent flyers. By allowing passengers to see traffic patterns and where the aircraft, which is going to operate the next flight, currently is, it gives a fairly good idea as to when it will take off. On other days, one could just see a plane pass overhead, fire up the application and find out where it is coming from or going to, maybe just to get the vicarious joy of virtually travelling. In a city like Dubai, where the gigantic Emirates airline rules with over 100 A380 double-deckers ferrying people across the world, it is just amazing to fire up the application on the phone and look at all the places those gigantic machines are going to.

Therefore, whether one is a frequent flyer or just an aviation geek, the last month has been a crazy one. Today, if you open the Flightradar24 application or the website and look over India, you will see barely a plane in the sky. Those that you encounter are those from South-east Asia, travelling to Europe over India, and the occasional cargo flights flying into major Indian airports. Besides, maybe one can see an evacuation flight or two every other day as Air India and other airlines, such as IndiGo, have been operating flights to get foreign nationals out of the country. Other than that, nothing.

All of India’s 650 plus commercial passenger planes are for the large part grounded. And India is not unique here. Even Emirates is operating just cargo flights and most of its A380s have been tucked away at Dubai’s huge World City airport. At least it will be able to bring these giants back into the service. Airlines like Air France, Lufthansa and Qantas are debating the very future of these aircraft. Across the world, even in the US, where there are over 10,000 commercial aircraft crisscrossing that vast nation, most planes are grounded.

The Coronavirus has hit global aviation like nothing before. According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines globally can lose passenger revenues of up to $113 billion due to this crisis. Not that the tensions between India and Pakistan last year, which had shut all air corridors between the two countries, can compare or the shootdown of the Malaysian Boeing 777 over Ukraine and Iran’s downing of a Ukrainian aircraft. Even the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks was not so brutal. Aviation consultancy, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation India Pvt Ltd (Capa India), has said that domestic air passenger traffic is expected to drop from an estimated 140 million in FY20 to around 80-90 million in FY21 and international traffic is expected to almost halve from around 70 million in FY20 to 35-40 million in FY21.

Why is it so bad this time around? Well clearly, hints of how aviation spreads a global pandemic were evident during the SARS outbreak of 2004 and the subsequent spread of Avian and Swine flu. During the spread of such infections, air travel in and around the East and South-east Asia had collapsed. But because the virulence of those viruses was far less than the one blowing like a tornado through the aviation world today, the overall impact was, at best, minimal in Europe and America.

This time around, the virulence of the disease, coupled with the insane growth of the aviation sector over the past decade, is going to make the industry suffer badly. Indeed, aviation is a victim of its own success as connectivity moved from huge hubs like Beijing and Shanghai to direct connectivity to cities like Wuhan.

Unfortunately, after Governments hummed and hawed for a couple of weeks before shutting aviation down, often delaying flight lockdowns at the insistence of airline lobbyists, the impact might carry on for longer. Even if India reopens its skies, it looks increasingly likely that the withdrawal of aviation services will only be gradually eased out.

As for international flights, several nations across the world are still under lockdown. This will go on for a longer period of time than in India. At least as of now, some nations, such as Singapore, are major aviation hubs. It is estimated that at least 200 of India’s commercial fleet will not be required when things restart. Leisure travel will be hit hard as jobs will disappear and increments will become a thing of the past, resulting in lower discretionary spends.

But the impact on international travel is likely to be harder still. Foreign holiday travel, particularly to hard-hit tourist hubs such as Italy and Spain, will vanish. Non-essential business travel, too, will. The conference market drying up will mean fewer trips to countries like Germany and even China. Airlines like Emirates, which have gorged themselves on Indian travellers for three decades now, might suddenly run out of the runway as aviation will likely reform itself in ways we cannot even predict today.

Make no mistake, international and domestic air travel will recover. One reason for this is because a vibrant and operational aviation sector is strategically vital for large nations like India. While the Indian Government will not be able to bail out airlines, the latter will have to indulge in small measures to get the sector up and running again, at least to a decent baseline.

This is also a time when the Government will have to sit down with industry leaders and figure out what it will have to do to help the sector grow. It needs to ponder if any protectionist moves, such as preventing large numbers of Indian travellers flying through hubs such as Dubai and Singapore, will be required.

At the same time, flying is all a confidence game. By now, everybody is calling the Coronavirus a “travelling salesman” disease. One reason for the dramatic growth in air travel over the past decade has been because of the incredible safety record of modern civil aviation but that confidence has disappeared thanks to the virus. So, how do we get that confidence back? That will have to be something the Government will have to do alongside airlines. It is not just us, Governments across the world will have to deal with it.

1,13-4-20,The long march,"As we try to flatten the viral curve, we must ensure a graded but sure opening of economic activities and avoid a collapse

Let’s face it, the trudge back to normalcy won’t be easy at a time when we have to seemingly live with the virus, contained and tamed somewhat, but not completely eradicated till a vaccine or cure is developed. The earliest that could happen is almost a year away. Till then, there will be insurmountable challenges. One, of course, is keeping the nation’s human resource healthy. The other will be the health of the economy itself, which needs to be oxygenated, for more people could die out of poverty, joblessness and food crisis than the virus itself. The economy will be on a slow run for a while, just to keep going. But short-term measures and holding strategies are needed before one can look at aligning them with or even conceive of long-term structural reforms. In the first stage, both the Centre and the States are looking for ways to get the April harvest going so that standing crops do not go waste and there is no food scarcity a couple of months down the line. The flight of migrant labour has worsened manpower strength and the increasing disease burden may endanger harvesting in high cluster States. While the so-called green zones, or States where the virus has had minimal impact, might be given the go-ahead, pool testing will be needed in affected States, for example Punjab, to work out safe areas where harvesting and processing can resume. There will be added disinfection and hygiene protocols that will add to input costs, be it in agriculture or industrial units. While agriculture will give us basic food, units producing essential items need to get going, like pharma, chemicals, packaged food items, soaps and detergents as well as the dairy sector. With units running below capacity due to the lockdown, their owners are facing multiple issues — from struggling to get permissions from each State Government for operations, to finding labourers, who have either taken a journey home or are unable to report to work due to the strict enforcement of stay-at-home orders, and finally closing gaps in the existing supply and distribution chain. Here, too, the Government is considering a staggered resumption, grading permits Statewise depending on the spread of COVID-19.

Clearly, there’s a need for a Central intervention to boost production and keep to health protocols uniformly. So the Government is taking recourse to an Independence era law; it wants to amend the Factories Act, 1948. The amendment calls for extending the working hours of healthy workers — from the current eight hours, six days a week (or 48 hours) to 12 hours, six days a week (72 hours). Besides, the workers would be paid in consonance with the number of hours. This will not only speed up production but can also ensure limited physical movement of the workers, thus saving them from the prospect of being exposed. It would also mean restarting production lines to a higher capacity. Of course, everybody is looking at a big stimulus package, one that ensures working capital, particularly to micro, small and medium enterprises, and saves jobs. Mind you the bigger manufacturing sectors — construction, infrastructure, automobiles, transport, consumer goods, real estate — are already on pause button. The emergent growth drivers like travel and tourism have flatlined already. In such a scenario, there is no big push from anywhere, merely a subsistence formula that can just about keep the economy greased for running when required. The impact of the lockdown, joblessness and furloughs means there will be a larger weakening of domestic demand and disruptions in the financial market. Some experts have suggested borrowing not only from the market but knocking on the RBI’s door. These are indeed tough decisions that require collective wisdom more than anything else. Of course, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already initiated a consultative process with industry captains and financial experts, including his predecessor and undoubtedly a top economic brain, Manmohan Singh. Even former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has sunk his differences with the present regime, saying he is prepared to help a COVID-stressed Indian economy if asked. In fact, just like cooperative federalism that is on full display, India needs a council of economic warriors for a cohesive battle strategy.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-long-march-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-long-march.html
2,13-4-20,Women warriors,"Be it as scientists, guinea pigs for human trials or community helpers, women are battling the virus from the front

India has undoubtedly woken up to the spirit of humanity as evidenced by an entire civil army of Corona warriors, who are helping the medical fraternity and administration rein in the spiral. What is unprecedented, though, is the extent of participation of women around the country in the fight against the virus. First at the frontline are nurses and care givers, who are separated from their families while handling the epidemic, contracting the infection and yet discharging their duties. Then there are three women constables from Delhi’s Greater Kailash Police station, who are working tirelessly with a sewing machine to stitch cloth masks for the poor who are unable to afford them. Not only are they stitching them, they are sanitising the finished products by soaking them in a solution of water and sodium hypochlorite, before ironing them and distributing the masks to labourers and those living in slum clusters. Together, the trio of (s)heroes in uniform has made and distributed around 200 masks. Some women volunteers in distant towns are donning protective suits to help the police enforce the lockdown and social distancing protocols. Everyone knows about Minal Bhosale, a virologist from Pune, who created the first Indian testing kit for the virus and gave birth to a daughter the day after she finished it. Internationally, too, the contribution of women in this fight against the virus is noteworthy. There are teams of women scientists who are working round-the-clock in the race for a vaccine. Rebecca Sirull was the first human to sign up for a vaccine trial. Turning oneself into a guinea pig needs some courage, more so if one has dependents. But Rebecca took that risk, ignoring side effects. In China’s Wuhan district, female medics shaved their heads so that they could perform better and in an efficient manner, preventing the spread of the virus which thrives in hair. These are just a few examples of courage and dedication.

The lockdown has created a tougher situation for women working professionals. With the call for social distancing, families are now holed up together 24x7 and must attempt to carry on with their professional lives while assuming household duties as well. Women now have to work from home as well as work for their homes. With an inherent sexism still latent in many households, most women aren’t lucky enough to have progressive and supportive partners who would readily extend a helping hand and share the workload. In the medical community, too, women have turned out to be more resilient to the impact of the virus and research is showing that more men succumb to it than women because of their inherent immunity and strength. Time the world recognises that there is nothing called gendered roles anymore.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/women-warriors.html
3,13-4-20,An unreliable shield,"Since the subsidy given to rice farmers has exceeded 10 per cent, India has violated its WTO commitment and invoked the ‘peace clause.' But how much immunity will this give to it?

In a notification submitted to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) — the multilateral body which binds member countries to a common set of rules with regard to trade in goods and services with “fairness” and “non-discrimination” as its underlying principles — India has informed that the value of its rice production during 2018-19 marketing year was $43.67 billion and for that, it provided subsidies worth $5 billion. This works out to 11.4 per cent of the value of rice production.

Under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the WTO, a developing country cannot give aggregate measurement support (AMS) — an acronym for subsidies in WTO parlance — in excess of 10 per cent of the value of its agricultural production. The AMS includes “product-specific” subsidies and “non-product specific” viz. subsidies on agricultural inputs like fertilisers, seed, irrigation and power.

The “product-specific” subsidy is excess of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) paid to farmers over the External Reference Price (ERP) multiplied by the quantum of agri-produce. Whereas the MSP is taken for that very year, say, 2018-19, the ERP is the average of the international price prevailing during 1986-88 fixed in rupee terms. The “non-product specific” subsidies are money spent by the Government on schemes to supply agricultural inputs at subsidised rates. Compliance has to be ensured both for individual crop as well as at the aggregate level. For instance, the subsidy on rice should remain below 10 per cent of its production value. Besides, the sum total of subsidy on all crops, say rice, wheat and coarse cereals should not exceed 10 per cent of agri-production value. This rules out a scenario whereby a country gives more on one crop, say 15 per cent on rice, and yet keeps aggregate subsidy within the 10 per cent threshold by giving less on another crop.

Since, the subsidy given to rice farmers in 2018-19 at 11.4 per cent of production value exceeded 10 per cent, India has violated its commitment under the WTO. The breach is open to challenge by other members. However, it has invoked the “peace clause” to seek immunity from action. The Indian request will come up for consideration in the WTO Committee on Agriculture (CoA).

So, what is the “peace clause”? Does it provide an effective shield? Will the CoA allow its benefit? Can India explore other options?

India runs a mammoth programme of Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes. Under it, agencies of the Government viz. Food Corporation of India (FCI) and so on, buy agri-produce from the farmers at MSP (notified by the union) and distribute through a network of fair price shops to meet the food security needs of India’s poor and vulnerable population at affordable price. Since, MSP is higher than ERP, the excess is deemed as subsidy.

Developing countries, with India leading from the front, have consistently argued at the WTO that since the Public Stockholding is intended to serve the food security objective and does not cause any distortion in international trade, subsidies given under this programme should be exempt from commitment under the AoA. The ninth WTO ministerial in Bali (2013) agreed to a “peace clause” under which “if a developing country gives AMS in excess of 10 per cent, no member will challenge this until 2017 when WTO would look for a permanent solution to address their food security concerns”.

The peace clause came with a plethora of conditions viz., submission of data on food procurement, stockholding, distribution and subsidies (including their computation) and do on. These also included establishing that subsidies are not “trade distorting.” Moreover, it intended to cover only the schemes existing at the time of the Bali declaration.

The peace clause was intended to be a “stop gap” arrangement that should have ended in 2017 by which time, a permanent solution should have been in place. But that was not to be. In December, 2014, the WTO-General Council (GC) approved “extension of the peace clause till a permanent solution was found.” This meant indefinite deferment of the permanent solution and perpetual dependence of developing countries on the “peace clause.” In the WTO-GC meeting in Geneva on July 31, 2014, India had insisted on a time-bound action plan to find a permanent solution, to be executed before the end of 2014 co-terminus with approval of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) — an area of great importance to developed countries. In December, 2014 GC even as the latter got away with the TFA, the former was merely handed out a “peace clause” and that, too, with a plethora of riders.

That the permanent solution route was more or less closed, it was also evident from the 10th ministerial in Nairobi (December, 2015) when it decided that “negotiations on the subject shall be held in the CoA, which will be distinct from the ongoing agriculture negotiations under the Doha Development Round (DDR).” The mandate of CoA normally being routine matters, it was naive to expect from it a far-reaching policy decision. In the 11th WTO — ministerial held in Buenos Aires (December 2017), the DDR was dumped.

Coming to India’s request seeking refuge under the peace clause against breach of subsidy ceiling, now the CoA will examine it in the light of conditions appended to it. Considering that the US has been lambasting India for alleged under-reporting of its subsidies, it is unlikely to be a smooth sail.

In a notification to the WTO in March, 2018, India had reported AMS of about Rs 12,000 crore on rice or 5.45 per cent of production value during 2013-14, whereas, on wheat, AMS was Rs 5,000 crore or 3.53 per cent of production value. In a counter-claim made to the CoA (May, 2018), the US stated that during 2013-14, Indian AMS on rice was Rs 1,78,000 crore, or 77 per cent of production value and on wheat, it was Rs 96,500 crore, or 65.3 per cent of production value. The gap is due to vastly different methodologies used by India and the US.

For arriving at AMS, India rightly compares MRP with ERP of the same year; considers quantities procured for public stock holding; excludes price support provided to resource poor farmers who produce food mostly for self-consumption. On the other hand, the US uses ERP of over three decades back; considers even quantities not procured by agencies and ignores exemption to resource-poor farmers. There are inherent flaws in the US calculation. Relating the current MSP to international price prevailing in 1986-88 is not only illogical but is outright absurd; it inevitably results in “artificially” inflated subsidy. The benefit of MSP is not available to quantities not procured from farmers; yet the US has included these in its calculations.

The resource-poor farmers produce food for their own consumption; hence, there is no question of subsidy given to them distorting trade. Yet, the US has not excluded subsidy support to them from the calculation.

In the CoA, the US is bound to stick to its calculation and on that basis argue that the 11.4 per cent reported by India for 2018-19 (in case of rice) is a gross under-statement. The Government should pull out all stops to counter the American claim. It needs to go a step forward to even challenge the formula that got embedded in the AoA (ERP frozen at 1986-88 level was part of the agreement).

Correcting the anomalies in the methodology of calculating AMS should be at the core of finding a permanent solution; that process should be resurrected and taken to its logical end. Post-correction, the subsidy figures will automatically come to much less than 10 per cent (as in 2013-14) or marginally higher (as in 2018-19). Small variations are more likely to be condoned and even if retaliatory action is sanctioned, that will entail much less pain. In any case, this would be far better than letting anomalies continue leading to inflated subsidy and need to take refuge under an unreliable peace clause.

India also needs to mount a sustained diplomatic offensive to counter US efforts at the WTO to do away with the extant Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) available to developing members which enable less than reciprocal commitments such as 10 per cent threshold for agri-subsidies (for developed countries, the threshold is five per cent). If, S&DT goes, India will have to limit its subsidies to less than five per cent. Meanwhile, the Government should take up restructuring its subsisting subsidy regime. Instead of subsidising agri-inputs and MSP to farmers which are treated as “actionable” subsidies, it should consider direct cash transfers to farmers similar to developed countries of US and EU. While, ensuring compliance with WTO rules, this will also help in eliminating inefficiencies and misuse that are germane to present subsidy and price support regime. A collateral gain will be by way of pruning payments and helping fiscal discipline.

4,13-4-20,A new normal is emerging,"The social narrative itself will need to change. Perceptions will have to alter. The frameworks of reference will have to shift

When information has reasonable chances of being accurate and comes from a knowledgeable source and that authority cannot be identified, it is customary to say that the information being provided is from a “reliable source.” Hence, as per usually reliable sources, so far as Covid-19 is concerned, the coming week-10 days are crucial to come to a reasonable conclusion on the trends of the pandemic.

Be that as it may, it is obvious that when the Coronavirus passes into the corridors of time, the kind of world which would then have emerged would not be exactly the same as the one which experienced the onslaught of the pandemic.

To put it simply, as has been pointed out by some thinkers, many in the world today are really in the mode of grieving the death of the normal; of life as we know it. Life no longer begins with the morning routine of rush or leisure, depending upon whether one is exercising or not. Breakfast doesn’t follow necessarily at the same hour and one is not rushing out of doors to take some transport/or drive to the place of work/school/college. The rest follows. There is no further rush in the morning. The upper three-four per cent of the Indian population may or may not be opening their computers, laptops or otherwise. There may or may not be a protocol to attend and there may or may not be a webinar or a briefing.

Couples who barely found time to catch up with each other’s welfare now have to spend all the time indoors. Sometimes there are dependents; the elderly or the young who are thrown into the mix together. Some are isolated alone, their lifeline cut off. Clearly these times do not fulfil a forecast. No book on futurology, no, not even the most accomplished soothsayers had forecast this pandemic.

The contradictions, as are usual in a time like this, are many. If one cleans the hands with sanitiser there is a television feature which warns against the skin going dry and the Coronavirus, even though dead, continuing to be lodged there with its own complications. The basic question remains to what extent is the cleaning of the hands with a sanitiser a valid and a safe hygiene effort?

Gloves have also been equally touted and warned about. Gloves are selling at a premium and even getting them is a problem because stirring out of the house may invite the wrath of the regulatory agencies who may not appreciate the legitimacy of a walk for gloves. Even the gloves obtained in such a manner draw a mixed reaction from commentators. There are features which say that even if you hold a headset with gloves it is possible that you may have touched your face with the glove covered fingers and the transference of the virus would has already taken place. The protocols of transfer vary in versions.

The list can be endless and if “commentary” is a legitimate exercise in the era of Covid-19 a rhetorical question would be acceptable because it is valid. The regulatory agencies would have an obligation to spell out some standards. The question remains about what parameters to use to recognise the valid use of gloves, sanitisers and masks? It doesn’t take a genius to answer this question. Obviously some common sense has to be applied. Only that “common sense” across 10 individuals need not necessarily have an algorithm.

When common sense varies from person to person then it may be valid to point out that it could become the basis of not so pleasant a conversation among people having to share the same space. Social systems could vary from one location to another because the people there would have variances in patterns of interpersonal relationships. This would lead to each cluster becoming like a “zoo of interpersonal relations”, bound by space and time.

The long and short of it is, some basics in hygiene, say of social distancing may need time for sociological platforms to evolve, to an acceptable level of consensus. Till then, discussions, arguments and worse will become more common between two contending parties. Many sociologists will testify that this has a potential of turning into a very difficult social situation.

The ultimate resolution of the contending views in the preceding paragraph (and there are many others) will show that it is possibly a social tinderbox situation.

The challenges are so many and on so many fronts that any governance system will find itself stretched. The delivery systems will have their own overtones.

Perhaps, the social narrative itself will need to change. Perceptions will have to alter. The frameworks of reference will have to shift. One can no longer talk of being “stuck” at home. One should think of being “safe” at home. This is a new overtone for an experience which is unique. In the common parlance of human societal structure, it is lifestyles not only for work but also entertainment and often of rituals,that need a quick re-look.

5,13-4-20,Prepare for the return of the global workforce,"Mass return of expatriates can be expected due to the Coronavirus outbreak and the Govt at all levels should make contingency plans and programmes, in particular where States or local authorities are unprepared or unable to assist the returning Indian diaspora

Currently, we are witnessing the pandemic of the century and almost the whole world is in a lockdown. The lives and livelihoods of millions are in peril. Even the so-called developed countries of the West have been unable to contain the Coronavirus. In all nations, the worst-affected by the shutdowns are the migrant blue collar workers and their families as they are the most vulnerable, unorganised and exploited.

Indians being the largest migrant workforce in the world will be the worst impacted. Last year, the diaspora’s remittance was to the tune of $80 billion but what it will be this year is anybody’s guess. Frightening reports have started pouring in from different parts of the world related to the causalities suffered by Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). As the healthcare sector is at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, the large number of Indian doctors, nurses, paramedics working around the globe will be the worst hit. Most of them are at risk due to the non-availability or shortage of the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) needed to fight the pandemic, even in developed nations.

Envisaging such disasters and conflict in 2015-16, the Migrants in Countries in Crisis (MICIC) Initiative developed guidelines to protect expatriates through an inclusive consultative process. They provide concrete and practical guidance to stakeholders at the local, national, regional and international levels on how to prepare for and respond to crises in ways that protect and empower migrants, leverage their capacities and help expatriates and communities recover from crises. The guidelines address the full cycle, i.e, crisis preparedness, emergency response and post-crisis action.

Interventions, policies and structures to assist and protect immigrants during the emergency phase of conflicts and natural disasters are best set up in times of peace, before a crisis occurs, with expatriates being integrated into and involved in disaster and crisis management planning. The Sendai Framework for Action 2015-2030, adopted at the UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, underlines the need for a holistic approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR). Unfortunately, our preparedness in this regard for the Indian diaspora, as we all know, is non-existent.

Promoting, respecting and protecting the rights of immigrants at all times to facilitate their inclusion, mitigate their vulnerabilities, empower them to better protect themselves and their community in the event of a crisis, is vital.

The following are some salient points for dealing with this outbreak with an earnest request for a detailed DRR plan at all our Missions abroad for future crisis management.

Task groups should be readied for collecting and sharing data on immigrants via local networks and diaspora groups and with smart tools such as web applications and social media. This data should include information on migrant profiles (including sex, age, status and job) and contact details. While respecting data protection laws, speedy procedures are required to regulate data sharing in times of emergency.

Emergency hotlines should be established in all the Missions especially the Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries with officers to handle the major regional languages of India. Periodical advisories must be released in all the major Indian languages.

In order to provide assistance in times of crisis, it is crucial to have information on where migrants are located. Mapping must be done and should include categories for temporary and permanent immigrants, irregular undocumented residents, students and tourists.

Creative communication channels must be used to raise awareness and improve the integration of irregular migrants, as they are the worst hit.

User-friendly registration systems should be evolved for individuals and groups, especially the vulnerable sections of the undocumented or illegal immigrants.

In coordination with the governments, lists must be prepared of facilities where migrants could be accommodated, like shelters, isolation and quarantine areas. This includes a special area for women and children.

Integrating immigrants into professional and voluntary emergency and rescue services constitutes a concrete way to better adapt communication channels and services. This must be done in a way that takes into account language and the culture of migrant communities and shares knowledge between relief services and expatriate communities. Sufficient orientation and training should be imparted to professional and voluntary emergency and rescue workers to address the specific needs of immigrants in times of crisis.

Training sessions in schools or at workplaces and booklets and brochures also represent valuable information sharing trajectories. Advisories by the Missions disseminating information about emergency procedures and contacts to migrants in the mother tongue is a must.

Local administrations generally work more closely with affected populations than the Missions and the Government and can be included in institutional cooperation from the beginning in order to make use of their ability to reach out to the affected diaspora.

To inform migrants where shelters/isolation/quarantine centres are located, awareness programmes about consular offices and shelters should be held.

It is also vital to coordinate with other governments to ensure efficient mass evacuation plans for those who want to return, especially those with irregular papers or illegal immigrants.

Planning for return and reintegration as well as for other long-term needs of immigrants must start now, as essential components of recovery plans. Mass returns of expatriates can be expected and the Government at all levels should make contingency plans and programmes, in particular where States or local authorities are unprepared or unable to assist the returning workforce.

6,13-4-20,Woman throws five kids into Ganga,"



|

Five children were feared dead after they were taken to Jehangirabad ghat and pushed into Ganga river by their mother in Bhadohi district in the early hours of Sunday.

Later, the woman too tried to kill herself by jumping into the river but was swept away to the bank by the current.

Upon reaching her home, the woman informed her neighbours of the incident, who in turn informed the police. Later senior officials rushed to the spot and divers were pressed into service to trace out the missing children.

The woman was arrested and the police said that she seemed to be mentally unsound. Her husband, who had left for his workplace to Jharkhand on Saturday night, later returned home.

The woman also told her neighbours that she and her children were on the verge of starvation due to the lockdown and since she was a daily wager, due to lack of work she did not have any money left in the house.

However, some locals claimed that the woman had an argument with her husband over meeting out daily expenses and feed the children after which he left for Jharkhand.

As per reports, Mridul Yadav aka Munna of Jehangirabad area was living with his wife Manju Yadav and five children — Shanker (6), Keshav (3), Arti (11) , Saraswati (7) and Mateshwari (5). Early Sunday morning, while Munna was away, his wife took all five children to Jahengirabad ghat and threw them in the river before jumping into the river.

She, however, swam across but the children were feared dead. She kept sitting there for some time before returning home and narrating the tragedy to her neighbours.

14,13-4-20,WB extends time for Odisha disaster project,"Looking at the emergency situation due to Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19), the World Bank has extended the period of Odisha Disaster Recovery Project (ODRP) for another three months.

The ODRP was to end on March 31 but has been extended to June 30, providing a cushioning period for the State Government to utilise funds available under the programme.

World Bank India Director Junaid Kamal Ahmed informed the Ministry of Finance in this regard.

Earlier, the Government of Odisha had requested the Union Government to extend the ODRP period for another one year keeping an emergency situation like COVID-19.

The State Government had approached the Centre to impress upon the World Bank to extend the ODRP up to March 31, 2021 and allow the State administration to utilise Rs 310 crore to combat the COVID-19.

The World Bank was to reallocate the funds for contingent emergency response to contain spread of the COVID-19.

However, the World Bank has extended the period for another three months instead of one year and has asked the State Government to close the project by June 30, 2020.

The State Government was implementing ODRP for two Phailin hit blocks of Puri districts like Krushna Prasad and Brahmagiri.

Previously, the ODRP was implemented in Ganjam and Khordha, both the districts were badly hit by Phailin in 2013.

Now with the Union Government having declared COVID-19 as a national disaster, the State Government has approached the Union Ministry of Finance to allow ODRP funds for handling an emergency situation to contain spread of COVID-19.

Finance Secretary Ashok Kumar Meena is in touch with senior officers of the Union Ministry of Finance.

Meena had written a letter to the Department of Economic Affairs to consider the case as the State Government is fighting a grim battle against COVID-19.

Under this back drop, the State Government is expecting a positive response from the World Bank so that funds available in ODRP would be utilised for containment of COVID-19 in Odisha, sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wb-extends-time-for-odisha-disaster-project.html

Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu shot off two letters to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding Rs 50 lakh as compensation for safai karmacharis who died while working, and also insurance cover and protective gears for media persons working along with the corona warriors in the state.

In his 3-point charter of demands for media persons, the Congress leader said that all media persons be provided face masks and sanitisers along with insurance cover of at least Rs 25 lakh.

Lastly, the UP Congress chief said that it was being reported regularly that security personnel were harassing media persons for performing their duties and this should be stopped immediately.

In another letter to the chief minister, the UPCC president expressed concern over the death of safai karmacharis during work and said that it was shameful that many safai karamcharis died while working in inhuman condition.

18,13-4-20,Educational institutions asked to start on-line classes,"



|

With the possibility of extension of lockdown looming large, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked all educational institutions to start on-line teaching so that students may complete their courses within stipulated time and their session is not further delayed.

“Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked principal secretaries of higher education, vocational education, medical education, technical education and agricultural education departments to start on-line courses so that students do not suffer in completing their courses during lockdown,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters in Lucknow on Sunday.

He was briefing media persons about decisions taken by the chief minister during his meeting with Team-11 in Lucknow.

Awasthi said that the chief minister voiced concern over students losing out on their studies because of the lockdown.

“Therefore, all higher educational institutes should prepare an on-line facility for their students to complete their respective courses,” Yogi told the officials.

The chief minister appreciated the move of the Chandrashekhar Azad Agriculture University in Kanpur, which contributed a lot in on-line teaching of students and even made 250 contents and passed on over 4,000 study material through WhatsApp to the students. Besides, the university also prepared e-timetable for students.

In another important decision, the chief minister directed officials to make arrangements for the purchase of wheat from farmers at their doorstep on minimum support price (MSP) so that they did not have to go to mandis to sell their produce and expose themselves to coronavirus infection.

The government also suggested that private flour mills and other private companies could also purchase wheat from the farmers at their doorstep only on MSP.

“The chief minister clearly said that the farmers should not have any problems in harvesting and selling their produce. Already, around 40 per cent of harvesting has been completed in the state and to prevent any problem to the farmers, officials of Agriculture department should go to the farmers’ doorstep to purchase wheat or other produce, “Awasthi said.

In the meeting, the chief minister said that no public function should be held on Dr BR Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14 or public celebration of any festival in the coming week.

“We have to ensure that people celebrate all functions in their homes during the lockdown,” he said.

Yogi also appealed to students, government employees and parents to download Arogya App, which has proved to be an important instrument in knowing about the status of COVID-19 cases in India.

He also asked officials to take stern action against hoarders and black-marketers.

The Excise department was asked to take action against bootleggers.

“There are reports that illegal brew is being prepared and sold. The department should carry out a three-day exercise to check the malaise,” Yogi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/educational-institutions-asked-to-start-on-line-classes.html
19,13-4-20,UP govt may divide state into red and green zones,"



To make the fight against coronavirus more decisive, the Uttar Pradesh government may divide the state into two zones, red and green, depending on the number of COVID-19 cases reported from these regions, and impose restrictions accordingly.

The suggestion was mooted at a meeting that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had with his two deputies Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya in Lucknow on Sunday.

The probability of lockdown extension and other issues were discussed in the meeting which lasted for around an hour.

A senior official said that the government was going for micro planning to control the spread of coronavirus and therefore it was decided to compartmentalise the state into red and green zones, depending on the COVID-19 cases reported from districts, and restrict movement between the two zones.

“At present, 41 districts have reported coronavirus positive cases and the rest 34 are coronavirus-free. With the division, it would be easy for the district administration to impose restrictions. Vigil could be intensified in districts reporting coronavirus cases and it could be relaxed in coronavirus-free areas,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

The official further said that the district administration may allow industrial production in green zone and give more relaxation to the people while in red zone, restrictions would be imposed strictly but it would be mandatory for the residents to use masks in both zones.

What prompted the state government to go in for stricter norms is the way the number of coronavirus hotspots spiked from 102 a couple of days back to 135 on Sunday. These hotspots account for the bulk of coronavirus cases. Of the 480 cases reported in UP, 342 are from these hotspots only.

“We have done our planning down to the micro level. We know that 15 districts are the problematic ones and therefore movement of vehicles has been restricted and whosoever comes out of their homes will be booked,” he said.

Meanwhile, the government has registered 15,378 FIRs against 48,503 people for violation of lockdown while 485 persons have been booked in 385 FIRs under Essential Commodities Act for black-marketing and hoarding in the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-may-divide-state-into-red-and-green-zones.html
20,13-4-20,"Save economy, provide stimulus package: UCCI","The Utkal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UCCI) has welcomed the extension of the lockdown till April 30 to combat the rapidly-spreading COVID-19 pandemic, but at the same time, in a letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has voiced concerns about the State’s economy and said that some sectors need special attention for their survival.

The UCCI, an apex chamber representing major, medium, small, minor industries as well as trade and commerce, said the major issue before all businesses during the lockdown is logistics, without which no one can plan, execute manufacturing or provide services.

“Seamless transportation is a necessity, for which instructions, across the line, should be issued for allowing transportation activities because overenthusiastic villagers at many places are causing trouble,” UCCI president Ramesh Mahapatra said in the letter to the CM.

He said major industries are facing the problem of transporting raw materials to factories and extraction of finished goods.

Similarly, acute labour shortages in factories, warehouses, transport sector and distribution have broken the supply chain to a great extent, Mahapatra said.

This is a grey area which needs to be handled after the lockdown is lifted; but even now, certain allowable activities should be continued, he said.

With the closure of most of the establishments, payment of wages to employees has become difficult since the lockdown measures have severely impacted cash flows; and many establishments might close down their businesses if they are unable to comply with the labour department directive. “We request the State Government to look into the directive again as the lockdown has been extended,” he said, adding, “We sincerely appeal that the wages should be paid at a reduced rate for at least six months.”

The UCCI also urged the Government to waive the demand charges and also the electricity duties for the lockdown period and claimed that similar steps have been taken in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat.

“To induce cash flow into the business, we propose to provide loan against GST paid by the business at 3% rate of interest,” Mahapatra said.

The hotel and tourism sector is the worst-hit, he said, adding that suitable revival packages would bring back the industry on a survival path.

Therefore, excise fees, levies, taxes, and power and water charges should be waived for the tourism, travel and hospitality industry for the April-June 2020 quarter, he said.

Prawn farming has also suffered a major blow because of the closure or partial running of processing plants, he said, adding that a suitable stimulus package to the fishing community, fish farmers and processors may be considered.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/save-economy--provide-stimulus-package--ucci.html

It is seen that the licenced shops are closed from front side, but these products are available at the backdoors of the same shops at higher prices. As the supply of the licence liquor have been banned during this period, duplicate and illicit liquors are being sold here, alleged sources.

The country liquor is cooked in the outskirts of Athagarh, Tigiria and Banki areas in the manner of running a cottage industry and sold in at least three times higher prices than before. Similarly ganja is sold by black marketers in most of the chowks and markets of Athagarh and Banki. This apart, gutkhas are sold in double or triple their usual prices in most of the betel shops which are locked from front side but opened in backside.

The black marketers in connivance with some unscrupulous Excise officials here are running the business even during the lockdown period and do not go for raiding any such counters. It is also alleged that local police also know the matter but remain silent for vested interest.

Apart from testing people for the Covid-19, the city health department and Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC) are coordinating to test the people in the affected areas for jaundice also to provide treatment, a top official said.

However, what is seen is the violators are left scot-free.

Shocking visuals in Umarkote town shows people thronging market without respecting social distancing norm. To avoid over crowding, the local administration has set up two places for the daily market in the town. But due to non deployment of any police personnel here, the people are openly flouting the norms of social distancing. They are even found without wearing the masks.

The cleanliness drive of the civic body in the town is eyewash, as no work has been done on ground. Garbage piling up on the roads and overflowing drains reflect the sorry state of affairs on the sanitation front posing a threat of outbreak of the diseases. Some local NGOs and politicians are seen in abundance here distributing food packets as a mark of help to the needy in the town but it seems they are after more publicity rather than service.

They are taking undue advantage of the situation and uploading the photograpy of the distribution in different social media making a mockery of the poor and needy.

Similar is the condition in the village level to expedite quarantine facilities in rural areas. The panchayats have been provided Rs 5 lakh each by the Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water Department. The Panchayat officers ( POs) at the panchayat level are instructed to supervise all the facilities under the strict surveillance of the Block Development Officers and district authority.

Due to nationwide lockdown near about 32 nomads of Maharastra are detained in an isolation center at Benora Panchayat but they are in a pathetic condition. They are provided with only two rooms by the officials defying the social distancing norms. On the first day they were provided with some dry foods and a financial aid of Rs 2,000 by the SP with an assurance to get all types of helps.

The quarantine house installed in a school in the panchayat has thirty beds having no bed sheet and pillow. The workers engaged for the management of quarantine house alleged that they have been provided with only two hand sanitizers without any adequate protective equipment for them.

For the sake of their safety, they purchased masks from their own pocket , said the workers.

In Taranga Panchayat there are 150 distresed people. But there is free kitchen for 99 people only. Similarly in Hirapur and Singsari Panchayat they prepare only 15 to 20 meals whereas the sick and indigent people are found in more numbers.

When asked, the officials revealed that they are managing with the existing finance of the panchayat received from the Block office.

27,13-4-20,"Cutting across party lines, leaders condemn attack on cops","Cutting across party lines, political leaders on Sunday condemned the brutal attack on the Punjab police by a group of nihangs in Patiala while seeking strict action against the perpetrators of the crime.

In a shocking incident on Sunday morning, an officer’s hand was chopped off with a sword and two other Punjab policemen injured when a group of nihangs attacked them after being asked to show curfew passes at a vegetable market in Patiala district.

Eleven people, including five attackers, were arrested hours later after an exchange of fire at a gurdwara where the group fled after the 6.15 am incident in Sanaur town.

Reacting to the incident, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh asked police to take strict action against law-breakers. “Police Party on Naka duty was attacked today in which one ASI's hand was cut off and 6 were injured. Police cornered the culprits and have taken them into custody. Have given instructions to the @PunjabPoliceInd to deal with anyone breaking the law in strictest possible manner,” the CM tweeted.

Akali stalwart and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal too condemned the attack, saying, “There is no place for violence in a civilized society.”

Badal said that the police throughout the country have been performing a difficult task most selflessly. The five-time CM urged the people to cooperate with the Centre and the State Government against the coronavirus outbreak.

Describing the incident as barbaric, Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal sought action against “those who break the law”.

“The barbaric attack on cops by anti-social elements at Subji Mandi in Patiala is condemnable. All necessary steps should be taken to maintain law and order and everyone should cooperate with authorities. Those taking law into their own hands like this should be dealt with severely,” Sukhbir tweeted.

Flaying the brutal attack, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Gobind Singh Longowal asked the people to follow the curfew restrictions.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state unit chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann demanded “strictest action” against the accused.

Senior advocate and AAP’s former Dakha MLA HS Phoolka sought “exemplary punishment” for the accused. “As culprits are arrested now, file charge sheet in two days and request court to complete trial within a week. It’s attempt to murder with injury, life imprisonment is maximum punishment. Culprits should be awarded life imprisonment to send a message,” he tweeted.

Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal also demanded strict time-bound action against the accused and urged people to cooperate with the authorities amid the lockdown. “The shocking #attack on cops by anti- social elements at Sabji Mandi in #Patiala has shaken everyone. Strict time bound action & punishment should be given to these goons. I appeal to everyone to cooperate with the civil & police admn in these difficult times,” she tweeted.

Condemning the inhuman attack, another Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri demanded an “exemplary punishment” for the members of a Sikh sect saying that “such criminals and anarchists” should be brought to justice at the earliest.

“The inhuman attack on policemen in Patiala needs to be condemned in the strongest of terms. Such criminals and anarchists should be brought to justice at the earliest. They deserve exemplary punishment,” he tweeted.

THREE CASES REGISTRED

Three separate cases — one regarding the attack on police party at Sabzi Mandi, second regarding Gurudwara incident, and third under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act — have been registered against the accused.

The first has been registered at Sadar Patiala police station for attempt to murder, grievous hurt, rioting, attack on public servant under the Indian penal Code (IPC), and also under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 against Balwinder Singh, Jagmeet Singh, Bant Singh and Nirbhav Singh.

SEVERED HAND OF POLICE OFFICER RE-IMPLANTED

After nearly eight hours of surgery, a team of doctors at the PGI on Sunday successfully re-implanted the left hand of Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of Punjab Police that was chopped off in a clash by Nihang Sikhs in Patiala.

The 50-year-old patient had an amputation through the proximal wrist of left hand, the PGI said in a statement.

The reimplantation was started around 10 a.m. after initial preparation of the amputated part. Both radial and ulnar arteries, the vena comitantes and an extra dorsal vein were anastomosed (reconnection of blood verssels). All the flexors and extensor tendons were repaired, the statement said.

All the nerves at the wrist required bony fixation done using three K-wires. The approximate time taken was about 7.5 hours. The PGI said this was technically very complex and challenging surgery, which was successfully done. It was evaluated at the end of surgery that hand is viable, warm with good circulation, it added.

After a phone call from Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta, PGI Director Jagat Ram activated the emergency team at Advanced Trauma centre and he gave the responsibility to Ramesh Sharma, Head Department of Plastic Surgery, for hand re-implantation.

The surgery team comprised Sunil Gaba, Jerry R. John, Suraj Nair, Mayank, Chandra, Shubendu, Ankur, Abhishek and Purnima, while the nursing team comprised Arvind, Sneha and Arsh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cutting-across-party-lines--leaders-condemn-attack-on-cops.html

29,13-4-20,"Capt appeals people to stay indoors on Baisakhi, deliver Ardas from home","Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder on Sunday appealed to the people to pray (deliver ardas) at 11 am on Monday, on the occasion of Baisakhi, from their homes for the State’s victory over the deadly Covid-19 enemy, for the protection of their children and the future generations.

Capt Amarinder, in a Baisakhi eve message to the people of Punjab, said that this was a different Baisakhi in view of the coronavirus pandemic as a result of which people could not go out to celebrate the festival with traditional fervor, in large congregations.

“It is necessary for all to stay at home, in this difficult time, and observe the occasion with prayers for the total elimination of Covid-19 from the state,” he said.

“Let us pray to Wahe Guru to keep us, and our Punjab, in the Charhdi Kala, to keep us safe and happy always,” urged the Chief Minister, pointing out that even the Akal Takht and SGPC had appealed to the people not to congregate or gather outside to celebrate Baisakhi this year.

Expressing the hope and confidence that Punjab would be victorious over pandemic, Capt Amarinder appealed to the people to do their duty in this battle, just as lakhs of frontline warriors were doing to keep them safe and protected.

He thanked the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, other health and sanitation workers, the police, the revenue staff, the religious organizations, the NGOs and everyone else engaged in fighting the battle at the frontline, putting their own lives on the line.

He also thanked the SSPs and the DCs for managing the situation so effectively and efficiently, and expressed the confidence that they would all continue to work relentlessly even in the coming days in the interest of Punjab and its people.

Pointing to the global Covid-19 crisis, the Chief Minister said that the situation was relatively better in Punjab, and in fact across India, due to the early lockdown or curfew and its strict enforcement. It was important to continue with these stringent and difficult measures, despite the inconvenience and frustration being caused to everyone, he added.

Underlining the need to continue with such strict restrictions, he cited various studies or research papers, models or expert opinion to stress that if we do not implement the lockdown in the coming days, the situation could get out of control.

“The numbers being projected by all these experts etc in the absence of isolation or lockdown are scary,” he pointed out.

Though there were some problems with the supply chain at the beginning of clampdown, things were now on track and would improve further in the coming days, said the Chief Minister, assuring every person in the State of his government’s full support in this hour of crisis.

He promised the migrant labourers and other poor or needy people that his government will continue to take care of them, and ensure that not a single one of them will go hungry, till the Covid-19 crisis ends.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-appeals-people-to-stay-indoors-on-baisakhi--deliver-ardas-from-home.html

31,13-4-20,BBSR needs more native trees to curb air pollution,"April 13 is the Foundation Day of Bhubaneswar. It was on this day in 1948 that India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had laid the foundation stone for the new capital city.

The Master Plan of Bhubaneswar was prepared by internationally acclaimed urban planner, Otto H Koenigsberger in 1948 for a population of 40,000 over an area of 16.48 sq km with a density of 10 to 12 families per acre. The city was developed on neighborhood principles. Each residential neighborhood is planned around an educational and recreational centre with open spaces for community functions.

Local shopping for every two sets of neighborhoods is grouped together with the intention of improving business prospects. The town centre consisted of the market building, weekly market, and daily market. Koenigsberger suggested seven types of roads – footpaths, parkways, cycle paths, minor housing streets, major housing streets, main roads and main arteries – for seven groups of users for seven different functions. The overall widths of land earmarked for roads determined by traffic and the requirements for storm water drainage services and avenue trees.

The city has now undergone various transformations. Bhubaneswar was a small sacred town in 1921 with population of 8,110 persons only. Later on the city became a class IV town and retained the same status until 1951. In 1951 the population increased to 16,512. Population further increased to 38,211 in 1961, 1,05,491 in 1971 and 2,19, 211 in 1981. In 1991 population was 4, 11,542.

Bhubaneswar got the NAC status in 1952. It became a Class III town in the next Census of 1961 and a Class I city with municipality status in 1971, depending on its population strength and other urban characteristics.

The city was declared a Municipal Corporation in the year 1994 and according to the 2001 census it accommodated 6,48,032 people in the city. As per the 2011 census, the population of Bhubaneswar is 837,737 and covers an area of 135 sqkm. The decadal growth rate of the city is 30.2 per cent indicating that Bhubaneswar is growing very fast.

To meet the changing needs, the city requires more land. Today, the city’s growth is so fast that it is spreading towards Khurda and Jatani. To formulate a meaningful physical development plan, to regulate and guide the urban growth in Bhubaneswar by 2030 in a planned and healthy manner, a Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) for Bhubaneswar Development Planned Area (BDPA) was prepared.

The city was declared as Smart City by the Government of India under its Smart City Mission in 2015. Bhubaneswar ranks number one in the smart city pilot project. American Planning Association awards Bhubaneswar Smart City Plan the 'Pierre L’Enfant International Planning Excellence Award' as part of the 2017 National Planning Excellence Awards. This award recognizes planning practices and efforts undertaken outside the United States to promote communities of lasting value. The award criteria are based on a set of goals developed by the Global Planners Network.

A vital component of a Smart City is sustainability, which may be threatened by extreme use of resources. This may result environmental degradation of the city. A report by the Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) revealed that pollutants in the ambient air were found to be far above the permissible limit at all the six pollution monitoring stations in the city, such as at Patrapada, the IRC village, the OSPCB office, the Capital police station, Rasulgarh and at the OSPCB laboratory in Chandrasekharpur.

Based on air pollution, the city is categorized into Highly Critical Areas, Moderately Critical Areas, and Critical Areas. Highly Critical Areas are Bhagabanpur, Patrapada, Aignia, Unit – 20, Shankarpur, Khandagiri, Udaygiri, Dumuduma and areas all along National Highway 5 and 203. Moderately Critical Areas are Core area of the city. Critical Areas are Jaganath prasad, Sundarpur, Chandrasekharpur, Bharatpur, Sampur, Malipada, Andharua areas of the city.

The State Pollution Control Board has analyzed daily pollution data from the manual monitors to indicate the proportion of days in a year that have exceeded the national ambient air quality standards for PM10 between 2008 and 2017. In Bhubaneswar the percentage of days violating the daily standards has increased from 26 per cent in 2008 to 45 per cent in 2017.

Control of vehicular pollution requires transportation and mobility strategies to reduce traffic volumes and total vehicle kilometers travelled in the city. Such action has already started in Bhubaneswar that includes bus sector reform, infrastructure for non-motorized transport (NMT), street design guidelines, transit oriented urban planning, parking management and electric mobility etc.

As per the Smart City Plan, Bhubaneswar Smart City Ltd has launched several schemes to advocate and implement NMT plan and policies. As part of the clean air action plan comprehensive street design guidelines and non-motorised transport policy may help to promote zero emissions mode and leverage the high share of walking and cycling practice.

Besides, there are number of native trees which can be able to trap pollutants in the city. The value of Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) of the native trees is important for the preparation of landscape development plan.

34,13-4-20,"Working from home? Follow these tips to avoid neck, back pain","As many people are working from home during the COVID-19 lockdown without a proper desk, they could be sitting in the wrong posture for hours which can lead to pain in the neck and lower back.

Health experts have suggested that simple tips like not taking their laptop to bed, taking adequate breaks and having a healthy diet can help you avoid these problems.

People should be extra careful not to fall sick during this period as the work from home mode and closure of gyms have disrupted physical activity schedules of many, the experts said.

""We should keep in mind that this lockdown period is for our safety from a disease, and doesn't allow us to be careless and invite other diseases like cervical pain, backache, arthritis etc.,"" Monu Singh, Senior Consultant in Orthopaedics at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram, told IANS.

""As people are not going out daily for office now, it has definitely broken their physical activity schedule including walking, gymming and to balance that schedule they should take out at least one hour everyday for routine exercise and other physical activities which can be done at home like yoga and other free hand exercises,"" he said.

The doctor suggested that while working from home people should use a table and chair, keep their back straight and posture right.

They should keep taking adequate breaks to avoid sitting for too long in front of a laptop or any screen for that matter, he said, adding that diet is extremely important in these times of restricted activity.

""Avoid snacking, don't keep munching unhealthy food, add more fruits and fibres to your daily meal with plenty of fluids and keep your calcium intake right,"" Singh said.

Subhash Jangid, Director and Unit Head, Bone & Joint Institute, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram has advised people to do neck stretching exercises and keep the neck and back muscles strong in this period of lockdown.

""People with cervical issues should avoid any heavy weights,"" Jangid said.

""For people with back problems, you can walk in your home. Make a schedule, fix a time and walk at a length for half-hour to stay active. In case you do not have ample space for a walk, take out your yoga mat or a bedsheet, you can do pilates or soft yoga poses to improve your core strength and stability,"" he said.

Some such exercises are - chair stand, single leg raise, heel raise, front plank on table.

People can also do a plank and a child's pose to gain strength for the back.

The doctor added that dancing is a great way of staying active and keeping the family bond strong.

Alternatively, one can do skipping, Zumba, yoga or pilates or floor exercises.

""Stand or walk around while talking over the phone, rather than sitting down,"" the doctor said.

According to Viju Thomas (PT), Head Of Department, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Department, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute in New Delhi, people who are working from home need to be more careful.

""Do 'Surya Namaskar' every morning and walk in your room. If one is already on therapy then be in contact with your physiotherapist and keep taking advice to follow,"" said Thomas.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/working-from-home--follow-these-tips-to-avoid-neck--back-pain.html
35,13-4-20,E-readership on the rise as publishers feel Covid-19 heat,"With limited opportunities for physical book sales, publishers across the world looking to meet targets with e-books.

""The COVID-19 impact is (affecting) and will affect book industry as well. Books are never treated as essential items, which they should be, during the lockdown to engage people while they are at home. E-books are likely to see a spike in sales, but that is still a tiny fraction of the total market. But at this time, we are trying to use different platforms to sell our e-books,"" Usha Jha, VP (Sales), Speaking Tiger, told IANS.

As per Speaking Tiger's VP Publishing, Renuka Chatterjee , it's not so much the absence of physical book launches, promotions and author tours - which in any case have limited benefits in relation to the costs involved - but the fact that bookshops are closed, distributors are not taking orders, and people simply can't go to a bookstore to buy books.""

Adding, ""From that perspective, e-readership should certainly see a rise. We may also have to focus more on digital and e-books in the immediate future, to minimise printing costs and recover some of the losses we've made in this period,"" Chatterjee added.

Most publishers have been quick in launching social media and online campaigns to promote reading among children and adults. Penguin Random House India and Momspresso's Facebook is hosting a children's author every evening for storytelling sessions till mid-April.

As far as academic publishers are concerned, schools and colleges are closed due to the COVID-19 and while studying might have not come to a stand still, sale of school books certainly has.

""Promotions surely have slowed down since the primary target market for us is the college libraries, which are currently closed as a result of the lockdown. We believe there is going to be a short term impact on business with orders being delayed, deferred or cancelled. But in the medium term we don't think education as a whole will suffer or be allowed to suffer,"" said

Aarti David, Director Publishing, SAGE India.

For their reader base, the publishers believe that many of those who may not have picked up a book normally, will probably do so now, as there's a limit to how much you can binge-watch OTT and TV shows.

""One can only motivate readers to read content that is relevant and helps them stay positive; be less anxious and be able to cope at this totally unprecedented time. In today's situation there is limited access to physical copies and if we do need content, the easiest way is to read it online,"" David added.

How can the government help?

36,13-4-20,Tribals worst-hit in lockdown,"The Paharia tribals of Nuapada district, who eke out their living from basket weaving, are the worst-affected people during the corona-induced lockdown.

The prices of different items they make range from Rs 20 to a maximum of Rs 100 depending on their sizes and shapes. They move to different weekly haats nearby their villages to sell their products. Another way for sale of the products is through middlemen, who visit the villages at regular intervals.

However, due to the lockdown, neither the weekly haats are running nor middlemen are turning up.

""I have 80 baskets in my house ready for the haat, but I’m unable to sell them,"" says Guri Banbasi of Baijalpur in Gorla panchayat of Sinapali block. She would have sold those products for Rs 3,000 in normal time.

Jujesti Banbasi of this village has products worth Rs 1,380. There are 14 Paharia households in Baijalpur; and all of them are in a similar condition.

The total number of households reeling under such a situation would be about 2,000. ""We would have bought rice and grocery after selling these products but for the lockdown,"" they say.

Various records and research works dating back to the British rule reveal that the Paharias are one of the nomadic tribal groups of India. The kith and kin of the Paharias of Odisha living in the neighbouring villages of Chhattisgarh have been accorded vulnerable status; but in Odisha, they are considered as OBC.

The Odisha Government has recommended for inclusion of the Paharias in the ST Constitutional Order, which is yet to be considered by the Central Government. As a result, the 2,000 Paharia households living mostly in different parts of western Odisha are reeling under acute poverty.

38,13-4-20,"Together, we can win the war against COVID","I am a gastroenterologist based at Bhubaneswar being associated with the World health Organisation on eradication of hepatitis, also on prevention of Corona infection. Together we can win the war against the invisible enemy, the COVID-19 epidemic.

Odisha has the great potential for disaster management; it sets its own benchmark in front of the world. This time also our State will be on the frontline in managing this outbreak.

Acting fast was the most important decision South Korea made, early detection and isolation were the most important strategies to prevent transmission of infection. Early detection paid off for Singapore. The country was one of the quickest to identify cases. Lockdown and social distancing have been used to halt the transmission of the corona virus in China.

If we analyze the Bhilwara model to curb the spread of new coronavirus in areas that have been identified as hotspots, aggressive containment measures taken by the district administration limited the spread of the virus. Effective implementation of the curfew, sealing the borders of containment zones and ensuring zero vehicular movement, identifying potential clusters and carrying out intensive mapping of contacts, besides isolating high-risk people and collecting samples for tests quickly and massive screening exercise covering the entire population to detect influenza-like symptoms were some of the drastic measures. Kerala: Its involvement of community at a large is standing it in good stead as it leads the fight against the coronavirus.

Odisha should have its own model to contain the infection with its experience in managing different disasters very effectively. The State is in lockdown till this month end, but we all are not doing the way the Government wants. If every one of us is not supporting the State initiatives, it is definite we are going to lose the war.

The most important is awareness; people must understand the importance of these strict measures to curb the infection. This is the question of life and death, saving own life, others life, saving the State and saving the humanity. Community leaders, religious gurus must be involved to make people understand the seriousness of the problem. Unwanted social elements should face legal action.

The State should come up with the Odisha Corona App, to provide information about Corona infection, strategies implemented, and also to involve people, get their views and suggestions.

The Government machinery must involve the people of Odisha as community leaders, volunteers, different NGOs, people from private organizations to work for the State; they and their family should be safeguarded. During shutdown, the State Government with the local volunteers should design a system to provide every essential things, also the healthcare support. If this is done, people will not venture out and spread the infection.

Every households to be screened of suspected Covid infection in a cyclical manner. People should come forward to help the team in providing correct information. Those with suspected infection, should be quarantined and test to be done immediately. If found positive, they need to be shifted to isolation and aggressive contact tracing must be done.

42,13-4-20,No place for Covid-19 victim in city graveyard,"Local residents at Ratu Road area on Sunday protested against Ranchi district administration decision to bury the body of coronavirus victim at Ratu Road Kabristhan (graveyard). The 60–year-old man and resident of Hindpiri area died at trauma centre of Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), Ranchi on Sunday. The deceased is husband of a corona infected woman, a resident of Hindpiri locality of Ranchi.

As the news spread about district administration decision to bury the body at Ratu Road Kabristhan, large number of men and women took to street opposing the burial of body at Ratu Road cemetery.

Similar type of protest was witnessed at Joda Talab Cemetery in Bariatu area as administration second option was Bariatu graveyard.

Ranchi SDM Lokesh Mishra said, “Taking note of the protest the district administration has decided that the body will not be buried at Ratu Road Kabristhan. Earlier, the district administration had chosen Ratu Road cemetery due to its large area.” Mishra further said, “The district administration is searching for place which is away from residential area for burying the body of coronavirus victim.”

Meanwhile, the residents of Ratu Road area claimed that corona infection can spread if the body is buried here. People sitting outside the cemetery main gate demanded the district administration to bury the body outside the city.

The district administration team had a hard time to pacify the crowd. Later the district administration announced that the body will not be buried at Ratu Road Kabristhan. The residents of the area after sealing all the doors of the cemetery went back to their homes on assurance from district administration.

The elderly man was among the eight people brought to RIMS from Hindpiri area of the state capital after they tested corona positive. Sources said that deceased got the infection from his wife, who was infected a Malaysian woman.

Sources said similar type of protests had occurred in other cities too as even cemetery authorities have protested against burying corona patient in their area.

In United States which has witnessed largest coronavirus deaths is burying bodies at separate Island. Sources said that Hart Island near New York, which for decades used as the final resting place for those who died unclaimed, is being used for unclaimed coronavirus victims. Over 150 years, the island served burial ground for victims of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic and the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.

Also, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India has issued these guidelines for its citizens about how to dispose of the body of a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19. As the main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets there is increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members. As per guidelines the crematorium or burial ground staff should be sensitised that Covid-19 does not pose additional risk.

The staff should practice standard precautions of hand hygiene, use of masks and gloves.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-place-for-covid-19-victim-in-city-graveyard.html

55,13-4-20,17 hotspots in 9 districts of Punjab,"With the apprehensions of Punjab entering into the community transmission stage of coronavirus pandemic with infection source of 10 of the total 170 cases still untraced, the State Health Department has identified 17 hotspots spreading over nine districts for better monitoring and containing the spread of deadly virus.

By identifying the hotspots — areas with more than one confirmed Covid-19 case, that is, an area that could potentially see a community outbreak of the contagion, the concentrated efforts would be made to contain the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission, and thus preventing its spread to new areas.

These 17 hotspots add up to total 108 cases, out of total 170 reported so far in the state, with a maximum of 44 from Mohali, followed by 18 from Nawanshahr.

Among the 17 hotspots, Mohali — which has witnessed the highest number of cases standing at 53 — has the maximum six hotspots including Dera Bassi’s Jawaharpur village having more than 30 cases, followed by Phase III-A, Phase V, Phase IX, Sector 69 and 91.

In SBS Nagar (Nawanshahr) district, Pathlawa with its 12 cases and Sujjon village with six cases have been identified.

Other areas are Nijatam Nagar locality and Virk Patts Yadpur village in Jalandhar; Diamond Estate Colony and Udham Singh Nagar in Amritsar; Moranwali village in Hoshiarpur; Amarpura in Ludhiana; Budhlada in Mansa; Sujanpur in Pathankot; and Chatwalli in Ropar.

“In the hotspots, the Government of India’s containment plan comes into play. These hotspots are the epicenter of the outbreak in a particular area. The three kilometers area around that place has to be sensitized, and could be more depending on the District Administration. Maximum testing has to be done in these areas, and the people’s movement has to be stopped completely with the government’s responsibility to ensure supply of all essentials to the residents,” Punjab’s COVID Control Room head Rahul Tiwari told The Pioneer.

The State Government said that it would intensify its containment strategy in these areas by using RT-PCR and rapid kits to test extensively in these areas.

Another official, who did not wish to be named, said that the Police teams would be deployed outside each of these areas and barricades would be placed to prevent the entry and exit of anyone.

“All shops, except those selling medicines, will be closed and curfew passes, that have been issued earlier, would stand canceled until further orders. Only those involved with essential services, like doctors and health staff, would be allowed to move,” added the official.

“With the increase in the frequency of testing, we are expecting a rise in cases. But, we are also trying our best to limit the number of cases by strictly monitoring the situation, and now by identifying the COVID-19 hotspots, it would be more concentrated,” added the official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/17-hotspots-in-9-districts-of-punjab.html

60,13-4-20,Pressure of cash withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts eases,"Pressure of withdrawal of Rs 500 in cash from PM Jan Dhan Yojna accounts here in Palamu has considerably eased down.

According to Lead Bank Managar ( LDM) Kishore Tirkey there are 9,98, 426 PM Jan Dhan Yojn accounts in Palamu out of which 5,06,524 accounts are in the name of women here. PM JDY accounts in the names of males are nearly a lakh fewer than the female ones, which stand at 4,91,902.

LDM Tirkey said a large chunk of these PM JDY accounts have been opened with Customer Service Point (CSP) and next to it in Jharkhand Rajya Gramin Bank and quite a negligible number of accounts in the mainstream national banks.

Sources said there was no outbreak of chaos but police force had to sweat out asking customers to maintain social distancing.

Sources said barring at one place in Palamu where a CSP operator had to bear the brunt of the anger of the cop on duty, there was no customer convulsion here. Sources said there was no repeat of the mad scrambling for cash as one had witnessed during the demonetization time.

DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari had given instructions to all bank officials to ensure safe assemblage of customers at the CSPs or at Jh Rajya Gramin banks here.

SP Ajay Linda said cops, chowkidars and SDPOs keep a strict vigil here for this PMJDY withdrawal wherein all the efforts were to see that social distancing does not get fractured.

SDPO Hussainabad Vijay Kumar told the Pioneer, “We did one thing – we got shifted many CSPs operating from market areas in Hussainabad, Haidernagar and Mohammmadganj areas to rural areas where their destinations were. They had ignored the inconveniences of the customers and were doing banking works in market areas when their locations were rural ones.”

Kumar said the police shifted three such CSPs from Hussainabad market areas to its real rural destinations like Kusanarayanpur, Oopri Kala and Deori. Kumar said, “Can anyone believe Deori CSP was operating from Japla?” Police forced this CSP to start doing banking work from his allotted location Deori.

Similarly, Kumar said four CSPs operating in market areas of Haidernagar were made to work from the destinations allotted to them like Barewa, Kabra, Patarya and Bilaspur.

Vijay Kumar said this move of decongested the marketing areas and customers felt convenience to have their cash from PMJDY accounts in their villages/ panchayats’ CSPs.

Sources said if SDPO Hussainabad sent back CSPs to its original destinations, SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta caught a big case where a CSP was right operating on the first floor of the SBI branch located on the ground floor at Kishunpur under Paton police station.

Gupta said, “To my great surprise I found one CSP right on the top roof of the SBI branch at Kishunpur. I do not know why no SBI official ever objected to it. I got it shifted to a building on the ground far away from the SBI branch here.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pressure-of-cash-withdrawal-from-jan-dhan-accounts-eases.html

65,13-4-20,"Nihangs attack police team, chop off cop’s hand","A group of “Nihangs” (Sikhs armed with traditional weapons and dressed in loose blue top) chopped off an police officer’s hand and injured three other Punjab Policemen after being stopped from violating the lockdown in Patiala district, triggering a police operation in which shots were fired and 11 people arrested at a gurdwara.

In a latenight information, doctors at the Chandigarh’s PGIMER reattached the 50-year-old ASI’s hand after an over seven-hour long surgery, officials said.

As many 11 people, including a woman, were arrested from a local Gurdwara after exchange of fire in connection with the attack on the police party at Patiala vegetable market in the morning, where the group fled after the 6.15 am incident in Sanaur town.

One of the arrested men suffered gunshot wound, while a mandi official was also hurt earlier. “We have recovered arms, Rs 39 lakh cash, traditional arms like irons rods, khanda, bhaale (javelin), and cannabis during the raid on the gurudwara. Weapons, including guns and petrol bombs, have also been recovered from the hideout,” said Patiala’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu.

Video clips regarding the incident have been doing the rounds on the social media, attracting criticism from all over the country, cutting across party lines.

Strongly condemning the attack, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has warned that anyone violating the curfew, imposed in the State since March 23 to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, would be strictly dealt with.

“The police personnel are risking their lives to save the people of Punjab and any attack on them would not be tolerated,” he said while directing the State Director General of Police (DGP) to come down heavily on those trying to disturb the law and order of the state at this difficult time.

One of the viral video clips shows the Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Harjeet Singh seeking help after the “Nihang” (members of a Sikh sect whose adherents carry traditional arms and wear blue robes) severed his hand with a sword. A man picks up the severed hand and gives it to the officer who was then taken away from the scene of incident on a two-wheeler.

The ASI was then rushed to Rajindra Hospital, from where he was referred to the PGIMER, Chandigarh, where he underwent seven-and-a-half hour long “successful” surgery, and will stay under observation.

With curfew restrictions in place amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the police has put up barricades outside the wholesale market and entry was restricted to those having curfew passes.

“About four-five Nihangs arrived in an SUV and were told to stop by the mandi officials. They were asked to show curfew passes. But they rammed the vehicle against the gate and the barricades,” said the SSP.

“The Nihangs were spotted by the Mandi Board of the local vegetable market when they were trying to enter the market without passes. The assailants first thrashed the Mandi Board employees and then a scuffle broke out between them and the nearby police officers who had rushed to the scene. During the confrontation, the culprits took out their swords and chopped off the hand of ASI Harjeet Singh while the SHO Sadar Singh and ASI Raj Singh sustained injuries on their arms and legs,” said the government spokesperson.

After the attack, the men fled to the Gurudwara Khichdi Sahib, managed by them in Balbera village around 25 km from Patiala city, while being chased by the police. Senior police officers, including the SSP, then arrived at the scene and sent additional police forces to nab the culprits.

The accused were nabbed after the police party, led by IG Patiala Range Jatinder Aulakh and SSP Sidhu, were fired upon from inside the Nihang Dera Complex which also houses Khichdi Sahib Gurudwara.

“The operation followed several hours of stand-off and many rounds of appeals and negotiations led by Patiala SSP with the Dera Head Baba Balwinder Singh to surrender with their weapons and swords but the Nihangs refused to surrender. One Nihang, Nirbhav Singh, suffered an injury in the incident, was immediately rushed to Patiala Hospital,” said the spokesperson.

Giving details of the entire incident, DGP Gupta said the accused had set up morchas inside the Dera Complex and had placed LPG cylinders, along the Dera perimeter and were getting ready to set-off blasts to cause injuries to the police party, which was surrounded by the police party that chased them.

Despite repeated announcements from the public address system, they refused to surrender and, instead, abused the police and threatened them with serious consequences if they tried to come closer.

The police then persuaded the Sarpanch and some villagers to go in and persuade the men to come out but they failed. Soon thereafter, the police party heard loud shouts and noises from inside the gurdwara premises, suggesting that some innocent people and hostages within might have got caught in the trouble, according to the DGP.

A Patiala Police team led by IG Patiala and SSP Patiala, along with a team of the Special Operations Group (SOG), led by ADGP Rakesh Chandra, then moved into the premises, followed “to flush out the rogue band of nihang criminals”.

A few shots were fired by the accused at the police personnel before they were nabbed, said the DGP, adding that entire operation was handled delicately so that the maryada and sanctum sanctorum of the Gurdwara Sahib was not disturbed in any manner.

“The accused included the five persons involved in the brutal attack on the Punjab Police team posted at the vegetable market in Sanaur early on Sunday morning. They had crashed through a series of barricades and attacked the police personnel who inquired about their curfew passes, said the DGP Gupta, adding that Baba Balwinder Singh, the Nihang Head, was the main perpetrator of the attack on the police party at the Patiala Sabzi Mandi this morning. He came to the market with four other persons, in a Tata Xenon vehicle.

DGP said a huge cache of weapons as well as hand-held weapons, such as barchhe and kirpans, and some used cartridges were seized from the accused, in addition to two petrol bombs and LPG cylinders, five bags of poppy husk mixed with sulpha, other drugs in commercial quantity and Rs 39 lakhs in cash. Some bottles with chemical substances were also found inside the premises.

ASI Harjit Singh, whose hand was reportedly cut off with a sword during the attack at the vegetable mandi, has undergone a plastic surgery at PGI Chandigarh for suturing back his hand, where he was rushed after the incident, said the DGP.

Besides, Sadar Patiala SHO Inspector Bikkar Singh also suffered sharp weapon injuries on his left arm, leg and back, ASI Raj Singh was inflicted a sharp weapon injury on his left leg, and ASI Raghbir Singh had got blunt injuries on his body. In addition, a Mandi Board official AR Yadwinder Singh also suffered some minor injuries in this attack.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nihangs-attack-police-team--chop-off-cop---s-hand.html

With each coupon, a farmer will be entitled to bring one trolley of about 50 to 70 quintals of wheat.

A farmer shall be entitled to take multiple coupons each day or in different days depending on space in the purchase centre in order to avoid rush in mandis. About 27 lakh such coupons would be issued by market committees to arhtiyas.

Emphasizing the need to strictly observe necessary safety and sanitary protocols to curb the spread of coronavirus, observance of social distancing norms, wearing of masks and use of sanitizers will be ensured.

Mandi yards are being marked with 30×30 feet lines to accommodate a heap of about 50 quintals and maintain sufficient distance from the adjoining one.

District level Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been issued to the Deputy Commissioners and SSPs to ensure strict compliance of these protocols. Harvesting operations by combines have been allowed between 6 am to 7 pm, added Khanna.

Provision for clean drinking water, fumigation, cleaning and disinfection of mandis and mandi yards is being ensured.

Over one lakh masks and 25,000 litres of sanitizer have been received for use in each of these purchase centres.

“Under the District Level SOP, the DCs would be overall in-charge of procurement operations to oversee activities including issuing and distribution of coupons from April 12 (Sunday) onwards, availability of mandi labour in all 3691 centres,” he said.

Apart from these, the DCs have also been mandated to review storage point labour for unloading, mandi wise transport arrangements, maintaining cleanliness and sanitation of mandis, storage point, arhtiya shops besides lifting of sold wheat within 48 hours, revealed Khanna.

Notably, a 30-member control room has been set up in the Mandi Board head office and in each of the designated purchase agencies to meticulously coordinate procurement operations and logistics with each district 24X7.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wheat-procurement-amid-covid-19-scare-in-punjab.html
67,13-4-20,Stop installing disinfection tunnels: Health Dept,"Concerned over increasing instances of installation of disinfection tunnels in different places, the Uttarakhand government has said that such equipment serves no purpose and their installation should be discouraged. The decision of government came after the World Health Organisation (WHO) expressed concern over the installation of disinfectant tunnels in markets and other places and said that these tunnels are actually defeating the purpose for which they are being used.

WHO said that these tunnels create a false sense of security and feared that the people may get diverted from hand wash to disinfection tunnels. “The spraying of alcohol, chlorine or Lysol on human beings is not only harmful but also ineffective. These tunnels should not be installed and used,’’ a circular of WHO said.

In an order to all district magistrates (DM) and chief medical officers (CMO), the additional secretary medical health, Yugal Kishore Pants said that the installation of disinfectant tunnels are not according to the advisory issued by the government of India.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stop-installing-disinfection-tunnels--health-dept.html
68,13-4-20,Anganwadi workers to receive no pay for strike period: Kamthan,"The State Government will not pay any remuneration for the two months during which Anganwadi workers were on strike. No allowance was promised to the workers for these months after they ended their protest, said the director of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Jharna Kamthan.

Recently, the State president of Anganwadi workers association Rekha Negi said that the State Government deducted their two months allowance despite the promise made by Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' as the Government's representative before the suspension of their two months long protest.

Negi said, ""It is quite insensitive of the Government to take such action. Hundreds of Anganwadi workers are widows, single mothers, and abandoned women, and deducting their allowance during the lockdown in the State is wrong and cannot be justified by the state administration.""

However, ICDS director Jharna Kamthan does not agree that the Government promised no deduction in the remuneration of two months. ""It is a false claim by the Anganwadi workers that the Government promised to pay allowance for their protest period of two months,"" said Kamthan. According to her, the Anganwadi workers receive honorarium for their job so there will be deductions for their absence from the work too. ""It has always been this way with the Anganwadi workers. Even few years back, they staged a protest for few a weeks and during that time the allowance was deducted too,"" added Kamthan.

On the other hand, Negi stated that if the government will maintain such an “autocratic” attitude towards the Anganwadi workers, they will not work amid the situation caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

""I hope the government will pay our allowances soon or we will be bound to stop supporting government during the current crisis,"" added Negi. However, Kamthan had stated earlier that the Anganwadi workers cannot refuse working during the coronavirus crisis.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-workers-to-receive-no-pay-for-strike-period--kamthan.html

The panel brought together eminent Christian leaders of Africa. The religious personalities discussed uniting together as faith communities to conquer the challenges faced by the world today. All the panelists encouraged people to stay at home, keep social distancing and take all safety precautions possible to stay safe and well.

Swami Chidanand Saraswati, co-founder and chair of the Global Interfaith WASH Alliance and president of Parmarth Niketan in Rishikesh said, “Faith Leaders, you are agents of change. We need to come together and urge governments to take the lead in helping communities address COVID-19. We can fight the spread of the novel coronavirus in our countries.” He also led a special prayer with the panelists at the end for all those afflicted by the virus so that they may heal, for all of the frontline workers and healthcare providers as well as for all of humanity.

Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, secretary general of GIWA and president of Divine Shakti Foundation, moderated the panel and emphasised the crucial messaging that faith leaders must be sending out to their followers, such as the critical importance of hand-washing, social distancing and staying at home. She shared the experiences already felt by all in India and the steps the government is taking towards ensuring the safety of the nation, as well as how Parmarth Niketan is offering a full daily and weekly online schedule to uplift all those at home across the world.

Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, South African Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town and Trustee of GIWA, said, “Let's support the government to flatten the curve. We are not disobeying god by staying home. Instead, this decision is sacred, biblical and critical to protect one another.”

Frederick Shoo, presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania said, “As we celebrate Easter, we have advised people in the risk groups to stay home during this time. We are encouraging people to keep their faith in god. Faith is important right now as it helps to maintain the calm.”

Reverend Charles Kitima, secretary-general of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, shared, “We are using YouTube and radio to reach our worshippers and are encouraging them to stay connected even in their homes. Our key messages for all Tanzanians are to frequently wash their hands and practice social distancing at this time.”

James Elder, Chief of Communications, Eastern and Southern Africa for UNICEF urged everyone, “Kids are a part of the solution. Listen to them, especially now.

They can help to spread key messages. Support their learning at home but also allow children to have ‘corona-free’ time. It is important for them to still feel like children during this time.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/faith-leaders-discuss-measures-for-tackling-covid-19.html

103,13-4-20,Opp flays Centre for suspending MPLAD,"But over 5K cr MPLADS funds remain unused

The Opposition has criticised the Centre for suspending the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) scheme for two years, but an analysis of the scheme reveals that over the years the trend of Parliamentarians failing to use the fund optimally for their constituencies has been continuing.

As on March 4, 2020, the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation data shows the unspent amount to be Rs 5,275.24 crore.

In fact, the data shows that the unspent money under the MPLAD Scheme rose by a whopping 214.63 per cent between the 15th and the 16th Lok Sabha. And when compared with the 14th Lok Sabha, this rise is even greater — 885.47 per cent.

When taken Statewise collectively, Uttar Pradesh has an unspent amount of Rs 354.58 crore out of the total Rs 14,440 crore released between 2014 and 2019 while Assam has left only Rs 53 crore of the total amount of Rs 257 crore released.

Maharashtra has Rs 185 crore unspent from the total of Rs 774 crore released and Andhra Pradesh has an unspent amount of Rs 80 crore of the total amount of Rs 375crore released. If Karnataka has unspent fund of Rs 106.71 cr out of Rs 452 cr released, then Punjab has unspent amount of Rs 63.54 cr of the total amount of Rs 260 cr released.

Delhi has an unspent amount of Rs 41.38 crore of the total Rs 80 cr released while Madhya

Pradesh has Rs 112.68 cr. Kerala and Gujarat have Rs 72.38 cr and Rs 88.78 cr of unspent funds.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency, has Rs 2.67crore unspent fund out of the Rs 15 crore released under this head while the data shows former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who represented Amethi, having Rs 4.58 crore unspent out of Rs 12.50 crore released under the MPLADS between 2014 and 2019.

Similarly, Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi has also an unspent amount of Rs 4.64 crore out of the Rs 17.50 crore released during the same period.

The Centre, however, has defended the unspent funds. It recently informed the Parliament that unspent balance is not an unused fund as it also includes the funds in pipeline for implementation of ongoing works.

Nevertheless, unspent funds have been in thousands of crores this last few years. Unspent amount under the scheme was Rs 4,103.97 crore on March 31, 2019; Rs 4,877.71 crore on March 31, 2018 and Rs 5,029.31 crore on March 31, 2017.

And as for the year 2020-21, an allocation of Rs 1,518 cr had already been made before the Centre suspended the scheme to keep its finances for the fight against Covid-19. Of this, an amount of Rs 1,432 cr was left unspent.

Prime Minister Modi has suspended the MPLADS fund for two years 2020-21 and 2021-22 to use a fund of Rs 7,880 crore thus saved to manage the challenges and adverse impact on the economy due to the spread of coronavirus outbreak.

There are 543 MPs in Lok Sabha and 245 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, which means 788 Parliamentarians in all. Each MP gets Rs 5 crore per annum as MPLAD and for two years, which works out to be nearly Rs 7,880 crores.

As per the latest information available with the Parliament secretariat, a total of 355 MPs of 779 MPs (of the total 788) have contributed a total of Rs 365 crore from their MPLADS towards tackling exigencies in India emerging from the effect of the pandemic.

Earlier this week, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had asked MPs to contribute Rs 1 crore from their MPLADS to the PM CARES Fund. They had also asked MPs to contribute a month’s salary to the PM CARES Fund.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi had offered her entire MPLADS fund for the welfare of the people of Rae Bareli in fighting the coronavirus outbreak as per the requirement of the constituency. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi allocated Rs 2.66 crore from his MPLADS money to fight coronavirus in his constituency.

Balashowry, YSR Congress MP from Machlipatnam, has contributed the highest of Rs 4 crore of his MPLAD fund to the Andhra CM Relief Fund while Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav has donated Rs 25 lakh of his MPLAD fund for purchasing sanitisers and masks in Mainpuri.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-flays-centre-for-suspending-mplad.html

According to the letter issued on April 11, an official communication was received from the office of Delhi’s Minister for Food and Supply along with two screen shots and one link stating that a fake website (https://rationcardagent.co.in/digital-ration-card-application/ ) has been created by miscreants for registering digital ration card and asking for Rs 407.

“As per Section 2 (16) of National Food Security Act 2013 Ration Card “means a document issued under an order or authority of the State Government for the purchase of essential commodities from the fair price shops under the targeted public distribution system”.

As mentioned above only government and government alone are competent to issue ration card and there is no enabling provision under law to authorise any agent to issue ration card,” stated the letter.

“It is not only a case of cheating the common man but also amounts to fraudulently and dishonestly cheating him with an intention to have wrongful gains. Besides, it is also a fraud on government. Further, the department is undertaking relief to the people in midst of Covid 19 Lockdown period and poor and needy are being provided ration free of cost,” it further reads.

“Cheating the public and playing fraud on the Government at this juncture indicates as to how the miscreants are indulging in fraud and violation of law,” it added..

108,13-4-20,Don’t politicise corona war: Guv to TMC Govt,"Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has advised the Trinamool Congress Government not to politicise the battle against corona. Referring to the Union Home Ministry’s letter to the State Government warning it against slack enforcement of lockdown in selected areas the Governor on Sunday said that none should use the grim situation to play politics.

“The Home Ministry had earlier written a letter where it raised the issue of how the lockdown is being diluted in certain areas … where no social distancing is being maintained and where religious congregations are being allowed to take place. This can aggravate the situation,” the Governor said adding this was no time to politicise things.

Apparently referring to the administration’s green signal to only the Trinamool Congress’ workers to distribute relief disallowing members of other parties from joining the relief work the Governor said, “this is not a time to do politics particularly when the situation is so grim … the relief materials should be distributed by the Government agencies and not political workers… This will only lead to politicization of the matter and the real purpose will be defeated.”

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had made a snappish remark on Saturday while referring to the Home Ministry’s letter when she said that “you all know by mentioning the areas where the lockdown is allegedly not being implemented properly Delhi wants to pinpoint a particular group of population … But I want to tell them that we are fighting against a deadly virus and not a communal virus. I will not allow any communal politics here.”

The letter from Delhi had alleged that “people have been thronging in complete violation of social distancing norms...” mentioning specific areas like Maniktala, Narkel Danga, Rajabazaar, Topsia, Metiaburz, Gardenreach, Ekbalpur Ulta Danga. Incidentally all of these areas are dominated by the people of minority community.

Apart from Dhankhar the Left Front also attacked the State Government for not following the ICMR norms insofar as conducting maximum tests are concerned. State CPI(M) secretary and party politburo member Suryakanto Mishra on Sunday said that “not only that adequate number of tests are not being done but also in many cases the deaths are being ascribed to co-morbidity reasons which is highly fallacious.”

Himself a doctor and a former Health Minister of the State, Mishra said that “any casualty irrespective of co-morbidity reasons should be listed as corona death if the victim had contracted the disease otherwise the seriousness of the situation will be lost on the people.” Apart from conducting tests the Government should also come out with their data which will help the researchers to handle the crisis in better manner, he maintained.

Meanwhile, the Bengal Government is planning to make wearing masks mandatory in the State. According to sources, the Government will soon come out with orders making masks mandatory for the people who comeout in the streets.

“If anyone is found without mask he or she will either be sent back home or legal actions will be taken on that person,” a senior official said adding however that the general public who have no contact history will not be required to wear any N-95 or surgical mask. “In such cases only ordinary or home-made masks will do” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/don---t-politicise-corona-war--guv-to-tmc-govt.html

113,13-4-20,"With ‘roti, chutney’, life in Hindu refugee camp goes on without much help from outside","Sitting near the mud stove in her makeshift semi-pukka house on the banks of the Yamuna, Rani Das is wondering what if the lockdown is extended. Does she have enough ration to feed her family?

For now, she has enough rice, flour and sugar which will help them have two meals each day for another week.

Rani''s family is one among such 140 households in the Hindu Refugee camp near Gurudwara Majnu Ka Tila. Most of them fled their homes in Pakistan, escaping discrimination and religious persecution, and came to India between 2011 and 2013.

""But there is very little of lentils and vegetables left. There is no money, so there is no gas. The policemen are not letting us collect firewood from the banks of the river,"" Rani says, as she flips a sugar-stuffed roti on the hotplate.

""We don''t have fodder for our famished cows. Earlier, we would collect it from the jungle. Now, even that is now allowed due to the lockdown,"" she says, adjusting the only small wooden log inside the ‘chulha'' to keep the fire burning.

Rani''s daughter-in-law Jamuna is pregnant with her first child and has been eating just two meals a day – mostly sugar-stuffed roti or rice with salt and ‘green chutney''.

Her neighbour, Gomti, 52, says a few people came to them with cooked food but the residents of the camp did not take it, fearing it might spread the coronavirus in the locality.

""How do we know it is safe? We do not have a machine, which they show on television, to ascertain if it has the virus,"" she says. Gomti says her family will choose to have ""noon-roti"" (salt and roti) or die of starvation, rather than get infected.

""We saw it on mobile phone, even the families of those dying due to coronavirus do not accept the bodies and cremation grounds return them,"" she says.

Dharamveer, 42, the ‘Pradhan'' or community representative, says most men in the camp earn their living doing odd jobs. ""All the daily wagers, agricultural labourers, and those who sell mobile covers on the roadside are out of work,"" he says. ""Some people came here with cooked food but we did not accept it. We can cook our food on our own. All we need is that credible government agencies give us dry ration,"" Dharamveer, who has been leading the fight for India citizenship for community members, says.

He says families have been bathing and washing clothes without any soap. ""There is no soap. How do we wash our hands? We have been wearing the same clothes for 3-4 days on the trot,"" he says.

""I was practising at that time and did not use gloves and masks while giving saline doses to hundreds of patients everyday as I found it uncomfortable wearing them. Fortunately I didn't get any infection. However, this COVID-19 is very contagious and it's a pandemic. All precautions are a must,"" says the Bangladeshi-Swedish writer of ""Lajja"" fame who has been living in exile since 1994.

""The current situation reminds me of the time when I too worked to save people from cholera epidemic in the early 90s. I worked in an infectious disease hospital in Mymensingh where thousands of patients used to come every day and I treated them,"" she told PTI in an interview.

The cholera epidemic in Bangladesh in 1991 affected around 2,25,000 people and claimed over 8,000 lives.

""I feel very proud of the medical fraternity across the world working tirelessly. They are risking their lives to save humanity.

In a video-conference with PTI, the MSME minister said the government was working on a “war footing” to resolve issues - like working capital crunch and access to affordable financing - faced by the sector, as millions of units stare at staggering losses.

Gadkari said the committees constituted by the Prime Minister’s Office are continuously monitoring and assessing the situation on the ground and would suggest if and when the lockdown can be lifted in certain sectors for normal operations to resume, and added that “work should begin where possible while keeping the virus at bay”.

The MSME Minister said nearly 8-10 lakh units will be restructured in the coming days, asserting that owners will have to take care of their workers and put in place mechanisms for proper sanitisation as a preventive measure once they return to work. Gadkari also informed that a Rs 10,000 crore “Fund of Funds” has been approved by the Finance Committee and will be placed before the Union Cabinet for approval. This fund, he said, will facilitate MSMEs to raise money from the capital market, as a portion of their equity will be purchased by the government. “We will encourage MSMEs to enter the capital market and attract foreign investments, increase exports from the sector through large-scale production and create jobs,” the minister said.

He observed that the government was well aware of the issues faced by micro, small and medium enterprises, and packages announced by the Finance Minister will set in motion a recovery for the sector.

Gadkari said that recommendations of the UK Sinha Committee appointed by the Reserve Bank of India will soon be implemented.

The Minister said he has directed district officers to go to banks and facilitate paper work and coordination for loans to be cleared as fast as possible, and a “branch-wise” monitoring was underway to ease the credit woes of the MSME sector.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/msme-sector-will-tide-over-coronavirus-crisis--gadkari.html
118,13-4-20,"Amid lockdown, tea industry seeks 50 per cent workforce in Bengal gardens","A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee increased the limit of the workforce in tea gardens from 15 to 25 per cent amid the nationwide lockdown, the tea industry on Sunday urged the state government to gradually allow up to 50 per cent of the labourers in the plantations.

The chief minister had first allowed the deployment of only 15 per cent of the workforce in the tea gardens, which she increased to 25 per cent on Saturday.

Welcoming the move, Arijit Raha, secretary general of the Indian Tea Association (ITA) told PTI, “The Consultative Committee on Plantation Associations (CCPA) made a representation to the government seeking to allow flexibility in operations within prescribed limits. The increased deployment will help in plucking and ancillary activities.” ITA is a constituent of the CCPA. “We are hopeful that the state government will consider the enhancement of workforce to 50 per cent,” he said.

Rudra Chatterjee, director of Luxmi Group, which owns the Makaibari brand, welcomed the move saying it will help them get a portion of the first flush.

“We will get the entire second flush, the season for which will start from May. The second flush will be protected. Makaibari had fetched the highest price in the history of Darjeeling second flush at USD 1850 per kg,” he said.

Chamong Tea Chairman A Lohia said after the government decided to allow more workforce in the tea gardens, the group has begun plucking in all of its 13 gardens in Darjeeling by following guidelines laid down by the administration.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/amid-lockdown--tea-industry-seeks-50-per-cent-workforce-in-bengal-gardens.html

120,13-4-20,Karur businessman comes to rescue of needy,"Till Saturday, sanitary workers in Tamil Nadu’s Karur district never knew that life was beautiful and there were kind hearted people around. The district is famous for banking business as well as textile industries and daily life used to be fast moving. But COVID-19 and corona virus turned everything topsy-turvy. As the State Government declared a total lock-down, people in Karur district too were left with no other alternative but to follow the diktat. Whatever the compensation package announced by the Government seemed peanuts.

But there were some bright patches during the testing times. There emerged a person in Karur, an apolitical, secular and broad minded person for whom the man and woman in the streets were of paramount concern. Thogai Murugan, a 54-year-old self made entrepreneur who came up in life through the hard way, is the man of the hour in the district.

The sanitary workers and casual employees in Karur town who were left penniless and jobless because of the lock down were in for a surprise as Murugan and his family members invited them all to his house on Saturday and performed paada pooja (worshipping the feet) on them. Murugan, his wife and son washed the feet of the sanitary workers, offered aarati and sought the blessings of the invitees by falling at their feet. The icing on the cake was yet to come. “Each of the invitees numbering 105 was offered cash and essential items worth Rs 5 lakh which brought tears in the eyes of the recipients. The sanitary workers who are the frontline warriors in the battle against corona virus were insured by us,” Murugan told The Pioneer. He ensured that a total of 2000 casual workers in the city who faced bleak future because of the lock down got relief materials in the form of rice and groceries.

What prompted him to spend such big amount for these workers? “What is the guarantee that Ill survive this pandemic? How many of us will come out of this attack by the virus for which there is no vaccine as on today? I am not going to take with me the materials I had saved over the years when my dead body is taken to the burial ground. If I can save at least one life, I can die peacefully,” said Murugan.

He said the paada pooja was an act of reciprocation. “They are the real guards who ensure our safety from the pandemic. Can you imagine a day in our life without their services? This is my way of thanking the real life Gods,” said Murugan, a sworn rationalist.

For Selvaraj and wife Rani, the offering from Murugan was a divine intervention. “We were worried about how to feed the children in these times of lock out as there is no salary. Here, Ayya (a word of reverence) has made our Easter a happy occasion, something which we will remember throughout our life,” said Selbva, a sanitary worker.

Unprecedented scenes of empty churches emerged from Italy to Panama and the Philippines, as religious leaders found creative ways to address parishioners marking the holiday weekend from the confines of their homes.

More than half the world — over four billion people — are in lockdown worldwide as governments scramble to halt the pandemic’s deadly march across the globe.

The death toll from the virus soared past 112,407 this weekend, with more than 1.7 million reported infections globally.

Europe is by far the hardest-hit continent and on Sunday marked a grave milestone with more than 75,000 dead, according to an AFP tally.

The United States was quickly emerging as a hotspot as well, and on Saturday marked its own grim landmark: more than 20,000 dead, out of around half a million infected.

The US now has the highest death toll and the most cases out of any country in the world.

Speaking from a near-empty Saint Paul’s Cathedral, Pope Francis’ Easter Sunday message was largely focused on the pandemic, offering prayers for the ill and urging a united European front to fight the pandemic.

“ For many, this is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorrow and hardship that the pandemic is causing, from physical suffering to economic difficulties,” he said, in a livestreamed message beamed around the world.

He called for European “ solidarity” in the face of the virus, adding: “ After the Second World War, this beloved continent was able to rise again.” The pope had earlier urged creativity to mark the holy weekend — a call that appears to have been met by some of the world’s two billion-plus Christians.

133,13-4-20,"Trump played down virus crisis amid warnings from intelligence, health officials: NYT","US President Donald Trump was warned about the potential for a pandemic but he repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused instead on controlling the message, protecting gains in the economy and batting away warnings from senior officials, a lengthy investigative report in a leading American newspaper has said.

The report in The New York Times revealed that there were warnings from the intelligence community, national security aides and government health officials about an impending pandemic and its consequences but Trump played down the crisis.

“ An examination reveals the president was warned about the potential for a pandemic but that internal divisions, lack of planning and his faith in his own instincts led to a halting response,” the NYT said.

The US is the worst-hit country in the world with over 530,000 COVID-19 cases and 20,608 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

“ Top White House advisers as well as experts deep in the Cabinet departments and intelligence agencies all sounded alarms and urged aggressive action to counter the threat from the coronavirus, but President Trump remained slow to respond,” it said.

Trump’s views were “ coloured” by long-running disputes inside the administration over how to deal with China and his own suspicion of the motivations of officials inside what he viewed as the “ Deep State.”

Further, recommendations from public health officials often competed with economic and political considerations in internal debates, slowing the path toward belated decisions.

In a video-conference with PTI, the road transport, highways and MSME minister said talks are on with state governments for facilitating safe return of migrant labourers, an estimated 20 lakh of whom are in shelters pan-India.

“I had a meeting with road sector officials. Work can be re-started at projects with condition that adequate measures are taken for safeguard against coronavirus. We have to follow guidelines. At some places collectors have given permission, some not. We are doing a follow up along with the chief secretaries of the states,” the minister said. He said an estimated about 20 lakh migrant labourers are stuck in shelters or have gone back to villages and in view of the Disaster Management Act being in place, district collectors can take a decision on it.

“As I have said and believe, we can turn any problem into opportunity, we need to focus on highways building with renewed vigour...Highways sector has faced much obstacles due to coronavirus. In coming years we will have to give the highest priority to the infrastructure sector. To accelerate the economy, infrastructure is needed,” Gadkari said. He said plans are afoot to boost the highways sector. A committee has already been set up, he said, adding that work needs to be commenced on a war footing on highway projects, including the Rs 1 lakh crore Delhi-Mumbai new expressway which would usher in development of backward and far-flung areas of Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Reiterating that the government has saved a massive Rs 16,000 crore on land acquisition as it is on a new alignment, the minister urged companies to come forward for setting up manufacturing hubs and clusters along the highway to boost economic growth.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/need-to-convert-covid-19-into-opportunity--restart-highways-construction.html

A digital pipeline laid a few years ago — through linking Jan-Dhan accounts as well as other accounts with the beneficiaries’ mobile numbers and Aadhaar Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) — was instrumental in cash transfer under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package amid coronavirus pandemic.

This infrastructure pipeline is providing the necessary backbone for DBT flows, adoption of social security/pension schemes, etc, the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

137,13-4-20,S Asia may see worst economic performance in 40 yrs: WB,"As the global economy goes through an unprecedented tough phase amid the coronavirus crisis, a World Bank report on Sunday said that South Asia may witness its worst economic performance in the last 40 years.

The report also said that at least half of the countries in the region are likely to fall in deep recession.

“South Asia will likely experience the worst economic performance of the last 40 years. Because of the unparalleled uncertainty, this report presents a range forecast, estimating that regional growth will fall to a range between 1.8 and 2.8 per cent in 2020, down from 6.3 per cent projected six months ago.

The hardest hit is the Maldives where GDP is expected to decline by between 8.5 and 13 per cent this year, as tourism has dried up. Also, for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, the full range of their forecast GDP growth

for this fiscal year is in negative territory.

In a worst-case scenario, the whole region would experience a contraction of GDP, it added. The report noted that while normal downturns are caused by lack of effective demand, this crisis is caused by supply constraints. While typically manufacturing is the most cyclical part of the economy, this time service sectors are hardest hit, it added.

“While usually, GDP decelerates faster than consumption, as consumers smooth their spending over economic cycles, this time consumption is falling sharply. Moreover, supply disruptions and panic buying can jeopardize food security. The sudden disappearance of service sector jobs and the rise in food prices have created economic hardship, especially for people in the informal sector.”

It noted that policy makers in South Asia are dealing with a plethora of challenges.

The first task is to prepare the, still underdeveloped, health-care system for the fight against COVID-19. Another immediate task is to secure access to food and basic needs to the most vulnerable people in society.

Similarly, it is important to secure other vital functions in the economy, such as payment systems and banking operations. This all has to be achieved in a deteriorating global environment, while dealing with fiscal stress and problems in financial markets that were caused by pre-existing vulnerabilities, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/s-asia-may-see-worst-economic-performance-in-40-yrs--wb-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/s-asia-may-see-worst-economic-performance-in-40-yrs--wb.html

139,13-4-20,Oil rallies as top producers agree massive output cuts,"Oil prices rallied Monday after top producers agreed to slash output and shore up coronavirus-ravaged energy markets, but some analysts were concerned the cuts did not go far enough.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up 7.7 percent at USD 24.52 a barrel in Asian trade while Brent crude, the international benchmark, put on 5 percent to USD 33.08 a barrel.

OPEC producers dominated by Saudi Arabia and allies led by Russia met via videoconference for an hour Sunday in a last effort to cement a deal struck early Friday.

It still required Mexico's agreement and in a compromise reached Sunday they agreed to a cut of 9.7 million barrels per day from May, according to its Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, down slightly from 10 million barrels per day envisioned earlier.

OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo called the cuts ""historic"".

Oil markets have been in turmoil for weeks as lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed worldwide to combat the virus outbreak strangle demand, with a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia compounding the crisis.

While Monday's price rises were healthy, they were not as strong as the double-digit jumps and falls of recent weeks in a highly volatile market, and analysts were sceptical the deal went far enough.

The amount being cut was slightly lower than had been expected, and observers said it would not make up for expected demand loss due to the virus outbreak. Some analysts are putting this at about 25 million barrels per day in April.

In addition, storage tanks worldwide are rapidly filling up.

""The deal is a little less than the market expected given that Mexico has gotten off easy,"" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, told Bloomberg News.

""The hard work lies ahead given that the market is very sceptical that OPEC+ are actually going to be able to come up with their near 10 million barrels a day of production cuts.""

140,13-4-20,"RBI to use any means necessary to revive growth, preserve financial stability: Governor Das","All-out efforts are needed to mitigate the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the RBI will use any instrument necessary to revive growth and preserve financial stability, according to the minutes of the central bank's policy meeting.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das, was originally scheduled for March 31, April 1 and 3, 2020, but was advanced in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

After the three-day meeting which ended on March 27, the RBI reduced the key policy rate by 75 basis points.

To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak, the government of India has announced a comprehensive package of Rs 1.70 lakh crore, covering cash transfers and food security, for vulnerable sections of society.

As per the minutes of the MPC meet, released by the RBI, Das said the global macroeconomic situation has abruptly worsened in the last fortnight or so.

He stated that the authorities and central banks in many countries have deployed an extensive range of targeted policy instruments to deal with the macroeconomic fallout of Covid-19 caused by lockdowns and social distancing.

In his opinion, ""there is a rising probability"" of a global recession, which may be deeper than the one experienced during the global financial crisis.

""In India also, the near-term growth outlook has deteriorated sharply: initially reflecting global spillovers and the amplification of the impact of Covid-19; and thereafter, due to the much-needed efforts by the government to contain the pandemic by declaring a nationwide lockdown,"" he said.

On the inflation front, Das said the outlook has changed drastically.

The governor said the usual uptick that begins in summer months may remain subdued if demand conditions take longer to normalise. The weakening of domestic aggregate demand may also help to contain core inflation.

""The Covid-19 pandemic is an invisible assassin which needs to be contained quickly before it spreads and wreaks havoc on valuable human lives and the macro economy.

""In this scenario, it is important to ensure that finance, which is the lifeline of the economy, keeps flowing seamlessly to various sectors of the economy,"" said Das, and added the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy continue to be sound.

He further said growth impulses face strong headwinds from sluggish aggregate demand and disruptions in supply of labour and key inputs, including imports.

""The erosion of consumer confidence and investment sentiment can operate in an adverse feedback loop to worsen the growth outlook even further,"" he said.

Das said monetary policy needs to proactively arrest any deterioration in aggregate demand as he advocated a 75 basis reduction in repo rate.

""The Reserve Bank will continue to remain vigilant and will not hesitate to use any instrument conventional and unconventional to mitigate the impact of Covid-19, revive growth and preserve financial stability,"" he said.

RBI Deputy Governor and MPC member Michael Debabrata Patra said India has locked down and a state of siege prevails in wake of coronavirus outbreak.

Several types of activities have come to a standstill with social isolation, supply disruptions, demand contraction and heightened anxiety.

""The outlook for the economy is highly uncertain and shifts with every incoming data on the impact of the virus. Prospects for the Indian economy now hinge around how pervasive and severe Covid-19 turns out to be, and how long it lasts,"" he said.

In these challenging circumstances, Patra opined monetary policy has to assume an avant garde role.

""Even as it fights the corrosive impact of Covid-19 on macroeconomic and financial conditions, monetary policy has to provide confidence and assuage fear,"" he said while voting for a 75 basis points reduction in the short-term lending rate.

MPC member and RBI Executive Director Janak Raj said the reduction in the policy rate, together with several other liquidity enhancing measures being separately announced by the Reserve Bank, should ease financing conditions and address financial stability risks.

He also voted for persevering with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and to mitigate the adverse impact of Covid-19, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.

Ravindra H Dholakia too voted for the rate cut.

""There is still enough space for the policy rate cut as and when required to support growth recovery going forward since inflation is likely to be under control,"" he added.

Pami Dua and Chetan Ghate had advocted a reduction in repo rate by 50 basis points.

The RBI went ahead with the majority vote and reduced the key lending rate by 75 basis points.

Indian bourses opened on a negative note tracking subdued global market peers in Asia, said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi.

142,13-4-20,Rising unemployment from virus fight threatens China’s poverty targets,"Although China is claiming success in its battle against the coronavirus, millions have lost their jobs in the economic fallout, throwing into jeopardy an ambitious target to eradicate poverty this year.

Beijing has been working to fire up the economy again after bringing it to a near standstill to curb the spread of COVID-19, but many firms have had a bumpy restart and workers are bearing the brunt of the pain.

Despite being a country of skyscrapers and high-tech innovations, China still has millions of people on meagre incomes.

About 5.5 million rural Chinese live in poverty, defined by the government as surviving on less than 2,300 yuan ($326) a year. A slowing economy puts pressure on a key Communist Party goal to become a “ moderately prosperous society” by the end of 2020, an ambition in place long before the virus emerged.

It also threatens a long-held tacit agreement between people and party that freedoms can be sacrificed in return for economic progress, an understanding that largely forms the basis of the authoritarian government’s legitimacy in the absence of elections.

China has little in the way of social security benefits and workers who lose their jobs have an inadequate safety net, meaning mass unemployment often brings a fear of unrest.

The deal calls for the government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for 1,000 government officials held by the Taliban insurgents.

The Afghan government released its first 100 Taliban prisoners last week and Jawed Faisal, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s national security adviser, said the government has thus far released 300 Taliban prisoners overall from government custody.

Suhial Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban’s political office, said in a tweet that the first government prisoners will be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in the southern Kandahar province.

The exchanges come after the Taliban met with the head of US Forces in Afghanistan to call for an end to what they say is an increase in American attacks since a peace deal was signed in February, allegations the US Military denied.

On Saturday, a U.S. Military spokesman called on the Taliban to stop attacking Afghan security forces whom he said American troops would continue to come to their aid in accordance with the agreement.

144,13-4-20,Reopening of US could probably start next month: US top doc,"America’s reopening could probably start at least in some ways next month, a top member of the White House Task Force on coronavirus said on Sunday as the US battles one of the worst public health crises in a century.

For weeks now, over 95 per cent of 330 million American population are under stay-at-home order and a national emergency has been put in place as the United States has become the hotspot of COVID-19.

More than 20,000 Americans have lost their lives battling coronavirus and over 5.3 lakh have been tested positive. New York, the global financial capital, is the epicenter of this crisis with more than 1.8 lakh positive cases and 8,650 deaths.

President Donald Trump is mulling reopening the country, where in more than 17 million people have lost their job, given that in some parts of the country like New York, there are signs of reduction in new COVID-19 patients and states like Washington and California have successfully flattened the curve through strict enforcement of social distancing measure.

With American economy in teeters, President Trump has described this as one of the biggest decisions of his life that he has ever had to make.

“I think it (reopening the country) could probably start, at least in some ways, maybe next month. And, again it’s so difficult to make those kinds of predictions, because they always get thrown back at you if it doesn’t happen,” Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health told CNN. During the interview, Dr Fauci, who is a member of the White

House Task Force on coronavirus, hinted that the reopening of the country could be in phases and spread out region by region depending on the ground situation.

“We are hoping that, at the end of the month, we could look around and say, OK, is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on? If so, do it. If not, then just continue to hunker down. And that’s what, at least for me standpoint of the public health aspect, that we look at,” he said.

“Other decisions are going to have to be made at the level of the president and the governors about what they are going to do with all of the information they get. The only thing I and my colleagues in public health and medicine can do is to give a projection of the kinds of things that may or may not happen when you make these steps,” he noted. Responding to a question, Dr Fauci acknowledged that things could have been difficult in the US had everything been shut down from day one.

“It’s very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say, that if you had a process that was ongoing, and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/reopening-of-us-could-probably-start-next-month--us-top-doc.html
145,13-4-20,Importance of routine,"Divya Dixit suggests ways to ensure that working from home does not affect productivity during the lockdown

With nationwide lockdown amid the Coronavirus pandemic, leading companies and enterprises are seeing most of their workforce operating remotely. Working from home has become the new work culture that people are following during self-quarantine.

And as it gets intensified, there are multiple ways in which following a proper schedule could get tiring as well as confusing. However, one can operate successfully at home by practicing sincere discipline, implementing proper to-do lists and, above all, using technology in the right manner.

There have been conversations aplenty about the challenges of working from home and at the same time, without affecting productivity. It may not be preferred, but currently working from home is the need of the hour to ensure social distancing. Every cloud has a silver lining as does this one. This current predicament gives businesses, employers, and employees a golden opportunity to unlearn the classic operational dynamics and discover new mantras.

This is sure to be a complex period but overcoming these challenges will make us who we want to be. To do so, you need some organising skills to maintain a healthy balance between your personal and professional life and keep them separate.

Keep the day schedule as earlier

While the easiest thing to do is to stay up late at night and get up late in the morning given that you are at home and you don’t have to venture out. However, following the old office schedule is more helpful even while you’re at home. Get up on time, have your early morning coffee and squeeze in some me-time. Don’t forget that working out is of utmost importance. Don’t forego the habit and try to organise your schedule at least for the next 24 hours.

Sitting on a couch or the bed while working might look comfortable at first but one needs to remember that it’s not going to be just one or two days of working in the comfort of your home. Setting up a workstation will not only make you more focussed but will also help you maintain a fine line between your personal and professional spaces.

Agenda planning

A day without any set agenda can go haywire with you having no clue of the to-dos. You might have an idea as to what all you are supposed to work on, however, as the day progresses, one tends to forget as assignments keep piling. Keeping a proper to-do-list to segregate and prioritise what’s important and what’s not and following it religiously will help you plan your day better.

Keep time for breaks

As we are working from home, we tend to sit on our assignments and digital screens for long hours continuously, which can have an adverse impact on our body and mind. Make it a point to take breaks in between and get up from the workstation for short breaks — going for a stroll to the balcony might help. Instead of sitting and attending calls, you can walk while doing so as it will help your body relax a bit.

Be in constant touch with your team

Working from home doesn’t mean you have to work in isolation or all by yourself. Ensure you take every opportunity to engage with your team or colleagues. Be in constant touch with your team via conference calls, video calls, emails, hangout chats and more. Check if everything is fine at your colleagues’ ends and if the work is going smoothly. In times like these, we need to reach out to each other as and when required, too.

Balance between household chores and office work

The biggest drawback of working from home is that people tend to mix both their personal and professional lives, leaving very little time at hand for themselves or their family. One can strike the perfect balance by setting a fixed time where you will not work or sit in front of your laptop to work. Planning your day shouldn’t only be restricted to your assignments and projects. Space out your timings for lunch and a coffee break to relax during the day.

Stick to your official routine

While working from home might now save a lot of time spent in commuting for some people, this shouldn’t mean that you start working way past your defined hours just because you have enough time at hand. This is the moment where you unwind and utilise the extra time you have by doing something you look forward to before you end the day. It could be spending quality time with your family members, pet, learning an art, reading a book or, for that matter, catching up on the series you are currently hooked to.

In a blog entry, Big B shared his reasons. “The smartphone would have to be the invention of the times. It is running everything in the world today, whatever would we have done without it,” he wrote.

Travelling down memory lane the actor shared memories of landline phones and how these were the primary means to to communicate with before cellphones came along.

‘Hasmukh is a purely fictional tale. But every fictional story is inspired by some wild imagination. As a writer, that's what I have applied here. One can never imagine looking at Amol Palekar on screen and say that he can have a dark side. His onscreen characters are so affable and endearing. Hasmukh is similar.’

147,13-4-20,After you,"Apple, Google to harness phones for virus infection tracking

Apple and Google fueled hopes for digital technology’s promise against a fast-moving, invisible killer, announcing a joint effort to help public health agencies worldwide leverage smartphones to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

New software the companies plan to add to phones would make it easier to use bluetooth wireless technology to track down people who may have been infected by Coronavirus carriers. The idea is to help national, state and local governments roll out apps for so-called “contact tracing” that will run on iPhones and android phones alike.

The technology works by harnessing short-range bluetooth signals. Using the Apple-Google technology, contact-tracing apps would gather a record of other phones with which they came into close proximity. Such data can be used to alert others who might have been infected by known carriers of the novel Coronavirus, typically when the phones’ owners have installed the apps and agreed to share data with public-health authorities.

Developers have already created such apps in countries including Singapore and China to try to contain the pandemic. In Europe, the Czech Republic says it will release an app after Easter. Britain, Germany and Italy are also developing their own tracing tools.

No such apps have yet been announced in the United States, but gov Gavin Newsom of California said Friday that state officials have been in touch with the companies as they look ahead at how to reopen and lift stay-at-home orders. “We were on the phone just this morning, for example, with Apple,” he said at a news conference.

Privacy and civil liberties activists have warned that the apps need to be designed so governments cannot abuse them to track their citizens. Apple and Google said in a rare joint announcement that user privacy and security are baked into the design of their plan.

The technology might serve as a stopgap until there is widespread testing for the novel coronavirus, which in the US remains limited after production problems and limited federal coordination of the tests’ production and distribution. “It’s not a replacement for just having widespread testing, which would be more accurate,” said Tiffany Li, a visiting law professor at Boston University who studies privacy and technology. “But clearly we have a huge shortage of tests.”

Bluetooth signal tracking, as Google and Apple plan to use it, can protect privacy far better than other options such as GPS or cell-tower based location data, which allow centralized authorities access to the information.

But Li noted it could still lead to numerous mistaken alerts — for instance, if someone were in full protective gear or in an adjacent apartment while physically close to an infected person.

Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said a conversation with Apple’s senior director for global privacy, Jane Horvath, assured her that the initiative will protect people’s privacy.

Sensitive information will stay on individual phones in encrypted form — no personally identifiable data would be collected — and alerts would be handled by public health agencies, not the tech companies. It says location data for users won’t be used and the identity of people who may have been infected will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently. “I think they’ve taken care of some of the really big problems,” Dixon said, noting the companies say they can turn off the system when it’s no longer needed. “The government is not going to have identity information of those testing positive.”

Asked about the Google-Apple effort at his daily news briefing, President Donald Trump called it “very interesting,” but expressed concern that “a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person’s freedom. We’re going to take a look at that.”

Security experts note that technology alone cannot effectively track down and identify people who may have been infected by COVID-19 carriers. Such efforts will require other tools and teams of public health care workers to locate people in the physical world, they say. In South Korea and China, such efforts have included the use of credit-card and public-transit records.

In general, epidemiologists say contact tracing won’t be effective without widely available testing. In the Czech Republic, the plan is to have soldiers perform testing; medical students have been trained to staff call centers for notifying people at high risk of infection.

The Czech app will use both Bluetooth technology and geolocation data from wireless carriers and banks to create “memory maps” that trace the movement of infected people. That will help them identify others they came into close proximity with in the five to 10 days before they tested positive.

The hope is to quickly isolate people who may be affected so the virus can be contained and restrictions on movement relaxed. The app builds on a popular cellular-location mapping app used by one in 10 Czechs, who number 10 million.

The Google-Apple solution will also be voluntary — or opt-in — but with far greater privacy protections, something the European Commission specified as a central requirement of any such apps in a policy recommendation this week for the 27-nation bloc.

Given the great need for effective contact-tracing — a tool epidemiologists have long employed to contain infectious disease outbreaks — Google and Apple will roll out their changes in two phases. In May, they will release software that will support public-health apps for both Android and iOS phones. In coming months, they will also build the functionality directly into the underlying phone operating systems.

On Friday, the companies released preliminary technical specifications for the effort, which they called “Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/after-you-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/after-you.html

149,13-4-20,Behind closed doors,"While physical abuse cases may have gone down, domestic violence has shown a steady rise amid Coronavirus lockdowns, reports Shalu Agarwal

Violence against women at any time is unacceptable. Amid lockdowns imposed worldwide due to Coronavirus pandemic, cases of domestic violence across the globe have seen a spike says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Asking women who are tormented to save themselves anyway they can, he also tweeted recently, “Sadly, there are reports of increase in domestic violence since the #COVID19 outbreak began. We call on countries to include services to #EndViolence as an essential service that must continue during the response. There is never any excuse for violence.”

In the UK, as reported in a national daily, more than 25 organisations, working for domestic violence victims, have reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the virus spread in the country. In India, according to a monthly magazine, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has also observed more than two-fold rise in gender-based violence in the country during the Coronavirus lockdown. From 116 cases in the first week of March, the total number of complaints by women rose to 257 in the final week (between March 23-April 1), out of which 69 were of domestic violence. As per Rekha Sharma, chairperson, NCW, the cases of domestic violence are higher in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Punjab. These are the states where maximum cases have been reported by women who could reach NCW through different platforms and narrate the torture. However, she pointed out that the actual number must be even larger because there would be many women who are unable to report because of the fear of torture they face from their husbands and in-laws. Well, one cannot even imagine the rise in the total number of cases if every woman in remote corners of India is given easy access to report such crimes without being scared of their harasser.

Before the lockdown, a report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in January 2020, revealed that domestic abuse topped the list of violence against women in 2018. Out of the total crimes registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against women, 31.9 per cent cases registered were listed under the ‘cruelty by husband or his relatives’. The same report claimed Uttar Pradesh to be the most unsafe place for women as 59,445 cases of crime were registered from the state in 2018. Of these crimes, 2,444 were registered as dowry deaths, while 284 cases as abetment to suicide of women in the state. The NCRB data from 2016 to 2018 indicated that Ghaziabad and Meerut districts in Western UP have maximum number of cases registered, which also included murders of wives by husbands.

“It all starts with arguments over petty things that soon transforms into ideological differences that destabilises the harmony between a married couple. Most men grow intolerant towards their partner speaking against them. They lose patience and with the objective of punishing them, they end up killing or torturing their wives,” shares Dr Kashika Jain, a psychologist.

According to Atul Sharma, a social activist, the crime statistics in Western UP are extremely frightening. “Both police and administration have to take serious steps to control the crime rate against women. Killing of women by their husbands and relatives is utterly disgraceful and unacceptable,” he adds.

Another factor that has resulted in the increase in numbers is that due to the lockdown, both men and women are unable to move out of their house to find some solace away from the monotony. Ideally, when a husband beats his wife, the woman finds comfort in her parents’ home but now she is unable to head even there. Men, on the other hand, are facing salary cuts, many have already lost their jobs and are anxious about the future. As a result, they are venting their frustration on women.

Ayushi Jain, a social development practitioner, says, “In dysfunctional households, spending time outside the house is a tried and tested method of avoiding violence at home. On one hand, going out allows men to take out the ‘built up anger’, on the other, for women, it’s a way of diffusing the intensity of what they are going through by getting in touch with the outside world, possibly seeking support through community gathering or counselling.” She believes that in the current situation, the ways to vent the growing tension are severely limited because there is more confrontation between the two parties during the lockdown, which substantially increases the violence.

Besides the NCW, many non-profit organisations have intervened in the situation and have started providing online counselling to such cases. Many have also issued guidelines on social media to educate people on ways of intervening in cases of domestic violence around them without jeopardising the life of the victim. However, women who have absolutely no information about how to access such platforms still remain vulnerable. With the lockdown having been further prolonged, the concerned authorities and NGOs are working to help the victims of domestic violence due to the growing need to take stronger initiatives, especially in smaller, more staunchly patriarchal regions like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

151,13-4-20,"Boris discharged from hosp, says Britain will defeat virus","Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday vowed that Britain “ will defeat” the deadly coronavirus, soon after he was discharged from hospital following week-long intensive care treatment for the disease that has killed over 10,000 people in the country.

Downing Street said that Johnson left St. Thomas’ Hospital in London and will head to his prime ministerial residence of Chequers in Buckinghamshire, south east England. In a video message recorded to mark his discharge as well as Easter Sunday, the 55-year-old leader said that the UK “ will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together” .

He said: “ I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS (National Health Service) has saved my life, no question. It’s hard to find the words to express my debt.

“ And the reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they (NHS doctors and nurses) were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed” .

Johnson name-checked a number of the “ utterly brilliant” doctors and nurses for their care during his week-long hospitalisation and stressed that the UK will win the “ national battle” against coronavirus because the NHS is the “ beating heart of this country”.

“ It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love. So thank you from me, and from all of us, to the NHS, and let’s remember to follow the rules on social distancing. Stay at home, protect our NHS — and save lives,” he said.

154,13-4-20,World’s militaries face new enemy in virus outbreak,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced militaries and militias to adapt to an invisible enemy, even as traditional conflicts grind on.

Armies have had to enforce social distancing rules among troops while helping with national outbreak containment and postponing maneuvers.

On Thursday, Saudi Arabia declared a temporary halt to fighting in Yemen because of the pandemic, while in Libya and Afghanistan conflicts are intensifying despite UN appeals for a global cease-fire. An outbreak in poor or war-scarred nations would be particularly devastating.

Before the pandemic, Israel’s military kept tabs on the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, carried out occasional airstrikes against Iran’s military presence in Syria and retaliated for sporadic rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.

Now troops are being mobilized to help police enforce quarantines, assist the elderly or provide child care for health workers.

To prevent infections, the army canceled some weekend leave and isolated certain groups of soldiers.

Most training exercises have been canceled or delayed, though the air force conducted a drill with U.S. Forces — with each pilot isolated in his own fighter jet.

The army chief had to self-quarantine after coming in contact with a virus carrier, though he eventually tested negative.

The conflicts on Israel’s frontiers persist. In late March, Syrian air defenses opened fire on missiles allegedly launched from Israeli warplanes.

The Israeli military said border defense remains its top priority.

“ Our enemies are still at our borders and our civilians are still within sniper or anti-tank missile range,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman.

The virus has spread to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and to Gaza, which has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since the militant Hamas group seized control in 2007.

The long-simmering Israeli-Palestinian conflict now exists side-by-side with efforts to contain the outbreak.

Troops have carried out home demolitions in the West Bank, soldiers killed two Palestinians in clashes and a trickle of rockets has been fired from Gaza.

But the virus is also opening doors to limited cooperation. Israel has helped deliver test kits and other supplies to both the West Bank and Gaza.

An Israeli-Palestinian committee is coordinating the movement of Palestinian workers and security forces in the West Bank.

Spurred by concern over the pandemic, the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen declared a temporary cease-fire after five years of war.

The Houthis have dismissed the offer as a ploy and clashes continue, casting doubt over a future peace agreement.

The UN had called for an end to escalating fighting so authorities can confront the coronavirus. Yemen confirmed its first case this week, while foreign backers Iran and Saudi Arabia have struggled to stem massive outbreaks.

An outbreak in Yemen, where the conflict has devastated the health care system, could be catastrophic.

The past month has brought more human suffering across the country.

Ground fighting in the north caused 270 deaths in 10 days. The Houthis fired missiles at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, triggering retaliatory strikes on Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. A rebel attack on the city of Taiz, in western Yemen, killed at least six female prisoners and wounded two dozen women and children.

Even modest hopes for peace talks in Yemen stand in contrast to Libya, where rival forces have ignored humanitarian pleas for a cease-fire, seeking to exploit the diplomatic void left by the pandemic. Eastern-based forces under the command of Khalifa Hifter are escalating a year-long siege of the capital, Tripoli, which they want to wrest from the U.N.-backed government.

Artillery shells crashed through living rooms, cars, a sea port and three hospitals over the last month, killing at least 16 civilians and wounding over 30. Grad rockets struck one of the country’s few coronavirus facilities, sending shrapnel into a doctor’s leg during surgery and forcing seriously ill patients to evacuate as the bombs fell.

Militias allied with the Tripoli government have expanded their use of Turkish drones, at one point attacking an aircraft allegedly carrying medical supplies and protective gear. In South Korea, which has managed to slow the outbreak, the military is key to containment.

More than 450 military medical staff and 2,700 troops have been deployed to help with treatment at hospitals, screening travelers, enforcing quarantine, producing face masks and helping trace the contacts of virus carriers, according to the Defense Ministry.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/world---s-militaries-face-new-enemy-in-virus-outbreak.html
155,13-4-20,US Supreme Court to hear appeal on abortion during virus crisis,"Abortion rights advocates on Saturday called on the US Supreme Court to urgently intervene to force Texas to reinstate the right to abortion, which has been suspended in the state since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

This is the first appeal related to COVID-19 to reach the highest American court, which has been operating only in writing for nearly a month.

156,13-4-20,BRO opens Srinagar-Leh highway,"Braving the threat of falling prey to coronavirus and the harsh winters, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) personnel have opened the strategic Srinagar-Leh highway. This road connects Ladakh to the rest of the world and was blocked by snow for the last four months, thereby, virtually cutting Ladakh from other regions of the country. Incidentally, snowfall this winter was more than previous 60 years thereby making it more difficult for the BRO to clear it.

Giving details here about traffic resuming on this critically important road, defence ministry official said here on Sunday nearly 18 tankers and other essential commodities were initially allowed to move towards Leh from Zozilla pass at 11,500 feet. This was managed despite fresh snowfall in the pass, they added.

The 425-km road from Srinagar to Leh was closed since December last year due to heavy snowfall at Zojila pass. As per the directions from Divisional Commissioner Ladakh, there was an emergent need for stockpiling essential commodities in the Union Territory of Ladakh. Keeping that in mind the team of Project Beacon and Project Vijayak cleared fresh snow around Zojilla and made the road motorable.

Snowfall of this year had broken records of the last six decades. The snow clearance operations were undertaken by project Beacon of BRO from Gagangir to zero point and the same was done by project Vijayak from Drass towards zero point, officials said while elaborating upon the challenges faced by the BRO to finish this task.

This road sustains local population in Ladakh and beyond besides provide all the all-important support to the troops deployed on the Line of Actual Control(LAC) facing China and Line of Control(LOC) with Pakistan. During the winter months, when this road is closed every year, supplies are maintained by air.

In a related development, notwithstanding the threat of COVID-19, the BRO personnel are working relentlessly to completely replace Daporijo bridge (430 feet Multi-Span Bailey Bridge), the only lifeline of Upper Subansiri district, Arunachal Pradesh to restore Lines of Communication for all 451 villages and security forces located along the LAC. The armed forces have also activated isolation wards near the LAC and the LOC to deal with any case of the pandemic.

Giving details of the BRO undertaking the mission to construct the bridge, officials said more than 100 personnel of 23 BRTF/Project Arunank, on special request from the local administration, is working in full swing in spite of the dilapidated state of the existing bridge.

They said the BRO is committed to opening this vital line of communication by planned date, with all necessary precautionary measures. This bridge will ensure uninterrupted supplies like food and ammunition to the soldiers deployed on the LAC besides catering to the needs of the local population, sources said.

The BRO is the lead construction agency to build strategically important roads all along the LOC and LAC in inhospitable terrain and inclement weather. At present, the BRO is entrusted with the responsibility of constructing 72 strategic roads mostly in states having the LAC facing China.

Given this backdrop, the BRO in the northern part of the country is presently engaged in snow clearance operations on Manali - Leh axis, day and night despite inclement weather and COVID 19 threat to provide relief to Lahaul valley and Ladakh in an earlier time frame. Presently, Rohtang Pass and Baralachala Pass are being cleared by four snow clearance teams. This is the first time, BRO personnel were inducted by air to Sarchu to carry out snow clearance of mighty Baralachala Pass from Sarchu side.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/bro-opens-srinagar-leh-highway.html
157,13-4-20,On the righteous path,"When we work for self-transformation with a tenacious and determined will, society will change, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

All of us have heard the proverb, “Where there is a will, there is a way” often and most of us know what it means. However, we don’t realise that this proverb can be an important tool for self-transformation. The question of one’s inner transformation is linked to their will and resoluteness of spirit. Hence, if one decides with a strong will not to harbour any negative thoughts or allow oneself to indulge in any kind of bad behaviour, one will succeed in the process of inner change. Otherwise, one will feel demoralised and give up the effort to change oneself.

We must know that in the process of self transformation or change, the temptation to work for winning tributes and laurels and to rise to fame and glory will be strong. One will feel attracted towards the opposite sex and this will too will exert a powerful pull on the mind. The situation will be provocative and one might feel cheated by as there are wordly temptations.

This is the time when it is essential to stand firm and face the storm like a rock and tell yourself that it is a question of your integrity and honour. You made a promise to yourself that you won’t be a puppet or a slave of negative habits. Question yourself if “Am I going to break my promise? Am I a person who does not stick to his/her words or whose promise has no value? Wouldn't it be a breach of trust? Because you made a promise with god not to indulge in nefarious acts and swore that you had given up. Does it behove a person with self-respect to break his promise and to do what he himself had considered as spiritually obnoxious and morally evil?” This kind of self-talk is helpful while one is on the path of self transformation.

It has been observed that one of the weaknesses that results in spiritual ruin of man is that, he postpones the implementation of certain decisions even though they were made by him and are for his own good. This happens especially if a person fails in the initial steps of self-transformation. As a result of this, he feels frustrated and loses his self confidence. Having lost his will, he gives up the effort and says to himself: “I am not giving it up forever. I will start and fight again. But perhaps, the time has not yet come. I will start it on some more auspicious and memorable day.” And when that day finally comes, he thinks that, for this day, he will start afresh. But again there is a pitfall and then he starts all over again. But one who is not determined to continue against all odds, will admit his defeat again and again. And, having lost his heart, will either give up the efforts forever or will postpone it until another auspicious day.

Such people get used to repeated failure and, in the process, become weak. Let us, therefore, make a strong affirmation and say to ourselves: ‘Even if heavens fall, I am now not going to fall. My pledge is tougher than steel. And I am not going to falter and will march from great to greater heights!’ When we work for self-change with a tenacious and determined will, only then will the society change. Apart from this individual responsibility of self-change, there is no other known way of worldly transformation.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/on-the-righteous-path-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/on-the-righteous-path.html
158,13-4-20,Oly postponement blessing in disguise for Fouaad,"Indian equestrian ace Fouaad Mirza on Sunday said that the postponement of Tokyo Olympics to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic was a “blessing in disguise” for him as he will get more time for preparation.

The 28-year-old Mirza, who won two Silver medals in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia, is currently training in Germany.

“The postponement of Olympics is like blessing in disguise for me as it gives much needed rest to the horses and practice for me,” Mirza said.

""My favourite horse Seigneur Medicott has recovered from injury and I will start training with him. Touching Wood and Fernhill Facetime got time to rest and they will be fresh whenever the season begins,” he added.

Mirza won a Silver each in individual eventing and team eventing in the 2018 Asian Games on Seigneur Medicott while Touching Wood and Fernhill Facetime took him close to fulfil his Olympics dream.

He said India has secured a berth for the Olympics but he wants to confirm his personal quota for the Tokyo Games.

“For a confirmed Olympics berth I have to compete in one more event. That is called ‘Four Star Long’. I can complete this task in international ‘Four Star Long’ competition. My choice of competition was to be held in Montilibretti, Italy from April 9-12 but that got cancelled due to Covid-19.”

If Mirza passes the last hurdle, he will become India’s third equestrian participant in the Olympics after late Indrajit Lamba (1996) and Imtiaz Anees (2000).

Mirza is currently training under the watchful eyes of German legend Sandra Auffarth who won a Gold (team event) and Bronze (individual) in 2012 London Olympics, besides a Silver (team event) in 2016 Rio Games.

160,13-4-20,"IPL can be held without crowd, T20 WC can’t: Maxwell","Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell believes a rescheduled IPL can be held behind closed doors but it will be difficult to justify conducting the upcoming T20 World Cup without fans cheering from the stands.

Both the 13th IPL and T20 World Cup are uncertain at the moment with the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the options for BCCI is to host the IPL in the October-November window if the ICC decides to postpone the T20 World Cup (October 18-November 15). There has also been talks of conducting the tournaments behind closed doors.

One of the stalwarts of T20 cricket, Maxwell feels if crowds weren’t possible for either of the two events, the IPL would be a better option to go ahead.

“... It’s going to be hard for us to have crowds. I think if IPL goes ahead they can probably survive without any crowds, but I can’t see the T20 World Cup surviving without any people there,” Maxwell told ABC Grandstand.

“It’s going to be hard for us to justify having a World Cup when we can’t get people into the grounds. So I can’t see it happening in the near future. We’ve got to take care of everyone’s health and wellbeing.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-can-be-held-without-crowd--t20-wc-can---t--maxwell.html
161,13-4-20,Dhoni should have retired after 2019 WC: Akhtar,"Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar says he cannot fathom why Mahendra Singh Dhoni has “dragged it for so long” as the right time for the maverick ex-India skipper to call it quits was after last year’s ODI World Cup.

Akhtar said he hopes the 38-year-old Dhoni gets a resounding farewell despite his resolute silence on what the future holds.

“This guy has served to the best of his ability. He should leave cricket with dignity. I don’t know why he dragged it for so long. He should have retired after the World Cup,” Akhtar said from Islamabad.

“If I would have been in his place, I would have hung up my boots. I could have played shorter formats for three-four years but I left (after the 2011 WC) as I wasn’t into the game 100 per cent. So why drag?” he asked.

Dhoni, who has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal in July, was preparing to make a much-anticipated comeback with the IPL, which is now unlikely to take place.

If he had done well in the IPL, there was a possibility of him playing the T20 World Cup in October-November.

Akhtar believes Dhoni is now in a limbo but deserves a grand send-off despite the anti-climactic turn of events.

“As a country, you should let him go with a lot of respect and dignity. Give him a nice send off. He has won you the World Cup and done wonders for India. He is a wonderful human being at the same time. But right now, he seems to be stuck,” he said.

Akhtar said Dhoni should have ideally retired after last year’s 50-over World Cup.

“When he could not finish the game in the semifinal (against New Zealand). I felt he should have retired but he can only answer why he didn’t,” he said.

“He should have played a farewell series after the World Cup may be and then said goodbye in a manner befitting his great stature.”

Talking about the Indian team’s inability to win a global event since the 2013 Champions Trophy, Akhtar said Virat Kohli’s team needs match-winners in the middle-order.

“Winning tournaments is one thing but staying at top is another. India is still the top-ranked Test team and is almost among the top teams in the limited-overs format. So, we should not base their performance only on their showing in ICC events.

“Of course, they should win ICC events and they have to. This team, when the top four score, they win more often than not. But if they don’t, then it is an issue. Another thing I noticed is that you need a match-winner like Yuvraj (Singh) or Dhoni in the middle-order,” he explained.

“When we toured India in 1998, we always thought we would run through India after getting the top order. There was no match winner until Yuvraj came in, followed by Dhoni.

“Then you started seeing change in results. Right now, the problem is lack of finishers,” opined the 44-year-old.

Akhtar doesn’t see any cricket happening for the next six to eight months as coronavirus continues to wreak havoc around the world.

But if India’s tour of Australia takes place, Akhtar sees all four Tests going down the wire.

India had won their first ever Test series in Australia early last year. But this time, Australia will be a different kettle of fish in the presence of Steve Smith and David Warner, who were serving ball-tampering bans when India toured last.

“Despite the loss in New Zealand, I think India is a very, very good team and can give a tough time to Australia. But again, India have to prove that like they did the last time.

“However, I don’t see that series happening. My assessment is there won’t be any cricket for next one year. The T20 World Cup is not going to happen.

“We are dealing with a pandemic at the moment. Any industry, which requires crowd gathering, is going to suffer,” Akhtar added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-should-have-retired-after-2019-wc--akhtar-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-should-have-retired-after-2019-wc--akhtar.html
162,13-4-20,Woods relives joy of winning fifth Masters,"Fifteen-time major winner Tiger Woods says he can't help feeling like the green jacket he claimed for winning the Masters last year doesn't belong in his locker anymore.

The 44-year-old Woods doesn't like the idea of holding onto the coveted sports coat due to the world-wide coronavirus epidemic that led to the 2020 Masters tournament being postponed until November.

The pandemic ""has been a shock to all of us. We know it's still going to continue to get worse. It's a very difficult situation, a very difficult time, a unique time in history,"" Woods told CBS television on Sunday.

The American broadcaster replayed Woods' stunning comeback victory on Sunday with the five-time Masters winner adding his own commentary from his home in Florida.

Woods said it felt odd not to be in full training for a major and also to be keeping the winner's jacket for another seven months.

""This is not the way I wanted to have the jacket for a longer period of time,"" he said.

""Come Masters Tuesday, after our Champions Dinner, we put our jackets back up in our lockers, and the next person who gets to take it off the grounds is the champion that particular week.

""So hopefully we'll have it in November, and we'll be able to compete for it."" The Masters has been rescheduled for November 12-15.

Woods says he was raring to go and would have been healthy for this year's event.

""Yes, I would have been good to go,"" Woods said. ""Mind and body were coming together. I was not my normal self (earlier in the week), and all of my normal pre-major championship self.

""I'm used to having this four times a year. I kind of get in that mode. And it started happening again."" Looking back, Woods said he remembers little about his merrymaking on the green after holing the final putt 12 months ago.

""Well, the funny part about the whole thing is -- I don't remember screaming. I don't remember putting my arms up, and I don't remember yelling.

""That's one of those kind of blackout moments. There's certain celebrations throughout my career that I've made putts or celebrated, I just don't recall it. I guess I'm so locked into the moment,"" he told CBS.

""What I do remember is my eyes coming back down and seeing people in front of me. I do remember that. I remember all the arms up. But as far as me celebrating, I don't remember that part.

'Low times'

""I remember 'Where the hell's Joey (LaCava)? I need Joey.' And I finally found Joey and said, 'We did it.' Joey was there helping me go to soccer games when I couldn't drive a car. He came down here as a friend and helped try and nurse me back to health. He was there in those low times.""

What was extra special to Woods was embracing his mother at the final green.

""My mom's there and she's patting me on my back, and kept saying she's so proud of me, my dad would be so proud if he were here. She said, 'I love you,' and I said, 'I love you, too, Mom.'""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/woods-relives-joy-of-winning-fifth-masters-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/woods-relives-joy-of-winning-fifth-masters.html
163,13-4-20,"If IPL doesn't happen, it will be difficult for Dhoni to make comeback: Gambhir","Former India opener Gautam Gambhir says if IPL is not played this year, it will be difficult for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to make a comeback to the Indian team.

Dhoni last played for India in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July last year.

Since then he hasn't played any competitive cricket and legends such as Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have already said that it's getting increasingly difficult for the Jharkhand dasher to make an international return after such a prolonged sabbatical.

He was expected to be seen in action at this year's IPL but the chances of T20 league being played are remote due to the COVID-19.

""If the IPL does not happen this year, then it will become very difficult for MS Dhoni to make a comeback. On what basis can he (Dhoni) be selected since he's not been playing for the last one or one and a half year,"" Gambhir said on Star Sports show 'Cricket Connected'.

The 38-year-old Gambhir picked KL Rahul, who has been keeping in ODIs, as an ""apt replacement"" for Dhoni.

""Obviously his (Rahul's) keeping is not as good as Dhoni's, but if you are looking at T20 cricket, Rahul's a utility player, can keep and bat at No. 3 or 4. If the IPL does not happen, then Dhoni's chances for a comeback look dim.

""Ultimately, you are representing India, so whoever dishes out the best performance and can win the match for India should play for the team,"" added Gambhir.

The southpaw also felt that retirement was Dhoni's personal decision.

""As far as his retirement plans go by, that's his personal choice,"" said Gambhir.

However, his former teammate and test specialist VVS Laxman feels that Dhoni can continue playing IPL.

""Not only this IPL, he (Dhoni) will probably play in the next couple of IPLs, and then we will take a call about his future as a cricketer,"" Laxman said on the same show.

However, Laxman, a veteran of 134 Tests, said that the new selection committee, chaired by former spinner Sunil Joshi, will have to discuss Dhoni's future with him.

""Dhoni will be very clear, as far as his plans are concerned, I'm sure he must have communicated that with (captain) Virat Kohli, (coach) Ravi Shastri immediately after the 2019 World Cup in England,"" said Laxman.

""The new selection committee will have to sit down with MS Dhoni and understand his future, as far as Indian cricket is concerned. But MS Dhoni will continue to play for CSK and do well for CSK,"" said Laxman, who amassed 8,781 Test runs.

165,13-4-20,Love has four paws,"Whether it’s a dog, a cat or a hedgehog, pets are proving to be sources of comfort in crisis

Lala, a 3-month-old black Lab, romped into Ufuoma George’s life a few weeks ago, just as she retreated into her New York apartment in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic.

Lala, she thought, would be company. But she’s turned out to be so much more. “Being alone at home kind of is hard,” says George, “but with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to play with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it’s kind of like really calming and comforting.”

Whether it’s a dog, a cat or, yes, a hedgehog named Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.

Laura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they’re happy to oblige. “We wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,” Evans said. “She’s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.”

Nancy Karan said her pet, Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, “because it’s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.”

In Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens. “I think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It’s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,” she said.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens. “It frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,” she said.

While many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.

“We can’t blame them if they’re like, ‘I’m bored! I’m bored!’ and they haven’t done anything all day. It’s not their fault,” she said.

That doesn’t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen’s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask. “We don’t want her catching Coronavirus,” he joked.

Aubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California Polytechnic State University, said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals. “In a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you’re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/love-has-four-paws-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/love-has-four-paws.html
166,13-4-20,"MS looked in spectacular touch in CSK camp, say teammates","Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s intensity stood out and he looked in spectacular touch during the IPL camp, vouched his Chennai Super Kings teammates, who remained unperturbed by speculations over their talisman’s future in international cricket.

The three-time winners had commenced their training on March 2 with Dhoni joining from day one, but it was suspended on March 14 owing to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, who was picked by the franchise during the auction late last year, said Dhoni was focused and showed match-like intensity in the way he was batting and keeping.

“Mahi bhai was absolutely focused, training purposefully and was looking really good. He was showing match-like intensity in the way he was batting and keeping and that was rubbing off on others,” Chawla was quoted as saying on the CSK website.

Karn Sharma, another leggie in the squad, said the CSK captain’s enthusiasm and involvement were a source of inspiration for the other members.

“Mahi bhai was batting for two to three hours at nets every day, and the way he was hitting the ball no one could say he was returning from a long break. The way he was training was a huge motivation for the rest of us,” he added.

“During match simulations, he was very involved, speaking to the bowlers, and the rhythm he was in, it was a big boost for our team,” Sharma said.

Meanwhile the team’s bowling coach, Lakshmipathy Balaji, described Dhoni as a natural athlete and that he was clearly looking forward to the season.

“MS is a natural athlete and supremely fit. He didn’t look rusty, didn’t look one bit like he was away from the game. He was clearly looking forward to the season, the way he was training, batting, keeping and being involved with the team,” Balaji added.

Team physiotherapist Tommy Simsek said it was the first time in about 10 years he saw Dhoni do some wicketkeeping training.

“For the first time in about 10 years I saw MS do some wicketkeeping training and that goes to show that he was definitely keen, definitely focused to do well this year,” he added.

“I was worried that he hadn’t done much for a long time and then that he would try and do too much, too soon and he may get injured.

“It turned that I need not have worried — MS being the professional, he looked in really good shape. He said he’d started (training) a month or so before our fitness camp,” Simsek said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ms-looked-in-spectacular-touch-in-csk-camp--say-teammates.html
167,13-4-20,Kohli can be compared with Kapil: Srikkanth,"Former India opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth feels that current captain Virat Kohli can be compared with the legendary Kapil Dev, given both have tremendous self-belief and never-say-die attitude.

Srikkanth was part of the squad that Kapil led to victory in 1983 World Cup while Kohli featured in the team that won the 2011 edition of the showpiece.

“I’ve played along with Kapil Dev and I’ve been the chairman of selection committee for choosing Virat Kohli and I can tell you, both of their attitudes are absolutely the same,” Srikkanth said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected.

“Both have a tremendous amount of self-belief and they know they only go out with intention to win. The never-say-die attitude in them and the aggressiveness makes them fantastic during chases and the positive attitude both of them have makes them very similar to each other.”

On the same show, former batsman VVS Laxman said that Kohli never lets his guard down.

“The one thing I admire about Virat Kohli is his intensity. One thing I was worried about was whether he will burn out quickly. But not even one session or one over he lets his intensity drop and that is really commendable,” Laxman said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-can-be-compared-with-kapil--srikkanth.html
168,13-4-20,FTP for next two years should be reworked: Azhar,"Former India captain-turned-administrator Mohammed Azharuddin feels that all cricket boards should come together to redraw the international calendar as the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that the current schedule is irredeemable.

Azharuddin, who is the president of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), feels that tweaking of the Futures Tours and Programmes (FTP) is also necessary to accommodate IPL, which is important for both domestic and foreign players.

“I am sure they can have a restructured FTP for two years because of so much of uncertainty in prevailing circumstances. I mean you can always prepare for good times but you can’t prepare for bad times,” the 57-year-old former skipper said.

“Once things settle down, we can have a dialogue with other member nations,” he added.

The IPL, which was scheduled to be held from March 29-May 24, is set to be postponed indefinitely as the country stares at a lockdown till the end of this month.

“I think if they have to slot IPL, the whole itinerary needs to be changed. That’s one option or else stick to the current itinerary with whatever gone being gone.

“But that means huge losses for all the stakeholders and is not practical,” said Azharuddin, whose own Association hosts seven home games of Sunrisers Hyderabad.

“Therefore, I am expecting a complete overhaul of the FTP, if we have to fit in the IPL. I feel all the boards will agree as everybody is getting affected. But obviously the BCCI gets affected more,” he added.

IPL has so much prominence because foreign players like Jos Buttler and Pat Cummins have expressed their willingness to participate in the tournament at some point of the year.

“No one will say no to IPL. Not even the foreign players. So many people thrive on IPL,” he set the record straight.

“For a lot of our domestic guys, who are not India regulars, let’s accept they look forward to the IPL.”

However, the man who led India in three editions of the 50-over World Cup, doesn’t think that the World T20 in Australia in October-November will be done away with.

“I don’t think World T20’s slot will be gone. It’s third week of October and if things are okay by then, I would believe World T20 will happen.

“This is purely my personal opinion as you can’t tinker with a World Cup. But obviously IPL will get accommodated in somewhere.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ftp-for-next-two-years-should-be-reworked--azhar.html
169,13-4-20,WC final was most dramatic game: Morgan,"England limited-overs skipper Eoin Morgan considers 2019 World Cup final as the “most dramatic game of cricket” that has ever been played, saying it helped the sport grow “outside the normal bubble” and lifted its profile.

England were adjudged the winners of the 50-over World Cup last year on the basis of their superior boundary count after the epic final against New Zealand, and also the ensuing Super Over, ended in a tie at the Lord’s in London.

“The final was the most dramatic game of cricket and the best game of cricket that probably has ever been played which contributes to the hype of it,” Morgan was quoted as saying by Kolkata Knight Riders official website.

It was a landmark day for sport overall as Novak Djokovic edged out Roger Federer in an epic Wimbledon summit clash some kilometres away, that’s considered to be the longest ever final in the history of the prestigious tennis tournament.

“I think one of the great things about it was on the day of that great game of cricket was, it’s always now associated with the longest ever Wimbledon final that was epic as well,” Morgan said.

“It helped us in growing cricket outside of the normal bubble that we’re already in to a different audience, and for us at home it has lifted the profile of the game like we’ve never seen.”

England had crashed out in the group stage of the 2015 World Cup and Morgan said it was an amazing journey that the team went through from that embarrassing defeat to reaching the pinnacle of world cricket after four years.

“I think the journey we went on is probably the most exciting. In 2015, the embarrassing nature in which we were bundled out of that World Cup and the journey we embarked on to try and change the brand of cricket we played with a new group of extremely talented players over the course of 4 years — it’s brilliant,” he said.

“Just being able to impart some of my knowledge and experience along with some very senior players and a group of great support staff who always continue to question what we do in a good way in order to hold us accountable. It sort of culminated in last year’s World Cup.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wc-final-was-most-dramatic-game--morgan.html

In a statement to the London club’s supporters, the veteran former England manager insisted there was widespread support for playing the 2019/20 season out to a finish.

“Everyone is in total agreement we need an end to this season,” wrote Hodgson.

“We don’t want artificial means of deciding who wins the league, who gets into the Champions League, who gets relegated and promoted.”

His letter came after UEFA, European football’s governing body, warned a failure to complete domestic leagues could see clubs excluded from continental competitions next season.

Hodgson said players who, in common with the rest of the British population, are currently in lockdown would ideally like three to four weeks’ preparation before playing a match again.

But the 72-year-old added: “I accept there may have to be a squeeze on that time-frame.”

173,13-4-20,20% +ve cases need ICU support,"909 new cases, 34 deaths in 24 hours; total above 9K; Govt well prepared

Nearly 20 per cent of the Covid-19 positive cases need ICU support in the country. This has put acute pressure on the health officials to mobilise ventilators and other life-saving support equipment.

Addressing the daily Press briefing here on Sunday, Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said that on March 29, India had 979 positive cases and 196 needed critical care and oxygen. That time, 41,900 dedicated Covid beds were available in 163 State-run hospitals.

“On April 4, when we required 580 beds, we had 67,500 beds, on April 9, 1,100 beds were required but there were 85,000 beds available in the country,” he said.

Agarwal said as on Sunday India has 8,356 positive cases and of these 20 per cent cases need ICU support. “That means today 1,671 patients need oxygen support and critical care treatment, and we have 1,05,000 dedicated Covid beds available in the country in 601 hospitals. This figure is important to show that the Government is planning things in advance and is over prepared, he said.

In addition, the Government is also increasing the number of dedicated Covid hospitals and isolation facilities as per the evolving situations and precautionary measures because this is a pandemic and number can be exponential. Our effort is to take advanced steps, he said.

India, which is into the world’s biggest lockdown to combat spreading of the highly contagious pathogen, on Sunday reported an increase of 909 cases, taking the country’s total number of coronavirus cases to 8,356 by Sunday morning. The number rose to 9,205 late on Sunday and States were still reporting.

Agarwal said, “This is a pandemic and numbers can be exponential. Our effort is to take advanced steps.”

“A total of 8,356 positive cases have been reported in the country. At least 909 new cases and 34 deaths have been recorded in 24 hours. A good news is that 74 people have been cured in the last 24 hours taking the total number of cured people to 716. Total 273 deaths have been reported so far.”

About the preparations, Agarwal said the Government has identified 14 institutes, including AIIMS and NIMHANS, to mentor medical colleges and expand Covid-19 testing capacity.

Agarwal said AIIMS Delhi is now equipped with 250 beds including 50 ICU beds, and high dependent units attached with beds, and 70 ventilators.

In Safdarjung Hospital, one complete block has been converted into Covid block and has 500 beds. “We have provided 1,680 beds to Andhra Pradesh. As on today there were 148 ventilators available, we provided 444 additional ventilators. One special medical officer is appointed in every State.”

He also added that 9,000 beds were identified by the Army and 7,000 beds are available in military hospitals. Waterproof tents are also available in far flung areas and two patients can be kept in one tent, he said.

On being asked about resurgence in COVID19 cases in last few days in China, Japan and Korea, Agarwal said, “It is a cause of concern for us too, so we need to make sure that we continue to follow our containment and social distancing measures like we are following today.”

According to the health experts, COVID-19’s immediate assault on the body is extensive. It targets the lungs, but a lack of oxygen and widespread inflammation can also damage the kidneys, liver, heart, brain, and other organs.

According to a review ‘Intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): challenges and recommendations’ published in the Lancet Journal (Respiratory Medicine), as the pandemic spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with it.

It stressed that streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key, it said.

Amid the spike in the number COVID-19 cases, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that in the last five days, the average number of 15,747 samples have been tested per day. The average number of samples which tested positive daily is 584.

More than 40 vaccines are under development but none has reached the next stage. As of now, there is no vaccine, said Dr Manoj Murhekar, scientist from ICMR.

Across the world, the total number of coronavirus cases has crossed 1.8 lakh. With over 5 lakh cases, the US has been the worst affected country, followed by Spain (1.63 lakh), Italy (1.52 lakh), France (1.3 lakh) and Germany (1.25 lakh).

The mortality across the world has risen to over 1 lakh. In the US, the toll has crossed 20,000, followed by Italy (19,468), Spain (16,606) and France (13,832).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/20---ve-cases-need-icu-support-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/20---ve-cases-need-icu-support.html
174,13-4-20,Dharavi turning Mumbai into powder keg,"In what is turning out to be a nightmare for the health authorities, 15 more persons tested positive for coronavirus in Mumbai’s Dharavi on Sunday, taking the total number of infected cases to 43 in Asia’s largest slum.

Of the 15 new infected persons, nine have been quarantined at the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex. “All these nine cases are high-risks contacts of Social Nagar patient who died at KEM Hospital and those who tested positive in Madina Nagar. Four new positive cases have been reported in Shastri Nagar, while two persons have tested positive in Janata Cooperative Housing society,” a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official from G/North Ward in north central Mumbai said.

Of the new cases, two are women aged 20 and 24 years. The remaining 13 are male patients in the age group of 18 years and 66 years.

There have been four Covid-19 deaths in the most densely populated slum. Of the fatalities, two deaths have been reported from Dr Baliga Nagar, while one person succumbed to Covid-19 in Social Nagar. The remaining one death has been reported from Kalayanwadi.

Not wanting to take any chances, health workers conducted door-to-door screening of all the Dharavi residents. Simultaneously, a team of local private doctors of Dharavi and BMC medical staff checked the temperature and enquired the residents about their travel history. Over 150 doctors, working under the auspices of Indian Medical Council and Maharashtra Medical Council, have been assisting the BMC in the screening drive.

The medical teams will report to the BMC on the number of persons who have shown symptoms for coronavirus. “All those who have symptoms are being kept in quarantine,” a BMC officer said.

Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police personnel are using drones to monitor the movement of people in the congested lanes of Dharavi.

In a related development, the police and health authorities are enforcing the lockdown measures strictly in Asia’s largest slum.

Following the total lockdown, the movement of people has come down drastically on the roads, while all shops and establishments, fruit/vegetable markets or vendors, hawkers, etc, have been shut down, barring medical stores in Dharavi.

On its part, the BMC authorities have identified 10 hotspots within Dharavi, which is spread over 240-hectare area, and are maintaining vigilance on matters relating to health in the area. There are 60,000 to 70,000 families (more three lakh people) in Dharavi.

Dharavi has several business units -- right from textiles to pottery to fabrication to leather industry. Plastic recycling and garbage segregation too is done here.

176,13-4-20,"Nihangs attack police team, chop off cop’s hand","A group of “Nihangs” (Sikhs armed with traditional weapons and dressed in loose blue top) chopped off a police officer’s hand and injured three other Punjab policemen after being stopped from violating the lockdown in Patiala district, triggering a police operation in which shots were fired and 11 people arrested at a gurdwara.

In a late night information, doctors at the Chandigarh’s PGIMER reattached the 50-year-old ASI’s hand after an over seven-hour long surgery, officials said.

As many 11 people, including a woman, were arrested from a local Gurdwara after exchange of fire in connection with the attack on the police party at Patiala vegetable market in the morning, where the group fled after the 6.15 am incident in Sanaur town.

One of the arrested men suffered gunshot wound, while a mandi official was also hurt earlier. “We have recovered arms, Rs 39 lakh cash, traditional arms like irons rods, khanda, bhaale (javelin), and cannabis during the raid on the gurudwara. Weapons, including guns and petrol bombs, have also been recovered from the hideout,” said Patiala’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu.

Video clips regarding the incident have been doing the rounds on the social media, attracting criticism from all over the country, cutting across party lines.

Strongly condemning the attack, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has warned that anyone violating the curfew, imposed in the State since March 23 to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, would be strictly dealt with.

“The police personnel are risking their lives to save the people of Punjab and any attack on them would not be tolerated,” he said while directing the State Director General of Police (DGP) to come down heavily on those trying to disturb the law and order of the state at this difficult time.

One of the viral video clips shows the Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Harjeet Singh seeking help after the “Nihang” (members of a Sikh sect whose adherents carry traditional arms and wear blue robes) severed his hand with a sword. A man picks up the severed hand and gives it to the officer who was then taken away from the scene of incident on a two-wheeler.

The ASI was then rushed to Rajindra Hospital, from where he was referred to the PGIMER, Chandigarh, where he underwent seven-and-a-half hour long “successful” surgery, and will stay under observation.

With curfew restrictions in place amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the police has put up barricades outside the wholesale market and entry was restricted to those having curfew passes.

“About four-five Nihangs arrived in an SUV and were told to stop by the mandi officials. They were asked to show curfew passes. But they rammed the vehicle against the gate and the barricades,” said the SSP.

“The Nihangs were spotted by the Mandi Board of the local vegetable market when they were trying to enter the market without passes. The assailants first thrashed the Mandi Board employees and then a scuffle broke out between them and the nearby police officers who had rushed to the scene. During the confrontation, the culprits took out their swords and chopped off the hand of ASI Harjeet Singh while the SHO Sadar Singh and ASI Raj Singh sustained injuries on their arms and legs,” said the government spokesperson.

After the attack, the men fled to the Gurudwara Khichdi Sahib, managed by them in Balbera village around 25 km from Patiala city, while being chased by the police. Senior police officers, including the SSP, then arrived at the scene and sent additional police forces to nab the culprits.

The accused were nabbed after the police party, led by IG Patiala Range Jatinder Aulakh and SSP Sidhu, were fired upon from inside the Nihang Dera Complex which also houses Khichdi Sahib Gurudwara.

“The operation followed several hours of stand-off and many rounds of appeals and negotiations led by Patiala SSP with the Dera Head Baba Balwinder Singh to surrender with their weapons and swords but the Nihangs refused to surrender. One Nihang, Nirbhav Singh, suffered an injury in the incident, was immediately rushed to Patiala Hospital,” said the spokesperson.

Giving details of the entire incident, DGP Gupta said the accused had set up morchas inside the Dera Complex and had placed LPG cylinders, along the Dera perimeter and were getting ready to set-off blasts to cause injuries to the police party, which was surrounded by the police party that chased them.

Despite repeated announcements from the public address system, they refused to surrender and, instead, abused the police and threatened them with serious consequences if they tried to come closer.

The police then persuaded the Sarpanch and some villagers to go in and persuade the men to come out but they failed. Soon thereafter, the police party heard loud shouts and noises from inside the gurdwara premises, suggesting that some innocent people and hostages within might have got caught in the trouble, according to the DGP.

A Patiala Police team led by IG Patiala and SSP Patiala, along with a team of the Special Operations Group (SOG), led by ADGP Rakesh Chandra, then moved into the premises, followed “to flush out the rogue band of nihang criminals”.

A few shots were fired by the accused at the police personnel before they were nabbed, said the DGP, adding that entire operation was handled delicately so that the maryada and sanctum sanctorum of the Gurdwara Sahib was not disturbed in any manner.

“The accused included the five persons involved in the brutal attack on the Punjab Police team posted at the vegetable market in Sanaur early on Sunday morning. They had crashed through a series of barricades and attacked the police personnel who inquired about their curfew passes, said the DGP Gupta, adding that Baba Balwinder Singh, the Nihang Head, was the main perpetrator of the attack on the police party at the Patiala Sabzi Mandi this morning. He came to the market with four other persons, in a Tata Xenon vehicle.

DGP said a huge cache of weapons as well as hand-held weapons, such as barchhe and kirpans, and some used cartridges were seized from the accused, in addition to two petrol bombs and LPG cylinders, five bags of poppy husk mixed with sulpha, other drugs in commercial quantity and Rs 39 lakhs in cash. Some bottles with chemical substances were also found inside the premises.

ASI Harjit Singh, whose hand was reportedly cut off with a sword during the attack at the vegetable mandi, has undergone a plastic surgery at PGI Chandigarh for suturing back his hand, where he was rushed after the incident, said the DGP.

Besides, Sadar Patiala SHO Inspector Bikkar Singh also suffered sharp weapon injuries on his left arm, leg and back, ASI Raj Singh was inflicted a sharp weapon injury on his left leg, and ASI Raghbir Singh had got blunt injuries on his body. In addition, a Mandi Board official AR Yadwinder Singh also suffered some minor injuries in this attack.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nihangs-attack-police-team--chop-off-cop---s-hand-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nihangs-attack-police-team--chop-off-cop---s-hand.html
177,13-4-20,88K SHGs women warriors join anti-Covid op for 2-cr masks,"Around 88,000 Self Help Group (SHGs) women across the country have emerged as community warriors to help contain the spread of deadly Covid-19. These “unsung” warriors are doing their bits by producing masks, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and lakhs of litres of hand sanitisers day and night for frontline staff as well as countless citizens.

Some of them have also produced liquid soaps to help in keeping hand hygiene as the country grapples to check the deadly contagion. There are approximately 690 lakh women members of around 63 lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs) across the country.

As the masks are the first line of defence against COVID-19 and the Government has made mandatory wearing masks in public places, 78,373 SHG members under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) of the Union Ministry of Rural Development have taken upon themselves to produce 1.96 crore masks besides other safety gears.

These are various categories of masks, including 2-3 ply woven and non-woven surgical masks, cotton masks, etc, which adhere to the advisories of Union Health Ministry and Ministry of Consumers’ Affairs.

SHG members have now also started making PPE like aprons, gowns, face shields, said an official from the Union Rural Development Ministry.

“Around 78,373 SHG members are presently involved in manufacturing of masks. Jharkhand SHGs were among the first to respond and have produced about 78,000 masks since March 22, 2020. These masks were being sold at the premises of various district collectorates and subsidised medical stores at an affordable price of Rs 10,” said the officer.

From the country’s eastern region, 853 SHGs involving 2516 rural women of Chhattisgarh, have supplied thousands of masks, while in Odisha, SHGs have manufactured more than a million masks for distribution of among common people.

In Andhra Pradesh, 2254 groups of 13 sub-blocks of the district have followed the guidelines of government for the manufacturing of cloth face masks.

Similarly, Karnataka rural self-help groups have produced 1.56 lakh face masks just in 12 days.

Northern Goa district rural development agency through the help of SHGs has supplied 2,000 masks across the State. To cater the increased demand of masks, Himachal Pradesh SHGs with 2000 women members are producing masks.

Similarly, SHG members are also manufacturing PPE including aprons, gowns, face shields etc. Around 5000 PPE kits have been manufactured so far by SHGs in various States including Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Karnataka.

Punjab SRLM reported supply of 500 aprons to Civil Surgeon, Kapurthala while Meghalaya reported supply of 200 face shields to district Medical Health officer. Karnataka reported production of 125 face shields. SRLMs of Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab have reported production of face shields, gowns by the SHG members.

The officer further said the micro-enterprises supported by DAY-NRLM have taken up the production of hand sanitisers and hand wash products to ensure the availability in rural areas.

Around 900 SHG enterprises in 9 States have produced 1.15 lakh litres of sanitisers with the production in the three States of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh exceeding 25,000 litres each.

Similarly, around 900 SHG enterprises located across the States of Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Mizoram are producing sanitisers to feed soaring demand, the officer added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/88k-shgs-women-warriors-join-anti-covid-op-for-2-cr-masks-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/88k-shgs-women-warriors-join-anti-covid-op-for-2-cr-masks.html
178,13-4-20,Nationwide lockdown delayed just to topple MP Govt: Cong,"After weeks of ceasefire on political front, the Congress on Sunday went on offensive against the Modi Government, accusing it of delaying the nationwide lockdown just to topple the Madhya Pradesh Government.

Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath alleged that senior party leader Rahul Gandhi at various platforms, including social media, had indicated the threat posed by Covid-19 early February onwards, but the BJP-led Centre’s entire machinery and energy was dedicated to push MP into political crisis.

One-and-a-half-year-old Kamal Nath Government had to make way for Shivraj Singh Chouhan after several Congress MLAs defected to the BJP last month when senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the grand old party to join the BJP.

“Madhya Pradesh is the only State which has no Health Minister and no Home Minister...Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath as Chief Minister on March 23, and the lockdown began a day later,” Nath said at an AICC media briefing. “Rahul ji had on February 2 drawn the attention of the Government to the threat posed by coronavirus. However, the Centre delayed action because it was more interested in toppling the Government in Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

He said Parliament continued to function despite the fact several State Assemblies adjourned in view of the spread of COVID-19. This was done so that it could be said that if Parliament could function, the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, which was adjourned by the Speaker, could also be convened.

On the current situation in Madhya Pradesh with regard to coronavirus, Nath said that at such a crucial juncture, Chouhan is functioning without a Cabinet. “The Constitution clearly says that there shall be a Council of Ministers. Vivek Tankha is absolutely right in pointing out the crisis in Madhya Pradesh to the president. Since March 23, when the situation with regard to Covid-19 is so serious, there is no Cabinet. It is akin to making a joke of the people,” he said.

He said that soon after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, his Government had closed down all schools, colleges and malls.

Nath said the situation was grim in MP with around 45 officials of the Health Department, including the Principal Secretary, Health themselves getting infected.

He raised the issue of inadequate testing in Madhya Pradesh, saying for every 10 lakh people, barely 25 or 30 people were being tested. He also said that testing was focused only on the urban areas, and the rural areas were being ignored.

“What is a matter of concern is that the figures are for urban areas and not for rural areas. People have come back from adjoining States and gone to their villages. We have no idea if they have brought any infection with them and how many people they might have further infected,” he said.

On the political developments in the State, he said majority of the 22 MLAs who have switched over to the BJP will find it difficult to get re-elected. “They will have to face the people in the end. All their life, they criticised the BJP, and now they will go to the people carrying BJP flags,” the former CM said.

Nath added there will also be dissatisfaction in the BJP with regard to the new inductees as the leaders of the saffron party will feel that their turf is being encroached upon.

“My sympathy is with Shivraj. I wonder how he will run a Government which includes 10-12 Ministers who in the past used to criticise him. He will now sit in the Cabinet with the same people,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nationwide-lockdown-delayed-just-to-topple-mp-govt--cong.html
179,13-4-20,COVID-19: 59 Indians among 233 new cases in Singapore,"Fifty-nine Indians working in Singapore are among the 233 new coronavirus cases reported on Sunday, taking the total number of COVID-19 patients in the city-state to 2,532.

Of the new cases, 51 are linked to known clusters while 15 to earlier cases.

The remaining 167 have no links to earlier cases, pending contact tracing, the Health Ministry said in its daily update.

Seven new clusters, or common places of gatherings, were found, including one linked to the Black Tap restaurant at a five-star casino-resort complex, Marina Bay Sands. Burgers and milkshakes restaurant Black Tap is linked to eight cases and McDonald's is linked to five infections.

Thirty-one of the 976 patients still in hospital are in critical condition in the intensive care unit while most others are stable or improving.

There are 988 cases who are clinically well but still tested positive for COVID-19. They are being isolated and cared for at community facilities, said the ministry.

The death toll stands at eight.

Four additional cases are linked to the Indian-origin mega store Mustafa Centre, taking its total to 82.

The number of work permit holders working in Singapore and dormitory-related cases has increased sharply and this is likely to go up, ""especially as we undertake more aggressive testing in dormitories"", said the ministry.

Authorities further tightened circuit breaker measures to control the spread of the deadly disease, recommending that commuters wear masks on public transport and closing all beaches.

Markets will also refuse entry to people not wearing face masks and food outlets will face fines if their workers do not wear masks or face shields.

During the circuit breaker period, which lasts from Apr 7 to May 4, Singaporeans are to leave their homes only for essential activities such as buying food and groceries.

182,13-4-20,SC rejects plea against PM CARES Fund,"The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea seeking quashing of the decision to set up the PM CARES Fund, where people can donate money, to deal with the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde described the PIL filed by lawyer M L Sharma as ""misconceived"" and dismissed it in a hearing conducted through video conferencing.

The bench, which also comprised justices L Nageswara Rao and M M Shantanagoudar, did not agree to the contention of the lawyer that the fund has been created without following the schemes enumerated under Articles 266 and 267 (which deal with the contingency and the Consolidated Funds of India) of the Constitution.

On March 28, the Centre set up the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund with the primary objective to deal with any kind of emergency situation like the one currently posed by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide relief to those affected.

The prime minister is the ex-officio chairman of the fund and the defence, home and finance ministers are its ex-officio trustees.

""That cause of action arose to the petitioner on March 28, upon having press release for the formation of impugned PM CARES Fund and appeal by the Prime Minister of India to donate funds in that trust to fight COVID-19 and aid healthcare in future without any ordinance and gazette notification by the government of India,"" the PIL has said.

The plea had made all the trustees of the fund as well as the prime minister parties to it and had sought a transfer of the donations received so far in the fund to the Consolidated Fund of India, besides a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the setting up of the fund.

It said the trust had to be created in accordance with Articles 267 and 266(2), which deal with the contingency and the Consolidated Funds of India, of the Constitution.

""Impugned trust has not either been created by Parliament/state legislator within Article 267. It is neither passed by Parliament nor approved by the President of India. There is no ordinance/gazette notification in this regard,"" the PIL has said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-rejects-plea-against-pm-cares-fund-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-rejects-plea-against-pm-cares-fund.html
183,13-4-20,Travel nod to Wadhawans: Sena trains guns at ex-CM Fadnavis,"The Shiv Sena on Monday said IPS officer Amitabh Gupta, who gave permission to scam accused DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan and 21 others to travel to a hill station amid the lockdown, was appointed in the state Home department by then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP.

It is now clear who is actually behind IPS officer Gupta's decision and on whose instructions he would have put the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government into a ""crisis"", an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said without taking any name.

""This clearly indicates a ""conspiracy plot, which could not succeed,"" it said.

Hitting back, the opposition BJP said the editorial should have also discussed why a particular officer acted in such manner under the current regime and not earlier.

The Shiv Sena heads the tripartite government also comprising the NCP and the Congress.

After Home department's special principal secretary Gupta allegedly gave the Wadhawans a letter which facilitated their travel to Mahabaleshwar hill station in Satara district last week, Fadnavis said, ""it is not possible a senior IPS officer would do such gross mistake knowing the consequences on his own"".

Following a row over the issue, the MVA government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) on Friday sent Gupta on compulsory leave and ordered a probe in the matter.

Defending the government over the issue, the Shiv Sena on Monday said, Amitabh Gupta was appointed in the state Home department by previous chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

He must have trusted the efficiency of Gupta before appointing him into the Home department.""

""It is now clear and self-explanatory who has been actually behind Gupta's decision and on whose instructions he would have put the MVA government into a crisis,"" the Marathi publication said.

It is the same officer (Gupta), appointed by previous chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who has ""created trouble for the state government by favouring the Wadhawan family,"" the Shiv Sena said.

""It seems some conspiracy was being hatched but could not be successful,"" it said.

One of the leaders from opposition party says there should be immediate action against Amitabh Gupta, while Fadnavis claimed the IPS officer would not do something like that on his own, the Sena said.

""It clearly underscores a conspiracy plot, which could not succeed,"" it claimed.

If this government had any plans to help the Wadhawan family, why would Satara district collector seize their vehicles and put them under quarantine, the Sena argued.

""The opposition in the state should ask its questions to the Centre that who was behind Gupta in issuing the letter (to Wadhawans) and what exactly has the Centre planned in the Wadhawan case, it added.

Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam said, ""There were many officers in the state who were posted in various departments during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis as the CM of Maharashtra.

""The only question arises is that why those officials have acted like this in this case but never earlier. It would have been better for all if the editorial has discussed this issue,"" he said.

Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan are under the scanner in the Yes Bank and Punjab and Maharashtra Co- operative Bank scams.

The CBI registered an offence against Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan, Yes Bank's then Managing Director and CEO Rana Kapoor and others on March 7, an official earlier said.

Since then Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were absconding, he added.

A court issued a non-bailable warrant against both on March 17, but they did not appear, he said.

The Enforcement Directorate also issued summons to the Wadhawan brothers in the Yes Bank case and asked them to appear on March 17. The duo reportedly cited the coronavirus pandemic and skipped the appearance, officials said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/travel-nod-to-wadhawans--sena-trains-guns-at-ex-cm-fadnavis-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/travel-nod-to-wadhawans--sena-trains-guns-at-ex-cm-fadnavis.html
184,13-4-20,China clamps curbs on publication of research papers on coronavirus origin: Report,"China has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research papers on the origin of coronavirus, according to an American media report amidst its public spat with US President Donald Trump for calling it a “Chinese virus” and the growing interest all over the world about how and where the pandemic originated.

CNN reported on Monday that two Chinese universities published on their websites the central government directive stating that under the new policy, all academic papers on COVID-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication.

Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the online posts on Fudan University in Shanghai and China University of Geoscience in Wuhan which were subsequently deleted following inquiries, according to the American news network.

After containing coronavirus in its epicentre, Wuhan, where the virus first reported in December last year, China has firmly opposed to Trump calling COVID-19 as ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"", saying such allegations amounted to stigmatising the country.

On April 9, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, while replying to allegations of cover-up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said: “China was the first country to report COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) that doesn't mean the virus originated from Wuhan”.

“Epidemic may break out first anywhere in the world. But its origin is a matter of science and we should leave it to science and medical community,” Zhao who earlier created a storm by alleging in a tweet on March 12 that US army may have brought the virus to Wuhan leading to a diplomatic protest by Washington.

Initial reports said the virus reported to have originated from the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan where live animals are sold. It was subsequently shut down and has not been re-opened so far.

The US has accused China of delayed action resulting in the pandemic spreading to other countries, an allegation Beijing vehemently refuted, asserting it was working with the international community in an ""open and highly responsible manner"" to contain the global crisis.

About the new restrictions on the publication of research studies on the coronavirus origin, CNN quoted a Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity as saying that the move was a worrying development that would likely obstruct important scientific research.

""I think it is a coordinated effort from (the) Chinese government to control (the) narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China. And I don't think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease,"" the report quoted the researcher as saying.

The coronavirus pandemic has so far killed over 114,000 people and infected more than 1,850,000 in 193 countries and territories since it first emerged in China in December.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-clamps-curbs-on-publication-of-research-papers-on-coronavirus-origin--report-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/china-clamps-curbs-on-publication-of-research-papers-on-coronavirus-origin--report.html
185,13-4-20,Delhi govt sets up task force to identify suspected COVID-19 cases,"The Delhi government on Monday set up a task force which will visit households in all districts of the city to identify suspected COVID-19 cases.

The ‘Corona Foot Warriors Containment and Surveillance Force' has been constituted at every booth level, a Delhi government official told PTI.

Each team will have five members including a booth-level officer, civil defence volunteer, police constable, sanitation and anganwadi worker, the official said.

According to the official, 13,750 such teams will also advise people to maintain social distancing and wear masks when going outdoors.

The teams will recommend suspected cases for testing to the district health authorities, the official said, adding that anganwadi workers will be trained by the health department.

""Each task force will also inquire with the residents whether they know any suspected COVID-19 person in their neighbourhood. The task force will also enforce social-distancing in their respective areas,"" the official said.

The team will also make sure that people in their areas get supply of essential items and will keep in touch with each household through phone calls, the official said.

However, action will be taken against those who violate guidelines like not maintaining social-distancing, the official said.

The task force will also help in the smooth and speedy transportation of COVID-19 suspects to quarantine and isolation centres.

186,13-4-20,Lockdown window: All await PM’s call,"ComMin blueprint ready for opening industries, MSME with safeguards

All eyes will be on Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he outlines various aspects that will regulate the two-week extension of the ongoing lockdown as agreed in the meeting with Chief Ministers on Saturday. The Commerce Ministry has prepared blueprint for opening up of major industries and MSME with requisite health safeguards.

Now that the two-week extension is a mere formality, people will anxiously wait for the PM’s announcement to see what sort of sectoral “opening up”, if any, is facilitated by the Government to keep the economy going. Opening up farm sectors to allow harvesting and storage of standing crops and incentivising sowing could figure in the PM’s speech. There is also speculation about limited opening up of civil aviation in some sector as well.

A day before the crucial announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the lockdown, the Union Commerce Ministry wrote to the Union Home Ministry on the need to open several industries and many business sectors with “precautions” to prevent the spread Covid-19. For lovers of liquor there is good news. The Commerce Ministry has suggested opening up of that sector too.

The Commerce Ministry has suggested opening up of industries with “single entry point for workers” and “keeping of social distancing” in work atmosphere.”

“It is felt that certain activities with reasonable safeguards should be allowed once a final decision regarding extension and nature of lockdown is taken by the central Government. These new activities are essential to improve the economic activity and provide liquidity in the hands of the people. These suggestions have been obtained on the basis of very detailed interaction of the Hon’ble CIM ( Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal) with various States and industry bodies, and the feedback,” said the letter written by Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra, Secretary, Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.

The letter follows with three page annexure of what all industries to be opened and what all precautions to be taken. Commerce Ministry suggested that Industries should be allowed to operate in shifts with 25-30 percent staff in each shift with proper social distancing, santisation methods for the staffers and premises. The Ministry also suggested that District level authorities must inspect on the working of the industries and check on the adherence of the rules to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Commerce Ministry suggested that big companies and MSMEs and export oriented units must be opened. The Ministry also said that vehicle movements would be opened up with checking and factories must be asked to transport the staffers. The opening of telecom and allied sectors, fiber cable manufacturing, heavy electrical items, compressors, steel, defence, cement, pulp, timber, glass fertilizer, agro and agro chemical, paints, dyes, automotive, gems, jewellery, special economic zones were suggested y the Ministry.

A positive interpretation of PM’s remark “Jaan bhi, jahan bhi” has already led to optimism that the second phase of the lockdown may witness graded opening up of activities in other sectors such as construction, road and industrial activities. Thw Government has already allowed fishing activities on the sea side in certain States.

The Prime Minister has already suggested specific measures for agriculture and allied sector, including the modification of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) laws to facilitate sale of farm produce. He said the crisis was an opportunity to become self-reliant and turn the nation into an economic powerhouse.

On Saturday while interacting with Chief Ministers via video conferencing in his third such meeting, Modi hinted at the need to strike a balance between saving lives and reviving economic activity. Suggestion to a phased opening of air service is also understood to have been given but health experts have apparently not approved it.

It is understood that while senior officials agree on the importance of the lockdown to save Indian lives, they want economic activity to be revived as ports are jammed with containers and major port cities such as Mumbai and Chennai are hit by the pandemic.

In the backdrop of the Prime Minister’s assertion to strike a balance between “lives and livelihood”, the Government may move towards a “smart lockdown” -with severe restrictions in affected districts, and partial lifting of restrictions in unaffected districts, along with the opening up of some sectors to meet the economic challenge.

The Government may also be considering demarcating the country into three zones - red, yellow and green - depending on the scale of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray pointed out the challenges migrant workers were facing as industries did not have the money to provide for their wages and shelter interminably. He wanted the Centre’s assistance to facilitate the harvest of crops and grain procurement, relaxing of the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) Act cap of 3 per cent fiscal deficit to 4-5 per cent, release of MNREGA funds to pay wages to workers, and also their share of GST compensation.

The construction of highways may be also exempted from the total shutdown. According to sources, areas which are away from the urban centres and where there have been minimal to zero Covid-19 cases may be exempted from the lockdown and construction activity of roads should be allowed as it is essential for any economy.

It is believed that the Maharashtra Government may allow the construction of its marquee project -- Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg, an expressway connecting Mumbai and Nagpur. The expressway once constructed would be 701 kilometres long and will include eight lanes - four on each side.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) are also in discussions with various States to evaluate the situation on the ground. According to an official, some States and districts had sought permission to start road construction work where the density of population is low. They had also said the guidelines of social distancing would be followed to commence the projects. It is also learnt that districts and States will not be in a position to sustain the expenditure on the stay of migrant labour so they could instead be used for construction activity.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lockdown-window------all-await-pm---s-call-2020-04-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/lockdown-window------all-await-pm---s-call.html
187,13-4-20,Smokers may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infections: Study,"People who currently smoke, and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have higher levels of a molecule in their lungs, which could put them at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections, according to a study.

The study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, shows that levels of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) --which sits on the surface of lung cells -- in former smokers is lower than in current smokers.

""The data emerging from China suggested that patients with COPD were at higher risk of having worse outcomes from COVID-19,"" said Janice Leung from the University of British Columbia in Canada.

""We hypothesised that this could be because the levels of ACE-2 in their airways might be increased compared to people without COPD, which could possibly make it easier for the virus to infect the airway,"" Leung said.

The researchers studied samples taken from the lungs of 21 COPD patients and 21 people who did not have COPD.

They tested the samples to gauge the level of ACE-2 and compared this with other factors, such whether they were from people who never smoked, were current smokers or former smokers.

Not only did they find higher levels of ACE-2 in COPD patients, they also found higher levels in people who were smokers.

The researchers then checked their new findings against two existing study groups, which together contain data on a further 249 people -- some non-smokers, some current smokers and some former smokers.

They found levels of ACE-2 were higher in current smokers but lower in non-smokers and in those who were former smokers.

""We found that patients with COPD and people who are still smoking have higher levels of ACE-2 in their airways, which might put them at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections.

""Patients with COPD should be counselled to strictly abide by social distancing and proper hand hygiene to prevent infection,"" said Leung.

""We also found that former smokers had similar levels of ACE-2 to people who had never smoked. This suggests that there has never been a better time to quit smoking to protect yourself from COVID-19,"" she said.

Professor Tobias Welte, an infections expert from the European Respiratory Society said the study gives interesting insight into why some people may be at risk of more severe COVID-19 symptoms than others.

""What it does not tell us is whether it's possible to manipulate ACE-2 levels to improve survival in patients infected with COVID-19 or whether this would make a difference in COPD patients who contract the infection,"" said Welte, who was not involved in the study.

189,13-4-20,"James Gunn says 'Guardians Vol 3', 'The Suicide Squad' won't be delayed","Filmmaker James Gunn has assured fans that despite the coronavirus pandemic shutting down production on projects, the release of his upcoming films ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3"" and ""The Suicide Squad"" will not be postponed.

The director is helming DC Comics film ""The Suicide Squad"", the reboot to David Ayer's 2016 film. The film is scheduled to be released on August 6, 2021.

In a Q&A session on Twitter Sunday, Gunn told one of the concerned fans, ""Right now there's no reason for #TheSuicideSquad release date to move.""

Saying that the team is on or even ahead of schedule, the director said, ""We were extremely fortunate to wrap shooting & set up editing from our homes (due to a post production team & studio with foresight) before quarantine.""

Gunn was rehired for directing the third part of ""GOTG"", the arrival of which he said, is also as planned.

""Right now the plans with 'Vol 3' are also exactly the same as they were before coronavirus,"" he told another user who enquired about the status of the threequel.

When another fan asked if he would be offering any official first looks or teaser trailers of the new films, Gunn said unfortunately it seemed impossible.

""I wish we were but, as you might imagine, although editing #TheSuicideSquad has been pretty smooth in the time of quarantine (I'm working on the cut right now), there are a lot of other factors slowed - some of those related to releasing images, trailers, etc,"" he said.

190,13-4-20,'Half Full' will give hope to people in these times of loneliness: Naseeruddin Shah,"Naseeruddin Shah is back with a short film, one that the veteran actor believes is of hope at a time when vast majority of people are in the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Titled ""Half Full"", the film is directed by debutante filmmaker Karan Rawal and also features Vikrant Massey.

The story is about a man on the verge of taking a crucial decision when he meets an older person. The meeting alters his perspective towards life, death and self.

Shah said it is a strange case of happenstance that the core idea of the film has become relevant to the current times.

""When the film was made, we were hardly in this kind of situation. The situation has become relevant to the movie, I would say. I'm sure that a lot of people today will find identification with that young protagonist of the movie... This is a hopeful film and might help people cope with this time when loneliness is all around us,"" Shah told PTI in a telephonic interview from Mumbai.

The actor said that short films are ideal for budding actors and directors to begin their journey in cinema.

""I think these short films that are being made for the web are very healthy because the youngsters are getting a chance to try out their craft without sticking their necks out, without having the risk of losing lakhs or crores of rupees and without endangering their careers or worrying about box office collections.

""They are free to make the kind of film that they believe should be made. And that's why I feel obliged to be a part of them,"" he added.

""Half Full"" is part of nine shorts that will be screened on ZEE5 during the streamer's upcoming 'Short Film Festival'. It will premiere on April 15.

The 69-year-old actor has featured in quite a number of short films recently. He has previously been a part of shorts like ""Interior Cafe Night"", ""Rogan Josh"" and ""The Wallet"", among others.

Shah said such films require less time to make and that is why he prefers them.

""This is very painless and brief. I don't think I'd be able to take 45-60 days of shooting anymore. I have done several of those in my time but I don't think I'd be able to do that anymore. So, the shorter the work span, the happier I am.

""In the span of two days or in this case, just one night, you can make a complete film, which will communicate itself, which will be entertaining, and which people will remember. That is the satisfaction one gets from shorts.""

There is also the joy of working with new and emerging talent, he said.

""I got to work with a young filmmaker who's enthusiastic and who is trying his best to make something which he believes in. I basically enjoy the work of acting, whether it is in films, on stage, in front of a TV camera, or it is in the storytelling. I thoroughly enjoy my work and this was another chance for me to play a part I found to be very enjoyable, and a script which was very meaningful,"" Shah added.

Regarded as one of the best performers in Hindi cinema, Shah has delivered many critically-acclaimed performances in movies such as his debut ""Nishant"", ""Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron"", ""Mandi"", ""Sparsh"", ""Umrao Jaan"", ""Woh Saat Din"", ""Sarfarosh"", ""A Wednesday"" and many others.

But today, his endeavour is to train newcomers in acting and make them realise their potentials.

""The next stage of evolution for me is to find a technique of training actors. I have been involved in this for the past 20 years. I hate to call it teaching as I believe it is pretentious. I call it working with young actors and helping them find their potential. That is something which is a bit of a mission for me at the moment.

""Over the last several years, I've been finding this much more enjoyable than acting. It is much more rewarding to get an actor to live up to his potential than it is to do it ourselves. So that, if anything, is everything I have left,"" Shah said.

191,13-4-20,People call me choosy but that's how I want to work: Atul Kulkarni,"Even after acting for more than two decades across several languages, actor Atul Kulkarni believes his performances come out fresh because when he entered the profession, he had promised himself to not work every day.

The actor is known for his performances in acclaimed films like ""Rang De Basanti"", ""Chandni Bar"", ""Natarang"" among others.

Atul said for him, being on set every day has never been the be-all and end-all, as one also needs time to take in life experiences.

""When I came into this profession, my first condition to myself and my managers was that I don't want to work every day. As an actor you keep giving, so it's important for you to need the time to take things in. I've never believed in working every day. I only choose the work I like in whichever format or language,"" Atul told PTI in an interview.

The actor believes he would rather wait for the right project to come his way even at the expense of being called ""choosy"".

""I'm not tired of my profession, not overworked about going to the set and acting. I look forward to it. That's why it's easy to retain that freshness because I do what excites me. People call me choosy but that's how I want to work.""

Atul's latest appearance is drama-thriller ""The Raikar Case"", which is streaming on Voot Select.

While it isn't the first digital outing for the actor, having previously featured on ""City of Dreams"" and ""The Test Case"", he said it's important to keep up with the times and technology.

""As a camera actor, you're constantly in touch with technology. First the technology came into existence and then film acting happened. So it's always going to lead us. Web series is a new format, where everything, from the writing to storytelling is different.

""As an actor you have to approach it differently because you have a character which can go on for a long time. It is my duty to be on my toes, understand the new technology and adapt. That's exactly what I'm trying to do.""

For ""The Raikar Case"", the 54-year-old actor said, he resonated strongly with the script which chronicles a family torn apart after a suicide and the various truths that come to light.

""I believe in listening to a script as an audience more than an actor. If it excites me, it'll make me happy even when I'm working on it. 'The Raikar Case' had a fantastic thriller story, but it also talks about human relationships within a large family.""

The Nitin Kakkar-directed film, also featuring Saif Ali Khan and Tabu, opened to positive reviews in January end.

""A lot of the conversations about films and meetings came to a standstill. We will have to resume it when everything's done. But it definitely does cut momentum. I feel like I was going superfast and now it's all on halt...,"" Alaya told PTI.

The actor said she was travelling for work within the country before the pandemic took over and reached home right in time.

""I had to come back early as I knew all this was happening and knew we are probably heading for a lockdown and there'll be lots of restrictions. When I came back, we went straight into lockdown. My work definitely did get cut halfway.""

The 22-year-old actor said she was at a ""good point professionally"" before everything came to a standstill

""Then suddenly this break happened and I felt 'My God people are going to forget who I am.' I was trying to stay visible as much as I could. Then 'Jawaani Jaaneman' released online and people started watching my film again. I started getting more comments, feedback and felt now people will remember me,"" she added.

During the lockdown, Alaya says she is trying to stay occupied by learning new things and reconnecting with people.

""I'm trying to stay productive, but mainly just occupied because I'm one of those people who will go crazy if I do absolutely nothing. I need to constantly be doing something or the other.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said 758 more people died in the state from coronavirus in a 24-hour period, describing it as ""terrible news"" even as the infection rate continues to slow and stressed he will work with New Jersey and Connecticut on a coordinated plan to reopen the economy that also safeguards public health.

The state is witnessing mixed results as change in total number of hospitalisations is down but the ICU admissions and intubations ticked up.

""You're not seeing a great decline in the numbers, but you're seeing a flattening. And you're also seeing a recurrence of the terrible news, which is the number of lives lost, which is 758"" on April 11.

Cuomo said the big question on everyone's mind is when will the economy reopen.

People want to get on with their lives, people want to get out of the house. (They have) cabin fever. We need the economy working, people need a paycheck. Life has to function, he said at his daily briefing Sunday.

The Governor stressed that he wants to reopen the state and the economy as soon as possible.

""Let's just end this nightmare right. (It's like) Groundhog Day. You get up every day, it's the same routine, you almost lose track of what day of the week it is because they don't even have meaning anymore, he said making a reference to the movie.

Cuomo underscored that the caveat in re-opening the economy is that one has to be smart in the way we reopen and there is need for a coordinated, regional and safe approach.

Nobody wants to pick between a public health strategy and an economic strategy. And as governor of the state, I'm not going to pick one over the other, we need a public health strategy that is safe, consistent with an economic strategy.

He emphasised that the last thing New York needs is an uptick in the infection rate and hospitalization numbers that the state has worked so hard to bring down. So we need a strategy that coordinates business and schools and transportation and workforce.

Reopening the state and moving people back in the workforce would require more and faster testing as well as federal help. He said he will be coordinating with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont later today on coming up with a reopening plan that is a public health plan, safeguards public health but also starts to move us towards economic activation.

He said the state will also pass an executive order which directs employers to provide essential workers with a cloth or surgical face mask free of cost to their employees when they are interacting with the public.

The Governor and de Blasio also continued to disagree over when to open public schools across the state.

We're not going to open any schools until it is safe from a public health point of view. We won't open schools one minute sooner than they should be opened but we won't open schools one minute later than they should be opened either.

Am I, as I sit here, prepared to say what we'll be doing in June? No. I do not know what we will be doing in June. Nobody knows what we will be doing in June.

Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed an order on Sunday, extending the disaster declaration for all Texas counties in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Texas officials said on Sunday about 13,500 state residents have tested positive for the COVID-19, and 271 died.

Harris County has the most confirmed cases with more than 3,500 positive tests, followed by Dallas County with over 1,600, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

""By extending disaster declaration, we are ensuring the state of Texas continues to have adequate resources and capabilities to support our communities and protect public health, Abbott said.

""I urge all Texans to continue practicing social distancing and abide by the guidelines laid out by the CDC and my executive orders to slow the spread of COVID-19.

It said that there were 315 deaths in hospital over the last day, compared with 345 the day earlier. The total toll includes those who have died in nursing homes.

France had on April 6 recorded 605 deaths in hospitals, its highest daily number so far.

For the fourth consecutive day in a row, the number of patients in intensive care fell with 35 fewer patients, making a total of 6,845 people needing such treatment.

The health ministry reaffirmed that a ""plateau"" appeared to have been reached but warned the situation remained serious despite the slightly improving data.

""We must stay vigilant as the hospital and intensive care services are taking in very many patients,"" it said.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed.

French President Emmanuel Macron is due on Monday to address the nation for a third time during the crisis and is expected to announce that the lockdown will be extended beyond its current April 15 expiration date.

Macron will have to steer a careful course amid the tentative signs of improvement, telling people they must still stay at home while giving indications about how the confinement measures might be relaxed. (AFP)

The multilateral funding agency said it has also approved measures to streamline its operations for quicker and more flexible delivery of assistance.

The package expands ADB's USD 6.5 billion initial response announced on March 18, adding USD 13.5 billion in resources to help its developing member countries counter the severe macroeconomic and health impacts caused by Covid-19, it said in a release.

The USD 20 billion package includes about USD 2.5 billion in concessional and grant resources, it added.

""This pandemic threatens to severely set back economic, social and development gains in Asia and the Pacific, reverse progress on poverty reduction, and throw economies into recession,"" said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa.

The package will be delivered more quickly, flexibly and forcefully to the governments and the private sector in our developing member countries to help them address the urgent challenges in tackling the pandemic and economic downturn, Asakawa added.

The funding agency's most recent assessment earlier this month has estimated the global impact of the pandemic to about 2.3-4.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), wherein the regional growth forecast for the Asia and Pacific is forecast to decline to 2.2 per cent during 2020 from 5.2 per cent in the last year.

ADB's new package of USD 20 billion includes establishment of a COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option under ADB's Countercyclical Support Facility.

Up to USD 13 billion will be provided through this new option to help governments of developing member countries implement effective countercyclical expenditure progrmmes to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on the poor and the vulnerable, ADB said.

Grant resources will continue to be deployed quickly for providing medical and personal protective equipment and supplies from expanded procurement sources.

""Some USD 2 billion from the USD 20 billion package will be made available for the private sector. Loans and guarantees will be provided to financial institutions to rejuvenate trade and supply chains. Enhanced microfinance loan and guarantee support and a facility to help liquidity-starved small and medium-sized enterprises, including those run by female entrepreneurs, will be implemented alongside direct financing of companies responding to, or impacted by, COVID-19,"" the funding agency said.

The response package includes a number of adjustments to policies and business processes that will allow ADB to respond more rapidly and flexibly to the crisis.

These include measures to streamline internal business processes, widen the eligibility and scope of various support facilities, and make the terms and conditions of lending more tailored, it added.

ADB said that all support under the expanded package will be provided in close collaboration with international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund; World Bank Group; World Health Organization, UNICEF and other UN agencies; and the broader global community.

The coronavirus pandemic has so far claimed around 1,15,000 lives globally and has left over 1.8 million people infected.
