0,05-2-20,Das named Asia Pacific Central Banker of 2020,"Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das, who hails from Odisha, has been named the Central Banker of the Year, Asia-Pacific 2020, by the Banker magazine, a unit of the Financial Times.

The award is given to the central bankers who have best managed to stimulate growth and stabilise their economy.

The magazine said Das was honoured for managing India’s banking sector that has faced a series of challenges such as nonperforming loans and fraud. Repeated economic slumps saw the RBI cut interest rates five times during 2019 and it was open to cutting them again if necessary, said the magazine. It further said Das tried to manage banking issues within the financial system, a risky move but one that would reduce dependence on the central bank.

Jorgovanka Tabakovi of the National Bank of Serbia was adjudged the winner as the Global Central Banker of the Year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/das-named-asia-pacific-central-banker-of-2020.html

On January 29 morning, Amit felt some pain at the lower part of his body(waist). He consulted medicine specialist Dr Ajit Kumar Tripathy at his residence who is in leave after being transferred from Dhenkanal Headquarters Hospital. Dr Tripathy injected him Robi-D(Melto Carbamal and Diclofenac) mentioned in the prescription of Amit.

Sources said Amit again consulted Dr Tripathy, at about 2 pm as he experienced severe pain, after taking the injection. Dr Tripathy asked Amit to take admission at the Saraswati Lab which is promoted by him. Amit died at Saraswati lab while taking saline.

Relatives of deceased Amit, accused the doctor of having made wrong treatment leading to his death and filed an FIR at Sadar PS against the doctor and Saraswati lab.

Meanwhile, relatives of Amit alleged that Dhenkanal police were trying to suppress the incident. As the doctor has worked in Dhenkanal Headquarters Hospital for more than ten years and is known to all officials and political leaders, police are slow in the matter, they alleged.

7,05-2-20,How well-prepared are we?,"Given the population density in India and the explosive rate of person-to-person transmission the coronavirus can achieve, the situation can be potentially catastrophic

Recently, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) pertaining to the coronavirus cases being reported from China. The virus, with its epicentre located in the live animal market of Wuhan city, infected more than 10,000 people in China till January 31. This is more than the number of people infected in the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.

Till now, more than 200 people have succumbed to the virus, which is a novel variant of the coronavirus family (2019 n-Cov infection), which is the same family as the SARS virus. It also has similar symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, which are also typical to the battery of symptoms a patient displays during pneumonia.

The typical clinical profile of patients has been a spectrum: From common cough and cold to severe cases of pneumonia and death. The severity of the 2019 n-Cov has not been completely established but it can be safely assumed that the severity will be higher in people with lower immunity. So in patients with HIV, those on immune-suppressants and even people suffering from malnutrition, especially older people, the severity of infection can be assumed to be higher.

While Beijing has quarantined Wuhan and a few other cities, countries are taking their own measures to ensure containment of the virus. While nations like Russia have closed their land borders with China, others are focussing on airports and sea ports. Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan have set up thermal cameras at all airports to ensure screening of passengers with fever. But since the infection can be asymptomatic for seven to 14 days, the system in not foolproof.

The USA, on January 31, took a rather bold stand, releasing the Presidential “Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Non-immigrants who pose a risk of transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus”, which suspends the entry into the US, as immigrants or non-immigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the People’s Republic of China, (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau) during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into America.

The US has 241 suspected cases of which six have been confirmed as a lot of Chinese families had planned their travel to the USA at this time to celebrate the new year with their families.

The first case in India was reported in Kerala. Since then, the Government has been on high alert and the Government machinery has been prepared to prevent further exposure of the pathogen inside borders as well as contain the current situation.

The National Institute of Virology, Pune tested 49 suspect cases, of which only one turned out to be positive. But the fear of the virus hitting Indian shores and exploding into epidemic proportions is real. If we compare it with the SARS 2003 numbers (a very gross analogy nonetheless), China had 5,327 cases and 348 deaths confirmed and India had about three probable cases, 10 suspect cases and no fatalities. The global number of infected cases for SARS were 8,098.

Currently, the number of cases for 2019 n-Cov just in China has exceeded 10,000 and India has one positive case. Some of the things we do understand is that due to poor nutrition and thus poor immunity, the risk of getting infected on exposure to the virus is high.

The severity of disease on infection is also expected to be high in such populations. Now in that scenario, imagine the population density in India and the explosive rate of person-to-person transmission the virus can achieve. The situation can be potentially catastrophic, especially considering the fact that the health infrastructure required to manage a large disease burden such as this, is not nearly adequate.

India ranks 57 of 195 countries in the Global Health Security Index. The index, developed jointly by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and The Economist Intelligence Unit, ranks countries based on preparedness to handle public health emergencies.

Countries are assessed across six categories: Prevention of the emergence or release of pathogens; early detection and reporting for epidemics of potential international concern; rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of an epidemic; robust health system to treat the sick and protect health workers; commitment to improving national capacity, financing plans to address gaps and adhering to global norms; and overall risk environment and country vulnerability to biological threats.

While there are multiple indicators within the same, we must focus on some relevant to the current threat scenario. India ranks 142 of 195 in public health vulnerability: This includes access and expenditure on public health.

This implies that our health infrastructure cannot absorb large shocks. India ranks 144 of 195 in cross-border policies for public health emergency response. We have no recorded measures for international cooperation or even regional cooperation for health emergencies.

India ranks 167 in access to communications infrastructure: Which measures access to internet and the possibility of communicating to the masses, messages regarding public emergencies.

This is contestable given the large mobile penetration even in remote areas but at the same time the fact remains that we do not have a robust system to disseminate public emergency messages to the masses in a planned and actionable manner. We are ranked 101 in terms of immunisation, leaving a vast majority vulnerable to infections. Considering these points, it is evident that if the disease is not contained, results can be catastrophic for us.

The Indian Government has been taking good measures to screen for and contain the virus. Airport Health Organisations at Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin are screening passengers coming from China. But most of the screening, for now, is based on self-reporting and symptomatic interviews by airport authorities.

The Mumbai airport has reported universal thermal screening by cameras for all flights coming directly from China. Screening is even being carried out at sea ports for all personnel disembarking from ships coming from China. There are quarantine centres with 300-bed capacity set up in Manesar, Haryana and 600-bed capacity in south-west Delhi, ready for any confirmed cases.

About 400 Indians are currently being evacuated from the Wuhan area. Since the one case confirmed in India, a student from Wuhan University, 1,073 people have been kept under observation in Kerala while the student is being managed in Thrissur Medical College. The Ministry of AYUSH has also released an advisory for the management of coronavirus on the Press Information Bureau.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has set up a helpline with a 24X7 call centre for coronavirus (helpline number 011-23978046).

They are encouraging all people who have travelled back from China after January 1 to self-report symptoms and follow up on care. Complete ban on travel is not practical and in the absence of that from all countries, people who have a travel itinerary which (in part) included China, are now travelling from a different country, can be carriers.

The challenge also is that the disease is airborne can be asymptomatic for one to two weeks, making it extremely difficult to detect early. At the same time heavy screening and observation of all passengers can be cost-intensive.

In the light of the same, measures need to be taken to establish screening centres at a minimum four ports of entry, with the relevant manpower and technology for screening and quarantine. Then mandating all flights from China to be routed through these airports only.

Passengers must be informed in advance that this will increase their travel time and based on screening results they might be referred to a local health set up for quarantine, leading to additional delays. The passengers might also have to declare two weeks’ voluntary isolation based on screening results. With these checks in place, only extremely important travel can be filtered and borders can be managed skillfully.

To maintain foreign sentiments, an earnest declaration should also be made by the state leadership that this is not because we have low confidence to the Chinese measures already being taken but additional measures are being taken in the interest of national security.

8,05-2-20,A ‘patriotic’ cover-up,"While the authoritarian system allows for mobilisation of resources, it also pushes a dangerous culture of auto-denying ‘bad news’ that allows a problem to fester

In February 2003, an American businessman travelling from China got afflicted with pneumonia-like symptoms while on a flight to Singapore. En route the flight had stopped at Hanoi and the businessman was rushed to a hospital where he soon died. Many others in the medical staff attending to him also developed the same disease and an Italian doctor, Carlo Urbani, recognising the severity of the strange viral threat, alarmed the World Health Organisation (WHO) – later, he too succumbed to the mysterious virus. Three months earlier, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic had indeed accounted for its first casualty in the Guandong province of China and many more had followed, but China had deliberately kept the news under wraps from the WHO and did not announce the outbreak till the virus and the “bad news” had gone beyond its controllable borders. The initial Chinese cover-up had resulted in a crucial time-lag that had facilitated the spread of the SARS epidemic. Later China apologised for its “slowness” but only after 800 lives were lost in the first global pandemic of the 21st century. A local Chinese whistleblower doctor, who was among the first to report about the mysterious SARS outbreak, was subsequently demonised as a “bad” citizen and placed under house-arrest as he had ostensibly brought disrepute to the nation!

Seventeen years hence, yet another airborne virus has broken out in the city of Wuhan with the lessons of the SARS mishandling remaining essentially unlearnt. What has changed in the last 17 years has been the sure emergence of the new “superpower” China on the global highway, which is even more intolerant to anyone, anything and any news that could apply brakes towards its believed destiny. China is not only among the countries with the most restrictive media environment, it is also the most sophisticatedly controlled domain that barely allows a squeak to filter out. The recent examples of putting the virtual media gag on mammoth scale societal dissonances like the Uighur “re-education camps” or the Hong Kong protests are uniquely China, which is forever in a state of paranoia against the prospects of any negative news filtering out. Towards this end, it “manages” the media through a variety of means, from brazen bans, coercion, threats to even simply “buying out” silence (usually in the case of vassal countries like Pakistan, North Korea etc). Such an environmental hypersensitivity has only heightened in the recent times and all potentially negative news are immediately slammed as “unpatriotic rumours.”

This militates in the face of undisputable development that has taken place in the fields of infrastructure, technology, socio-economic parameters and so on. Ironically, the city of Wuhan also hosts one of the most advanced research laboratories in the field of epidemic research. Such a dominating governance instinct puts the entire credibility of the exact situation, scale and control measures in question as the news emanating from China is solely from the governmental agencies and filtered through lenses.

Reacting to the basic precautionary measures taken by most countries, the state’s mouthpiece Global Times made space for some irresistible realpolitik: “Starting Sunday, the US barred foreigners who have travelled to China within the past 14 days from entering the country, far beyond the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaration that does not recommend travel and trade restrictions for China. The US was the first country to take such an extreme measure, setting a bad example worldwide.” Meanwhile, Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, has admitted to the initial slackness due to “lack of scientific recognition” and also owing to “probably some executive issues.” The Chinese government is still playing down the impact of the latest outbreak, even though the infectivity of this virus has far surpassed that of the 2003 SARS epidemic.

While the Chinese reaction has probably been more intensive as compared to 2003 SARS in terms of building makeshift hospitals, requisitioning emergency medical staff from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and round-the-clock construction of related facilities, the strict denial of any foreign or even independent reportage of the outbreak remains unchanged. China was already reeling under an overheated economy with the lowest growths recorded in nearly three decades. The added challenges of punishing trade-wars with the United States and unending Hong Kong protests, were further taking their toll. Now, estimates abound of additional lost growth of between $60-70 billion or a further drop in GDP by two percentage points in the first quarter of the year. The fear of continuing “bad news” could lead to an unavoidable extension of the Lunar New Year holidays, keeping the shutters on the factories that would further cripple economic activity and impact global supply chains.

All in all, the economic, social, diplomatic and strategic cost to China will be very damaging, but it has the reserves, capacity and wherewithal to “pull through” yet another crisis. What will become increasingly difficult going forward is the ability of the regime to continuously “cover up,” should the common man on the street feel the pinch, post the crisis. China has its hands full on many fronts simultaneously and its ability to weather the multiple storms will be tested as its economic health will not be as robust as it was earlier. China could utilise the situation to either “open up” itself or further clamp down on censorship in order to sustain a government-fed narrative. More likely than not, regime-insecurity will ensure authoritarian impulses and preferences. While the authoritarian system allows for unprecedented mobilisation of resources, it also fosters a dangerous culture of auto-denying “bad news” that allows a problem to prolong itself longer than it would normally have, had the issue been tabled in all transparency. The invocation of “patriotism” to cover up tragedies is the bane of all single-party regimes. The lessons of SARS may have been incorporated in terms of building infrastructural capacities to manage crises. But the Xi Jingping era has only worsened on democratic freedoms and transparency. The Coronavirus saga exemplifies that.

9,05-2-20,Localisation of data vital,"Start-ups and the IT industry can leverage the data universe generated from digital transactions and build innovative products

Evolution in technology has fostered ubiquitous digital connections, bringing together people, devices and objects across platforms. Predominantly, verticals like banking, financial services, insurance, retail, healthcare, hospitality and education are sprinting into the digital realm, putting identity at the centre of the digital ecosystem. Consequently the identity of people is exposed to cyberthreats. According to RiskBased Security, 3,813 breaches were reported through June 30, 2019, exposing over 4.1 billion records. The Cybercrime & the Internet of Threats, 2018 report published by Juniper Research deciphers that around 33 billion records would have been stolen by cybercriminals annually by 2023. Such mind-numbing figures advocate why data protection legislation is paramount in a digital world susceptible to zillions of cyberthreats. The economy is becoming more globalised with the advent of digital connectivity and billions of people will be added into the ecosystem in days to come. Hence, it is imperative for Governments to safeguard their citizens’ personal data. This is because data is the new form of securitisation. It has tremendous potential to derive massive economic value by generating smart insights and utilising them as feeders for building new business propositions.

According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 58 per cent countries have data protection and privacy legislations, while 10 per cent nations have draft legislations. This shows that the clamour for data protection has grown ever since the European Union (EU) laid the groundwork by legislating General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and executed it on May 25, 2018 to protect privacy rights of EU individuals. It also warranted that the law was applicable to all enterprises processing or controlling personal data of EU residents. Considering this and the rapidly-growing digital footprints of Indian citizens across various platforms, including the web, smartphones, storage media and other smart devices like the Internet of Things and sensors, there is a need for data localisation. Thankfully, the Government realised this early on and it led to the formulation of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

Data localisation may create opportunities for the Indian information technology (IT) industry and technology start-ups in terms of infrastructure and products suited to the requirement of the Data Protection Bill. Data localisation will also encourage domestic tech companies and international behemoths to venture into setting up massive digital infrastructure, like data centres, in the country. While data localisation will build a robust ecosystem for fostering local business models in data mining, data analytics and big data, it will equally boost opportunities for tech start-ups to build path-breaking products around data-driven businesses. Moreover, this will herald a new breed of skilled professionals like data scientists, analysts and warehouse architects to propel the growth in this segment. According to a report on the State of Analytics at Domestic Firms in India, 2018 by Analytics India Magazine and INSOFE, the Indian analytics, data science and big data industry is estimated to be around $30 billion. Of this, the domestic market captured $3.03 billion in 2019 and it is expected to double by 2025. Data localisation will further fuel the growth of this industry.

Sensing the potential of data analytics in eGovernance, the Centre is also planning to build an advanced technology platform to host and interpret huge amount of data that will integrate and help in better understanding of citizens’ data, spending patterns of the Government, consumption trends and the success of various Government policies. This will increase transparency in eGovernance by giving citizens access to the statistic. Data localisation is certainly going to catalyse this mission. The Government can also leverage citizens’ information for economic empowerment, address educational and health service challenges, foster financial inclusion and expedite verification and validation for Government schemes. The other dimensions of data localisation include thwarting of breeches, safety and security of privacy and curtailing of cyber frauds that happen very often in a digital world. When information is stored locally, the Government can easily access the payments data and investigate financial crimes expeditiously. The proposed Bill will provide the right framework to protect India’s sovereign rights on citizens’ details and strengthen its leadership in the digital economy.

The expansion of the digital economy will create opportunities to improve the social and economic standards of people living at the bottom of the pyramid by addressing challenges through data-driven insights. Since India is an IT superpower coupled with a high internet penetration and a strong business economy, the Bill seems to be very timely and this will revolutionise the entire gamut of services delivered by IT companies. In effect, this will build up a synergy between enterprises and the regulatory authorities to establish mature business processes, which, in turn, will help companies correct their business procedures to significantly safeguard data of citizens. Furthermore, start-ups and the IT industry can leverage the humongous data universe generated from digital transactions and build innovative products with a significant socio-economic impact while safeguarding a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025.

10,05-2-20,Priyanka must rebuild the party in UP,"The Gandhi scion must work out a strategy for the 2022 Assembly polls. For this, she must become a street fighter like her grandmother Indira, hold the flock together and bring new faces into the Congress

One year after her dramatic entry into politics, the Congress is still waiting for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s magic to surface. When she was inducted last year as AICC General Secretary, the party believed that she was their “Brahmastra (divine weapon)” and would restore the party to its old glory. After the passage of one year, many Congressmen feel that she has not delivered as much as the party expected.

Priyanka is not new to politics, as she had grown up in a distinguished political family. Because of an unwritten pact in the family, she had taken a back seat allowing her brother Rahul Gandhi to remain in the limelight for the last two decades. In any case, Sonia Gandhi preferred her son to succeed her, instead of the daughter. After taking charge of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) unit, she began well with a mega 17-km-long roadshow in Lucknow. Priyanka accompanied Rahul when he visited the Pulwama victims and she also visited the families of the victims of the Sonbhadra massacre, Unnao rape case and violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, taking the UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath head on.

Before the Lok Sabha polls, she visited the Bhim army chief Chandrashekhar Azad in hospital, creating ripples in political circles. During the elections, till the last minute Priyanka kept up the suspense whether she would contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, or not.

Unfortunately, these moves are not enough. Despite all the hype, in 2019 the Congress won only one seat as Sonia managed to retain Rae Bareli, while Rahul lost in the family bastion Amethi. In 2014, the Congress secured just two seats —those of Sonia and Rahul. The Congress leaders, who were betting on the Priyanka magic are unable to explain why, though at one level, she has many things going for her. Priyanka has the family name, a presentable personality, charisma, an uncanny resemblance to her grandmother Indira Gandhi, articulation and many more positives to her advantage. But obviously these are not enough. Why is Priyanka unable to capitalise on these obvious advantages that she has? Is it because of the lack of backing from the family? Is it sibling rivalry? Is the Old Guard resisting her rise? At least three opportunities came her way in the last one-year. The first was when Rahul resigned after the party lost in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. She could have easily succeeded him as the party chief and no one would have opposed her. Ultimately the Old Guard prevailed on Sonia to come back as the interim party president.

The second was when the anti- CAA protests started picking up. Though Priyanka had tweeted in support of them, had visited the victims in hospital and taken the lead in sitting on a dharna with students at the India Gate, many feel that she could have done more on behalf of the party, particularly in UP as it is one of the States which had faced the worst impact of the Government crackdown on the anti-CAA movement. Priyanka will get another opportunity to lead the party when her mother takes a back seat again. Sonia is said to have conveyed to her close aides (read the Old Guard) that they should choose a new party chief in view of her deteriorating health. When they suggested the name of Priyanka, they got the hint that she would prefer Rahul to come back as the president.

Sadly, Priyanka’s performance in her one year in office is not very impressive but there are many reasons for that. First of all, PGV as Priyanka is called within the party, was deployed very late. Had she been inducted ten years ago, she would have matured politically. Also her entry was at the wrong time. The party was in a disarray, losing one State after another post its miserable performance in the 2014 general elections, where it got just 44 seats as the Rahul-led Congress had not been able to provide an alternative to Modi.

Second, the Gandhi name no longer holds the magic, which the family refuses to recognise. No one in the present generation is in awe of the clan. The unfortunate thing is that while Modi has found a way to connect with the voters, the Gandhis are still to find their narrative. While Rahul has at lease some electoral wins, PGV does not even have that, though she is considered more articulate and charismatic than her brother.

Third, Priyanka might become a good leader in times to come but for that she should become a vote catcher. Looking back, it is not clear what is Priyanka’s brand of politics except for her sporadic activities. She must work out a strategy for the 2022 Assembly polls. For this she must hold the flock together and also bring in new faces. But if she has the spirit of Indira Gandhi, Priyanka too should become a street fighter and be seen more on the ground than on twitter. If she has to lift the Congress from its present decline in UP, Priyanka has to build the organisation at the grassroot level and become a 24/7 politician as 2022 is not very far.

11,05-2-20,Soldiers without boots,"The CAG report flags a chronic shortage of gear for our forces in Siachen and raises questions about fund allocations

The latest CAG report about the pathetic lack of snow gear and supplies for our soldiers on guard at the freezing and inhospitable Siachen glacier is only shocking as a headline. For such findings do not change year after year when the defence accounts are assessed. They show the same lopsided allocation of funds that has been compromising the health and functionality of our troops. This is irrespective of Governments and consistent warnings by a series of CAG reports. This report is no different from the earlier ones relating to March 2013, which said that we would run out of ammunition in 10 days in a conventional war. So apart from this grim state of affairs bothering us for a while, there is no determined policy push to set it right. Some of the details are indeed so disturbing that it makes us wonder if we are among the top armies of the world. Such was the shortage of multi-purpose boots, which can protect feet in -55 degrees Celsius, that our personnel had to opt for recycled ones. They fell short of snow goggles in a region where you would go blind without them, simply because there weren’t enough stocks at the Ordnance Factory in Dehradun. If shortages aren’t alarming, raising questions about why the funds ran dry or if they had mysteriously leached during dissemination, then irregularities in the selection of rucksacks, face masks, high mountain clothing and equipment are more than plain serious. Apparently, they didn’t meet any specifications. Worse, about 31,779 sleeping bags were found “sub-standard.” And though these conformed to old specifications, nothing explains why they were procured at an extra cost of Rs 7.74 crore. The saddest part is all of these make for the most basic kit for such extreme conditions and are not even orders for upgraded gear. Still their procurement was delayed inexplicably by four years. Predictably, the Narendra Modi Government may pass on the blame to the systemic paralysis of the Manmohan Singh years and claim clemency that it only assumed power in 2014. But then can it explain why it couldn’t accelerate the empowered committee on provisioning reviews? As it turns out, some of our benchmarks are not even commensurate with international standards. And this is still not a priority considering soldiers are forever under threat in a treacherous terrain where more die to avalanches and climate extremes than any military action.

Year after year, there is always a demand for increasing the defence outlay. Last year’s Budget made the headline for being the lowest since 1962, which was when India fought the war against China. And though this time it has been hiked by about six per cent, mostly to factor in inflation, it is not enough to make big purchases for enhancing capabilities. Yet a lion’s share of the Budget is allocated to the Army, followed by the Navy and the Air Force. A majority of the budget then goes towards the salary and pension bill. And with both only expected to grow in the future, the cascading effect will undoubtedly stretch the procurement list at the seams for some time to come. So unless there is a strict cost rationalisation review, there can be no redress. Much of the revenue expenditure has been wasteful, due to outdated processes of maintenance and upkeep and a flabby supply chain management. Then there is the menace of corruption in procurement, skeletons of dodgy deals tumbling out of cupboards every other year, all of which compromise spends. At the moment, there is very little manoeuvering space to set aside funds for infrastructure. And if this is the case with basic equipment, one shudders to think what will happen to technological upgrades of arsenal and strategic inductions. Most of this year’s defence expenditure will go towards the new Tejas Mk 1A aircraft. Although developed at home, its capabilities pale in comparison to other fighter jets around the world and will need fortifications. Which means that we will continue to import rather than buy home-grown tech, simply because it is not up to the mark. Due to the low budget, the Navy, too, has had to roll back plans on having 200 warships by 2027. One just hopes that the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff, aimed at improving the coordination between forces, streamlining resources, professionalising operations and sharpening our preparedness in the neighbourhood, can synergise security requirements and prioritise them according to the budget. Hopefully, we can then give our soldiers the boots they need to march with.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/soldiers-without-boots-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/soldiers-without-boots.html
12,05-2-20,Homecoming of sorts?,"Rumours are rife that the Tata Group will buy out Air India. What will that mean for its employees?

In retrospect one could ask what came out of the nationalisation of Air India. After all, the Tata Group bestowed the airline to the nation with a unique identity, one that still exists today. Although the airline, as we know it now, is still a bloated, yet hollow shell of its former self. It has been used and abused by politicians and bureaucrats over the years with questionable purchases of aircraft and dubious lease agreements, let alone hiring employees more interested in politics and corruption. However, things have been brought back on track over the past few years with new aircraft, the membership of a global alliance and profitable new routes to the US and Europe. The creation of a low-cost operation in Air India Express to ferry passengers, particularly between southern India and the Arabian peninsula, has done very well for itself.

So is the Tata Group the right suitor at the right time? It already has two airline ventures in India, the full-service Vistara with Singapore Airlines and no-frills Air Asia India with Malaysian low-cost operator Air Asia. Any takeover will have to get approval of both these partners and the question arises about whether these partners will put in any cash towards the Air India purchase. Then, of course, how will Tata integrate Air India into its current operations and what will happen to the thousands of employees, many of whom are fearful that any new owner will want to clear out the deadwood. Then again, with an existing alliance with Singapore Airlines, also a Star Alliance member, the Tata Group might find it easier to integrate an airline such as Air India, with Air India Express likely being integrated into the no-frills operation. Does it make sense for the Tata Group to spend so much money, over $3 billion, even with the Government covering some of the accumulated losses. It did not bite when Kingfisher’s Vijay Mallya and Jet Airways’ Naresh Goyal went begging to them, even though both had established airlines. So why Air India? Possibly the fact that JRD Tata was so closely linked to the airline, even serving as its Chairman till 1977. In fact, Air India preserves JRD Tata’s desk at its headquarters in Mumbai to this day. At the same time, Air India has significant international and domestic operations, even though they are well behind IndiGo on the domestic front. In addition, the Tata brand is still one that many Indians respect and a sale to the Tata Group will not draw the ire of the public, let alone the Opposition. Provided the buyout works.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/homecoming-of-sorts--2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/homecoming-of-sorts-.html
13,05-2-20,Govt extends deadline for Sarbakhyama again,"In view of an overwhelming response to the Sarbakhyama Yojana (amnesty scheme), which has been launched to regularise unapproved construction in the urban areas across the State, the Government has extended the deadline of the scheme further for 15 more days.

Housing and Urban Development Minister Pratap Jena informed this here on Tuesday.

Jena told reporters, “We have received a lot of applications (under the Sarbakhyama Yojana). Even though we had set February 5 as the last date for (implementation of scheme), applications are continuing to pour in. Hence, we decided to extend the last date for submitting the applications for 15 more days.”

Stating that the relaxation period would no more be extended, the Minister warned that legal action would be taken if unauthorised constructions are not regularised during the freshly mandated period.

Notably, the Government had launched the scheme in June 2018 to regularise the unapproved constructions by paying a specific fee along with submission of building construction plans and fire clearance certificates. Earlier in June last year, the Government had extended the deadline of the scheme for six months.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-extends-deadline-for-sarbakhyama-again.html

15,05-2-20,"Adulteration, pollution preventable and modifiable causes of cancer","World Cancer Day is observed every year on February 4 to raise awareness on cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world.

Cancer can be defined in simple words as the uncontrolled growth of cells. The second characteristic of cancer cells is their ability to survive with the normal cells of the body. Cancer is known to spread to distal organs and can also recur at local site after treatment.

This condition has tormented humans for as long of our civilisation has existed. Cancer is not new to the humans as it is being perceived today. It is recorded in Egyptian texts dating back to about 5,000 years and similarly it has been mentioned in Ancient Indian medical texts Charak and Sushruta Samhitas. It was known as “Arbud”.

A study published in the Lancet 2017 shows that the incidence of cancer in children is increasing day by day. A UK based charity; Children with Cancer organisation states that the exposure to external factor such as pesticides, air pollution and dietary habits may have bearing on the increased incidence of childhood cancer.

In his professional experience, this author has known the child of a family friend who developed a germ cell tumour at the age of six months. Here, the cause seems to be either genetic or environmental in the womb.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) 2016 data shows a significant rise in the incidence of cancer among both men and women. Cancer burden in India has more than doubled over the last 25 years. The highest incidence of cancer in women is breast cancer and oral cavity cancer in men. According to government of India report breast, cervical, oral cavity and lung cancer together constitute almost 40 per cent of all cancer burden.

Tobacco in any form is known to cause cancer. Tobacco smoking causes lung cancer and tobacco chewing causes oral cancer. The consumption of alcohol is linked with liver and stomach cancer mainly but may cause breast cancer too.

It has been found that there is a synergistic impact of smoking and drinking in the risk of developing several types of cancer particularly oral cancer and stomach cancer. Several prominent studies have found an increased cancer risk associated with urban air pollution. Particulate matter present in the ambient air has been found to be a major contributor to increased cancer risk.

It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of cancer cases can be linked to embryonic exposures of toxins which are commonly found in many commonly used household substances most notably liquid detergents and certain cosmetic products. In June 2015, a global collective of medical resources attempted to address the long standing concerns of chemical exposure in everyday life which estimated that up to 20 per cent of cancer cases can be linked to environmental exposure of toxins. A study published in 2016 found that 90 per cent of the US households had dust which contained chemical suspected to be harmful to human health specifically by interfering with the endocrine and reproductive function.

Free radicals in the body are known to damage the normal cells and these free radicals are linked with the cause of cancer. Antioxidants are important for good health and offer other benefits too. It is good to consume antioxidants through natural colourful fresh vegetables and fruits.

It has been estimated that 30 per cent of all cancer in developed nations and 20 per cent in the developing nations are linked to the diet we consume. Over a hundred studies from around the world have reported a link between red meat intake as a likely cause of developing cancer while the exact pathway of cause of cancer is not clear. Out of all meat, beef has the highest positive correlation with colon cancer.

Diet plays a vital role in maintaining good health. Most of the lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hyper tension, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, hyper lipidemia and many other diseases are linked with bad food habits. But certain foods like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, radish, carrot, beans, berries, tomatoes reduce the chances of cancer and can reduce the growth of the cancer cells significantly. Other foods like turmeric, garlic, cinnamon, citrus fruits, flaxseeds, olive oil and fatty fish are known to reduce the chances of cancer as well. It has become increasing clear that overeating can have a major impact on your risk of developing cancer.

Green tea is the healthiest and probably one of the cheapest beverages on the planet and it is loaded with the hundreds of micronutrients and plenty of anti-oxidants that have powerful effect on the body. It not only improves the brain function but reduces the body weight and decreases the risk of cancer.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and green tea has about 30 per cent polyphenols by weight. The polyphenols reduce the formation of free radicals in the body which can damage the normal cells. These free radicals are also known to play a role in ageing. The treatment of cancer usually includes a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and other supportive therapies. The most important factor which influences the outcome of the treatment depends upon the age and, co-morbidities of the patient, type, site, size, stage, quality of surgery and doubling time of the cancer.

The price of the anti-cancer drugs is phenomenally high and is hurting the low income people and developing countries the most. The high price of anti-cancer drugs is even pinching the developed nations of the world like USA, UK and other European countries. According to a survey which was conducted in 2014 by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India, it was found that out of pocket expenditure on cancer treatment is among the highest for any ailment. Cancer can be a major cause of acquired poverty.

The treatment of cancer is very expensive India it is reported that treatment cost can go up to Rs 20 lakh per year. In certain cancers one can imagine how difficult it would be to the patient and their families when 22 per cent of the Indian population is still living below poverty line according to the government of India data collected in 2011.

Various scientific studies have found that about 60 per cent of cancer related deaths can be prevented by primordial prevention (removing the cause of disease so that exposure to risk is minimal) and early detection by screening (test to detect disease).

In spite of spending significant amount of money for treatment which families are usually unable to afford --but somehow arrange by borrowing money from friends and relatives or by selling their meagre assets-- they ultimately lose the beloved one to the fight against cancer and in such a way the whole family gets devastated.

Improper diet, adulterated food, contaminated and polluted air, water and soil are the common causes of cancer. Recently other factors like lack of physical activity and obesity have been found to be linked with cancer development.

Cancer awareness and early detection should be a priority for all governments and particularly in our country because of the negative socio economic implications. It will be worthwhile to educate and spread awareness among the people to take steps to prevent cancer and realise the importance of early detection and adequate treatment.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/adulteration--pollution-preventable-and-modifiable-causes-of-cancer.html

18,05-2-20,Himachal aims to increase forest cover by 30%,"The Himachal Pradesh Government is aiming to increase its forest area by 30 per cent by 2030 and to achieve this goal initiatives have been taken up, an official said on Tuesday.

Plantation campaigns are being carried out by the state Forest Department in identified places. Last year by involving 1,18,932 people, 26,47,146 saplings were planted, a government spokesperson told IANS.

This campaign was run for five days and it was for the first time record saplings were planted under a campaign. As a result of public campaigns, the Forest Department has succeeded in increasing the green cover.

Quoting a Forest Survey of India report for 2019, the green forest cover area which was 15,100 sq km in the 2017 has now increased to 15,433.52 sq km in 2019.An increase has also been reported in very dense, moderate dense and open forest areas, he said.

The moderately dense forest area, which was 6,705 sq km 2017, has increased to 7,125.93 sq km in 2019.

Likewise, between 2017 and 2019, the dense forest area of the state has increased from 3,110 sq km to 3,112.71 sq km.In order to connect the forest enhancement with livelihood, the Himachal Pradesh Forest Eco System Management and Livelihood Improvement project of Rs 800 crore funded by JICA has been started in six districts -- Kullu, Mandi, Lahaul-Spiti, Bilaspur, Shimla and Kinnaur.

The main aim of this project is to improve ecosystem services in the forest area for sustainable socio-economic development. Under the project, 460 committees will be constituted for promoting activities like forest and environmental protection, biodiversity and organism conservation and improvement in livelihood.

Through this project, local rural forest development committees will be empowered to visit various states and various training programmes will be organised to make them aware of about the ongoing schemes in other states.In addition, the Himachal Pradesh Forest Ecosystem Climate Proofing Project of Rs 310 crore is being implemented in the districts of Kangra and Chamba in collaboration with the German government and the German Development Bank (KFW).

To make every section aware about the rights of girl child and to bring the idea of linking them to environment and to society, the state has launched the 'Ek Buta Beti Ke Naam' scheme.

Under this scheme, after September 20, 2019, the Forest Department is providing five saplings, tri-guards, child's name plate, 20 kg of earthworm fertilizer and technical information to each daughter's family.

About 11,50,000 saplings are projected to be planted in the next five years and for which Rs 28.75 crore will be spent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/himachal-aims-to-increase-forest-cover-by-30-.html

The stray cattle have enough space to roam free in the Gau Sadan compound and are also enabled to feed when they wish, said the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun senior veterinary officer Dr V Sati.

According to Dr Sati, “Stray cattle are not usually in the habit of living in a confined area or being tied up in a corner. If they are kept tied up, they create a nuisance for the other cattle too. Therefore they are kept free in Gau Sadan where they can roam around and have food according to their will.” “We respect their freedom to move around and MCD has enough space for stray cattle where they can stay without being confined to narrow spaces,"" Sati added.

On the commencement of picking stray cattle off the major roads of the city, he said, “There is now negligible number of stray cattle on Dehradun roads. Anyone can easily see the difference in the number of stray cattle visible on the roads these days compared to the past."" According to him, the people who domesticate the cattle are actually responsible for the stray cattle on the roads. They leave them in open on the streets when they are not profitable for their owners.

He also mentioned that to get the cattle released from Gau Sadan, an owner will have to pay penalty of Rs 500 per day for the duration of the cattle’s stay at the shelter. Sati further informed that currently there are three guards and two people for taking care of cattle in the shelter but the number of staff will be increased in the near future.

27,05-2-20,"Commuters face hardship as Uber, Ola on strike","The commuters continue to face a hard time on Tuesday as the app-based cab services Uber and Ola remained off the roads and only limited vehicles were available in the city.

While the Chandigarh Administration convened a meeting with a delegation of drivers of cab services to resolve the issue of entry fee, the drivers announced to continue their strike over other demands.

The cab aggregators Uber and Ola are in a deadlock with drivers over payment of the ‘entry fee’ being charged by the Chandigarh State Transport Authority (STA). The entry fee is charged from cabs, which are not registered in Chandigarh.

The STA had last week asked both Uber and Ola to pay the unpaid ‘entry fee’.

The Traffic Police had also started challaning cab drivers who didn’t have the receipt of ‘entry fee’ paid for entering the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

The strike call given by the cab drivers entered its sixth day at Mohali on Tuesday.

More than 5,000 cabs are plying in the city, catering to the tricity commuters. According to the On Demand Transport Aggregators Rules 2017, except for about 500 cabs registered in the city, an entry fee of Rs 1000 per cab has to be paid every quarter by the aggregators.

The STA had allowed Ola and Uber to offer their can services in 2017 hence the Department is seeking unpaid dues for nine quarters.

During the meeting held with association of cab drivers, Manoj Parida, Adviser to UT Administrator, said that the pending Government revenue has to be paid by the drivers of cabs.

He also said that since the entry fee of Chandigarh is only Rs 333 per month which is much cheaper than the neighbouring states, there should be no reason for the default.

It was decided that all stakeholders may be allowed to make payment of first two quarters of current financial year by February 15 while the remaining needs to be cleared by March 31. After this, a special drive will be started by the Transport and Traffic Police Department to penalize the defaulters for non-payment of entry fee.

After the meeting, Harvinder Singh, president, Cab Operator Social Welfare Association, said, “We will continue the strike.

We have submitted a memorandum of demands to the Chandigarh Administration and will continue the strike till our demands are met.”

While we have been asked to pay the entry fee by the UT Administration, it is the responsibility of the companies to pay the fee, he said.

Another meeting of Administration, representatives of cab companies and drivers should be organized to resolve our issues.

Only then we will decide over ending the ongoing strike, he added.

47,05-2-20,Electrifying Changes for MP Power Sector,"In a bid to provide affordable and uninterrupted power supply to industrial, agricultural and domestic consumers , the Kamal Nath Government is working towards reducing transmission losses and upgrading power production facilities in Madhya Pradesh.

The State Government, helmed by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, is committed to providing 10 hours of electricity to farmers while the target for domestic consumers is set for uninterrupted round-the-clock supply.

According to officials at the Energy Department in the State Capital, a slew of measures is underway to ensure the development of the power sector into a financially viable self-reliant unit providing affordable electricity across the consumer spectrum.

Listing out measures, the officials say both Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Energy Minister Priyavrat Singh have been instrumental in expanding the policy framework with a vision to facilitate the upgrade of production and transmission facilities.

A power deficit state, Madhya Pradesh faces a range of challenges that require attention and action on a war footing. While the establishment of new generation facilities is pertinent for the long term, the upgradation of existing production facilities and transmission infrastructure is crucial for the everyday supply of power in the state.

With the state requisitioning power to feed its ever-burgeoning supply needs, the state government has effected some astute policy reengineering and budgetary planning and allocations to ensure that affordable power is made available to all.

Rising to the challenge the State Government has given its assent to the requisition of 2,640 megawatt of electricity to fulfill the long-term supply needs.

The Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company (MPPGCL), the power generation arm of the State Government, has earned requisite approvals of nearly Rs 1,715 crore as part amount or loan from the State Government for its various projects.

Another Rs 2,552.9 crores have been approved for existing and under construction power projects.

Amid attempts to strengthen transmission, the Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company, the transmission arm for the western region in the State, has been entrusted with the approvals for a guarantee of a loan bid of Rs 1,200 crore. The State Government has also agreed to extend guarantee to its wholly-owned transmission arms for a loan of Rs 2,900 crore from the Power Finance Corporation (PFC).

Credit facilities have also been provided to MPPGCL and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company (MPPMCL) for a total of Rs 2,200 crore.

In keeping with efforts to minimise transmission snags the department of energy has laid down norms for time-efficient correction and replacement of faulty or burnt out transformers. All efforts are underway to ensure a reduction in the incidents of tripping.

Norms for safe and technically advanced maintenance measures have been put in place while stringent checks are being conducted to ensure the quality consumables and power supply hardware received from private vendors.

Consumer-friendly measures have been launched to ensure the timely redressal of grievances and steps are being taken to improve the various aspects of domestic supply, metering, billing and collection processes.

Household connections relying on agricultural feeders are being provided single phase electricity starting 6pm.

Measures are being taken to provide neighbourhood and doorstep services to consumers across the state, department employees are also being imparted with training to help upgrade their skills with a special emphasis on safety.

Officials say every aspect of the sector, be it technical or commercial, is being studied with a view to bring a quality change to each micro process which would in-turn contribute to better performance of both men and materials involved in the production, distribution and supply of power.

A raft of power welfare schemes has also been launched by the Government (see box).

With Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Energy Minister Priyavrat Singh leading the charge, an electrifying change seems to be in the offing for Madhya Pradesh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/electrifying-changes-for-mp-power-sector.html

51,05-2-20,Remuna locals oppose dairy farm land transfer,"Former MLA Pradipta Panda, employees of a dairy farm and local elected representatives demanded protection of land meant for the dairy farm.

They, besides stating that the farm was established in Remuna in 1965 for the enhancement of milk production and promotion of other dairy products, informed it was erected on a 84-acre patch of land. However, of late , it was observed that the land was shrinking as a portion of it was alienated for other purposes.

Panda said out of 84 acre of land while four acre land was given for OMFED, 50 acre was given to the newly-established Fakir Mohan Medical College and Hospital. Further, there was a proposal to give another 5-7 acre to the medical college for its expansion and establishment of a Nursing College.

Panda said after establishment of the dairy farm, grass cultivation was taken up in rest land for the fodder of the cattle. The locals were not only procuring pure milk from the farm but also buying grass from the farm. About 100 people belonging to 12 families had been depending on the farm.

Once there were a large number of cattle and milk production was substantial but the production had declined now as the cattle were not getting adequate movement and fodder.

They alleged that after giving the 5-7 acre of land to the Government medical college hardly any land would be left for the dairy farm for which the land was meant during establishment.

The milk production would further decline once the cattle would not find adequate grass from the field, they alleged.

On Sunday while a meeting was held in the regard , the local elected representatives including ZP member Sitaram Pradhan, Sarpanch Gitanjali Giri and PS member Ashok Sethi attending the meeting expressed concern over the issue.

They observed that the district administration should procure land which were adjacent to the medical college instead of taking the land of the farm.

The passed a resolution not to part with any patch of land of the dairy farm and communicate their unanimous decision to the district Collector and other authorities. They also threatened to hold agitation if their grievance was not addressed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/remuna-locals-oppose-dairy-farm-land-transfer.html
52,05-2-20,Juster: DefExpo an opportunity to see innovation of Indian defence industry,"US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster said that DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow was a great opportunity to see talent and innovation of India’s defence industry and the US government was looking forward to pursuing opportunities to expand cooperation as the Indian government establishes defence industrial corridor in Uttar Pradesh.

“Defence exhibitions such as these demonstrate that industry in the US and India, along with our respective governments, share a common understanding regarding the nature of modern battlefield,” the US Ambassador said in a presser in Lucknow on Tuesday.

Juster further said, “We share the belief that in order for India to ensure its defence and work with like-minded nations in pursuit of common security objectives, it is critical that India move toward systems — not just weapons — that are effective, agile, and resilient. India must ultimately move toward systems that are interoperable with the equipment and networks of its security partners,” he said.

US firms at this exhibition produce battle-proven, high-technology equipment and networks. For example, these companies have supplied modern land and sea-based fighter aircraft; ballistic missile defence systems; the most advanced, networked avionics equipment; and secure communications equipment for the United States and our partners. They are poised to offer the same to India, he added.

“While defence technology and an opportunity to view latest high-tech gadgetry is what attracts visitors to DefExpo, perhaps the greatest value is the occasion it provides for our companies to foster closer industry-to-industry ties in what is a key pillar of the US-India relationship,” Juster said.

The US Ambassador added, “I have found in my travels in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere in India that the potential for industry partnership between our two countries on state-of-the-art defence equipment is enormous.”

“Right now, US firms participating in this event are partnering with companies across India, including in Uttar Pradesh’s Defence Corridor, to produce defence equipment not just for our country’s militaries, but for those of partner nations,” he said.

Giving examples, Juster said, “Tata has partnered with Lockheed Martin to build all C-130 tails and F-16 wings here. And Boeing is collaborating with HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) to produce all AH-64 Apache fuselages in Hyderabad.”.

“Along the pathway to a deeper industry-to-industry relationship, there are, of course, barriers that we must overcome. It is our goal to identify obstacles to enhancing industry-to-industry cooperation and formulate solutions in concert with the Government of India as well as US and Indian industry, so that we can build a closer defence relationship,” he said

When asked what exactly will the US display in DefExpo 2020, the Ambassador said that weapons of different range like satellite, avionics and modern missiles system would be put on display.

“This will be an opportunity for private players in India to enter into an agreement with US companies and manufacture the weaponry here,” he said.

But he also ruled out signing an MoU with UP government over setting up of defence units in the proposed Defence Corridor saying that the US government only played the role of facilitator by creating an environment where private companies could come together and ink a deal.

When asked whether during his proposed visit to India, US President Donald Trump would sign any pact on defence, the US Ambassador said that President Trump had shown his willingness to visit India and there was no proposal pending on defence deal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/juster--defexpo-an-opportunity-to-see-innovation-of-indian-defence-industry.html

62,05-2-20,‘Polluters-must-pay' drive kicks off in Angul,"Failure in implementing various action plans in the stipulated times and negligence of the statutory bodies, including Pollution Control Board, caused serious air pollution in Angul district. While various action plans, prepared by the OSPCB, have not been implemented by the industries and mines authorities, action plans on urban waste management, planned transportation activities and fly ash management have not been fully implemented, leading to severe pollution. Air pollution increased health cost and economic burden of the people.

In view of this , in an urgent meeting, the Citizens’ Action Forum (CAF) strongly demanded and decided to campaign for providing free electricity and free medical facilities to the inhabitants of the critically polluted Angul district.

The Chief Minister has already demanded for providing 25% to 33% free power from coal-based thermal power generating stations to the host States. CAF president Rabindra Prasad Pattanaik told that coal-bearing States like Odisha in general and districts like Angul in particular were facing negative externalities like loss of forest and vital eco system, pollution of air and river water, health hazards, problems of resettlement and rehabilitation which were not being compensated by the existing system of payment of royalty.

Moreover, Angul people are with high health risk due to the severe pollution of four thermal power plants and 17 coal mines.

Due to dust and air pollution, diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, fluorosis, bronchitis, thyroid and stomach ailments have become endemic .

Environmentalist Sasmita Behera demanded that polluters pay the health and electricity cost of the people.

Interacting with media, Gupta, who is Jamshedpur West MLA said that the previous government only built infrastructures with three new medical colleges but failed to provide resources like doctors, nursing staff and paramedics. The situation is the same not only in all the six medical colleges, but also at hospitals in district, block and village levels.

“ It is really a matter of concern that several rural hospitals are lying locked due to lack of doctors. I have asked my department principal secretary to compile a list of hospitals along with their manpower requirements. After getting the figure I will meet the Chief Minister to take steps to fill up the vacancies,” said Gupta.

Gupta on Monday had held a meeting with Tata Steel vice-president (corporate services), Chanakya Chaudhary and Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited MD Tarun Daga and MGM Hospital superintendent Dr Sanjay Kumar and deputy superintendent Dr Nakul Choudhary at Circuit House and discussed problems with MGM doctors and nursing staff and also inspected the emergency and other wards of the over 500-bed state owned.

76,05-2-20,SIT formed to probe MLA’s graft charges,"Taking serious note of Independent MLA Balraj Kundu levelling corruption charges against former Haryana cabinet minister Manish Grover, Home Minister Anil Vij on Tuesday formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Urban Local Body director Amit Aggarwal to look into this issue thoroughly.

The Home Minister has also directed SIT in-charge to complete the investigation within a month.

Meham MLA Kundu recently met Vij and registered a complaint against Grover with ""evidence"" . The MLA had apparently handed over documents related to scam involving crores of rupees against Grover, a minister in the previous BJP government in the state.

Talking to The Pioneer, Vij said, “Meham MLA Balraj Kundu had earlier met me at the Secretariat and registered a complaint regarding corruption in urban local bodies. I have constituted a SIT to look into this issue thoroughly.”

When contacted MLA Kundu said, “I welcome Home Minister Anil Vij’s decision of constituting SIT to look into corruption charges against the ex-Minister. However I have not been informed so far.”

Sources said that in the complaint to Home Minister, Kundu had demanded inquiry against Grover for allegedly allotting development projects in Rohtak to his relatives and favourite contractors by ignoring rules and regulations. He had also alleged that Grover was also responsible for large scale irregularities in sugar mills across the State during his tenure as cooperatives minister.

Kundu alleged that a case of criminal breach of trust was registered against him at the behest of Grover. He alleged that the former minister pressurised the administration to implicate him in false case after he raised corruption charges against Grover.

A case was registered on January 17 against Balraj Kundu and his brother Shivraj under relevant Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to cheating, conspiracy and criminal breach of trust on a complaint lodged by one Narender Dhankhar

Narender Dhankar had alleged that the (Kundu) brothers, who run a construction company, were not paying money to him which they owed to him during business transactions.

Taking serious note of an FIR against him and his brother, Kundu who had earlier supported the coalition government unconditionally, had threatened to withdraw support to the BJP- JJP government in Haryana if chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar fails to order a probe into allegations of corruption against Grover within a month. Grover is counted among the BJP leaders close to CM Manohar Lal Khattar.

Kundu had earlier said, “I have been chosen as an MLA by the constituency. It is my moral duty to expose those who had looted public money.” ""I have been raising my voice against corruption. Such false cases will not suppress my voice,"" he had said.

The formation of the SIT by Vij comes in the backdrop of the seven Independent MLAs who had given unconditional support to the BJP-JJP led- coalition government holding a meeting recently under the chairmanship of MLA from Rania and Haryana Power Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala.

They had strongly opposed the case filed against Kundu and his brother.

Previously Kundu who was associated with BJP had said, “We had extended the support to the BJP-JJP government because of ""clean credentials"" of the chief minister.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sit-formed-to-probe-mla---s-graft-charges.html

The power supply had to be blocked from 8am to 4pm on Tuesday as the Hatia Grid was undergoing upgrade as per a national scheme of upgrading all the power grids across the country, Public Relations Officer of JBVNL, MP Yadav said. “The power supply resumed after 4pm. We are upgrading all the power grids as per a national plan. Hatia Grid underwent maintenance and upgrade on Tuesday, so the power supply had to be temporarily blocked,” he said.

Sources from JBVNL said that the Hatia Grid was built in 1962 and therefore it was in need of necessary upgrades. Some equipment in the grid are also being replaced in order to make the infrastructure up-to-date. A similar power blockage is likely on February 8 as the grid would again undergo some upgrades, they added.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren recently took to microblogging website Twitter to inform the people of Jharkhand about the power cuts and requested them to have patience. “Dear, residents of Jharkhand. In the entire State, the work of maintenance and upgrading of all the grids of the State is going on at a cost of Rs 154 crores, due to which you all have to face some inconvenience,” he wrote. “I assure all of you that your convenience and safety is my priority. I sincerely hope that all of you are with us in this work. I apologise for all this inconvenience to you all,” he added.

However, while Tuesday’s power cut was planned, residents in some parts of Ranchi have been suffering due to frequent power failures in the past couple of days. “Some technical faults caused the power cuts in Kokar and Lalpur areas. The problems have been addressed and supply has resumed,” Yadav said.

In the wake of frequent power failures, Chief Secretary DK Tiwari had called for an emergency meeting with concerned officials last month and asked them to ensure uninterrupted power supply in all parts of the State capital. He had also asked JBVNL officials to do all maintenance works during the daytime, so residents do not face problems in the night.

88,05-2-20,Poddar raises national heritage structures issue in Rajya Sabha,"Rajya Sabha member Mahesh Poddar has said that due to flawed reporting, Brahma Temple of Tagore Hill in Ranchi and Nandan Kanan, the workplace of Ishwarchand Vidyasagar in Karmatand, Jamtara, have not been developed as heritage sites. He said that his efforts to develop these two places of historically important Jharkhand as heritage sites will continue.

Through a question in the Rajya Sabha, Poddar sought information from the Government about the conditions laid down by the Archaeological Survey of India for marking or developing a memorial site as a heritage site. He wanted to know whether the government would develop the Brahma Temple at Tagore Hill, Ranchi and Nandan Kanan, the workplace of Ishwarchand Vidyasagar at Karmatand in Jamtara, as a heritage site as per the stipulated condition.

Replying to the question Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Culture and Tourism, Prahlada Singh Patel, said that under Section 2 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, if any composition, monuments, stupas, mausoleums, caves, rock formations, carved articles Or monolithic, is of historical, archaeological or artistic interest and has been existing for at least 100 years, then it can be declared a monument of national importance. Patel said that due to the Archaeological Survey of India not being declared a monument of national importance so far, it is not being considered to develop these two sites as heritage sites.

Poddar said that due to lack of proper reporting about these two historical sites of Jharkhand, they could not attain the status of National Heritage.

He said that it is an undisputed fact that Nandan Kanan is the workplace of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in Karmatand in Jamtara district. Vidyasagar ji has died on 29 July 1891, that is, the buildings and other constructions built by him in Karmatand are more than 100 years old.

He said that in the 1832 edition of the magazine titled Tattvabodhini, published from Kolkata, in the year 1910, there is a reference to the Brahma temple at Tagore Hill in Ranchi. It is clear that this structure was also built before 1910 and is now more than 100 years old.

Poddar said that in light of these facts, both these historical monuments of Jharkhand qualify for the status of a heritage site. But due to lack of proper reporting, till now they are deprived of getting the status of monument of national importance and the convenience of conservation-development.

He said that he is in constant communication with the Central and State Government on this subject and efforts will be continued in this direction till the target is achieved.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/poddar-raises-national-heritage-structures-issue-in-rajya-sabha.html

""We have to go soon from here, we have been told that soon we will be shifted in a big room with attached bathroom, this CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) will separate us from our parents,"" she said with a trembling voice.

""We do not know what may happen in the next second, I address these girls as 'Babu'(lovely daughter), every where people are talking about NRC, CAA but no one is aware what the act is about.., even I am not fully aware,"" said Jagat, a rickshaw puller.

At political front, Okhla people are with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for water, electricity and health facilities in their areas but in a larger frame, people residing in these areas have taken CAA as a fight of their existence in India.

Usmana , a student in Jamia said, ""Anti-CAA protest is beyond politics. Our protest is a peaceful. It is time to tell the masses, anti- CAA is not a fight of Muslims or any particular community. Why Tibetan, a few tribal communities are out of this act. We will not allow politicians to use anti-CAA protest to gain political benefits… it is unfortunate in our country, our friends Rambhakt Gopal and Kapil Gurjar are being used by group of people sitting in system, this is dangerous to radicalised youth, our hopes are strong although"" he said.

""We know people commuting between Delhi-Noida and vice-versa facing trouble and their complaints are legitimate... we are requesting authorities to open the other side, so that commuters can travel in their directions, but 50 days for women protesters was not easy,"" student added further.

Surprisingly, 500 children are participate in ongoing anti- CAA protest in the age bracket of 5-20. ""These children belong to home maker mothers while they keep their presence in the protest. Children are bound to join their mothers because they have a fear in mind that if they get locked in homes, their mothers will be shifted into detention centers,"" said another student.

""We teach these students - What good is in azadi if it is written on your 'Shroud', the young minds are talented and prayed for thousands of animals burned in 'Bushfire in Australia', these children are being involved in 2000 art works.. at the early age of their life, they are reading word to word of preamble and CAA Gazette,"" said a student in Jamia.

Few meters away from the university campus, at protest site where more than 500 sit-in claimed their equal right to stay in India however circulated video of Home Minister Amit Shah's parliamentary speech about to bring NRC has brought a fear in middle aged women.

""The biryani narrative is false, come here and sit with us, this is a fight for Gandhi, he is in you, he is in us ….the man, who was against the violence and we cannot let him killed again, the peaceful protest is humanizing us day by day"" said a protester.

Standing determined with anti- CAA protesters, these students engaging people to avoid communal activity which may add fuel to fire however anti- CAA stage is being used to deliver hate speeches by the war mongers.

""Makan eh Shukar hai… Allah k hathon main, agar hota Modi k hath main to kya hota (We are blessed as our fate is in God's hand if it would have in Modi's hand what would happened),"" a man shouted .

Relating selves with people who became pray in communal riots, another man recited a couplet; 'Ajjeb dard ka rishta hai, kahin kisi ka Makan jalta hai to apna sa lagta hai"".

Meanwhile, showing solidarity with anti-CAA protesters, a farmer association turned up at Shaheen Bagh.

Congress has fielded former Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) president and municipal councillor Neetu Verma Soin. Malviya Nagar Assembly constituency (AC) houses posh colonies such as Safdurjung Enclave, Hauz Khas, Geetanjli, Krishna Nagar and densely populated Hauz Rani and Begumpur colonies.

The major concern of the constituency is perennial traffic snarls and lack of adequate parking facilities. While, some residents of Malviya Nagar criticised the free bus ride for women, free electricity and water but a sizeable number of people, especially women supported the free schemes.

""The people who are criticizing free schemes are those who are rich enough to pay bills, have shelter and numerous plots that they even did not work and earn enough by renting their homes. But what about the poor people who live on rent and slums? Arvind Kejriwal has done good work and implemented schemes to benefit the backward people of Delhi,"" says Krishna, who manages a pottery shop in Hauz Rani area.

Sonam, a resident of Safdurjung Enclave, who is a housewife, said, ""I will vote on the basis of the work done in the city and welfare of the people. Till, 2013 we have only heard promises made by the politicians which remained a promise only but in the last five years we have seen many developmental works and safety schemes implemented in Delhi for women safety, education and in health sector. AAP's work is visible; they have fulfilled their promises unlike other political parties.""

Some of the shopkeepers who deal in handicrafts and artifacts market in Hauz Rani Area appeared confused. ""We are still confused whom to vote. Kejriwal gave us free water, electricity and bus ride and Modi has provided free gas cylinders,"" said Lado Devi, who owns a handicrafts shop.

""The major issues in the Malviya Nagar constituency are traffic jams, parking and encroachment of footpaths and platforms. There is hardly facility for pedestrians and never ending traffic jams are the biggest concern for the people living here,"" said Neha, a law professional.

""We the people have given chance to all the parties in the following years. This time AAP's work is visible on ground, although many more works is yet to be done but the people are happy and wants give them a second chance,"" said Mohammad Arman.

Meanwhile, an octogenarian voter Hari Raj Singh said, ""In the old age, one wants to visit pilgrimage and this has been fulfilled by AAP. We are requesting and writing letters to Centre for old age pension but have lost hope. At least AAP is providing free health schemes and mohalla clinics.""

There were voices that criticised AAP dispensation, ""AAP kept crying for the last four years blaming Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for stopping all its files but it suddenly implemented all the schemes such as free electricity, water and transport just four months before the elections. Why? Now BJP cleared all the files,"" said Dwarka, a resident of Malviya Nagar adding BJP will construct Ram Mandir, article 370 has been revoked and Triple Talaq has been removed, he said.

109,05-2-20,"‘Hindi cinema reflects Indian art, culture’","The vibrant world of Hindi cinema is considered a reflection of the art, culture and literature of India. Film personalities once decided that India’s glorious history and prospects must be outlined in every way around the world, so that India’s credibility can be established in the world and this responsibility was entrusted to IIFA.

In the new century 2000, the foundation of the award was laid in London, United Kingdom. The event was so successful that the whole of Britain in one voice called India ‘Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam’ and it was also the first film to receive the Best Film Award. Many countries expressed their interest in organizing IIFA with eagerness after the success of the London IIFA. The second award function was held in Sun City, Africa. Then Malaysia, Singapore, Netherlands, Dubai, Thailand, Macau, Sri Lanka, US, Spain, Thailand, ie country by country, India’s fame spread worldwide.

IIFA’s social concern

In view of the social and cultural concerns of the South Asian community living in Yorkshire, Britain, the Government of Britain invited IIFA again and in 2007, the exciting 3-day festival of IIFA in Sheffield, Yorkshire, brought a sense of harmony among the citizens once and for all. Not only this, Yorkshire’s identity and credibility was established throughout the world and it emerged as a major center of tourism for Britain. Even after this event, Indian cinema, festivals and culture are enthusiastically assimilated in Yorkshire till date.

Event with unlimited investment scope-IIFA

IIFA was organised in Singapore. The event overwhelmed Singapore. At the same time, Singapore felt that economic activity had increased during this event. It was then decided that a methodical study of the event would be conducted. The results of this study shocked Singapore. It was found that in the short term, many purchases were made in the markets during this period. The hotels did a great business. Tourists came in large numbers and the tourism sector grew by 30 percent. Also, for a long time there was a large investment in Singapore. After this study, Singapore again requested IIFA to organise the event and similarly many countries including Africa have repeatedly demanded to organise IIFA.

While the entire world has acknowledged the greatness of historians, litterateurs, artisans, artists, but still our state is struggling to establish its credibility. I want that now the identity of Madhya Pradesh is established in good context in the whole world. That is why I invited IIFA. I am grateful from the core of my heart that IIFA accepted our hospitality despite invitations from many countries and States, as IIFA shapes its organisation with governments only, whether it is from countries or states.

It is said that child is the father of man. As soon as the dates of IIFA’s event were announced in Madhya Pradesh, most of the hotels in Indore were booked. The market started preparing for its business. The tourist sites of the state have become active. Event management students are also keen on the event. IIFA will also give certificates to the participating students.

I, dedicate this IIFA Award programme to the tribal brethren of the state and the common citizens because this event will open the doors of prosperity for these people first. Let us all make the event a success. IIFA will prove to be the stepping stone for the progress of the State.

112,05-2-20,Cong calls AAP manifesto ‘pack of empty promises’,"The Delhi Congress called the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) manifesto yet another ""Khokhle Wadon Ka Tokra, Phir Se"" (pack of empty promises, yet again) as it was repeating virtually the same set of lies which AAP could not deliver in the past six years.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra asked what circumstances prevented the AAP from fulfilling promises it made despite having an absolute majority in the Assembly. Chopra said the AAP which came to power on the assurance to pass Jan Lokpal immediately but has it has not done it though six years have elapsed.

Commenting on its promise to appoint new ""safai karamcharis"", he said it was a big joke. ""The AAP Government did not regularise the contractual sanitation workers and also delayed their wages, resulted in repeated strike which left mounts of garbage on Delhi streets,"" he said.

""The AAP Government also did not streamline the utilization of garbage dumps and neither created innovative methods for its disposal. Many sanitation workers had died while cleaning sewers and instead of promising Rs 1 crore compensation to families of all those Safai Karamcharis who died while performing duty, the AAP Government should have ensured that not such death happen in future by modernizing the sewer cleaning, instead of sticking with the prevailing primitive ways,"" he added.

Chopra said that AAP was reiterating the old ""full Statehood for Delhi promise"" knowing very well that there were not many takers for this promise and AAP itself seemed to have abandoned it as none of the AAP leaders have raised it in the present Assembly election campaign.

""The AAP's promise to extend the metro network to 500km was a hoax as it could not even complete the third phase which is running three years behind schedule. While the fourth phase is clouded in uncertainty,"" he said.

Chopra said that it has become a big joke regarding the ""Yamuna Riverside Development"" and world class roads promises as the AAP should first clean up the toxic Yamuna and repair the broken roads before making such tall promises. ""The AAP in its manifesto had said that in association with the Central Government, it will regularize unauthorised colonies and give ownership rights to the people. This announcement is nothing but to mislead the people of unauthorised colonies as during its tenure, the AAP Government only traded charges and counter charges with the BJP Government on this issue.

""AAP is lying about giving legal protection to street vendors as it has failed to implement the Street Vendors Protection Act, passed by the Congress-led UPA Government at the Centre. When street vendors were being uprooted in Delhi, it was the Congress party which fought for their protection, while the AAP Government remained silent,"" he added.

DPCC spokesperson Anil Bhardwaj said that ""protection from sealing"" was yet another blatant lie of the AAP as when shops and industrial units were being sealed, AAP and BJP just watched as moot spectators rather than doing something to prevent the great injustice.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-calls-aap-manifesto----pack-of-empty-promises---.html

114,05-2-20,Harappa-linked Narela neglected by all,"Lack of connectivity and transport system, bad roads and water supply are the core issues which residents of Outer Delhi's Narela constituency are concerned about. Though the residents praised the works initiated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in their area but rued being on the outskirts of the national Capital, Narela is neglected by every Government and political parties.

Most of the localities in the constituency, touchings Haryana border, are rural and have villages Lampur, Mamurpur, Akbarpur Majra, Bakhtawarpur, Bakouli, Bankner, Bhorgarh, Budhpur, Ghoga, Hamidpur, Hiranki, Holambi Kalan, Holambi Khurd, Iradat Nagar, Jhangola, Jindpur, Khampur, Khera Kalan, Shahpur Garhi, Singhola, Singhu, Sungerpur, Tajpur Kalan and Tigipur.

One of the most famous Assembly constituency, Narela also have historic factors traced back to Harappa and Indus Valley Civilisation and its roots are also mentioned in the 'Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri', the autobiography of Mughal emperor Jahangir.

For 2020 elections, Narela has been declared as a 'general seat' open to any candidate. This time once again AAP has fielded Sharad Kumar, its sitting MLA, who is favourite among the residents, living in unauthorised colonies in the area, while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Neel Daman Khatri who have a stronghold among rural residents and belongs to Mamurpur village.

The congress which once had a vote bank of unauthorized residents and locals has brought Siddarth Kundu, who is also a local from Akbarpur Majra village and he is also well known among locals. The fight is the constituency is between BJP and AAP candidates. People are happy with AAP on their freebies but BJP has an advantage of the rural vote bank.

""The main issues which we face are traffic jams, narrow lanes, bad roads and a transport system which could connect the residents if Narela with Delhi,"" said Sajjan Kumar, a local resident in Narela.

""Some works have been done by AAP in the constituency. In some areas roads have been built and the free electricity is the main reason I will again vote for AAP candidate,"" said Suraj Bhan, a resident of Tajpur Kalan.

""Being on outskirts of Delhi, the area is quite disconnected with the entire Delhi as there is no proper Government transport system. For metro we have go to Samaypur Badli and its far and during works hours traffic chaos is a routine thing,"" said Mukesh Tushir, a resident of Mamurpur village.

""Though street light have been installed in the area but there are several blind spot in the area. When we go towards DDA road or DDA office, the lights are not working and there have been several crimes on that route during night hours,"" said Chander Singh, a resident of DDA flats in Narela.

""This time there is tough fight between AAP and BJP. Both are favourites of the residents and both have done developmental works during their tenure. Issues pertaining to electricity and water have been resolved by the AAP led Delhi government whereas some works are also done by BJP led Union Government, so public here have mix response over whom will they vote this time,"" said Ajeet, a proprietor in Narela.

The vote share of 96,143 scored by AAP's Sharad Kumar during the last assembly elections was the highest the constituency has ever seen while no other candidate could cross 56,000 votes before he set this record.

115,05-2-20,Shaheen Bagh shooter AAP man: Police,"Shaheen Bagh shooter Kapil Gujjar has reportedly admitted to the Delhi Police that he joined Aam Aadmi Party in early 2019. The police also claimed to have recovered around 10-12 photos of Kapil with several senior AAP leaders from his mobile phone. The revelation has been made by the Crime Branch of Delhi that is interrogating Kapil who had fired shots at Shaheen Bagh, earlier this week.

The AAP, however, said it will try to ascertain whether Kapil had any connection with the party. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said, ""There is no point in releasing such photographs. This is a part of BJP's dirty politics. Crime should be investigated and stern action should be taken against the culprit.""

Singh said that his party will also move the Election Commission seeking action against Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo for naming AAP in the matter. ""When elections are on cards, how can the DCP malign the name of any party,"" he added.

The disclosure by the police about Kapil’s alleged links with AAP comes just four days before the Assembly elections in Delhi, in which the 50-day protest at Shaheen Bagh against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act has become a key issue.

Late in the evening, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar criticised the AAP for allegedly playing ""politics of violence"" to ""divide"" the society. ""Now, it is clear that the person who fired was from AAP. They are creating tension in the city. They stand totally exposed.""

Mr Deo said that Kapil has revealed that his father Gaje Singh was also an AAP member and that both of them had joined the party in 2019. Kapil's father had earlier contested the MCD election in 2012 on a BSP ticket. In the photos, accessed from a phone by the police, Kapil can be seen with senior leaders of the party like Sanjay Singh and Aatishi along with his supporters . A senior police officer said that the Crime Branch has also told the court about Kapil his father’s connection with the AAP.

Kapil had fired two or three times in the air, standing near the spot where hundreds of women and children were sitting in Shaheen Bagh on February 1. A big crowd of unarmed men, women and children were standing nearby. Eyewitnesses said when his gun jammed, he tried to run but was caught. While being led away, he was heard saying: ""Humare desh mein sirf Hinduon ki chalegi aur kisi ki nahi (in our country only Hindus will prevail)."" He was later taken in police custody for two days for questioning.

Kapil's family, however, refuted the police's claim.

Kapil 's uncle Fatesh Singh said, ""I have no idea where these photographs are circulating from. My nephew Kapil had no association with any political party nor does any other member from the family is. My brother Gaje Singh, (Kapil's father) fought Assembly elections in 2008 for Bahujan Samaj Party and lost. After that no one from our family had any links with any political party"".",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shaheen-bagh-shooter-aap-man--police.html

The statement comes days after Thakur was banned from election campaigning due to his controversial remarks at a poll rally.

Thakur also accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia of backing the Shaheen Bagh protesters.

""When people of Delhi will cast their vote in favour of the lotus (BJP's poll symbol)...

118,05-2-20,Expeditiously decide Centre's plea against stay on convicts' execution: Nirbhaya's parents to HC,"Nirbhaya's parents urged the Delhi High Court on Tuesday to expeditiously decide the Centre's plea challenging stay on execution of the four convicts in the case of their daughter's gang rape and murder.

Advocate Jitendra Jha, representing the parents of Nirbhaya, given name of the victim, said he mentioned the matter before the court for early disposal of the government's plea.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, who had on February 2 reserved order on the Centre's plea after holding special hearing on Saturday and Sunday, said the decision would be passed at the earliest.

The trial court on January 17 issued black warrants for the second time for the execution of all the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) -- in Tihar jail at 6 am on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

On January 31 the court again stayed the execution as the counsel for three convicts -- Pawan, Vinay and Akshay -- urged it to adjourn the matter ""sine die"" saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.

While the mercy pleas of Mukesh and Vinay have been rejected by the President, Pawan has not yet filed it. Akshay's mercy plea was filed on February 1 and is pending.

The Centre and Delhi Government challenged the trial court's order staying the execution.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing them, had contended that it was a deliberate and calculated design of the convicts to ""frustrate mandate of law"" by getting their execution delayed and they were not entitled to any more time.

The counsel for the convicts opposed the plea saying it was not maintainable and that the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court and while the government was accusing the convict of delay, it has woken up only now.

Nirbhaya, 23-year-old paramedic student, was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 in Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The top court, in its 2017 verdict, had upheld the capital punishment awarded to the convicts by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/expeditiously-decide-centre-s-plea-against-stay--on-convicts--execution--nirbhaya-s-parents-to-hc.html

“The swab samples of the suspect was sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and the findings reached us today indicatoing to be negative to coronavirus. Earlier four samples had tested negative for the virus” said Director of Medical Education Training (DMET) Prof CBK Mohanty on Tuesday.

The move came after the CBI received sanction from the Karnataka Government to proceed with its investigation into the alleged role of 1998-batch IPS officer Nimbalkar, then posted as the Inspector General (CID-EOW), and 2008-batch IPS officer Hilori, then posted as the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru East.

Besides these two IPS officers, the agency has named the then Inspector M Ramesh

and Sub-Inspector Gowri Shankar, both posted at the Commercial Street police station in Bengaluru and Deputy Superintendant of

Police (CID-EOW) EB Sridhara. Others named as accused in the case include the company, IMA, its founder Mansoor Khan and three

of its other directors-Nizamuddin, Vaseem and Arshad Khan.

The agency had approached the State Government, seeking permission to proceed against the two IPS officers, who were in senior positions in the Karnataka police, and had allegedly helped Khan in continuing his dubious enterprise without taking requisite action as per law, officials said.

The CBI has alleged that since 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) repeatedly raised red flags on the activities of the IMA group, which was allegedly raising illegal deposits from investors promising lucrative returns in the name of Islamic banking practices.

Ramesh had also received a reference in this regard through the DCP, Bengaluru East, but did not conduct a proper enquiry and closed the case on August 29, 2016, the agency has alleged in its FIR.

In his comments on closing the reference, Ramesh had mentioned that the company was operating within the rules and there were no deviations. He had also said that he could not take any action against the company under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment (KPID) Act, 2004 in the absence of a complaint from any depositor, the FIR says.

The probe report by Ramesh was rejected by the RBI and the DCP was asked to re-look into the matter, but he closed the reference just before his transfer, saying it was dealt with by the CID-EOW, the CBI has alleged.

Subsequently, complaints were also made against the company and the Karnataka Principal Secretary (Revenue) had also asked the police to probe the case, but Inspector Ramesh, Sub-Inspector Gowri Shankar and Hilori did not take any action, alleges the FIR.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi--books-ips-officers--others.html

It will usher in an era of peace in the North East which has suffered decades of bloodshed and violence, he said, adding that his Govt has also curbed naxalism and boosted development in areas hit by the extremist Left violence.

The North East States used to see frequent blockades and 'bandh' that would bring life to a standstill for days but things have now changed for the better, Modi said.

Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Sanjay Singh(AAP) said despite punishment awarded to the convicts, their hanging was postponed.

While calling for implementation of the judgment at the earliest, Naidu also said people are agitated and concerned over the delay adding those in the system must fulfil their responsibilities.

Naidu said the convicts were given all legal opportunities and when they were exhausted, the convicts managed to get reprieve on some pretext or the other.

124,05-2-20,"21 public issues raised in RS amid din, TMC walkout","Even as the Opposition including the Congress and Trinamool Congress(TMC) raised a din in the Rajya Sabha in the morning session on Tuesday, the House functioned with as many as 21 issues of public importance raised. Raising slogans for most part of the Zero Hour, the TMC later staged a walkout.

The Opposition parties were protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) and had not allowed the House to function on Monday.

Elders from different parties on Tuesday including the Congress, meanwhile, highlighted issues like the spread of coronavirus, onion exports, Nirbhaya rape case, and locust attack on crops in some states in the pandemonium.

Noisy scenes began as soon as the House commenced proceedings and Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur rose to lay the paper listed against his name.

The moment his name was called, some opposition members started shouting slogans against him. The EC recently barred Thakur from campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections in the wake of a controversial remark made by him at a poll rally.

Soon after Chairman Naidu dismissed notices from several opposition members to suspend routine business of the day and take up issue of CAA, TMC MP Derek O'Brien insisted that his notice should be taken up. Naidu said matter could be discussed during the debate on Motion of thanks on the President's address which had mentioned CAA.

The TMC members, however, did not oblige and some of them trooped into the well of the House raising slogans like 'Goli Marna Band Karo.'

Soon, the Congress MPs also joined them in the well and raised a din.

Despite the din, the Chairman continued with Zero Hour proceedings. While opposition members stopped shouting slogans when MPs from Congress, AAP and DMK were raising their points, they again shouted slogans when MPs from ruling party or its ally stood up to speak. Some ruling party members as well as YSRCP MP V Vijyasai Reddy too objected to the selective protests by TMC and Congress.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/21-public-issues-raised-in-rs-amid-din--tmc-walkout.html

130,05-2-20,Anti-party steps: JVM showcauses MLA Pradeep,"The plot of former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi’s party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) merger with BJP is final and is gaining pace day-by-day. After the dismissal of Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey from party, the JVM on Tuesday issued showcause notice to its other MLA Pradeep Yadav, who is legislator from Poraiyahat in Sathal Pargana.

Yadav has been issued show cause notice for his “anti party activities”.

The show cause notice has been served to Yadav by party’s general secretary Abhay Kumar Singh.

The single page notice issued by Singh mentions that for past few days Yadav has been giving statements, which is against party’s ideology. Yadav toeing the line of other opposition leaders against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), and National Register of Citizens (NRC) too has been questioned by party high command.

Yadav’s visit to New Delhi where he had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi along with Bandhu Tirkey too has been found unsavory with JVM leadership.

A senior JVM leader requesting anonymity said, “The countdown for JVM’s merger with BJP is almost certain and final.

JVM chief Babulal Marandi is removing one by one leader who is opposed to merger plan.” Sources said that as JVM chief doesn’t want any legal wrath in JVM merger with BJP, he is moving slowly in the direction.

Sources said that Marandi became interested to join BJP after he came to know that two of these MLAs (Yadav and Tirkey) were planning to join Congress.

Both Yadav and Tirkey have openly opposed the merger of JVM with BJP. In the new working committee constituted by party last month Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey found place in 151 member working committee, but they have been not assigned any important post such as vice presidents, principal general secretary or general secretaries. In the last dissolved working committee Pradeep Yadav the Poreyahat MLA was principal general secretary.

Yadav, not being assigned any important posts indicates growing differences between him and party chief Babulal Marandi. Both Pradeep Yadav and Babulal Marandi had RSS background. In 2000 when the separate State was carved out of Bihar with Babulal Marandi becoming first chief minister, Yadav was in Marandi’s Cabinet. Yadav, who has been representing Poreyahat for around two decades, left BJP in 2006 when Marandi formed his own party JVM (P).

Sources said that it will be win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anti-party-steps--jvm-showcauses-mla-pradeep.html
131,05-2-20,BJP now realising power of democracy: Soren,"Jharkhand Mukti Morcha Executive president cum Chief Minister Hemant Soren today said that it is unfortunate for the country to have government at the Centre that does not believe in the values of democracy and Constitution. Addressing a huge gathering at Dhanbad on the occasion of JMM’s 41st Foundation Day of JMM, Soren flayed the BJP for playing divisive politics in the country.

“It is a misfortune for the country to have a (BJP) government at the Centre that do not believe in democracy and Constitution. They are making their own democracy and Constitution. They are making laws and trying to impose it on people with the power of bullets, lathis and protests. We have to give them a befitting reply through social means,” he said.

“The BJP must have understood the power of democracy now. They have this tradition of dividing Hindu-Muslims and make communities fight with each other.

The whole world admires our unity in diversity. The Constitution has given us rights, which need to the strengthened,” said the JMM executive president.

Soren said that the people of the State are forwarding step by step to save the Constitution.

“They have made ridiculous laws and rules. Now, companies across the nation are being sold including Railways, BSNL and LIC. Privatisation of the public sector firms will mean no reservation in jobs for people. But, we are ahead of them.

No reservation then no coal, no reservation then no iron, no reservation then not an inch of land to anyone,” he thundered.

Remembering Jharkhand Movement leaders, Soren greeted Dishom Guru Shibu Soren and other prominent leaders present on the occasion and said that the JMM has been fighting for the interest of the people of the land for over 50 years. “In last 50 years JMM has been fighting for the people of the State.

And, even after we got a separate State, in 19 years of Jharkhand’s history the dreams and aspirations of people remained unfulfilled. We got the State but not our rights. We were politically feeble and people who oppressed us for centuries continued manipulating us. Gradually, our political conscience woke up and we triumphed over BJP,” he said.

“This is your government. I am not the CM; every person of the State is CM. We are just a means to make the rights of people reach them. The former government has pushed the State back in every field. No one is happy.

Law and order situation is devastating. The treasury is empty. They have looted the State so much that even giving salaries has become a daunting task,” he said.

“All government schemes that are run in the State are funded by you. It is your right. Even DCs and SPs get salaries from the tax that you pay. We will ensure that the first right on State’s treasury will be of the people of State,” said the CM.

Soren said that GST has affected the State most. “The Centre has kept all the options with it and the State is cheated. We will fill the stomach of people of Jharkhand first then only others can get their pie,” he said.

The CM reiterated party’s poll promise on the occasion to provide employment to all and said that in the coming State Budget girl children on the State will get free education.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-now-realising-power-of-democracy--soren.html

Bhagwat is staying in Bhopal to review various RSS activities till February 6.

Rejecting RSS’ claims of being a non-political and cultural organisation, Govind Singh here said that he has been listening for five decades that RSS is not linked to politics in any way.

They repeated the same statement in 1977 when the Janta Party came to power in New Delhi claiming that their organisation only aimed at service activities, added Singh.

Alleging that RSS claims have now been exposed, Dr Singh said, “Mohan Bhagwat nowadays appoints Chief Minister and governors and his senior colleagues get people appointed as members in Public Service Commissions in states wherever the BJP is in power.”

The Minister also slammed the BJP saying the party has almost similar ideology as that of Hitler adding both have reservations to democracy and this is the reason the BJP is going for anti-people decisions of late, he said.

“I wish to know from Bhagwat ji from where the RSS and affiliate organisations secured possession of properties running into thousands of crores after the BJP came to power at the Centre,” stated Singh.

“Why we never spot RSS workers busy in building anything of public importance like a dam,” asked the minister.

Immediately after the House convened at noon after the proceedings were adjourned till 1200 hrs following uproar by Opposition members over Hegde's remarks, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the BJP leader has ""insulted"" Mahatma Gandhi, who is respected by people across the globe.

Chowdhury then made a remark against Hegde, which Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said would not go on record.

The Congress leader said country-wide protests against CAA and NRC were peaceful on the Gandhian line.

Opposition members including Congress MPs jumped into the well displaying placards and shouting slogans.

Despite requests by the speaker, opposition members did not stop sloganeering and later Congress members walked out of the House.

Chowdhury also said that they were expecting a response from Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi on the controversial remarks but they are ""helping"" people who hate Mahatma Gandhi.

""I have no expectations from people who are doing Godse politics,"" he said.

Mostly members from the Congress, DMK and NCP sought to raise the issue of Hegde's remarks but the Speaker did not allow them.

137,05-2-20,PM can sell Taj Mahal like PSUs: Rahul,"The Congress on Tuesday fielded its top guns, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for campaigning in Delhi, with the former party president saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could ""sell the Taj Mahal"", the way he was selling the PSUs.

While the former Congress president addressed two poll rallies in Jangpura and Sangam Vihar, his sister and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi joined him in his second rally where they launched scathing attacks on Modi and the BJP, besides Arvind Kejriwal and AAP, for ""spreading hatred"" and doing nothing to provide jobs.

This is the first time in the Delhi poll campaign that top Congress leadership came out to campaign for their candidates. On Monday, only Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh addressed election rallies.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said it was a ""matter of shame"" that despite being educated, youths had to run around for jobs and asserted that ""solid steps"" would be taken to deal with unemployment if the Congress came to power in Delhi.

Addressing Congress supporters at a poll meeting in Tilak Nagar, he said, ""I don't want to condemn any party on this occasion.""

""I want to highlight some of the issues which are bothering the youth today. Even after eduction, and spending so much money on it, they have to run around for jobs. It is a matter of shame,"" he said.

Singh, a noted economist, also said that unemployment rate in Delhi in the last four months was 15 per cent, much higher than elsewhere.

""The Congress is committed to the people and solid steps will be taken to deal with the unemployment issue if the Congress comes to power. Our major thrust will be on employment,"" he said.

Accusing the BJP and the AAP of spreading hatred in society, Rahul Gandhi said Modi and Kejriwal were not interested in providing jobs to youngsters, but were keen on making one Indian fight another for staying in power.

Addressing his first rally ahead of the polls, he said the current environment in the country, the hatred, the violence and the attacks on women were harming India and people were not benefitting from it.

He hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not addressing the economic slowdown and the issue of unemployment, but instead, encouraging violence.

""They (BJP) talk about the Hindu dharma, they talk about Islam, they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism where is it written that attack other people, suppress them,"" he asked.

What kind of ""Hindu dharma"" is of Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) because Hinduism talked about taking everyone along, Rahul Gandhi said at the rally organised to garner support for the Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Marwah.

""The person who makes 'deshbhakts' (patriots) fight among each other, can he be a deshbhakt,"" Gandhi asked the crowd.

Referring to coronavirus, he said the countries manufacturing in China were looking at India for taking on the mantle of a leading manufacturer.

""The whole world, except China, wants to invest in India. But when they look at India now, they see hatred, violence, rapes, goondaism, killings. Wherever you see in the last five years, one Indian talks to another Indian with hatred. This is not our history. This is a country of love,"" Rahul Gandhi said.

He accused the government of selling state enterprises such as Indian Oil, Air India, Hindustan Petroleum and the railways as well as the Red Fort.

""He (Modi) may even sell the Taj Mahal,"" the former Congress chief said.

Training his guns on Kejriwal, he alleged that Modi and Kejriwal could only think about power and said, ""They can announce anything in two minutes to stay in power.""

138,05-2-20,Electrifying Changes for MP Power Sector,"In a bid to provide affordable and uninterrupted power supply to industrial, agricultural and domestic consumers , the Kamal Nath Government is working towards reducing transmission losses and upgrading power production facilities in Madhya Pradesh.

The State Government, helmed by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, is committed to providing 10 hours of electricity to farmers while the target for domestic consumers is set for uninterrupted round-the-clock supply.

According to officials at the Energy Department in the State Capital, a slew of measures is underway to ensure the development of the power sector into a financially viable self-reliant unit providing affordable electricity across the consumer spectrum.

Listing out measures, the officials say both Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Energy Minister Priyavrat Singh have been instrumental in expanding the policy framework with a vision to facilitate the upgrade of production and transmission facilities.

A power deficit state, Madhya Pradesh faces a range of challenges that require attention and action on a war footing. While the establishment of new generation facilities is pertinent for the long term, the upgradation of existing production facilities and transmission infrastructure is crucial for the everyday supply of power in the state.

With the state requisitioning power to feed its ever-burgeoning supply needs, the state government has effected some astute policy reengineering and budgetary planning and allocations to ensure that affordable power is made available to all.

Rising to the challenge the State Government has given its assent to the requisition of 2,640 megawatt of electricity to fulfill the long-term supply needs.

The Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company (MPPGCL), the power generation arm of the State Government, has earned requisite approvals of nearly Rs 1,715 crore as part amount or loan from the State Government for its various projects. Another Rs 2,552.9 crores have been approved for existing and under construction power projects.

Amid attempts to strengthen transmission, the Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company, the transmission arm for the western region in the State, has been entrusted with the approvals for a guarantee of a loan bid of Rs 1,200 crore. The State Government has also agreed to extend guarantee to its wholly-owned transmission arms for a loan of Rs 2,900 crore from the Power Finance Corporation (PFC).

Credit facilities have also been provided to MPPGCL and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company (MPPMCL) for a total of Rs 2,200 crore.

In keeping with efforts to minimise transmission snags the department of energy has laid down norms for time-efficient correction and replacement of faulty or burnt out transformers. All efforts are underway to ensure a reduction in the incidents of tripping.

Norms for safe and technically advanced maintenance measures have been put in place while stringent checks are being conducted to ensure the quality consumables and power supply hardware received from private vendors.

Consumer-friendly measures have been launched to ensure the timely redressal of grievances and steps are being taken to improve the various aspects of domestic supply, metering, billing and collection processes.

Household connections relying on agricultural feeders are being provided single phase electricity starting 6pm.

Measures are being taken to provide neighbourhood and doorstep services to consumers across the state, department employees are also being imparted with training to help upgrade their skills with a special emphasis on safety.

Officials say every aspect of the sector, be it technical or commercial, is being studied with a view to bring a quality change to each micro process which would in-turn contribute to better performance of both men and materials involved in the production, distribution and supply of power.

A raft of power welfare schemes has also been launched by the Government (see box).

With Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Energy Minister Priyavrat Singh leading the charge, an electrifying change seems to be in the offing for Madhya Pradesh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/electrifying-changes-for-mp-power-sector.html
139,05-2-20,"Cong, AAP giving moral support to Shaheen Bagh: BJP","The Motion of Thanks on President’s address saw exchange of bitter accusations and allegations between the ruling the treasury and Opposition benches of Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

Hitting out at the Congress and the Aam Adami Party (AAP) for giving “moral support” to Shaheen Bagh stir, the ruling BJP said that young minds were “poisoned through hate-filled speeches” in the name of freedom of expression during anti-CAA protests, while Congress said the Government has created these “destructive” issues to divert attention from key challenges like economic slowdown, farm distress and unemployment.

Initiating the debate on Motion of Thanks on President’s address in the Upper House, senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav also lauded the Government for multiple initiatives to take India ahead globally while being rooted to its values whether on digital front, agriculture, health or national security.

Yadav said “Congress and AAP are giving moral support” to the agitation and the “minds of small children are being poisoned”.

Yadav quoted a statement by Trinamool MP Derek ‘O Brien on how his relatives who went to Pakistan had to migrate and how those who came to India prospered. “We have got the citizenship law so that O’Briens remain O’Briens and are not forced to convert to other religions,” Yadav said.

Participating in the debate, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad expressed the hope that the government would soon realise its “mistake” of bifurcating Jammu & Kashmir into two union territories and bring a bill in this session to restore its statehood. He was of the view that had the Government brought constructive proposals, the opposition would have supported them all through.

“Triple Talaq, CAA, NPR issues are being talked about by you to divert attention on key issues of unemployment, black money, slow GDP growth. Your ideas or proposals are not constructive but destructive,” Azad said.

Responding to BJP’s allegations, Azad retorted: “Shaheen Bagh is your creation. You want to run the government, and at the same time play role of Opposition and come down on streets also to protest against all issues.”

He held the Government responsible for not holding of discussions on issues like GDP growth slowdown, rising inflation and recent hike in levies on products like refrigerator, TV, AC, medical equipment, automobiles, tyres etc.

He said that the Government cannot keep on abusing neighbouring countries and needs to modernise the defence.

Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray accused the Government of hiding the real picture of the economy and criticised its disinvestment policy, saying it is on a mission of “beecho (sell) India”.

The Government is selling PSUs along with LIC, which are properties of the people and steps are being taken without inviting any suggestions from policy makers and employees unions, he said while participating in the debate on Motion of Thanks on President's address in Rajya Sabha.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong--aap-giving-moral-support-to-shaheen-bagh--bjp.html

A Bench comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari posted the matter for hearing in April after Zakia’s counsel sought an adjournment and urged the court to post it after the Holi vacation.

The victim woman, who was initially rushed to a Primary Health Centre at Hinganghat and later shifted to the specialized Orange City Hospital & Research Institute (OCHRI) at Nagpur after her Oxygen levels went down in her blood, is currently on a ventilator. Doctors attending on her at OCHRI described her condition as “very critical”.

The victim woman suffered nearly 40 per cent burns after the accused Vicki Nagrale (27) -- who was laying in wait for her near college at Hinganghat – took out petrol from his two-wheeler and poured it on her and set heron fire, at around 7.30 am on Monday. After she shrieked for her, the bystanders doused the burning victim woman with water and extinguished the fire. By then, she had been badly burnt.

“The woman has suffered deep burns on her face, scalp, neck, right shoulder, left hand, upper back, eyes and respiratory system. She has suffered 35 to 40 per cent Grade III deep dermal burns with respiratory distress and inhalational injuries with related complications,” OCHRI Director Anup Marar said.

The victim woman underwent a tracheostomy, debridement, escharectomy and burns dressing on Monday. “She is very critical. She is holding onto her vital parameters with intensive care and oxygen support of five litres per minute. Next 72 hours are very crucial for her. It is only after that will be able to speak in certain terms about her health. Our expert doctors are monitoring her condition,” Dr Marar said.

In a related development, thousands of people — including women, school children and senior citizens —took out a morcha to local revenue authorities’ office at Wardha on Tuesday morning to demand that the accused be hanged forthwith. Leaders of all political parties had joined the protest.

“The man, who burnt my daughter and reduced her to such an unbearable state she is in today, should be burnt alive. He should undergo the agony that my daughter is currently undergoing,” the victim woman’s mother said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/badly-burnt-victim-critical--hinganghat-erupts-in-anger.html

143,05-2-20,4 States still deprived of Ayushman Bharat Yojana,"With four States including Delhi, West Bengal, Odisha and Telangana not yet implementing the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the Government on Tuesday said in the Rajya Sabha this has deprived the poor from deriving benefits of comprehensive healthcare facilities.

Giving this information, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said he had personally talked to the Chief Ministers of the concerned States and urged them to implement the scheme for the larger good of the needy. He also clarified that the Central Government can only ""humbly"" request the State Governments when some MPs said if any action can be taken against States like Delhi.

""Our Government has requested these States and I have written and urged the Chief Ministers and Health Ministers of these States, after meeting them personally, to implement the scheme, as the poor in States like Delhi are bereft of benefits of the healthcare Ayushman scheme.

""We will keep on insisting. We again appeal to these four States to join the scheme in the larger interest of healthcare. This will also help reduce their burden as the Central Government shares the burden with State Governments in the scheme,"" he said.

Fielding questions of this issue during the Question Hour, the Minister also said there was no such proposal at present to implement the scheme through the municipal bodies. In fact, the Govt cannot bypass the State Government, he said adding ""We can check whether it is technically possible,"" he said.

While the Aam Aadmi Party has its Government in Delhi, the BJP is in power in the MCD in Delhi. The three other States which have not yet joined the scheme are also non-BJP ruled States.

The Minister also informed the House that the Government is also using technology, including artificial intelligence, to detect fraud or negligence in various hospitals.

Vardhan said as per the 2011 list, there are a total of 10.74 crore families who are potential beneficiaries under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and the allocation of funds has been done on the basis of number of beneficiaries in each state. At present, more than 80 lakh people have availed of the benefit.

He also assured the members that the Govt will not compromise the interest of patients while handing over district Govt hospitals to private medical colleges through public-private partnership mode. Such experiments have successfully been implemented in the last 25 years and even government think-tank Niti Aayog has taken note of this and come out with draft guidelines, he said during the Question Hour.

Responding to a separate query on dialysis for poor patients, the Minister said dialysis services are provided at district hospitals for management of chronic kidney diseases under the Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP).ialysis services under PMNDP are provided free of cost to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/4-states-still-deprived-of-ayushman-bharat-yojana.html
144,05-2-20,Mamata hits out at BJP,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday hit out at BJP leaders for their recent ""goli vs boli"" remark during campaigns for the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi and said that the saffron party was firing bullets because it is aware that it will lose the poll.

She said that a country has a bleak future when its leaders take to the streets holding guns.

Hitting out at the saffron party from speeches at the border towns of Bongaon and Ranaghat Banerjee said a country slips into anarchy for sure where its leaders openly sponsor gun culture.

“What can lie ahead of a country where the Ministers come openly on the streets askingtheir supporters to take up guns and shoot their opponents?” the ChiefMinister said wondering if the trend continued they “I don’t know whatlies ahead of us.”

Predicting a sure loss for the BJP in the coming Assembly elections inDelhi, Banerjee said “as they are expecting a defeat in Delhi elections they are sending their cadres to the streets with guns. They are saying that ‘boli nahin chalega. Goli chalega (gun and notdialogue will rule the roost) … but truth to be told it is only ‘boli’(talks) and not ‘goli’ (bullets) that will finally hold the ground.”

Apparently referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who calls himselfa Chowkidar (watchman of the country) said “she looks after the peopleof her State throughout the year unlike those who call themselveschowkidar and surfaces before the people only during the elections.”

She said that she would never side with those who spread hatred forpolitical gains. “I don't belong to a group that spreads hatred amongmasses. It is due to instigation by the BJP leaders, that theincidents of firing took place near Shaheen Bagh and Jamia,” Banerjeesaid adding the BJP was dividing the masses and terrorizing them towin elections.

Speaking on the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act Banerjee askedthe people not to show their documents and defeat the very purpose ofthe Act.

“The CAA is an instrument to divide the society. But I ask you not toshow your documents… remember that the CAA won't grant youcitizenship. Rather it will turn you into a foreigner… They are seeking information about three generations who lived before you. Whowill be able to provide such information? And if you cannot do thatyou will be called a foreigner. So don’t believe in them and don’tshow your documents.” Banerjee added.

Meanwhile, for the first time the legal fraternity on Tuesday took outa big rally in Kolkata condemning the CAA and National Register forCitizens.

Alleging that the BJP was trying to forcibly implement the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), the National Register of Citizens(NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), Mamata said these steps are like ""black magic"" and she would stop this ""anyhow"".

""The NPR, NRC and CAA are like black magic"", she said, and urged the people of the country to unite to save the nation.

""We (TMC) are not a party of Dushasanas like the BJP. They are the offsprings of Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq and people must unite to save the country from them,"" Banerjee said while speaking at a public rally at Ranaghat in Nadia district.

Dussasana is the the brother of Kaurava prince Duryodhana in the 'Mahabharata' while Muhammad-bin-Tughlaq"" was the Sultan of Delhi from 1325-1351 and known for his eccentric decisions.

146,05-2-20,Resentment brews in Tamil Nadu BJP,"nTamil Nadu BJP is on the verge of an explosion as senior leaders are speaking of a massive exodus from the party. Things have reached a point of no return and the national leadership has summoned some of the senior leaders like SV Sekhar to New Delhi for consultations.

Pon Radhakrishnan, former Union Minister of State for Surface Transport who lost his seat from Kanyakumari in the April 2019 election and his followers are being portrayed as the villains by senior leaders who have been with the BJP since the day it was formed.

What brought things to an explosive level is the admission of Sasikala Pushpa Ramaswamy, the sensational and controversial AIADMK member of parliament to the BJP. Sasikala Pushpa, who has been ousted from the AIADMK by no less a person than former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for bringing disrepute to that party is being seen in Tamil Nadu politics as an untouchable entity for her personal life about which the yellow press in the State had a field day during 2015 and 2016.

The MP was in the news in 2018 when she divorced Lingeswaran, her husband for 24 years and married Ramaswamy, another controversial person. “It seems Tamil Nadu BJP has become a haven for item girls of Tamil cinemas and other political parties,” said Uma Anandhan, a senior leader in Tamil Nadu BJP. Though she refused to elaborate further , it was possible that she was referring to Namita, a popular item dance actress in Tamil films, joining the BJP.

Though many leaders declined to come out and react to the latest developments, political commentators like Govindarajan Satyamurty and Sam Rajappa were of the view that Tamil Nadu’s rendezvous with a Third alternative may take some more time.

“There was a time in 2014 when people were of the view that the BJP may emerge as an alternative to the AIADMK and the DMK. Not any more. With people like Pon Radhakrishnan at the helm of affairs, it is sure that BJP would not make any impact in Tamil Nadu politics,” said Satyamurthy.

It is alleged by a section of the leadership that Pon Radhakrishnan and P Muraleedhar Rao (the central observer ) are responsible for the present state of affairs. “Rao’s infatuation with the glittering stars of Kodambakkam has damaged the prospectus of the BJP,” said a senior leader.

Uma was blunt in her statement: “If they feel that the BJP in Tamil Nadu could be run only by leaders from other parties so be it. We will look out for other alternatives,” she said.

Though the BJP is weak in Tamil Nadu, there has been no dearth of groupism in the party. Recently , a woman involved in a murder case was admitted to the party-based on the recommendation made by the mining baron of south India.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/resentment-brews-in-tamil-nadu-bjp.html
147,05-2-20,"25 held, mastermind go underground","nTwenty-five people have been arrested till Tuesday evening from various districts of Tamil Nadu in connection with irregularities and fraudulent means deployed in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission Recruitment Examination held in 2017 for selecting candidates to various Government departments.

Those arrested include persons who were working as assistants in the departments of Home and Registration. The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission scam which came out in the open last month has been designated as the State’s own Vyapam with apprehensions that crores of rupees have been exchanged hands to clear the TNPSC examination for appointment in Government departments.

The investigation and arrests are the fall out of the TNPSC which handed over the probe to the Crime Branch -CID of Tamil Nadu Police early this month following social media posts about widespread corruption and malpractices in the recruitment examination held by the agency.

The Crime Branch wing of Tamil Nadu Police is in the look out for S Jayakumar, believed to be the kingpin behind the scam. Candidates seeking employment in Government services approach Jayakumar who directs them to which examination centre to choose and how to fill up the answer sheets.

“The candidates are told to attempt the questions only if they were fully confident of the answer or to leave the answer sheets blank otherwise ,” said a police official in the team probing the scam.

He said the answer sheets are tampered with while they are taken back to the TNPSC and the Crime Branch have collected documentary evidences of such illegal activities. “Amount ranging from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 15 lakh has been collected from each candidate appearing for the Group II examination and they get posting in the departments of registration and revenue. No wonder, our revenue and registration offices are beehives of corruption,” said the official . What is surprising is that those arrested include a policeman who paid money to the scamsters to get his wife a job as an assistant in the revenue department.

The police has arrested most of the persons who were working as agents of Jayakumar, the master brain. Jayakumar has been operating with impunity and is allegedly close to many senior officials in the Government departments. He has been absconding and a manhunt is on to nab him. On Tuesday, the police got all his bank accounts frozen. “Since he is not using mobile phones or otjher digital means, we are finding it tough to locate his hide out but we are sure he would be nabbed in days to come,” said the Crime Brach official.

A similar investigation was on into the recruitment drive by TNPSC for selecting last grade employees to Government offices.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/25-held--mastermind--go-underground.html

Beniwal said that massive damage of crops have been done by these locust in Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan. ""The issue was raised at the all party meeting and NDA meeting in this regard. He has also raised the matter with PM Modi,"" Beniwal said.

Replying to Beniwal, Minister of State Arjun Meghwal assured that a central team has been formed to assess the damage of crops. He assured that compensation will be given to farmers after the assessment of crops damage.

The activists owing allegiance to the Akhila Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS), who have been holding peaceful protests at Wadavli since January 23, upped the ante on Tuesday, after the police detained some of their leaders, including ABKS’ Raigad district president Ramchandra Mahtre and the chief of the NMIA project-affected action committee Anil Patil.

The walk-out will take place at all offices of the insurance behemoth across the country.

In the Union Budget announced on Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government, which holds 100 per cent stake in LIC, will sell a part of its holding through an initial public offering (IPO).

“As an immediate reaction to the proposal to list LIC, All India LIC Employees Federation will hold one-hour walk-out strike on February 4,” the union said in a statement.

Listing of LIC is against national interest as over the years it has been playing a pivotal role in nation building activities, it said.

On a capital base of Rs 5 crore, the union said LIC’s valuation surplus was Rs 53,211.91 crore, life fund stood at Rs 28.28 lakh crore and asset under management over Rs 31.11 lakh crore at the end of FY19.

“Being one of the biggest financial institutions of the country, any move to privatise LIC will shake the confidence of the common man and will be an affront to our financial sovereignty. The very purpose of LIC to provide insurance coverage to socially and economically backward class at a reasonable cost will be defeated and motto will change from service to profit,” the statement said.

Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said the listing of LIC will help bring in greater transparency, public participation and also deepen the equity market.

“Government came out with the idea (LIC listing). The details will follow and it will be in the interest of LIC and its policyholders. Interest of LIC and policyholders will be safeguarded,” Thakur recently told PTI.

The move will help boost confidence of people in the banking system which has been shaken after a scam last year in Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) which affected lakhs of customers.

At present, bank depositors get an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh on their amount by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) if a bank fails.

“Work has begun on Budget announcement. Department of Financial Services has given approval for raising deposit insurance cover from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The change is being done after a gap of 27 years,” Kumar said in a tweet.

Accordingly, he said, the banks will pay a premium of 12 paise against 10 paise per Rs 100 deposited.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech on Saturday said a robust mechanism is in place to monitor the health of all scheduled commercial banks and that depositors’ money is safe. “Further, DICGC has been permitted to increase Deposit Insurance Coverage for a depositor, which is now Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per depositor,” she had said.

DICGC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, provides insurance cover on bank deposits. The deposit insurance scheme covers all banks operating in India including private sector, cooperative and even branches of foreign banks. There are some exemptions like deposits of foreign governments, deposits of central/state governments and inter-bank deposits.

Deposit insurance was static at Rs 1 lakh since 1993.

159,05-2-20,BJP leader seeks urgent hearing,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked a Delhi BJP leader to approach its mentioning officer for urgent listing of his plea seeking removal of hundreds of anti-citizenship law protestors occupying a stretch of road in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was urged by lawyer Shashank Deo Sudhi, appearing for BJP leader Nand Kishore Garg, that the plea be listed for an urgent hearing considering the difficulty faced by residents due to the nearly-two-month-long protest on a road connecting Delhi and Noida.

“You go to the mentioning officer,” said the bench which also comprised Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant.

Later during the day, the lawyer mentioned the matter before the mentioning officer who assured urgent listing of the PIL, provided defects are cured.

The plea also said that various other arterial roads of Delhi have been facing traffic congestion due the protest at Shaheen Bagh.

Restrictions have been imposed on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and Okhla underpass since December 15, when hundreds of women sat on a protest against the amended law.

Saying that the law enforcement machinery has been “held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters,” the plea has sought laying down of guidelines for protests leading to obstruction of public place.

“It is disappointing that the state machinery is muted and silent spectator at hooliganism and vandalism of the protesters who are threatening the existential efficacy of the democracy and the rule of law and had already taken the law and order situation in their own hand,” said the plea.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-leader-seeks-urgent-hearing.html
160,05-2-20,DefExpo to open today,"India’s biennial DefExpo will kickstart in Lucknow on Wednesday with the aim to showcase the potential of the country to become a global defence manufacturing hub.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said delegates from 70 countries and 172 foreign military manufacturers will attend the five-day mega exhibition. As many as 856 Indian defence firms will also showcase their products at the event.

“We want to make India a hub of defence manufacturing. The DefExpo is a step in this direction,” Singh said.

“The participation of a large number of foreign firms in the DefExpo reflects India’s growing stature,” he said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said his government has been encouraging defence manufacturing in the state. He said two Dornier aircraft of aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Limited will be used by the state government for civil purposes on two routes.

It will be for the first time that the 19-seater aircraft will be used by a state government for civilian purposes.

Singh said India cannot continue to rely on imports for defence platforms and the country has to create its defence manufacturing space.

“By end of this decade, I am confident that India will be among the top three economies in the world. The indigenous defence production will contribute significantly in taking India’s economy forward,” Singh said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/defexpo-to-open-today.html

162,05-2-20,Awaiting govt advisory on whether Chinese shipments are fully safe: ICEA,"Phone makers are waiting for government to clarify if there could be even a slim chance of coronavirus contamination through product shipments from China, industry body ICEA said on Tuesday.

It said that though there is no outright evidence of such transmission, an advisory will conclusively settle the matters for industry players.

Meanwhile, stocks of mobile components and parts accumulated ahead of Chinese New Year holidays have ensured that mobile phone production in India has continued with minimal impact so far despite the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus, but future supplies would depend on whether or not the shuttered factories in China reopen next week, ICEA said.

“We had written to government for a clarification on whether such contamination through shipments is even remotely possible. Prima facie, there seems to be no evidence of such a risk but government should issue an advisory conclusively on whether it is fully safe or not,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.

The deadly virus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city, is spreading to other nations. The outbreak has claimed more than 420 lives so far in mainland China, and has compounded fears of an economic impact.

India on Monday reported third novel coronavirus case after another Keralite student from Wuhan university in China tested positive for the infection. The Kerala government has declared the epidemic as a “state calamity”.

Asserting that the there is no impact yet on mobile phone production, Mohindroo said ICEA is keeping a close watch on the situation and that much would depend on whether the factories which are closed in China, reopen next week.

“...there is a natural stocking up and preparation which the Indian industry and the global industry does ahead of the Chinese New year holidays. This will see us through till February 10-15. We will watch the situation daily. If the problem persists beyond February 10, then we will have a real problem at hand,” he said.

ICEA, the apex association of mobile and electronics industry comprising of manufacturers, brand owners, technology providers, said it remains confident that strong remedial action been taken by Chinese Central government and provincial governments will contain the issue with the help of global health organisations.

Asked if India’s production target for phones could be impacted this quarter for players that depend heavily on sub-assemblies and component imports from China, Mohindroo said, “I cannot comment on targets as it will entirely depend on how the situation unfolds.”

By February 11-12, a clear situation will emerge, he said, adding that with exception to certain players who import components from Vietnam and Korea, most of the mobile players are dependent on Chinese imports.

“Overall, India imported Rs 95,000 crore worth of components this year,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/awaiting-govt-advisory-on-whether-chinese-shipments-are-fully-safe--icea.html

Trade officials of India and the US are giving final touches to the deal expected to cover specific sectors, they said.

Trump is set to visit India on a two-day trip between February 23 and 26 and both sides are in the process of fine-tuning his schedule, sources said.

The main segment of the visit will take place in the national capital, though an option of having a short visit by Trump to another city is being explored.

The cities being considered include Agra and Ahmedabad.

A high-level logistics team from Washington handling Trump's foreign trips visited India last week as part of preparations for his maiden tour of India as the US president.

""The trade deal and a pact on further enhancing defence cooperation are likely to be sealed during the visit by the US president,"" said a source.

India is seeking exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products as well as resumption of benefits on tariff on certain products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).

India is also pressing the US to facilitate greater market access for its products in the US in sectors such as agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices in India.

In 2018-19, India's exports to the US stood at USD 52.4 billion, while imports were USD 35.5 billion. Trade deficit dipped from USD 21.3 billion in 2017-18 to USD 16.9 billion in 2018-19.

India received FDI worth USD 3.13 billion from the US in 2018-19, higher than USD 2 billion in 2017-18.

India had invited Trump to grace the Republic Day parade as the chief guest last year but the US President could not come due to scheduling issues.

During his visit to the US in September last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reminded Trump of his invitation to him to visit India along with his family

Trump’s plan, which was unveiled last week, would foresee the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, but it falls far short of minimal Palestinian demands and would leave sizable chunks of the occupied West Bank in Israeli hands.

In a statement, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell underlined the bloc’s commitment to a two-state solution, based along 1967 lines with the possibility of mutually agreed land-swaps, made up of the state of Israel and “an independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign and viable state of Palestine.”

Borrell said the US initiative “departs from these internationally agreed parameters.” “To build a just and lasting peace, the unresolved final status issues must be decided through direct negotiations between both parties.

172,05-2-20,Govt introduces Bill to amend Aircraft Act,"The Government on Tuesday introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha to amend the Aircraft Act wherein the fine amount for violations will be hiked from Rs 10 lakh to up to Rs 1 crore.

A few other provisions would also be made part of the law that will also help in complying with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) requirements.

The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2020 also provides for keeping “aircraft belonging to any armed forces of the Union, other than naval, from military or air force outside the purview” of the Aircraft Act, 1934.

Once the amendments are passed, the Government would have the power to issue directions to review, if necessary in public interest, any order passed by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), as per the bill’s Statement of Objects and Reasons.

A key proposal is to increase the fine amount from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore for violations. Other proposals include empowering BCAS or any authorised officer to issue directions, having designated officers for adjudging penalties and introducing a provision for compounding of offences.

Generally, compoundable offences are those which can be settled by paying certain amount of money.

Further, the Bill seeks to empower the Central Government to constitute DGCA, BCAS and AAIB under the Act as well as specify their responsibilities.

It would also bring regulations of all areas of air navigation services under the Act. The Act has provisions for securing the safety of aircraft operations in India and carrying out civil aviation operations as per standards, procedures and practices laid down by ICAO.

As per the statement, ICAO audits, conducted in 2012 and 2015, have indicated a need to amend the Act to give proper recognition to the regulators under the Act. Among others, the audits had suggested enhancing the “maximum quantum of fines and to empower the departmental officers to impose financial penalties on individuals or organisations involved in violations of the legal provisions”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-introduces-bill-to-amend-aircraft-act.html

Currently, FDI in Air India is capped at 49 per cent through the government approval route while 100 per cent FDI is permitted in scheduled domestic carriers, subject to certain conditions, including that it would not be applicable for overseas airlines.

Allowing 100 per cent FDI in Air India would allow Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to invest up to 100 per cent. Currently, they can acquire only 49 per cent in the national carrier.

Sources told PTI that the civil aviation ministry has asked the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to remove the clause which restricts FDI in Air India to 49 per cent.

A draft note has been circulated on the issue seeking comments from different ministries, they added.

In the case of scheduled airlines, 49 per cent FDI is permitted through automatic approval route and any such investment beyond that level requires approval.

Under the Substantial Ownership and Effective Control (SOEC) framework, which is followed in the airline industry globally, a carrier that flies overseas from a particular country should be substantially owned by that country’s Government or its nationals.

Making a second attempt in as many years to divest loss-making Air India, the government came out with the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for 100 per cent stake sale on January 27. Besides, Air India’s 100 per cent stake in budget airline Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in AISATS, an equal joint venture with Singapore Airlines, have also been offered.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-working-on-proposal-to-allow-100--fdi-in-ai.html

The company which announced the strategy two years ago with an investment of Euro One Billion (Rs 8,000 crore) and changed the leadership of the company, whose strategy will now be driven by Czech brand Skoda Auto believes that they can reach sales of over 1,00,000 units annually in India by 2025 according to Bernard Maier, Chairman of the Board, Skoda Auto. Speaking to The Pioneer, Maier said that the sales target was a ‘realistic’ one despite the fact that the Indian automotive sector is expected to reach three million units by 2025, “we do not want to overpromise and under deliver, we believe that with our new product strategy underpinned by the made for India MQB-A0 platform we can easily achieve this target.”

The first vehicles made with the new platform, the upcoming Volkswagen Taigun and the Skoda Vision In concept, the latter will be made into a production car soon were showcased at the event. Both vehicles are expected to go on sale in India before the end of 2020. Jurgen Stackmann, Board Member, Sales, marketing and After-sales, Volkswagen AG told The Pioneer that the move to SUV’s was a global one, “after all people like the high seating position and now thanks to improvements in construction the fuel penalty for SUV’s is minimal.” He added that he did not feel that shared mobility solutions such as app-based taxis will make a huge impact in India and as for electric vehicles while Violkwagen will launch some cars in India, the country also needed to ‘clean up’ its energy production and build charging infrastructure for a lasting impact.

However, Stackmann did make clear that Volkswagen Group’s future in India will be diesel-free as the costs associated with clean diesel engines under the BS6 norms coming into force in April 2020.

However, Mevlut Cavusoglu also renewed a call on Russia to “rein in” the Syrian government forces and reiterated Turkey’s determination to retaliate against any future Syrian attack on its troops.

On Monday, Turkish artillery targeted Syrian government forces in northern Idlib province, responding to shelling that killed seven Turkish soldiers and a Turkish civilian. A Syrian war monitor said 13 Syrian troops were also killed in the clash.

The exchange of fire in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria, increased tensions between the two neighbouring countries and threatened to drive a wedge between Russia and Turkey, which have sought to coordinate their actions in Syria. “The Astana and Sochi peace processes have not been completely destroyed but have lately started to suffer and to lose importance,” Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara, referring to Russian-Turkish peace initiatives that have also involved Iran.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/turkey--ankara--moscow-working-for-syria-peace-despite-clash.html

183,05-2-20,‘Take holistic approach to impart education’,"There are several issues hindering the education sector from realising its potential. These need immediate addressal, says UTTARA SINGH

The education sector has undergone a major catharsis in the last decade, thanks to technology. Undoubtedly, the Government and institutions have been making untiring efforts to reform the existing education model; however, there are still several issues, the nation is grappling with, which is hindering the sector from realising its huge potential. These are the issues that need immediate addressal.

Areas of improvement are:

Rote learning: We have come a long way with time, however, we still have not been able to detach ourselves from rote learning and focus on conceptual learning. Many schools are leading and changing the system at their level but only a small population has access to it and not everybody can afford the education they are offering.

Therefore, it becomes important for the government to take the onus of responsibility to introduce and implement effective strategies and eradicate rote learning from the schools at all levels.

The Government should come forward and encourage schools to introduce conceptual learning which avoids rote learning. This will not only help students to understand the concepts in a better way but will also help them to apply them effectively.

Introduction of technology: In this renaissance of technology, the education system can’t afford to function in silos. The education system must whole-heartedly embrace technology and pass it on to students as their future relies on it!

Students must be taught about technology right from the early years of their education so that they do not face any problems in the future. Moreover, they should be taught to use it wisely and cautiously.

Evaluation system: In the present education system, marks still play a crucial role in assessing a student's ability and deciding their future. The pressure of obtaining good marks often leaves the students burdened and makes them underperform.

Instead of evaluating a student's knowledge by a three-hour exam, more impetus should be given to communication skills, leadership skills, classroom participation, projects and extra-curricular activities.

A healthy mix of subjects: We all grew up hearing that the sharpest minds opt for Science and Humanities was considered second best. Students should be given the option of choosing subjects that interest them. A more liberal mix of subjects should be encouraged.

Better training of educators: We live in an ever-changing and dynamic world. This means that day after day, things around us keep changing and we have to adapt ourselves according to it to survive and grow.

With new technology seeping into the education system and with different kinds of students with different interests and talents, there is an impelling need for all the teachers to receive the best of educational and technology training. This is a core area that needs attention.

Personalise education: All students are unique. They might have different levels of comprehension which need to be addressed differently. To equip teachers to pay attention to every student and understand their abilities, schools must utilise technology like artificial intelligence and chatbots that can assist the teachers as well as students.

Focus on life skills: Education should focus on helping the students to become humans who have a strong sense of values. They should be taught about the basic principles because eventually, their success in life will depend on their EQ as much as their IQ.

The education sector of India has an immense potential to become one of the best education systems in the world, provided the gaps are filled. Civic sense, responsibility, kindness should be deeply ingrained. Life skills like collaboration, compassion, working in teams, having a sense of humor, handling stress, anger management should all be a part of the teaching learning process.

It is now time that we take a holistic approach to impart high-class education to our students that focuses on creating global citizens who have a strong foundation of values and are proud of their own culture and heritage.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---take-holistic-approach-to-impart-education----2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---take-holistic-approach-to-impart-education---.html

185,05-2-20,mindIT,"India is undoubtedly a land of opportunity with millions of aspirants competing for a handful of seats. The number of candidates appearing for different competitive exams is increasing at a whopping rate. To differentiate the deserving applicants from the rest for various esteemed institutions and job positions, an egalitarian method was devised to select deserving candidates, which is now deemed as competitive exams.

Cracking a competitive exam is one daunting task. These exams aim to assess the aspirants' perseverance, patience, time management and will to grab the coveted seat despite all odds. Accomplishing a huge volume of comprehensive exam preparation in a limited amount of time requires a strategy. Successful are those who make the best use of the available time.

Escape the rat race! Build your strategy: Unlike school or college academic tests, competitive exams require a different approach, a focused mindset, and a thorough understanding of subjects and concepts. Usually, students face numerous challenges in clearing these competitive exams.

To ensure success in competitive exams, it is important to start preparing as early as possible. To begin with, have a focused goal. With a fixed goal and the right plan in hand, aspirants can measure their preparation — how far or close they are to their goal.

Plan, prioritize and focus

To tame a lion, it is important to know about it extremely well. Similarly, aspirants should be clear about the exam - the pattern, stages and the competition. Often, aspirants face the dilemma of when they should start preparing for the exam.

The ideal time to start preparing for competitive exams is High School education, i.e., from class 9th. At this stage, students are mature enough to realise their abilities and decide their career path. Moreover, the concepts introduced in Class IX curriculum are the fundamentals on which the foundation of higher education is laid. Secondly, there is enough time to work on the finer aspects of complex concepts.

Students can start preparing for the competitive exams they wish to sit for, be it JEE or NEET while preparing for the school exams in Classes Xi and XII.

This is the right time as the concepts tested in competitive exams are covered in Classes Xi and XII.

Since there is a lot to be covered in less time, it is essential to have a strategy. It is advisable that one understands the past years' exam trends and devise the preparation strategy accordingly. They should focus on weaker subjects and revise the stronger ones.

A detailed list of vital formulae comes handy in last-minute revision, hence such notes should be prepared. Finally, to assess preparation vis-a-vis other aspirants, it is highly recommended that one practises mock tests and solve previous years' question papers.

An early start proves beneficial while preparing for any competitive exam. It helps to analyse one's preparation and efficiency to deliver on the D-Day.

190,05-2-20,Be job ready,"Every year, 60 per cent of eight-lakh engineering graduates from across the country remain unemployed. The problem is due to gap between what is being taught and what the industry requires, says Brijesh Kohli

The current job market is undergoing a transformation which has created a need for academic institutes to address the challenge of developing employable individuals. The evolution of technology has created a vacuum between industry and academia as institutes/colleges are not able to keep pace with the changes in technology advancement. The fresh talent that is coming out of institutes is not job-ready and unable to meet expectations of the industry. The budding talent pool is not equipped with knowledge and skills that may help them to compete in the job market. And, there are cascading effects of the unpragmatic engineering programmes in countries economic development.

According to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) report in 2017, more than 60 per cent of the eight lakh engineers graduating from the country every year remain unemployed. Same year a study by Aspiring Minds, employability assessment company, claimed that 95 per cent of engineers in India were not fit for software development jobs. Indeed, the root of the problem lies in the education system, which is not able to cope up with the changing needs of the market due to their impractical and archaic curriculums and pedagogies. Further, our education system is skewed towards providing only knowledge and information rather than developing skills. This does not help us to churn employable students as in today's environment, it is very important to unlearn and acquire new skills in a very short span of time.

The problem arises due to gap between what is being taught and what industry requires. In orderto overcome this situationstudents, need to acquire skills that bridge the disconnect with the job market.Our education system is skewed towards providing only knowledge and information rather than developing skills. This does not help us to churn employable students as in today's environment, it is very important to unlearn and acquire new skills in a very short span of time.

The pace of change is very rapid, and we are at the cusp of technology revolution where IoT, AI, ML, Robotics and Blockchain are shaping the future of public as well as private institutions. The current industry scenario has created an urgent need for the academic institutes to bridge this gap and head towards the technological advancement to empower the businesses with job-ready engineers.

Technology landscape

In today’s VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world, it is imperative that our education institutes must prepare young workforce to face the changing demands of the industry and provide them full range of skills ranging from creative to a complex one. The role of education system is to empower the students with cutting-edge technologies and equip them with the skillset that are aligned with norms of today's IT ecosphere.

In India, though technological advancements have constantly triggered developments in various industries, the education sector hasn't been able to keep pace. Still, things can be improved to harness future opportunities, especially in the IT sector. It is believed that India's IT space is expected to reach 7 million by 2023, according to the Indian Staffing Federation. Indeed, most of these job roles will revolve around the latest technologies and applications such as IoT, AI, ML, Big Data, Blockchain, AR, DevOps, Agile, and Scrum. Hence, the engineering colleges offering degrees in IT, Computer Applications, and Software Development must equip their students with these trending technologies.

Innovators of tomorrow

A lot of changes are required in the curriculum of engineering programmes, and it is imperative for colleges to upskill their faculty and make them well-versed with thetechnologies that are emerging in the industry.

Though the theory has its own significance, the focus should be laid on practical implications to serve the actual purpose of an engineering programme. The programs should be designed in such a way that young workforce builds a creative mindset and develop a sound foundation of knowledge towards key concepts of programming and software craftmanship. This will help the individuals to transition from classroom lectures to building practical solutions.

Colleges can also engage willing senior professionals from various companies to take classes on weekends and provide career guidance as well. Academic institutes/colleges can also collaborate with companies for few courses that can be taught by professionals from companies physically or through webinarsetc.

Moreover, institutes can also collaborate with the industry through joint research projects under the mentorship of industry experts which will help students to interact with them to resolve their queries. In this regard, we at Xebia are working towards building synergies with the universities and educational institutes to offer industry focused programs on emerging technologies.

In fact, to garner the best talent from engineering colleges, industry players must also come forward to communicate what are the demands of the industry from their prospective employees and what changes colleges have to incorporate in their teaching methodologies. With such a collaborative and integrated approach, the gap between demand and supply can be minimised to a great extent and help us in preparing for a digital tomorrow.

Equipping future engineers and innovators with latest technologies will help them to compete not only in the job market but also provide a step towards their dream organisations and become indispensable resource.

Understanding India in its entirety with its diversity is significantly important for professionals of tomorrow, both in the zone of social change and leadership. Exposure to rural India is as much significant as comprehension of urban India, for any professional. Educational institutions with requisite programs can furnish their students with the novel chance to submerge themselves into country life and understand its intricacies.

In the present setting, rural India has steadily settled its qualifications as of practical importance — to a great extent because of the different Government-driven activities that are contributing to the ambit of financial inclusion. This will enable corporate elements to take advantage of the rising opportunity, accordingly opening up new roads of corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Developing fortune combined with better correspondence and availability, rural markets are bound to become the dominant focal point. These progressions are prompting adjustments in goals, inclinations and purchasing conduct of rural customers. These markets present difficulties to marketers regarding promoting systems, correspondence, building supply-chain mechanisms. Marketing, advertising and communication towards rural markets may give new avenues to the media domain, with a growing relevance on digital and social marketing.

Bridging this void in various management programmes across the country are Rural Immersion Programmes. These programmes are designed in such a way, that students can have a direct understanding of a nation’s rural life.

This programme principally empowers students to structure and actualise rural correspondence systems that join participatory strategies with correspondence procedures, media, and instruments. The arranging itself is a unique procedure, as indicated by the circumstance, the time, assets that are accessible and, in particular, the plan of an organisation and its partners.

The programme is arranged towards guaranteeing that the members get an opportunity to apply their classroom learning into a practical real-life domain. Furthermore, the program offers the students an opportunity to investigate and recognise execution lapses or business openings, which can help fill these voids. The programme additionally sharpens students towards social issues, which are pervasive in such social orders.

The idea of a Rural Immersion programme is not just constrained to offering an introduction to college students to visit these places, but to bring learning and open doors for students of the urban foundation by living in a farmer’s home for a couple of days and comprehend their predicament and issues.

The programme is in fact given to sharpen and teach urban students about social issues concerning country individuals and their components to battle despite seemingly insurmountable hurdles in their everyday lives. This is a one of a kind programme intended to change a student into an all-encompassing individual. The accentuation of this one of a kind programme is significant in exploring and taking a shot at ground level with the goal that each student can contribute to maintainable advancement of the rural network.

193,05-2-20,Make best use of time,"Aspirants taking the UPSC this year need to time manage and use technology to ace the exam, says AK Mishra

Time is the one thing in life that you can never get back. Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever. In today’s fast-paced world, even though it seems like we’re working 24x7, are we really making the best use of our time? It’s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?

Time management is the most crucial part of UPSC prep. Making effective and proficient use of it will enable you to manage your studies and counter any stress or pressure that you might encounter during the course of this preparation.

Make an honest assessment of available time: At first, decide how many months you have at your disposal and also how much time you can dedicate. You must keep in mind the time value of success and cost-benefit analysis principles. If you are a beginner and not working giving 6-7 hours of focused time is essential. On the other hand if you are a beginner and working, give at least five hours daily. The ideal preparation period is 11-12 months. So plan accordingly. If you have lesser number of months available it is suggested those daily hours that you devote are stretched to 8 hours of study.

Set up realistic but little ambitious targets: You must set monthly, weekly and daily targets. The targets you set have to reflect your personal understanding and priorities. It is essential that these targets are realistic so that they are achievable while it is also important that they are ambitious so that they give you a push to utilize your time to the best extent. Make a list and gather your sources. Try to keep them limited i.e. instead of randomly picking up books and material. Be clear of books you wish to refer to and Current Affairs material website or notes you wish to follow. Also track your daily, weekly and monthly performances.

Divide large tasks into small yet achievable daily goals: A famous African proverb is that if you have to travel fast walk alone and if you have to go far away travel with others. The journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.

You may have lot of subjects to cover but it starts with one single step taken at this moment. For example if you have planned to finish your optional in next 3 months. Chalk out a plan that gives number of chapters to be completed in a week and number of pages you can complete in a day.

This will enable you to monitor your progress and make changes whenever necessary. One of the foremost things to remember is to keep your schedule flexible. If during any unexpected event you are unable to follow your schedule, give yourself the space to do so. But always come back to the schedule. Also, when a schedule is not working for you, work on it.

Make smart use of technology: Internet and smartphone can make your life easier if you do not allow yourself to be carried away by it.

If you dont have the time to read newspaper and make current affairs notes. Make use of apps like Evernote to organise your notes and copy-paste pictures and screenshots from any websites. You can use apps like habit trackers to track your habits and build your intended habits.

Manage your stress and anxiety levels: The UPSC preparation may come with undue stress and pressure for some. Thus it is important to adequately manage it through proper nutrition, adequate physical exercises or any other activity along with meditation. Approaching a trusted adult or a friend in case of need is the best thing you can do.

It is always important to remember during the course of the preparation that irrespective of the result there is ample scope for everybody to do well in life. Have faith in your abilities and give your best and leave the rest. Don’t try to compensate for stress with more books. More material can confuse you in the long run and reduce efficiency. Maintain simplicity of prep.

Avoid distractions: The importance of meaningful breaks has already been discussed. But it is important to distinguish them from distractions that eat away your productive time. Breaks are taken at your own will when required, while distractions may come in the form of social media notifications or a family gathering. Thus use your own discretion and pick and choose as per your own will.

195,05-2-20,"Kunwar, Himmat fightback rescues Delhi","All-rounder Kunwar Bidhuri and the talented Himmat Singh struck fighting half-centuries to rescue Delhi from a precarious position as the hosts reached 270 for 6 against Gujarat here on the first day of their group A encounter.

Delhi at one stage were staring down the barrel at 136 for 5 with only opener Hiten Dalal (69 off 130 balls) looking comfortable against the Gujarat attack.

However, Himmat (56 off 153 balls), who made a comeback into the senior side along with Kunwar (78 batting off 133 balls) rescued Delhi with a 134-run sixth wicket stand.

Pacer Arzan Nagaswalla (3/54 in 18 overs) was the pick of the Gujarat bowlers while seasoned Axar Patel (1/60 in 18.3 overs) did the most important job of dismissing Himmat off the last ball of the day.

The right-hander, who showed tremendous patience during his 153-ball stay went for a drive but the edge landed in Rujul Bhatt’s hands in the slip cordon.

This was after he had hit eight fours and a six during his knock. Kunwar, who scored his maiden half-century, was more attacking of the two, with 11 fours and a six to his credit.

Assam out for 97

Rohtak: Haryana gained the upper hand on an eventful opening day of their Group C match against Assam, taking a 101-run lead after bundling out their opponents for 97 in the first innings.

Haryana finished the day at 198 for 9.

Captain Harshal Patel’s decision to bowl after winning the toss paid dividends as he and left-arm spinner Tinu Kundu (5/35) wrecked the Assam batting line-up, making good use of the conditions. Medium-pacer Patel, who has been key for Haryana this season, finished with 4 for 32.

In reply, Haryana looked in trouble having lost half the side for 65 before a defiant 76-run partnership between Chaitanya Bishnoi (46) and R P Sharma (59) sparked a revival.

Later, the skipper Harshal Patel (28) smacked three fours and two sixes to help Haryana extend the lead.

Saurashtra reduce Mumbai to 249/8

Rajkot: Saurashtra left arm spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja snared five wickets to leave Mumbai teetering at 249 for eight in Elite Group B game.

Had Sarfaraz Khan yet again not rescued Mumbai after they suffered a top-order collapse with his 78, the 41-time Ranji champions would have been in more trouble in what is a must-win game for them.

Jadeja (5/90) rattled their top-order and among his wickets were Jay Bista (43), Bhupen Lalwani (25), Siddesh Lad (13) and rival skipper Aditya Tare (10).

Struggling at 88 for four, Sarfaraz (78 off 126 balls; 9x4 and 2x6) and all-rounder Shams Mulani (59 not out off 171 balls; 6x4; 2x6) steadied the ship with their 109-run stand for the fifth wicket. They ensured that the domestic giants took lunch and tea without losing any further wickets.

Sarfaraz, who took his team out of trouble in the last two matches, again played a matured and responsible knock.

However, after doing all the hard work, he fell on 78 after being cleaned up by Kamlesh Makwana. Sarfaraz’s unbeaten run thus ended in first-class cricket after amassing 605 runs from three innings. Aditya Tare (10) was dismissed cheaply as he became Jadeja’s fourth victim. Mulani held one end and completed his fourth fifty after tapping Jadeja for a single.

However, Mulani ran out of partners with Vinayak Bhoir (21) and Shashank Attarde (0) also falling in quick succession as Saurashtra took honours on day 1.

For the hosts, Jadeja was ably supported by Mankad (2/30) and Makwana (1/46).

Earlier, the Saurashtra Cricket Association felicitated senior speedster Jaydev Unadkat for taking 300 scalps in first-class cricket. Unadkat, however, missed the game due to niggle.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kunwar--himmat-fightback-rescues-delhi.html
196,05-2-20,"Marsh, Maxwell back for SA tour","Australia has recalled allrounder Mitch Marsh and Glenn Maxwell for the ODI and T20 tour of South Africa.

Marsh last featured in an Australian side in the Ashes series last September. He he hasn’t played an ODI since January 2018 or a T20I since October 2018.

Maxwell last played for Australia in October before taking a break from cricket, citing mental health issues. He returned to action in the BBL for the Melbourne Stars.

On Tuesday, Marcus Stonis was named the Big Bash League’s domestic player of the tournament, but he was left out of both squads.

“Marcus Stoinis is a stand-by player for each squad and was unlucky to miss out due to the make-up of the current top order,” selector Trevor Hohns said in a statement on Tuesday.

“It is terrific to have a back-up player of his caliber in such good form.”

Pacemen Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson were named in the T20 squad and Matthew Wade was included in both.

Australia will play three T20s against South Africa - on Feb 21, 23 and 26 - before three one-dayers on Feb. 29, March 4 and March 7.

ODIs: Aaron Finch (captain), Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Ashton Agar, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitch Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa.

197,05-2-20,Dicka’s form blessing for Punjab: Anwar,"Cameroonian forward Dipanda Dicka has taken I-League 2019-20 season by storm scoring eight goals for Punjab FC so far and is also the leading goal scorer of the tournament and team’s experienced centre-back Anwar Ali is happy about his teammate spectacular form.

“Dicka is a very chilled out striker but on the given chance he can score spectacular goals and that’s his speciality in the ground. He is very good in front of the D. He took his time to find his natural form and now we can see his free-scoring run,” Anwar said about his star teammate.

However at the same time, former Indian international Anwar also expects other offensive players to step up if the team wants to challenge for the title

“But in terms of a bigger picture, we as a team want our other players to find the name on the score sheet as well. Because a team which is fighting for championship can’t just remain dependent on one player. If Dicka is scoring it’s a good thing but if he’s not able to convert chances then the winger or the midfielders should be able to contribute,” he added.

2017-18 champion is playing under a new name (formerly Minerva Punjab) this time and is currently at the second spot in the points table with 17 points from 10 games, six points behind leaders Mohun Bagan, who they will play next in the away tie after playing 1-1 draw in the home fixture on January 14.

In terms of the standings, upcoming game at Kalyani on Sunday is important for Punjab to narrow the gap with Kolkata heavyweights and this is the motivation for the players for the marquee clash.

“It is an important game for us because a win against Bagan in their home turf will not only give us an added momentum but also will narrow the game between the two sides.”

The team is doing well after making a horror start to their campaign when they host 0-3 against Churchill Brothers but since then won three and played a draw in six games. A couple of which (against East Bengal and Mohun Bagan) could easily have been in favour if they haven’t conceded in final minutes.

Speaking about the defence, Ali said: “All the goals that we have conceded till now is because of our own mistakes. It’s not like that any opposition players have scored after beating the defence and destroying it. Four-five goals were scored after we failed to clear the ball properly. So I don’t think the defence has been a cause of worry instead some individual errors punished us. However it is not a serious concern,” he concluded.

Anwar also spoke highly about Minerva School of Sports Excellence for providing a good sporting environment to young kids who often compete with the senior team players during pre-season games and has also made it to the senior set up.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dicka---s-form-blessing-for-punjab--anwar.html
198,05-2-20,IPL right platform for T20 WC preparation: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday said that his team is not looking to strengthen its T20 World Cup preparations in the ODI series against New Zealand as the upcoming IPL is the “right platform” for it.

However, head coach Ravi Shastri had last month said that the ODIs India play against New Zealand and South Africa (in March) could be a preparatory ground for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October-November.

“We have had five T20s already, it’s not that we don’t have a lot of T20 cricket. We have IPL as well which is going to be a month and a half of T20 cricket. So we will probably utilise that, I think, because last year (for ODI World Cup) you did not have much opportunity to prepare yourselves apart from the games that were in front of you,” said Kohli on the eve of the first ODI.

“But T20s is very different, as I said. IPL is probably the most competitive tournament you can ask for as a collective and guys will look to get into that frame of mind in that tournament and not this early in a 50-over format because you don’t want to play in a different manner.”

The skipper feels it is important to give equal respect to each format.

“You have to respect the format, you have to play according to the pace of the 50-over game and as I spoke of the combination as well. It’s about guys getting settled in their roles and repeating that game after game so that they know I played this in this format, I have to play this in T20s or similarly in Test cricket.

“These things are all about creating good habits for different formats and then being able to switch between them. So no, we are not looking at this series as preparation for T20 World Cup. IPL is going to be the right platform for that.”

India go into the three-match series high on confidence, having whitewashed the Black Caps 5-0 in the T20 series. Kohli’s team had also beaten New Zealand 4-1 in ODIs last year before going down in T20s.

“The last time around, when we played here, we dominated the first three games. Lost the fourth and came back in the fifth one again. We felt we had more time to work out our plans in the ODIs actually. The T20 format was something that suited New Zealand more as they could play some explosive cricket and really did come after our side but in one-day cricket, we have played some really hard-fought series.”

He expects New Zealand to bounce back strongly following the drubbing in T20s.

“That’s something that we need to be wary of, that we keep believing in our own plans and ride those pockets of pressure and eventually turn the situation around for ourselves. That’s something that we’ve always known with the New Zealand side that they’ll not give up and keep finding a way to come back into the game,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-right-platform-for-t20-wc-preparation--kohli.html
199,05-2-20,Latham hopes fresh faces will turn it around for Kiwis,"New Zealand’s stand-in skipper Tom Latham is banking on fresh faces to turn around the fortunes of his injury-hit side against a seemingly invincible India in the ODI series.

Latham said the Black Caps, playing their first ODI since World Cup final, are hopeful of bouncing back.

“We have played India a lot over the last couple of years. So, there shouldn’t be too many surprises...For us it is about trying to focus on the series,” he said.

New Zealand are battling an injury crisis, which includes regular skipper Kane Williamson. The Black Caps will, however, be rejuvenated by the inclusion of all-rounder Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme in the ODI squad.

“The T20 results were disappointing for the T20 side. (But) It is nice that a slightly new group has come in for this one-day team, a few new faces and a different format,” he said.

“So it is important that we don’t try and reinvent the wheel to try and change our style of play...Obviously it is hard but as I said there is a new group now. Fresh faces in a different format, which will pose challenges in a different way.

“So, fingers crossed and we can switch into One-day mode and start getting those results,” he added.

Talking about reversing the results after the T20 whitewash, Latham said, “Winning can be a habit. Unfortunately we have been on the wrong side of those results, which has been disappointing.”

“As I have said earlier, it is a different format, which is probably refreshing for the guys. There are new faces, who were not involved in the T20 series. We have been in those positions in the T20 series to win the game. Now we can start winning and going across the line,” he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/latham-hopes-fresh-faces-will-turn-it-around-for-kiwis.html
200,05-2-20,Chapman in for Williamson,"New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the first two ODIs against India as he continues to battle an inflamed AC joint in his left-shoulder and has been replaced by Mark Chapman.

“Kane has had an X-ray scan which cleared him of anything serious, but it’s best for his recovery that he avoids aggravating the joint for the next few days,” team physio Vijay Vallabh was quoted as saying by New Zealand Cricket.

“He will continue his fitness training sessions throughout the week and will start batting again on Friday with the prospect of being available for game three next Tuesday.”

Selector Gavin Larsen confirmed in-form Auckland Aces left-hander Mark Chapman would join the squad in Hamilton on Tuesday.

“It’s hugely disappointing for Kane, but with so much important cricket still ahead this summer we must take a safety first approach,” Larsen said.

“It’s great to welcome Mark back into the one-day unit off the back of consecutive centuries for New Zealand A against a strong India A side.

“Mark’s a versatile player who can cover multiple batting positions and his fielding is a real upshot to have in the squad.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chapman-in-for-williamson.html
201,05-2-20,"Prithvi returns for Test, Mayank in ODIs","Opener Prithvi Shaw on Tuesday made a comeback into the Indian Test team for the two-match series against New Zealand while Mayank Agarwal replaced injured Rohit Sharma in the ODI squad. Shaw, who last played for India in October 2018, returns to the Test side after Rohit was ruled out of the series due to a left calf muscle strain. The two-Test series begins in Wellington on February 21.

“Vice-captain Rohit Sharma sustained a left calf muscle strain during the fifth T20I against New Zealand at Tauranga on Sunday.

“He underwent an MRI scan in Hamilton on Monday. The opening batsman has been ruled out of the upcoming ODI and the Test series and will be referred to the National Cricket Academy for further management of his injury,” said the BCCI in a statement.

Shaw, who had made a century on Test debut against the West Indies in October 2018, had last month received a maiden ODI call-up for the New Zealand series.

After serving an eight-month doping ban last year, Shaw showed no signs of rustiness and was instantaneously amongst the runs in domestic cricket with the double hundred against Baroda being the highlight.

Shaw has already been in New Zealand for more than two weeks with the A side and smashed a 150 against New Zealand XI in his first innings on the tour.

His India U-19 teammate Shubman Gill has expectedly retained his place in the Test squad following a match-saving double hundred for India A against New Zealand on Sunday.

Both Shaw and Gill are openers but the former is expected to open alongside Agarwal in the first Test at Basin Reserve. Gill, who smashed the double ton batting at number four, can also make the eleven as a middle-order batsman.

Gill, who has played two ODIs, was part of the Test squad in the home series against South Africa and Bangladesh but did not get a game.

Kuldeep Yadav, who did not make the eleven in the five T20s against New Zealand, has been dropped from the Test squad with the selectors going for two specialist spinner options in Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin.

K L Rahul, who played his last Test in the West Indies in September, was ignored despite a prolific run in limited overs cricket.

Among the pacers, Navdeep Saini has made his way into the Test side following impressive performances in limited overs cricket. Saini had received his maiden Test call-up for the one-off Test against Afghanistan in 2018 but is yet to make his debut. However, he has gone on to play three ODIs and 10 T20s for India.

Senior pacer Ishant Sharma, who had twisted his ankle during a Ranji Trophy game last month, has kept his place in the side but his participation in the series is subject to fitness.

Test squad: Virat Kohli (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice-captain), Hanuma Vihari, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Mohd.

202,05-2-20,Study abroad,"‘Good education and value for money’

There are several reasons why a student wanting to study abroad should choose a Canadian university. Andrew Smith tells you why

As a member of the trade commissioner service from the Cabinet of Canada our mandate is to promote educational services in Canada. We have been spending some time doing this a few years. We have 2.1 lakh Indian students with visas currently studying in Canada and that’s a five-fold increase over the last five years and those effects have come alone through the promotional efforts.

The schools have people on ground to do the promotions, we got the MOU use linking Canadian and Indian institutes. When we are talking about higher education in Canada for Indian students, the scope is large.

We have got a lot of universities and UG school in India, they approach us for education fairs we have got a lot of universities and UG school in India, they approach us for education fair..

I think the opportunities are available and massive something as specific as selfish research that is when we looking at and our education portals are self-sufficient which king of getting you the best universities and you can fly too directly.

When Indian students look to study abroad, and when they look at Canada they know that thare getting world-class education in a safe and welcoming environment, their families are getting a good education and good value of money the students. In many cases, they can choose where there is an Indo-Canadian community to help them with the onboarding.

They get the intellectual witness and richness of campuses and contribute to the country’s economy so they are important to us as well. All though they can become ambassadors for India in that two-way trading relationship.

An Indian students if choosing Canada will have the study to purse permanent residency if they choose so and the area we work really hard on is really fast processing students visas, so when parents consider all of those factors they will choose Canada.

203,05-2-20,BUDGET TALK,"The focus area of education in this year’s budget under the theme of Aspirational India oriented towards three key areas: Improving the quality of education, promoting digital learning and skill development to address high unemployment rate. The Finance Minister (FM) was expected to announce revolutionary measure in building the new digital education ecosystem to promote futuristic skills and combat high unemployment rate but no major announcements of schemes/policies were made regarding the same. The announcement of New Education Policy” was much needed move considering pathetic state of education system but pathway towards implementation is still a long way to go.

— Dr Raj Padhiyar, Founder & CEO, Digital Gurukul

We welcome the focus on education, skill development and new-age technologies in this year’s budget which focuses on furthering the employability of Indians through the government’s Skill India Mission launched in 2015. The step by the government to facilitate the educational needs of the growing working-age population and students who do not have access to higher education by offering online education programs from the top 100 institutions of the country is commendable. It will allow students from around the country to have quality education and learn from the best institutions in the country.

— Irwin Anand, MD, Udemy India

It is a progressive Budget that acknowledges the role technology can play in addressing challenges and improving access to quality higher education and employment opportunities for India's youth. The Government's announcements related to the development of emerging technologies like AI, ML, Data Analytics ecosystem in the country and skilling opportunities for the youth, clearly reflect the focus on preparing the youth for jobs of tomorrow. Also, the introduction of online degree programs highlights the growing acceptance of online education in its capability. Aided with a boost in infrastructure and high quality content, online education will not only accelerate skill development initiatives but also help ‘right-skill’ the workforce of the future.

— Raghav Gupta, Managing Director, India, and APAC, Coursera

It’s great to see the Union Government’s focus on education. The FDI part was in waiting for a long time, glad to have it come through —it will really help us make a big leap! Online education programmes, introduction of new courses that will push students into careers of tomorrow, and of course the Indian SAT for promoting #StudyInIndia — all are in the right direction, and I am personally very excited about us at leverage Edu helping execute some of these parts.

— Akshay Chaturvedi, Founder & CEO, Leverage Edu

By 2030, India is set to have the largest working age population in the world. It is good to know the Government has acknowledged this and the need for the education sector to have greater finance to attract good teachers. This time the Finance Minister has announced Rs 99,300 crore outlay for education sector and Rs 3,000 crore for skill development. But the rise is just not enough to match the need. Considering the option of External Commercial Borrowings and FDI for education was much-needed.

204,05-2-20,Rani shines in India’s 1-0 win,"Confident Indian women’s hockey team registered a 1-0 win against Great Britain in Auckland on Tuesday in their fourth match. Having won their first match in the New Zealand tour 4-0 against the hosts Development Squad, Indian women’s team had lost the following two matches 2-1 and 1-0 respectively to the New Zealand national team.

However, on Tuesday, the Indian women’s team led by Rani played with full gusto and a structured defence with tight passing ensured little room for Great Britain to counter attack or create chances to score.

“We created enough chances and now we need to keep working on converting those chances but our defence stood strong through the match which was a good thing,” expressed chief coach Sjoerd Marijne after the match.

Ending the first half in a 0-0 stalemate, India made another PC attempt in the third quarter but could not make the opportunity count. The team however kept up a good line of defence and continued to carry on aggressive attack. It was not until the 47th minute when Skipper Rani created space in the circle, netting a powerful shot past Great Britain’s goalkeeper.

The 1-0 lead put serious pressure on Great Britain who eventually could not recover, thus conceding the loss.

208,05-2-20,Mirabai betters own national record,"Olympic medal hopeful and former world champion Mirabai Chanu on Tuesday bettered her own national record by lifting a total of 203kg to win the 49kg Gold in the National Weightlifting Championships.

The 25-year-old Manipuri, representing Railways, lifted 88kg in snatch in her second attempt and 115kg in clean and jerk for a total of 203kg.

Mirabai’s previous best of 201kg had come at the World Championship in Thailand in September last year, where she had finished fourth.

Tuesday’s effort has put her in fourth place in world rankings behind Chinese Jiang Huihua (212kg) and Hou Zhihui (211kg) and Korean Ri Song Gum (209kg).

Mirabai was targeting 207kg but lost her balance in the final attempts of both the snatch and clean and jerk.

“I still have some time left for the Asian Championships and I hope to get there (210 kg) before the Olympics,” Mirabai told reporters.

“Everything is going according to our plan. Everyday, we are getting in there. Our target is to achieve 206-207kg at the Asian Championships. It’s all about making some technical adjustments and power-strengthening now.”

With all focus on Mirabai, it was the unheralded 21-year-old from Tamil Nadu, N Ajith, who produced the biggest stunner of the tournament, upsetting defending champion and Commonwealth Championship Gold medallist Achinta Sheuli with national record performance.

Ajith lifted 140kg in snatch and 170kg in clean and jerk for a total of 310kg, which was 4kg more than the defending champion and local favourite Achinta who achieved his personal best in both snatch (138kg) and clean and jerk (168kg) for a total of 306kg.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mirabai-betters-own-national-record.html
209,05-2-20,"Shaw, Agarwal will debut today","India are set to field two debutant openers, Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal, in the first ODI against New Zealand here today after skipper Virat Kohli confirmed that K L Rahul will continue to bat in the middle-order.

Rahul will keep wickets and bat at number five like he did during the Australia series, Kohli said on Tuesday.

“Prithvi’s definitely going to start and whoever the replacement is, we’ll ask for an opener (which has already been decided with Agarwal replacing Rohit). KL will bat in the middle-order. We want him to get accustomed to that role and keep as well,” said Kohli.

Kohl said Rohit’s absence doesn’t hamper the team’s preparations as there are not many ODI series lined up in the year of T20 World Cup.

“I understand it’s an unfortunate situation that Rohit can’t be a part of this series. When you talk about one-day cricket and T20 cricket and Test cricket now, he’s one guy who’s always on the list first. But the thing is that we don’t have any one-day tournaments to look forward to.

“It’s if anything an ideal time for him to go away and rectify this as soon as he can and come back. He played the T20I series, so from the team’s balance point of view heading into the World Cup year, it doesn’t really hamper the combination as far as the T20s are concerned,” he said.

Kohli said injuries to Dhawan and Rohit are a good opportunity for Shaw and Agarwal.

“Rohit’s injury is unfortunate but someone who steps in, it’s a chance for that guy to experience this kind of pressure & expectation, and for us to see who are the guys that cope with it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shaw--agarwal-will-debut-today.html

In his first reaction after the amendment to the Citizenship Act and nation wide protests against it, the top actor wondered as to how Muslims, who chose to stay back in India following partition will be sent out of the country.

""CAA is no threat to Muslims, if they face trouble I will be the first person to raise voice for them,"" he told reporters here.

Besides, the central government has assured that Indian people will have no issues in view of the Citizenship Amendment Act, he noted.

Alleging that some political parties were instigating people against CAA for their selfish interests, he also blamed religious leaders for supporting protests against the law and dubbed it ""very wrong.""

212,05-2-20,Nadda asks Kejriwal if he would 'burn down' Delhi to defeat Modi-Shah,"Sustaining attack on AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal over the police claim that the Shaheen Bagh shooter was an AAP worker, BJP chief JP Nadda on Wednesday questioned him if he would ""burn down"" Delhi to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.

""The situation would not have been this had you worked Kejriwal ji. Earlier you incited mob in Jamia and Seelampur, instigated arson and stone-pelting in New Friends Colony, Shaheen Bagh dharna and then firing by your worker. Would you burn down Delhi to defeat Modi and Shah,"" Nadda asked in a tweet in Hindi.

Kapil Baisala, who opened fired at Shaheen Bagh protest-site last week, was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party, police claimed on Tuesday. He and his father joined AAP in early 2019, they said.

DCP (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo said Baisala's mobile phone was seized and WhatsApp data and photos of him and his father joining the party were retrieved.

The AAP has questioned the police investigation alleging it was under influence of the BJP.

AAP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said the photos retrieved from Baisala's phone were part of investigation and alleged they were leaked to BJP.

""On whose instance, the police is giving statement? How did the photos which were part of the investigation reach the BJP? Before the news came out, Manoj Tiwari in the morning stated that the accused was from AAP. How did Manoj Tiwari get this news,"" Singh asked.

He said AAP will approach the Election Commission to raise the issue, which has cropped up four days before the polling date.

Seeking to make a comeback in Delhi after two decades, the BJP has thrown all its weight to oust AAP from power, with some party leaders going to the extent of terming Kejriwal a ""terrorist"" and accusing him of supporting Shaheen Bagh protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the 'Tukde-Tukde' gang.

214,05-2-20,"Govt's three errors of DeMo, flawed GST, squeeze on banks, sent economy in tailspin: Chidambaram","The monumental blunder of demonetization, a flawed GST and putting the squeeze on banks were the three major errors committed by the government that sent the economy into a tailspin, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Wednesday.

Addressing students at the Shri Ram College of Commerce here, the former finance minister also said that the country was heading towards another ""listless"" year in terms of economic growth.

""We will limp along. But if there is a crisis -- problem in the Middle East, a war or a trade war between the US and China, is there a plan B that the government has?"" he asked.

Pointing out that the government has itself set a ""pessimistic"" target of 10 per cent nominal growth, Chidambaram said the real growth would at best be around five per cent.

""The growth rate has declined for the last six quarters. If the 7th quarter also shows decline then it means that the slide persists and we are yet to see light at the end of the tunnel, we are still in the tunnel,"" he said.

Chidambaram said it is the Opposition that has been giving the reasons for the economic slowdown when the explanation should have come from the government.

Giving various economic figures, he said all the numbers point towards a ""limping economy"".

Explaining the reasons for the economic ""decline"", Chidambaram said the ""monumental blunder"" of demonetisation, the hurried and flawed implementation of the Goods and Services Tax which led to ""chaos"", and ""putting the squeeze"" on banks so much that the bankers stopped lending, were the ""three major errors because of which economy has gone into a tailspin"".

All the key sectors such as mining, manufacturing, electricity, coal, crude oil and gas are performing poorly, he said, adding that the visible signs of the slowdown are most apparent in the automobile sector.

Chidambaram said most importantly the economy was demand-constrained which was also pulling down investment and needed to be vitalized.

He said the government's move to revive demand by cutting Corporate Tax was flawed as what was needed was to put money in the hands of the people.

Instead of the cutting corporate tax, if they had given relief in GST, that would have left money in the hands of millions and that would have led to investment, he said.

He said one way of putting money in the hands of the people was to put more money in schemes such as MGNREGA and PM-KISAN.

But, unfortunately the government has announced cuts in the budget of such schemes for the next fiscal, he said.

The government has missed a huge opportunity to revive the economy, he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-s-three-errors-of-demo--flawed-gst--squeeze-on-banks--sent-economy-in-tailspin--chidambaram-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/govt-s-three-errors-of-demo--flawed-gst--squeeze-on-banks--sent-economy-in-tailspin--chidambaram.html

217,05-2-20,Injury-hit India ready for ODI battle,"Injuries to key players has opened the door for exciting youngsters such as Prithvi Shaw to make an impression in the Indian line-up against a low-on-confidence and depleted New Zealand in the three-match ODI series starting at Seddon Park here today.

This is India’s third ODI assignment after the World Cup last year, having previously beaten West Indies (away) and Australia (at home).

The Black Caps, on the other hand, play their first ODI since that infamous loss at Lord’s in the World Cup final against England.

The last time these two sides met in the 50-over format, New Zealand had knocked India out of the World Cup with an 18-run win over two days in the second semi-final at Manchester.

In the current context, stakes aren’t that high as both sides prepare for the T20 World Cup later in Australia this year. In fact, the upcoming two-Test series later this month bears more significance than this ODI clash.

In the ODI series, neither side will be at full strength as a string of first-team players will be missing due to injuries.

India were dealt a major blow when Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the remainder of this tour owing to the calf injury he picked up in the final T20I. The Men in Blue are already missing Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar.

For New Zealand, inspirational skipper Kane Williamson has joined the long list of injured along with the likes of Trent Boult.

Skipper Virat Kohli outlined that they will stick to the strategy adopted against Australia in Rajkot, where KL Rahul kept wickets and batted at number five.

Kohli had more or less confirmed Shaw’s ODI debut in that scenario, and now India will probably have two openers debuting.

The last time such a situation arose was 2016, when KL Rahul and Karun Nair opened for India on their debuts in Zimbabwe.

Sunil Gavaskar and Sudhir Naik (1974) against England and Parthasarthy Sharma and Dilip Vengsarkar (1976) against New Zealand are the other previous instances.

Such a move would set up India’s batting line-up with Kohli at number three and Shreyas Iyer at number four.

In the nets on Tuesday, Manish Pandey batted along with Kohli and Iyer, ahead of Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant and Kedar Jadhav.

If Pandey plays, the lower order will be a curious mix with Dube, Jadhav and Ravindra Jadeja vying for the all-rounder’s spot.

In the bowling department, three pacers will probably be the norm once again.

Kuldeep Yadav, who sat out the entire T20I series, is slated for a comeback given his performance against Australia at home.

New Zealand will have some re-think before finalising their playing eleven too.

Tom Latham will lead the side ahead of Tim Southee who was stand-in skipper during the last two T20Is. In Williamson’s absence, they will look towards Ross Taylor for batting leadership.

The Black Caps will be rejuvenated though with the inclusion of all-rounder Jimmy Neesham while Colin de Grandhomme returns to the squad as well. Ish Sodhi is only there for the first ODI and the hosts could opt for a two-spinner attack given the slower surface at Seddon Park.

Keeper-batsman Tom Blundell and lanky pacer Kyle Jamieson are the only ones who don’t have an ODI cap to their name.

Teams

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Chahal, Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini.

218,05-2-20,Messi demands Abidal name names after dressing room criticism,"Lionel Messi has hit back at Barcelona sporting director Eric Abidal after the Frenchman blamed slackness in the dressing room for the departure of recently-fired coach Ernesto Valverde.

Now Argentine ace Messi has fired a salvo at across his own ranks just as the club are trying to get him to sign a contract extension.

""Sincerely I don't like doing this kind of thing but everyone has to be made responsible for their actions and what they say,"" Messi said on Instagram.

""We the players in the dressing room are the first to admit it when we haven't played well. The directors need to take their responsibilities too.

""I believe that if you talk about the players (in this way) you should name names instead of worrying everyone and encouraging rumours that are far from certain."" Earlier Tuesday Abidal had spoken glowingly of Messi and had sounded optimistic of an extended deal.

""I'm sure we'll come to a deal with Leo because he knows we need him. He's on top form, enjoying his game and breaking records,"" said Abidal.

""We as a club want to make him even happier and to do that by surrounding him with the right teammates. We want a strong team with a good everyday feeling and above all we want to win titles.""

221,05-2-20,"NRC would impact all religions, won't allow it: Thackeray","Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said there was no need to fear the Citizenship Amendment Act, but asserted his government will not allow the proposed National Register of Citizens to be implemented as it would ""impact people of all religions"".

Throwing out Bangladeshi and Pakistani migrants out of the country was an old demand of the Shiv Sena, the chief minister said in the third and concluding part of his interview to party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

""I can confidentally say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not meant to throw Indian citizens out of the country. But, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is going to impact Hindus as well,"" the Sena president said.

India has the right to knowthe number of minorities from neighbouring nations who applied for Indian citizenship after being persecuted in their home countries, he said.

""When they come here, will they get homes under the 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana'? What about employment and education of their children? All these issues are important and we have the right to know,"" hesaid in the interview to Saamana's executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut.

""As chief minister, I should know where will these people be relocated in my state. Our own people don't have adequate housing. Will these people go to Delhi, Bengaluru or Kashmir, since Article 370 is now scrapped?"" he wondered.

Several Kashmiri Pandit families are staying like refugees in their own country. The CAA is not to throw citizens out of the country, Thackeray said.

""However, the NRC will impact Hindus and Muslims and the state government will not allow it to be implemented,"" he asserted.

Under the NRC, all citizens will have to prove their citizenship. In Assam, 19 lakh people could not prove their citizenship. Of these, 14 lakh are Hindus, Thackeray claimed.

In a veiled attack on his cousin and MNS chief Raj Thackeray, who will lead a rally in support of the CAA and NRC in Mumbai on February 9, the chief minister said the NRC is not yet a reality and there is no need for a 'morcha' in support of or against it.

""If the NRC is enforced, those who are supporting it will also be affected,"" he said.

Under the NRC, even Hindus will have to prove their citizenship. ""I will not allow the law to be enacted. Whether I am chief minister or not, I will not allow injustice to anybody,"" he said.

The chief minister also took a veiled dig at the Centre's decision to give the Padma Shri award to Pakistani- origin musician Adnan Sami.

""A migrant is a migrant. You can't honour him with the Padma award.

223,05-2-20,Hindu Mahasabha leader murder case : 4 detained in UP,"The Uttar Pradesh Police on Wednesday detained four persons in connection with the murder of Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) president Ranjit Bachchan.

According to sources, the four individuals were detained by the Special Task Force of the Lucknow Police from Gorakhpur and Rae Bareli.

Ranjiyt Bachchan was shot dead on Sunday morning by unknown gunmen in Lucknow while he was on a morning walk.

Police sources said that the suspects were detained on the basis of call details of the deceased's mobile phone.

One of the suspects had made a call to a close relative of the Hindu leader, minutes after Ranjit Bachchan was shot dead.

The police are investigating all possible angles in the murder case and are likely to question Ranjit Bachchan's second wife, Smriti.

A property dealer from Gorakhpur is also on the police list for interrogation.

Ranjit Bachchan was shot at in the head multiple times by bike-borne assailants on February 1 in broad daylight. The incident took place near the Global Park in Hazratganj area.

The attackers fled from the spot after the firing.

Bachchan was immediately rushed to Lucknow Trauma Centre where he was declared brought dead.

His younger brother Aditya, who was with him at the time of the incident, also suffered bullet injuries.

Four police officials, including two PRV police personnel, a constable and an outpost in-charge were suspended after the murder.

The police also released CCTV footage of the murder suspect and announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for any information about any suspects' whereabouts.

Notably, this is the second incident when the leader of an ultra-right fringe Hindu outfit has been killed.

In October last year, leader of the Hindu Samaj Party and former member of the Hindu Mahasabha, Kamlesh Tiwari, was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the Naka area of Lucknow.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hindu-mahasabha-leader-murder-case---4-detained-in-up-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hindu-mahasabha-leader-murder-case---4-detained-in-up.html

225,05-2-20,"Rahul says BJP, AAP didn’t create jobs but made people fight","Attacking the BJP and the AAP at a rally on Tuesday, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said both the parties did nothing to create employment but kept indulging in spreading hatred in society.

The Congress leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal are not interested in providing jobs to youngsters but keen on making one Indian fight another for staying in power.

Addressing an election rally in support for the Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Singh Marwah, he slammed Modi for not talking about the economy and unemployment in his poll speeches and said the Prime Minister did not have the guts to do it.

Hitting out at the Prime Minister, Rahul said, “Modi promised two crore jobs annually but did nothing to ensure it. He talked about Pakistan but not about providing jobs and improving the economy. Jobs could be created by making India a manufacturing hub, but not in the manner the Government is working.”

“They (BJP) talk about the Hindu dharma, they talk about Islam, and they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism-- where is it written that attack other people, suppress them?,” he asked the crowd.

What kind of “Hindu dharma” is this of Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as Hinduism talked about taking everyone along, he said.

The aim of the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is to spread hatred in the society, something the Congress could never do, Rahul said.

“Do not harbour any illusion. Go to any person and you will find nationalism in his blood irrespective of his religion or whether he is poor or rich. The person who makes ‘deshbhakts’ (patriots) fight with each other, can he be a deshbhakt?,” Rahul asked the crowd,” he said.

“The Finance Minister is not ready to say how many youngsters got employment. She said I will not say it as Rahul Gandhi will ask me questions,” the Congress MP said as he slammed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech in Parliament as “hollow”.

He also targeted the Centre for slashing corporate tax and claimed that loans worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore were waived of 15 crony capitalists.”In my next speech, I will take out a list of how many projects Adani has been given by Modi. Airports and ports have been handed over. You will see Adani’s and Ambani’s names everywhere. This is not Narendra Modi’s Government, but a Government of Adani and Ambani. Only 15 people benefit from it,” Rahul said.

Referring to coronavirus, he said the countries manufacturing in China were looking at India for taking on the mantle of a leading manufacturer. “The whole world except China wants to invest in India. But when they look at India now, they see hatred, violence, rapes, goondaism, killings. Wherever you see in the last five years, one Indian talks to another Indian with hatred. This is not our history. This is a country of love,” Rahul said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rahul-says-bjp--aap--didn---t-create-jobs-but--made-people-fight-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rahul-says-bjp--aap--didn---t-create-jobs-but--made-people-fight.html
226,05-2-20,"Aerobridge screening, visa curbs to prevent spread of coronavirus","The Government on Tuesday unveiled several measures to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus which has killed nearly 450 persons in China.

As part of the new measures, aerobridges will be used at dedicated gates of seven international airports at Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Cochin, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai to screen passengers for coronavirus.

The decisions were taken at a meeting held by Health Secretary Preeti Sudan to review the preparedness of the States with the Ministries or departments concerned on coronavirus through video-conferencing.

Meanwhile, India on Tuesday tightened visa rules by cancelling the existing visas for Chinese and foreigners who had visited China last fortnight.

Sudan said screening of passengers was being done at all the 21 airports, international seaports and border crossings. A total of 89,500 passengers of 777 planes were screened so far at the 21 airports, she said.

Sudan said that various precautionary measures were undertaken in close coordination with the Ministries concerned at the Central level. She said the situation was being closely monitored by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Union Health Minister and Cabinet Secretary on a daily basis.

The Union Health Secretary said that new visa restrictions and advisories were issued in view of the emerging scenario globally and asked the States to raise awareness on those. She reviewed the preparedness of all the States and UTs in terms of orientation of health and other agencies, adherence of various prevention and management protocols, awareness regarding prevention of coronavirus among those being screened and those transiting the border with Nepal, self-reporting by these people, isolation wards etc.

Sudan also informed that in order to meet the increasing demand for additional manpower to undertake the screening at airports, the States should provide the required health workforce and other logistic support.

The States bordering Nepal informed that they were taking necessary measures and following up on the guidelines issued by the Government on screening people and surveillance management.

States that do not have airports or seaports said special awareness drives at toll plazas, bus stations and railway stations were being initiated. Kerala, which has reported three positive cases -- all students from China’s Wuhan -- highlighted the close monitoring and surveillance being carried out by it across all administrative units in the State.

The Ministry of Tourism stated that it was coordinating with the Hotels Association for wider self-reporting by travellers visiting religious and other tourist places.

As many as 454 samples were tested, of which 451 were found to be negative and the remaining three positive, Sudan said, adding that 3,935 passengers were under community surveillance in 29 States and Union Territories (UTs).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/aerobridge-screening--visa-curbs-to-prevent-spread-of-coronavirus.html
227,05-2-20,India vanquish Pak to enter U-19 WC final,"Yashasvi Jaiswal batted like a man among boys while Kartik Tyagi reminded Pakistan of Waqar Younis’ toe-crushing yorkers as defending champions India walloped their arch-rivals by 10 wickets to enter their seventh ICC U-19 World Cup final here on Tuesday.

The gulf in class between the two sides was evident as Indian bowlers collectively choked Pakistan to a paltry 172 in 43.1 overs. Left-handed opener Jaiswal then showed his class with an unbeaten knock of 105 off 113 balls, with an equally graceful Divyansh Saxena (59 not out off 99 balls) supporting him in an easy chase completed in only 35.2 overs.

“It’s a dream come true for me. To be able to do this for my country is a great feeling. To score a hundred against Pakistan in a World Cup semi-final is something I can’t put into words,” Jaiswal, who hit eight fours and four sixes, said after winning the “Player of the Match” award. India thus maintained their supremacy over Pakistan at the age-group and senior level in ICC tournaments — both men and women. The “Boys in Blue” earlier reached the summit clash in 2000 (winners), 2006 (runners-up), 2008 (winners), 2012 (winners), 2016 (runners-up) and 2018 (winners).

The current batch with key players, having already played senior representative cricket and five with IPL deals in their bag, showed the difference in skill level and application from their opponents, an aspect that could be attributed to the robust junior cricket structure put in place by none other than Rahul Dravid.

Jaiswal literally toyed with the bowling attack, hitting the Pakistani bowlers towards all parts of the ground. The youngest Indian double centurion in List A cricket finished the game with a six, which also completed his hundred.

En route his hundred, pacer Abbas Afridi was effortlessly hit over deep mid-wicket for a six and then pulled the next one behind square for another six.

The Pakistan bowling attack was pedestrian at best and didn’t have much answers to the drives that flowed from Yashasvi’s blade. Divyansh’s batting was also pleasing to the eye, playing the ball late.

“We were talking about how we needed to stick at the wicket. They bowled well initially and we wanted to ride that out and we knew we could dominate them after that,” Jaiswal added. The match as a contest was over in the first half when Pakistani batsmen had no answer to Tyagi’s pace and Bishnoi’s variations.

Pacer Tyagi (2/32 in 8 overs) bowled yorkers at will while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/46 in 10 overs) was a difficult proposition to read for the Pakistani batsmen after opting to bat.

Pakistan skipper Rohail Nazir (62 off 102 balls) and opener Haider Ali (56 off 77 balls) were the only ones to make significant contributions as their innings lasted 43.1 overs.

While Tyagi’s scorching pace and Bishnoi’s googlies were eye-catching, left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar (1/29 in 7 overs), left-arm seamer Sushant Mishra (3/28 in 8.1 overs) and part-time leg-spinner Yashasvi Jaiswal (1/11 in 3 overs) also kept the rival batsmen under check.

Tyagi, probably one of the fastest bowlers in India in his age category, bowled an inswinging yorker wide off the crease to uproot Irfan Khan’s off-stump and then got his second wicket with an intimidating bouncer that removed tail-ender Tahir Hussain.

He literally aimed for the base of the stumps with deliveries beautifully tailing in, which must have pleased Pakistan coach Ijaz Ahmed, who has seen Waqar bowl a few during his hey days.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-vanquish-pak-to-enter-u-19-wc-final.html
228,05-2-20,"Coronavirus outbreak: China working hard to ensure safety of Indians in country, says ambassador","China on Monday hoped that India will not put trade restrictions and limit movement of people to the country in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic in its Hubei province.

In an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said China's foreign ministry and local governments are working hard to ensure the safety of Indians and people working in Indian diplomatic missions in China.

Admitting that there could be a short-term impact of the epidemic on China's economy, he said the country's internal resilience is growing and it has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility.

“I am confident that it should not and will not be hindered by short-term difficulties. We should not suspend but expand the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries,” he said.

In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, India has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China, like many other countries, as part of precautionary measures to contain spread of the virus.

The death toll in China because of the virus has gone up to 490 while the number of confirmed cases has touched 24,300.

The WHO has declared a global health emergency after coronavirus cases were reported in several parts of the globe.

“We hope that the Indian citizens will not overreact or panic over the outbreak. It is better to remain rational and calm, and judge China's prevention and control efforts with objectivity and compassion,” the envoy said.

He said China, a “responsible” country, is not only protecting the health of its people but also that of people around the world.

“We need your understanding and support for the cooperation between China and India in epidemic control to ensure normal personnel exchanges and trade between the two countries,” he said.

“China is ready to continue to work with India, strengthen communication and coordination, and safeguard the health and safety of Indian citizens in China,” he added.

On the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's economy, Sun said there was no need to be pessimistic about the country's economy as its fundamentals remain unchanged.

He said the Chinese government has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility and the long-term “positive trend” of the Chinese economy will not be impacted by the outbreak of the virus.

“China has rich experience in successfully dealing with SARS and the international financial crisis. This time will be no exception. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently expressed confidence that the Chinese government has sufficient policy space to stabilize economic growth,” he said.

The envoy also mentioned a telephone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wi and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar last week on ways to deal with the situation arising out of the outbreak of the virus.

“In the telephone conversation, Wang said that to address transnational public health challenges in this era of globalisation, we need to stay objective and rational, and step up communication and coordination, and that all should play a constructive role,"" he said.

He added that Jaishankar had conveyed that it is important to evaluate the outbreak in an objective and rational manner and not take actions that may complicate the situation.

On Saturday, 324 Indians were brought back from Wuhan, while another batch of 323 Indians and seven Maldivians were evacuated from the Chinese city on Sunday.

Sun said a declaration of public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak in China is not a vote of no-confidence on China.

“When the director general of WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, it emphasised that it does not recommend any travel or trade restriction.

“This declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but to take care of other countries with relatively poor sanitary conditions. It is not a vote of no confidence in China,” he said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-outbreak--china-working-hard-to-ensure-safety-of-indians-in-country--says-ambassador-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/coronavirus-outbreak--china-working-hard-to-ensure-safety-of-indians-in-country--says-ambassador.html

Inaugurating the US pavilion at the Defexpo-2020, he said industry partners were playing a key role in the growth of Indo-US defence relationship.

""I had the pleasure of travelling back to Washington DC last December to attend the second US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue between Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark T Esper and Indian ministers Rajnath Singh and S Jaishankar.

""Two things from the ministerial dialogue stood out. First, the pace of defence cooperation between the US and India is accelerating. Second, our respective industry partners are playing a key role in the growth of our defence relationship,"" Juster said.

""As the ambassador of the US to India, I have the opportunity to witness the efforts that are spurring the growth of this defence relationship. For example, last fall, I observed the first ever tri-services exercise. Such exercises demonstrate the importance that the US places on the Indo-Pacific region and value of our defence relationship with India,"" he said.

He said both the sides were ""increasingly working together"" to meet common goals and serving common interest.

The US companies' representatives at this pavilion, will undoubtedly play a role in working with India to achieve this goal, he said.

""As the bilateral defence relationship grows, our embassy is dedicated to continuing to work to facilitate cooperation among the government and industries,"" he said.

When asked to comment on New Delhi's concern over weapons supplied to Pakistan being used against India, as after the Balakot strike, Juster evaded a direct reply.

""We are focussed here today on what we can do in partnership with India. And that partnership has continued to accelerate. That is the focus of attention and we regard India as a strategic partner in terms of our defence cooperation,"" he said.

230,05-2-20,'Novel device to detect harmful bacteria in food sample',"Researchers have developed a novel portable device that can perform chemical tests on food samples to detect harmful bacteria, an advance that may lead to quicker ways of preventing foodborne epidemics.

The device, described in the journal Applied Optics, performs chemical assays that produce light, and works with smartphones and laptops to test food samples on-site for harmful E. Coli bacteria.

According to the researchers, including those from Purdue University in the US, the device uses low light from the assay to detect the presence of E. Coli.

They created an electrical circuit with a signal amplifier, and components that send the data to laptops and smartphones via Bluetooth technology.

""Our goal is to create technology and a process that allows for the cost-effective detection of the causes of foodborne illness using an easy, expedient, and efficient process,"" said Euiwon Bae, study co-author from Purdue University.

""This time frame allows for better integrated detection and quicker action to stop more people from getting sick,"" Bae said.

To test the device, the researchers artificially contaminated ground beef with E. Coli, and then used their device to analyse the sample within 10 hours of inoculation.

They rinsed and incubated the beef with an enrichment liquid containing a modified phage -- a virus that infects bacteria.

As the phage infected the E. Coli, they added a chemical, which caused the bacteria to emit light.

The device then detected this light by counting the light pulses, or photons.

""Our assay offers higher sensitivity, lower cost, better portability and other distinct advantages when compared to existing detection methods,"" said Bruce Applegate from Purdue University.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-novel-device-to-detect-harmful-bacteria-in-food-sample--2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/-novel-device-to-detect-harmful-bacteria-in-food-sample-.html

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday released its manifesto promising 24-hour markets on a pilot basis, quality education, health, clean water, 24-hour electricity and “Deshbhakti Curriculum” in Government schools for Delhi Assembly elections.

Released in the presence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, Labour Minister Gopal Rai, the manifesto named “28-point guarantee card” also promises doorstep delivery of ration, free pilgrimage to 10 lakh senior citizens and `1 crore compensation to kin of a safai karamchari if he dies on duty, free spoken English course for youngsters and skill training and job opportunities for housewives.

Kejriwal said, “The AAP will continue its struggle to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill and the Swaraj Bill to involve the public in resolving problems through Mohalla Sabhas. It will also continue to fight and struggle for full statehood for Delhi”.

The party’s manifesto has taken care of every section of society, Kejriwal told reporters.

Sisodia said the AAP will not only continue all its pro-people policies such as 200 units of free electricity, 20 kilolitres of free water every month, free bus ride for women, but has also drawn a roadmap to make Delhi a “truly world class city” in the next five years.

It also promises world class roads, extension of Metro network up to 500 km. “Our vision for the next five years is to take Delhi to the next level by making it a 21st century Capital, highly advanced and progressive Capital of a developed nation so that the entire nation is proud of it.

“This manifesto has been created keeping in mind this idea of a progressive Capital and we cannot do it alone, we need participation and support from the people, from the Centre, and all the agencies in creating a Delhi of our dreams. The manifesto talks about all the communities and sections of the people, including women, traders, contractual workers, sanitation workers, victims of the anti-Sikh riots in 1984, and every other section and community,” said Kejriwal.

The party said its vision is to make every family prosperous. Kejriwal said, “I want to congratulate the sanitation workers that their outstanding demand has been met. The sanitation workers will be given a compensation of `1 crore in case of any unfortunate incident, and regularisation of their employment is also included in our manifesto.”

On extending Delhi Metro’s network to 500 kilometres, Sisodia said the party if voted to power will make it one of the world’s largest Metro networks and will connect several new areas such as Burari, Kirari, Bijwasan, Narela, Karawal Nagar, Mangolpuri and others.

“Along with reviving the Yamuna river, we will work together with the Central Government to develop a beautiful riverside along the banks of the Yamuna. This

will play a big role in maintaining the Yamuna eco-system and in creating a new tourist destination for Delhi,” read the manifesto.

Blaming the BJP-led Central Government of not regularising and changing the land-use of unauthorised colonies, the Deputy CM said, “The AAP will continue to mount pressure on the Central Government to ensure all unauthorised colonies in Delhi get regularised,” he said.

The AAP manifesto also promised to make all contractual employees engaged by the Delhi Government permanent.

“We will ensure that the findings of the Supreme Court appointed-SIT under Justice SN Dhingra are acted upon promptly and the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom get justice,” he said. The party said it would push for Bhojpuri language to be included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

237,05-2-20,AAP’s lame excuses hurt Delhi: PM,"Delhi needs a Govt that gives direction, doesn’t resort to blame game: Modi

Addressing his second election rally in Dwarka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and said Delhi needs a Government that can give direction and doesn’t resort to blame game.

Accusing the AAP for not implementing Central Government’s Ayushman scheme for the poor, Modi said Delhi people are in favour of the BJP and the Opposition parties are having sleepless nights. “The upcoming Delhi elections are the first election of this decade. This decade will belong to India. India’s development will depend on the decisions taken today. People have seen how the AAP Government practises the politics of hate,” Modi said.

Taking a jibe at the AAP Government, Modi said political differences are common among parties, and questioned “is it fine to block the development work for the poor due to these differences? This is what the people in Delhi are witnessing today”.

Referring to non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat scheme, Modi said, “Suppose a person who goes to Hyderabad for work needs to be admitted to hospital. Will this Mohalla Clinic go there?”

He asked, “Why the people of Delhi are deprived of benefits of the Central Government’s schemes for housing and health.”

The PM said Delhi could not be developed due to politics of vote bank and hate. “One should have intention of serving the poor and take tough decisions to work for development,” the PM said.

“People in the Delhi Government raised questions over surgical strikes and Balakot airstrikes by our forces. I have full faith in people of Delhi that they will give reply to such people,” Modi said.

“For the last five years, the way the Central Government has been working is unprecedented; since Independence this has never happened,” said the Prime Minister.

“The number of bank accounts opened for the poor has outnumbered the population of the US; Ayushman Bharat scheme benefited the number of people that outnumbers the combined population of Mexico, Canada and the US,” PM Modi said.

The PM said that over 1,700 illegal colonies have been regularised. How can Delhi forget the subject of right to homes to 40 lakh people? Without taking the name of the AAP, he said that those in power in the national Capital, “were trying to somehow avoid this matter for another two years”.

In Dwarka, Prime Minister Modi raised the issue of the amended Citizenship law and said, “Delhi needs a Government that will stand by the Central Government on major decisions like CAA. You must punish those who insult our forces. The Delhi Government is spreading lies on the issue and the Opposition is provoking the people against the CAA.”

Highlighting the commitments fulfilled by his Government, the PM said that the Government had started a scheme to provide monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for senior citizens and also, our Government had completed Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressway work, which was stuck for years. “We are trying to introduce ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme to ensure that people who migrate to other States for work are not deprived of benefits,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aap---s-lame-excuses-hurt-delhi--pm-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/aap---s-lame-excuses-hurt-delhi--pm.html
238,05-2-20,Do you have CM pick? Kejriwal teases BJP,"Shah retorts our CM is the people of Delhi, ready for debate anytime

With just three days left for the Delhi Assembly elections, AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal dared the BJP to announce its chief ministerial candidate by 1 pm on Wednesday and said he was ready for a public debate with the saffron party’s CM face.

Responding to Kejriwal’s challenge, Home Minister Amit Shah said, “Kejriwal ji asked us to declare our candidate for CM post. For this, there is no need to announce a CM face, just tell and time and place, people from the BJP will to take part in debate. As far as the CM goes, our CM is the people of Delhi.”

While releasing the manifesto, Kejriwal said if the BJP doesn’t announce its CM face, he will meet the Press at 1 pm with his next course of action.

“Manifestoes of BJP and AAP are out. It is important to have a detailed debate and discussion in a democracy, on the key initiatives addressed by different parties in their manifestos. People in a democracy should be able to ask questions and give opinions on the key poll promises of the manifestos,” said Kejriwal.

He said people want to know their CM faces before casting their vote. He also claimed that people are asking how and why we should vote for a party which does not have a CM candidate and if one will vote for the BJP, it will go waste.

“The people want to know the CM face of the BJP. If the people do not know their CM face, how and why should they vote for them? Amit Shah says he will decide the CM face after being voted into power, but the real power to decide the CM in a republic lies in the hands of the people,” said Kejriwal.

AAP chief said Shah is asking people to give him a blank cheque and he will fill the name of the CM after gaining power in Delhi. “But the people want to know the BJP CM face because if there is no CM face, people’s vote to the BJP will go waste,” said Kejriwal, adding in a democracy, the CM is elected and decided by the people not by Shah.

“I tell the people everywhere I go that your each vote will go for Kejriwal but you vote for BJP, who will you actually vote for? The vote will be of no use, it will be wasted. Delhiites are also asking by chance we vote for BJP, who the vote will go for? What if they (BJP) will name some un-educated and incapable person as CM post? Then it will be betrayal to the people of Delhi. Thus, the people will decide and choose their CM not Shah, says Kejriwal.

The Assembly polls in Delhi are scheduled on February 8 and the results will be out on 11th February.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/do-you-have-cm-pick--kejriwal-teases-bjp.html

In one of the recent episodes of ""Bigg Boss 13"", Rashami was seen talking about how badly she wants to end her relationship with Arhan after coming out of the house. She even said that she was unaware of Arhan's previous marriage until host Salman Khan revealed the news to her on the show a while ago.

But this did not go down well with Arhan, who also participated in the show and later got evicted. According to him, Rashami is lying.

In a recent interview to Bombay Times, Arhan said: ""Rashami knew about my marriage before she entered the house. She didn't know about the child, though. I would have told her at the right time.""

He also said that he's been projected as a villain on the show.

""I have been projected as a villain and it's humiliating. I am sure that her actions or silence could be a result of circumstances and situations inside the house.

""Every time, if he has pushed me, nudged me, I've done it too. If you set the bar, I'll raise it. You do it for the good, I'll do better. You do it for the bad, I'll do worse. It's how you are to me. Whatever has come to me I've just given it back,"" he added.

243,05-2-20,'Ray Donovan' axed after seven seasons,"Weeks after its seventh season finale, ""Ray Donovan"" has been cancelled at Showtime.

The last chapter of the legal drama concluded on January 19 on a cliffhanger, which will now serve as the series finale.

Liev Schreiber played the titular role of a fixer in the show who arranges bribes, payoffs, threats, and other illegal activities, to ensure the outcome desired by the client.

Soon after the last episode's airing, Schreiber told the fans of the series to ""reach out"" to the network if they want another season.

On Tuesday, Showtime announced that they were pulling the plug on the show.

""After seven incredible seasons, 'Ray Donovan' has concluded its run on Showtime. We are proud that the series ended amid such strong viewership and on such a powerful note.

""Our deepest thanks go to Liev Schreiber, Jon Voight, showrunner David Hollander and the entire cast and crew, past and present, for their dedicated work,"" the premium cabler said in a statement as reported by Variety.

244,05-2-20,There's a class system in film industry: Hina Khan,"There is a class system in the film industry which makes it hard for television actors to get a breakthrough, says TV star Hina Khan.

The ""Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai"" star, who is making her Bollywood debut with Vikram Bhatt's psychological thriller ""Hacked"", believes TV actors are as good as their cinema counterparts but are pigeonholed.

""There is a class system in the film industry. Be it anything -- the big designers or the productions banners -- I have been judged so many times because of my TV background. People from the industry don't even give us opportunity. We are equally talented,"" Khan told PTI in an interview.

The 32-year-old actor claimed she faced rejection in the Hindi film industry because of her TV roots.

""When it comes to Bollywood and all the 'biggies' out there, one really needs to prove themselves at another level.

""I don't know if one film can make a difference because it is tough to get noticed. I have faced a lot because of the tag of a TV actor. People told me things like, 'You are a television actor, you won't be able to pull off the character',"" she said.

Asserting that getting into films for TV actors is not a cakewalk, Khan said she is grateful to Bhatt for the opportunity.

""There is a reason Mr Bhatt trusted me. He could have invested his money in somebody from Bollywood or a newcomer, but he decided to take me in the film because I could break that mould of an innocent girl. It, however, doesn't happen often with TV actors,"" she said.

The actor said though she owes her success and popularity to ""Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai"", she has consciously ""tried"" to break the character of Akshara, the doe-eyed daughter-in-law in the soap opera.

After playing Akshara, Khan later went on star in ""Kasautii Zindagii Kay"" reboot in which she took on the grey character of Komolika, originally played by Urvashi Dholakia.

""I'm very proud of that show ('Ye Rishta...) because it has given me what I'm today. With other shows I have tried to break the stereotype, convince people and tell them that I'm not just an innocent girl, I can also play a grey character. I want to prove that I'm a versatile actor,"" she said.

""I have worked a lot to come out of that mould and unlearn a lot of things to start my career in movies, but there is a dearth of opportunities. Forget about playing a lead role, I'm even up for doing some pivotal character role. At least people will get to know what I can do,"" she added.

The actor said her film ""Hacked"" does not only revolve around cyber crime like hacking, but also attempts to shine a light on crimes against women.

""As a woman, this story was important for me. Hacking and stalking can happen with anyone, but women are subjected to it more. Men don't get stalked as much as women do. Also women don't open up about it.

""Initially, I was sceptical to take up a subject that has never been touched before. Stalking is not even taken seriously as a crime. People casually talk about stalking. You speak to any woman who has dealt with it, her life is miserable. With this film, if I'm able to give some strength to women out their, I will be more than happy,"" Khan said.

245,05-2-20,"Twitter to label fake, manipulating tweets from March 5","In yet another bid to take action against the circulation of synthetic and manipulating media on its platform, Twitter on Wednesday announced a new policy where it would begin labeling such content from March 5.

Twitter said the people may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.

""In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand the media's authenticity and to provide additional context,"" the micro-blogging platform said in a statement.

From march 5, Twitter will apply a label to the Tweet, show a warning to people before they Retweet or like the Tweet; reduce the visibility of the Tweet on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended; and/or provide additional explanations or clarifications, as available, such as a landing page with more context.

""In most cases, we will take all of the above actions on Tweets we label. Our teams will start labeling Tweets with this type of media on March 5, 2020,' said the company.

""The Twitter Rules are a living document, meaning that our policies and enforcement approach evolves continuously to address emerging behaviours online,"" said Mahima Kaul, Director Public Policy, India and South Asia.

""To build the Synthetic and Manipulated Media policy, we solicited feedback from civil society organisations globally through a survey published in multiple languages including English, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese,"" said Kaul.

Twitter admitted that this will be a challenge and it will make errors along the way.

""We appreciate the patience. However, we're committed to doing this right,"" it said.

Before preparing a new policy, Twitter did a survey on the initial draft of this rule and gathered more than 6,500 responses from people around the world.

It also consulted with a diverse, global group of civil society and academic experts on the new rule.

""Globally, more than 70 percent of people who use Twitter said ataking no action' on misleading altered media would be unacceptable.

Nearly 9 out of 10 individuals said placing warning labels next to significantly altered content would be acceptable.

More than 90 percent of people who shared feedback support Twitter removing this content when it's clear that it is intended to cause certain types of harm.

""More than 75 percent of people believe accounts that share misleading altered media should face enforcement action. Enforcement actions could include people on Twitter having to delete their Tweet or having their account suspended,' said the survey.

247,05-2-20,"China coronavirus toll soars to 490, total confirmed cases over 24000","The death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak rose to 490 on Tuesday while the total number of confirmed cases mounted to 24324, Chinese health officials announced on Wednesday.

By the end of Tuesday, a total of 490 people had died after being infected and 24,324 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions, China's National Health Commission reported.

It said 65 deaths were reported on Tuesday, all from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan.

Also 3,887 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported on Tuesday, it said.

Also on Tuesday, 431 patients became seriously ill, while 262 were discharged from hospital after recovery.

The commission added that 3,219 patients remained in severe condition and 23,260 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.

A total of 892 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery, it said.

Over 2.52 lakh who were in close contacts with patients had been traced with over 1.85 lakh others still under medical observation, it added.

By the end of Tuesday, 18 confirmed cases had been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), including one death, 10 in the Macao SAR and 11 in Taiwan, it said.

As the novel coronavirus, regarded as the most virulent in recent years, showed no signs of abatement, China has intensified its efforts to contain its spread by opening more hospitals in Hubei province to exclusively treat its patients.

A 1000-bed makeshift hospital was opened on Monday.

Another 1,300-bed hospital is set to be ready on Wednesday. Both will be run by hundreds of military medical personnel.

Authorities in Wuhan on Tuesday said they would build eight more mobile cabin hospitals to treat the patients, China Daily reported.

All the Chinese cities including Beijing have been reporting daily increase in the cases of the virus, which has no cure yet. The virus has now spread to over 20 countries.

The Philippines reported the first overseas death from the virus on Sunday while 176 cases have been reported from abroad so far. India has reported three cases of the coronavirus. All the three patients from Kerala recently returned from the affected Wuhan city.

India on Tuesday further tightened visa rules by cancelling the existing visas for Chinese and foreigners who had visited the country in the last two weeks.

On February 2, India temporarily suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China in view of the outbreak.

Currently, 647 Indians and seven Maldivians, who have been evacuated from Wuhan and Hubei are in 14-day quarantine at a medical camp in Manesar, near Delhi.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the media here that 16 foreigners in China have been infected with the virus.

She, however, declined to provide details of their nationalities in her Tuesday media briefing, citing privacy concerns.

According to reports, those infected included four Pakistanis and two Australians. Wuhan has thousands of foreigners as it is an education hub. Hundreds of Pakistani have been pleading to their government to evacuate them citing successful evacuation by the Indian government.

China has struggled to contain the virus despite implementing unprecedented measures, including virtually locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei.

While the virus cases increased by the hour, Chinese health officials attributed the spiralling rate of cases and the death toll to shortages of hospitals mainly in Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan.

Also Chinese officials have converted the national auditorium and gymnasium in Wuhan into a hospital to exclusively treat growing number of coronavirus cases.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that the outbreak of the deadly virus does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"".

In its report on Tuesday, they WHO said dramatic measures taken by China to rein in the virus has prevented significant spread abroad.

The UN health agency's chief also called for greater global solidarity, accusing some governments of wealthy countries of being ""well behind"" in sharing data on virus cases.

""While 99 percent of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases,"" the UN health agency's chiefs aid in a technical briefing to the WHO's Executive Board in Geneva.

248,05-2-20,Hyundai halts Korea output as China outbreak fallout spreads,"Hyundai Motors is suspending production in South Korea, a sign that the economic fallout from China's viral outbreak is spreading.

For other companies bracing for losses from coronavirus, the damage has so far been delayed, thanks to a stroke of timing: The outbreak hit just when Chinese factories and many businesses were closed anyway to let workers travel home for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday .

But the respite won't last.

If much of industrial China remains on lockdown for the next few weeks, a very real possibility, Western retailers, auto companies and manufacturers that depend on Chinese imports will start to run out of the goods they depend on.

In order to meet deadlines for summer goods, retail experts say that Chinese factories would need to start ramping up production by March 15. If Chinese factories were instead to remain idle through May 1, it would likely cripple retailers' crucial back-to-school and fall seasons.

""There's complete uncertainty,'' said Steve Pasierb, CEO of the Toy Industry Association. ""This could be huge if it goes on for months.""

Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak hit hardest, is a center of automotive production. It's been closed off, along with neighboring cities, isolating more than 50 million people and bringing factories to a standstill.

So far, U.S. Automakers haven't had to curb production for want of Chinese parts. But David Closs, professor emeritus at Michigan State University's Department of Supply Chain Management, said the clock is ticking.

""I would say it's weeks at the most,'' Closs said. “One to two to three weeks.''

Hyundai said Tuesday that it was suspending production in South Korea ""due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China'' and that it ""was seeking alternative suppliers in other regions.''

The partial shutdown of Wuhan has already harmed the production of TV display panels and raised prices, according to a report by research group IHS Markit.

The city has five factories making liquid crystal displays, known as LCDs, and organic light-emitting diodes, known as OLEDs, both of which are used for television and laptop monitors. China accounts for more than half of the global production capacity for making these display panels.

David Hsieh, an analyst at IHS Markit, said in a report that ""these factories are facing shortages of both labor and key components as a result of mandates designed to limit the contagion's spread,"" leading suppliers to raise panel prices more aggressively.

Phone-maker Motorola, which has a facility in Wuhan, said that so far, it expects little impact because it has a flexible global supply chain and multiple factories around the world. Its priority has been the welfare of local employees, Motorola, which is owned by the Chinese electronics giant Lenovo, said in a statement.

Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last week that the company's contractors in China had been forced to delay reopening factories that closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Cook said the company is seeking ways to minimize supply disruptions. Some of its suppliers are in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak. Most of Apple's iPhones and other devices are made in China.

In the meantime, economists are sharply downgrading the outlook for China's economy, the world's second-biggest. Tommy Wu and Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics have slashed their forecast for Chinese economic growth this year from 6% to 5.4%. They expect most of the damage to be inflicted in the first three months of 2020.

“But a more serious and long-lasting impact cannot be ruled out,'' they wrote Monday.

Forecasters are contending with unknowns. No one knows how long the outbreak will last, how much damage it will cause or how policymakers will respond to the threat.

“We're grasping for precedents,'' said Phil Levy, chief economist at the freight company Flexport who was an economic adviser in the administration of President George W. Bush.

Some look back to the SARS outbreak, which paralyzed the Chinese economy for the first few months of 2003. But the damage from SARS faded quickly: China was booming again by year's end. And the world economy emerged mostly unscathed.

But times have changed in ways that are not favorable to containing the economic damage. Back then, China was the world's workshop for cheap goods - toys and sneakers, for instance. Now, China has moved up to sophisticated machine parts and electronics like LCDs. And it accounts for about 16% of global economic output, up significantly from just 4% in 2003.

Levy said he was struck by how U.S. Airlines reacted to the coronavirus: They suspended flights between the United States and mainland China for weeks - American airlines through March 27, United through March 28 and Delta until April 30.

The move doesn't just affect tourists, students and business travelers. Caryn Livingston, editor of Air Cargo World, noted that about half of air cargo has historically been transported in the bellies of passenger aircraft.

“When you see them loading those big 747s, that's not just your luggage,'' Levy said. “That can be pallets full of electronics and other things.'' The health crisis coincides with an especially difficult time for China's factories.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hyundai-halts-korea-output-as-china-outbreak-fallout-spreads-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/hyundai-halts-korea-output-as-china-outbreak-fallout-spreads.html
249,05-2-20,Kia Motors launches premium MPV Carnival at Auto Expo,"South Korean auto maker Kia Motors on Wednesday launched its premium multi purpose vehicle Carnival, and showcased a new concept for a global SUV Sonet at the Auto Expo here.

Carnival is being launched in India in three different specifications at a starting price of Rs 24.95 lakh for its Premium variant (ex-showroom), Rs 28.95 lakh for its Prestige variant (ex-showroom), and Rs 33.95 lakh for its Limousine variant (ex-showroom).

Kia Sonet concept will be developed further ahead of a launch in the Indian market in the second half of 2020.

Kia Motors India said it had received more than 1,400 bookings for the new car on the first day of orders and has a total of more than 3,500 bookings received till date.

Kia had entered the Indian market with its SUV Seltos, which was displayed as SP Concept in the previous edition of the Auto Expo in 2018.

Commenting on the India journey, Kia Motors India MD and CEO Kookhyun Shim said: ""We have sought to understand Indian customers' aspirations, and match them with best-in-class products and services.""

He further said, ""Our latest vehicle, Kia Carnival, is a clear example of this approach. Though it represents a leap up from the Seltos, into a premium, aspirational segment, it has been devised with the same passion.""

Shim further said, ""As the Indian market evolves, we will continue to offer customers here the best and most innovative products and services.”

Kia Sonet concept is a compact SUV which will take on the likes of Maruti Suzuki's Vitara Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Ford Ecosport.

Kia Motors said the vehicle will be launched in India in the second half of 2020.

Carnival, on the other hand, looks to enter a segment dominated by Toyota's Innova Crystal. It is powered by a 2.2-liter VGT BS6 diesel engine, paired with an eight-speed ""Sportsmatic"" transmission.

Kia is also showcasing its Seltos X-Line Concept, a bolder reinterpretation of the Seltos SUV along with Soul EV, Niro EV, compact SUV XCeed and compact utility vehicle Stonic.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kia-motors-launches-premium-mpv-carnival-at-auto-expo-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/kia-motors-launches-premium-mpv-carnival-at-auto-expo.html
250,05-2-20,Malaysia's former first lady goes on trial for corruption,"Malaysia's former first lady, who allegedly bankrolled a luxurious lifestyle with kickbacks and stolen public money, went on trial Wednesday for corruption for the first time since her husband lost power.

Rosmah Mansor, notorious for making overseas shopping trips and owning vast collections of handbags and jewellery, became a lightning rod for public anger as the government of prime minister Najib Razak was engulfed by corruption allegations.

Her husband's long-ruling coalition suffered a shock election defeat in 2018 in large part due to claims he and his officials plundered billions of dollars from sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.

Both Najib and his wife have since been hit with multiple charges over the looting of the investment vehicle, but Rosmah's first trial centres on allegations she received bribes linked to a government project.

Prosecutors allege she pocketed 6.5 million ringgit ($1.6 million) for helping a company secure the project to provide solar power generators to schools on the Malaysian part of Borneo island.

The 68-year-old is also accused of soliciting a further 187.5 million ringgit. Rosmah faces three counts of corruption for the offences, which allegedly took place in 2016 and 2017.

Rosmah, known for her imperious manner and enormous mane of hair, denied all the charges as proceedings began at the Kuala Lumpur High Court.

The former prime minister's wife ""occupied no official position. However, she wielded considerable influence by her own overbearing nature"", said prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram in his opening statement.

""She placed herself in a position where she was able to influence decisions in the public sector.""

The trial was supposed to start Monday but was delayed after Rosmah was admitted to hospital complaining of neck pain. On Wednesday she arrived in a car followed by an ambulance, and limped into the courtroom.

Najib, who is on trial at the High Court over the looting of 1MDB, made an appearance in the courtroom as the trial got underway.

The former leader and his wife's lavish lifestyles came to symbolise the perceived rot in Malaysia's ruling elite.

Following the 2018 election, police discovered valuables -- including cash, jewellery and luxury handbags -- worth up to $273 million in properties linked to the couple.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/malaysia-s-former-first-lady-goes-on-trial-for-corruption-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/malaysia-s-former-first-lady-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.html

252,05-2-20,A smaller Expo this time,"Biennial celebration is smaller than it has been for a long time and just got hit by the coronavirus outbreak as well

With the 15th Auto Expo set to open at the India Exposition Mart in Greater Noida on Wednesday, with the first of two media days, the Indian automotive industry wants to put a terrible eighteen months behind it.

However, the show this year will have several large companies skip the event, so much so that in the main halls, where the event was spread over two levels only a single level will be used this time. Almost all of India’s leading two-wheeler manufacturers are not taking part; with Hero MotoCorp, Honda Two-Wheelers, Bajaj Auto and TVS all skipping the meet, there has been a lot of speculation about the large-scale withdrawal of the motorcycle and scooter manufacturers with sources inside the companies saying that their launches tend to get overshadowed by those of car manufacturers.

But it is not just two-wheeler companies skipping the show this year, with several major car companies in India, including Honda Cars, Nissan-Datsun, Ford and Toyota all skipping the event as well. With the exception of Mercedes-Benz, most luxury car manufacturers are giving the event a miss. Several of the companies skipping the show are doing so for the first time in their history. The weak economy and lower sales coupled with the huge expenditure incurred by companies on the rapid transition to BS6 emission norms have hit home hard. This is also evident in the length of the show, curtailed to just five days, two days for the media on February 5-6, a Business day on February 7 and public days over the weekend on February 8 and 9, although with Delhi going to the polls on February 8, attendance could be hit but the new Noida Metro Aqua Line should help those attending make it to from the Capital.

And in another blow to the event, the coronavirus outbreak in China has hit the one part of the show that observers were keenly awaiting, the charge of the Chinese carmakers into India. With the shows organisers taking several precautions after the Indian Government announced that it will not allow visitors from China, even with valid visas, entry into India. Several Chinese companies were exhibiting at the show, notably Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation through its brand MG Motor and Great Wall Motors which has announced plans to enter India with their Haval brand of Sports Utility Vehicles. The Auto Expo’s organisers, the Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers (SIAM) has issued a statement saying that the Chinese exhibitors have assured that only local representatives will stand at stalls.

It is not just doom and gloom though, several companies are going to showcase new products, these include the country’s two largest carmakers Maruti and Hyundai, the latter launching the second-generation of their bestselling SUV, the Creta. Maruti Suzuki plans to outline how they are going down the path of increased electrification of vehicles with their ‘Futuro-E’ concept. The Volkswagen group will also showcase their new identity in India now that they are headed up by Czech brand Skoda and their new ‘India 2.0’ strategy with some new SUV’s.

Tata Motors will also showcase several new products and concepts and recent entrant Kia Motors will unveil their new compact SUV for the first time globally. But will all this be enough to save the show?",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-smaller-expo-this-time-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/a-smaller-expo-this-time.html
253,05-2-20,Shannen Doherty reveals stage 4 cancer diagnosis,"""Beverly Hills 90210"" star Shannen Doherty has been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, the actor has revealed.

The 48-year-old actor, also known for ""Charmed"", announced in 2017 that she was in remission for breast cancer that had been initially diagnosed in 2015.

""It's going to come out in a matter of days or a week that I have stage 4. So my cancer came back and that's why I'm here,"" Doherty said appearing on ABC News on Tuesday.

The actor said she decided to go public with her diagnosis because the court filings of a legal battle, which she is fighting against an insurance company include her current health status, are set to release this week.

""I'd rather people hear it from me,"" she asserted.

Doherty said she has been dealing with the disease in private for more than a year now, while continuing to work, including shooting for the ""Beverly Hills"" reboot, ""BH90210.""

She was contemplating her diagnosis while she mourning the death of her ""90210"" co-star and friend Luke Perry last year.

""It was so weird for me to be diagnosed and then somebody who was seemingly healthy to go first. It was really shocking and the least I could do to honour him was do that show. I still haven't done enough in my opinion.

""It's a hard one because I thought when I finally do come out, I would have worked and worked 16 hours a day and people can look at that and say, 'Oh my God, she can work and other people with stage 4 can work. Our life doesn't end the minute we get that diagnosis. We still have some living to do,"" she added.

Doherty said she is yet to come to terms with the return of the disease.

""I don't think that I've processed it. It's a bitter pill to swallow in a lot of ways. I definitely have days where I say, 'Why me?' And then I go, 'Well why not me? Who else? Who else beside me deserves this?'

""None of us do. I would say that my first reaction is always concern about how am I going to tell my mom, my husband.""

The actor is married to photographer Kurt Iswarienko.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shannen-doherty-reveals-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/shannen-doherty-reveals-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis.html

255,05-2-20,"Iyer hits maiden ton; Rahul, Kohli too shine in India's 347","Talented Shreyas Iyer hit his maiden century while KL Rahul and skipper Virat Kohli carried on their fine form as India dished out a clinical batting effort to post 347 for four against New Zealand in the first ODI here on Wednesday.

Iyer showed why he is considered as the next big thing in Indian cricket, scoring 103 off 107 balls, his first ODI ton.

Besides, Rahul continued his purple patch, smashing unbeaten 88 off 64 balls while Kohli made 51 off 63 deliveries.

Iyer's knock was laced with 11 fours and a six and together with Rahul shared 136 runs for the fourth wicket as India scored 96 runs in the last 10 overs after being sent into bat.

This was after Tom Blundell featured his maiden ODI for the Black Caps, while India gave debuts to two openers -- Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal.

It was the fourth such instance in Indian history with Rahul-Karun Nair being the last such pair in 2016 against Zimbabwe.

Shaw and Agarwal got the innings off to quick start, adding 50 off 48 balls for the opening stand.

But both Shaw and Agarwal fell in the space of five balls as India were reduced to 54 for 2.

Shaw was the first to go, nicking behind a Colin de Grandhomme (1/41) delivery, while Agarwal was caught at point by Blundell off Southee (2/85).

It brought Kohli and Iyer together, and they dominated the middle overs with a 102-run stand for the third wicket. They manoeuvred the field well and kept the scorecard ticking as India crossed 150 in the 28th over.

Kohli fell against the run of play as a wrong one from Ish Sodhi (1/27) got through his defence to clip the leg stump.

Rahul though didn't let the innings lose any momentum as he smacked six sixes along with three fours.

But the day belonged to Iyer, who, despite a scratchy start, had crossed 50 off 66 balls. Once he passed the 50-run mark, the stylish right-hander batted fluently to notch up his first century in 16 ODIs.

The centurion fell shortly afterwards, caught off Southee even as Rahul took control.

He reached his half-century off 41 balls as India eased past 300 in the 47th over.

Rahul's carnage meant that New Zealand conceded 191 runs in the last 20 overs.

Kedar Jadhav remained unbeaten on 26 off 15 balls, stitching 55 off 27 balls with Rahul.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iyer-hits-maiden-ton--rahul--kohli-too-shine-in-india-s-347-4-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/iyer-hits-maiden-ton--rahul--kohli-too-shine-in-india-s-347-4.html
256,05-2-20,"Iyer maiden ODI ton goes in vain, Kiwis record first win of India tour","Young batsman Shreyas Iyer's maiden ODI hundred went in vain as New Zealand defeated India by four wickets in the series-opener, here on Wednesday.

Producing a commanding batting performance, India posted a competitive 347 for four but seasoned Ross Taylor anchored the Kiwi chase with an unbeaten 109-run knock.

The hosts overhauled the stiff target with 11 balls to spare with the Indian bowlers struggling badly despite having a big total to defend.

It was New Zealand's first win since India landed in the country with the hosts suffering a humiliating whitewash in the five-match T20 series.

The Kiwis were quite comfortable in their chase but lost wickets of Tom Latham (69) and James Neesham (9) and Colin de Grandhomme (1) when they were close to the target. Taylor ensured that the host do not snatch yet another defeat from a strong position.

Earlier, sent into, Iyer (103 off 107 balls) scored his maiden ODI century, while KL Rahul (88 not out) and skipper Virat Kohli (51) made fine fifties in the first match of the three-game series.

Tim Southee (2/85) picked up two wickets for the hosts.

Brief Scores:

India: 347 for 4 in 50 overs (Shreyas Iyer 103, KL Rahul 88 not out, Virat Kohli 51; Tim Southee 2/85).

New Zealand: 348 for 6 in 48.1 overs.

257,05-2-20,"Latham's innings took away momentum from India, says Kohli","Ross Taylor got the hundred but India captain Virat Kohli said it was Tom Latham's 48-ball 69 that took away the momentum from his side in the high-scoring first ODI against New Zealand here on Wednesday.

New Zealand recorded their highest-ever run chase, 348, riding on Ross Taylor's 84-ball-109 not out and stand-in skipper Latham's attacking half-century.

""It was an outstanding performance by New Zealand. We thought 348 was good enough. Ross is the experienced batsman they have but Tom's innings was the one that took away the momentum. Credit to Taylor and Tom,"" Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

India were below-par on the field with Kuldeep Yadav dropping a skier and bowlers doing a less than commendable job.

""Look, we didn't grab onto one chance, but we were decent. Something we need to keep (on) improving. We can't focus too much (on negative things). Today, the opposition played better than us and they deserved to win,"" Kohli said.

For India, Shreyas Iyer stood out with his maiden ODI hundred.

The Indian captain also seemed satisfied with the performance by debutants Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw, who gave the team a 50-plus start even though they failed to get big scores.

""I think the debutants gave us a good start and hopefully they continue. (Shreyas) Iyer was outstanding getting his first ODI hundred under pressure, KL (Rahul) again. These are positives for us.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/latham-s-innings-took-away-momentum-from-india--says-kohli-2020-02-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/latham-s-innings-took-away-momentum-from-india--says-kohli.html
