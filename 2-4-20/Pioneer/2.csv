0,02-4-20,The virus is saving lives as the Earth is healing,"Stanford University has conducted a research on the long-term benefits of this current rejuvenation of the planet due to the lockdowns and the study showed that humanity will benefit tremendously in future due to the respite received by the environment

As the old proverb goes, “Every dark cloud has a silver lining.” The ongoing COVID-19 crisis, too, has a silver lining as it has given the environment the much-needed break from the relentless degradation and exploitation by mankind.

The Earth is healing itself even as its biggest “parasite” humanity, grapples with the virus by practicing social distancing amid strict lockdowns. Suddenly, the urban as well as peri-urban areas have started experiencing a resurgence of nature as the lockdowns have brought with them fresh air, clearer skies and the revival of urban wildlife.

The social media is abuzz with citizens posting pictures of the night sky glittering with stars that were not visible till now in most cities due to the pollution. They are also posting videos of wildlife like deer, Blue Bulls, the rare Indian Civet and so on, straying into towns. There are more birds singing these days and the flora is actually looking green instead of the usual dusty brown. The light showers in the last few weeks have only helped to further bring down pollution and freshen up nature.

The city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic has been witnessing clear blue skies and fresh air instead of the usual low-hanging smog. In fact, satellite images of China collated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), showed major reduction in Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels due to the restrictions imposed in the wake of the virus containment efforts. The European Space Agency (ESA) also reported similar findings of a drop in NO2 levels across Europe, especially Italy. The canals of Venice, now devoid of the boat traffic sport clearer waters with a fresh spurt in aquatic life.

Furthermore, the suspension of all air traffic in most parts of the world, including India and the lack of vehicular traffic on roads due to the lockdowns have considerably reduced pollution levels and especially eased particulate matter (PM) 2.5 woes.

Stanford University has conducted a research on the long-term benefits of this current rejuvenation of the planet and the study showed that humanity will stand to benefit tremendously in future due to the respite received by the environment. These benefits would translate into lives being saved on account of reduced pollution levels of the PM 2.5 kind, which claim lives of children and the elderly.

The study’s findings were eventually published in the interdisciplinary group, Global Food, Environment and Economic Dynamics (GFEED). Other research data from across the world also supports these findings and additionally suggests that China is currently experiencing a 25 per cent drop in Carbon Dioxide emissions which is equivalent to 200 tonnes.

Research aside, the fact that it required a pandemic for the environment to experience this much-required relief and recovery, is appalling. Our daily routines do not offer any concessions or respite for the environment. Neither do the periodic climate conferences which become a battleground of opposing views but witness very little meaningful action in the best interests of the planet. In India, too, the peak polluting months witness us adopting environmental-conservation measures in a half-hearted manner. Compliance with regulations then, is not anywhere near the current level of obedience that we are witnessing now regarding the lockdowns. This is unfortunate as it shows that we humans respond with sincerity only when our lives are threatened.

The current phase can be a major learning curve for the Indian Government and environmental authorities. The pattern of public behaviour and response to a matter of community emergency is evident here and the Government must take note of the same. So that in future, when environmental conditions worsen and require a community-based action the Government can follow a similar methodology. This is essential because the current lockdown rules — though not 100 per cent successful — have been followed sincerely by many of the citizens.

The current situation also highlights another important aspect of how nations and governments measure the real-time improvement or deterioration of the environment. The authoritative and authentic satellite visuals of the ESA and NASA were relied upon to draw conclusions on the state of the environment of China and Europe. India, too, must stop politics over environmental assessment and data collection and instead rely on impartial international data. This will provide the real picture and disable any attempts at manipulation of State agency data by vested interests.

The rejuvenation of the Earth comes as a succor at the time of anguish and pain to mankind. Every human being pauses, even if it is for a second, to marvel at the beauty of nature and forgets the hardships being faced in this difficult time. If humanity needs a break from this pandemic, the environment needs a break from us.

1,02-4-20,‘CM: No salary deduction for govt staff for lockdown,"



|

Declaring that salary of state government employees would not be deducted for the lockdown period, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that people should remain indoors and stay safe so that lockdown could be effectively implemented.

The chief minister issued this directive during a meeting of COVID officers in Lucknow on Wednesday while reviewing the lockdown and availability of essential commodities in the market.

“The only way to defeat coronavirus is to implement lockdown effectively. If we can ensure that people stay at home, we can win this battle decisively,” he said.

The chief minister asked officials to ensure that people got all basic necessities like milk, vegetable, rice, flour and pulses easily at MRP (maximum retail price).

“There is apprehension that salary of government employees could be deducted for the lockdown period. This apprehension is baseless. Salary of employees will not be deducted. Even in private sectors, owners should pay full salary to their employees. This is a time of crisis and everyone should chip in with their contribution,” Yogi said.

The chief minister asked the Energy department not to take fixed charge from industries during the lockdown period.

“It is the responsibility of the state government to look after migrant workers staying in shelter homes across the state. Provide them water and food regularly and if anyone needs medical help, do extended it also. Those who are fasting during Navratri be provided fruits,” the chief minister said and added that no one should be allowed to travel in goods train and the guilty be punished as per law..

Yogi also asked officials to send action taken report to the prime minister and home minister’s offices regularly.

The chief minister further said that as procurement of wheat would start from April 15, officers should ensure that all mandis were sanitised.

“If need be, fire-tenders be used for this purpose. During the purchase of wheat, social distancing should also be ensured,” he said.

During that meeting, Yogi also enquired about the operation of community kitchens and said that the facility be extended to all areas where the poor live. “Daily wage earners should get the benefit of these community kitchens,” he added.

Yogi also asked officials to look for options to start out patient department (OPD) so that basic health facilities could be extended to the people. “Retired PHMS and Army Medical Corps doctors can be employed for this purpose. If need be, doctors should provide consultation over phone,” he said.

Industrial Development Commissioner Alok Kumar informed the chief minister that all flour mills, rice mills and oil mills were operating as per directions of Health department.

DGP HC Awasthi said that gloves and masks had been made available to all police personnel of the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---cm--no-salary-deduction-for-govt-staff-for-lockdown.html
2,02-4-20,"Pvt hosps, clinics to open for specific time every day","The Uttar Pradesh government issued orders to all district authorities to ensure that all private hospitals and clinics opened for a specific time every day.

Chief Secretary RK Tiwari said on Wednesday that the district administrations should ensure that all private hospitals and nursing homes along with clinics opened for at least a few hours so that basic health facilities could be extended to the people.

“The authorities should also ensure that private doctors should prefer to attend to patients at their residences,” Tiwari said.

The directive said that private hospitals should not only provide emergency services but also take care of regular patients.

Meanwhile, the government notified COVID-19 hospitals of which 80 are Level 1 in rural areas, 51 are Level 2 hospitals at divisional and district levels and six hospitals are of Level 3 in major cities and include hospitals of medical colleges in Prayagraj, Jhansi Meerut, SGPGI, Lucknow and PGI, Saifai.

These hospitals will have 200 beds dedicated for COVID-19 treatment and at least 40 ventilators.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pvt-hosps--clinics-to-open-for-specific-time-every-day.html
3,02-4-20,Police to ensure social distancing as banks become fully operational,"



|

With banks set to restore normal functioning after government order, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi issued directive that police arrangement be made to ensure social distancing and other norms.

Apprehending that a large number of people, including old age pensioners and labourers, would be queuing up at banks to withdraw money, the government directed the police force to help bank officials in ensuring social distancing.

“Banks will work normally between 10 am and 4 pm till further orders. Hence all district police chiefs have been directed to deploy policemen in banks for helping bank officials and ensure health norms,” Awasthi said.

It may be mentioned here that the dues of MGNREGA workers, salary of employees and monetary relief to the poor, farmers and others have been transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries and hence people in large number are expected to swarm banks as they open. This might lead to violation of social distancing norms and make it difficult for officials to ensure safety measures.

Meanwhile in Bareilly, amid apprehensions of two officials of State Bank of India’s zonal office being suspected cases of coronavirus infection after coming in contact with positive patients, the office was evacuated in Subhash Nagar area on Wednesday. About 300 people work in the zonal office.

SBI Divisional General Manager Pradeep Kumar. posted at the zonal office, said that apart from being evacuated, the office was also sanitised. Both suspected officials are under supervision of doctors.

Of the six residents of Subhash Nagar who tested positive for the virus, one is a loco-pilot at Bareilly junction and had been in contact with 32 people, including loco lobby (running staff) and operating staff. Later, these 32 people were quarantined in Moradabad division of Northern Railway. The loco-pilot had brought Ala Hazrat Express to Bareilly Junction on March 25.

A five-kilometre radius has been sealed in Subhash Nagar area.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-to-ensure-social-distancing-as-banks-become-fully-operational.html

6,02-4-20,Informing admn about corona suspects leads to killing of woman,"Passing on information about a suspected coronavirus patient led to the murder of a woman in Mainpuri while a street vendor was killed for not serving ‘chaat’ during lockdown in Lakhimpur Kheri.

In Mainpuri, Vinay Yadav of Annipur hamlet of Kurra was engaged as a rojgar sewak. On Tuesday, Army personnel Shailendra Yadav and his cab driver brother Gaurav Yadav of New Delhi returned home. Suspecting them to be afflicted by the coronavirus, Vinay included their names as visitors from outside and gave it to the local authorities for action.

On coming to know about this, Shailendra threatened Vinay to remove his and Gaurav’s name from the list, but the latter refused and asked them to go for medical check-up for the safety of other villagers.

On Wednesday morning, things got ugly when Shailendra, Gaurav and other kin struck at Vinay’s house and opened fire in which Vinay’s sister-in-law Sandhya Yadav (32) was killed. Before the police reached the crime scene, the assailants escaped.

A case was registered and efforts were being made to nab the accused.

In Lakhimpur Kheri, Chhotu aka Mauseem of Mudiya Khera hamlet of Kotwali area used to sell ‘chaat’ in the neighbourhood. However, due to lockdown, he had suspended his business.

On Tuesday, his neighbours Raunak, Lal, Mohammed and six others pressed him to prepare ‘chaat’. But when Chhotu refused to do so, they barged into his house and hacked him to death. A case was registered and efforts were on to nab the assailants.

In a separate case in Bulandshahr, a 30-year-old woman, who was seven-month pregnant, torched herself along with her two children after a tiff with her husband.

Vikram aka Bobby of Bardauli used to run a sweet shop in Delhi. Due to lockdown, he returned home two days back. On Wednesday morning, he had a tiff with his wife Pushpa after which the woman locked herself along with her sons Himanshu (8) and Niyanshu (3), poured kerosene and set themselves fire.

The locals somehow rescued them and rushed them to a hospital but all the three died on way.

Meanwhile in Jaunpur, a youth was murdered while a couple ended their lives in Agra.

In Jaunpur, the body of a youth with bullet wounds was found near Pili Kothi area of Line Bazaar on Wednesday morning. It seemed that the victim was killed somewhere else and the body was dumped there.

The victim was later identified as Utkarsh Dikshit (21) of Puranpur area of Kairakat in Jaunpur. His father, Jai Chand Dikshit, said that his son went missing on Tuesday evening.

A case was registered and investigations are on.

In the Agra, 22-year-old jeweller Gopal Sharma and his wife Priya (18) were found hanging from the ceiling of their bedroom in Ram Swaroop Colony of Shahganj on Tuesday afternoon.

They had tied the knot on January 18 last.

The family members failed to give any reason for the extreme step.

The bodies were sent for autopsy and the girl’s family at Firozabad was informed about the tragedy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/informing-admn-about-corona-suspects-leads-to-killing-of-woman.html
7,02-4-20,A new dependence,"Despite all controversies, China continues to be the biggest supplier of medical equipment to the US. By exporting humanitarian relief, it is setting a new world order

With the Chinese making a conciliatory statement, the war of words — of accusations and counter accusations — between the US and China appears to be thawing. As the epicentre of the pandemic has shifted from China to Europe and the US, there may be a window of opportunity. With the successful handling of the Coronavirus crisis, even as the rest of the world is grappling with the menace, China maybe eyeing to squeeze diplomatic capital out of such a humanitarian overture. It’s truly a case of schadenfreude. Foreign leaders, from the Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Italy’s Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, have all thanked China loudly for the medical supplies and teams of doctors received by them while at the same time chiding their neighbours for abandoning them. Spain has already decided to buy medical equipment and supplies from China worth a few hundred million US dollars.

Pakistan is reported to have opened its land border with China on the Karakoram highway in order to receive a generous consignment of medical supplies. In fact, an informal offer of building makeshift hospitals in India to treat COVID-19 patients on the pattern of the set-up in Wuhan also exists. And despite all the controversies, China continues to be the biggest supplier of medical equipment to the US.

Talking of controversies, there are some, which refuse to die, even with the passage of time. Considering the widespread human interest involved, some of these continue to be kept alive by conspiracy theories. In the context of Coronavirus, a lot has already appeared in the media but in a latest salvo, US President Donald Trump has targetted the World Health Organisation (WHO) while China has spoken strongly in support of the global health body. However, there is a background to the accusations made by America vis-a-vis the WHO.

Its contention is that despite the disease in its initial stages remaining confined to Wuhan, where the virus first caused an outbreak, it was neither tagged with China nor the province. Even when all the details were not available, it could have been tagged geographically or simply named as the Chinese virus. It was much later that the WHO named it as COVID-19, avoiding any mention of China. On the other hand, we have seen in the past, Spanish flu, Japanese encephalitis, German measles and some other country or place specific diseases, breaking the geographical barriers to become international pandemics. China has somehow managed to escape this tagging.

We are aware that both H5N1 bird flu and Severely Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had originated from the Chinese province of Guangdong. Yet, both these, even at their peaks, had managed to avoid the Chinese tag.

Sometimes, the name tags can also be greatly misleading with disastrous results. It is now known that the 2009 pandemic, which was popularly known as the Swine flu, was actually spread by humans and not pigs. But in its attempt to prevent contagion, a country in the Middle East mistakenly slaughtered a few lakh pigs.

Undeniably, there appears to be a certain degree of politics attached with the nomenclature of labelling such fatal diseases. In this regard, the decisions are taken at the level of the WHO, which hosts the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The current guidelines for nomenclature have been criticised by a number of scientific organisations.

It is the general opinion that by simply giving numbers to alphabetic codes, people at large are unable to appreciate the gravity of the disease. For instance, the letters HN denote the genetic size and sequence of the virus Hemagglutinin Neuraminidase. On the other hand, geographical labels tend to convey some very useful information for the world at large.

By leveraging their financial clout over certain international institutions, the Chinese have disturbed the existing order. This has not gone well with Western powers, who in any case had been increasingly looking inwards. Besides, there has been the question of financial support to such institutions, too. This is bound to make an impact on the post- Corona economic revival. In the given situation, the Chinese stand to gain substantially at the cost of others and emerge as a domineering influence cannot be ruled out.

Such a situation was in the making for a long time. In fact, ever since the economic downturn of 2008-09 and with the drying up of resources, there appeared to be some kind of a vacuum as far as investments in Europe were concerned. This space was readily occupied by China.

According to data compiled by the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID), New Delhi, the Chinese investments in Europe between 2010-17 have been of the order of $318 billion, which is 45 per cent more than their investments in the US. In fact, they have been targetting technologies that can, in the long run, provide a key to their own critical infrastructure. During this period, China has taken over 360 European companies, ranging from Pirelli & cSpA of Italy to Kuka AG robotics of Germany. ChemChina, a chemical firm in China, has acquired the Swiss giant Syngenta for $46 billion. The penetration of the communication giant Huawei with its 5G networks has already raised enough of hackles among the NATO countries.

It is in the backdrop of these developments that the post-Corona scenario must be viewed. The Chinese are making a quick economic revival with heavy investments while other nations are still reeling under the virus onslaught. This coupled with China’s outreach programme for medical and humanitarian aid are bound to pay it handsome dividends. For the decades to follow, the next few months are going to be crucial for politics, economy, diplomacy and the world order.

8,02-4-20,A new world order?,"Apart from raising doubts about the benefits of a global village another major impact of the Coronavirus is the fact that it is challenging and redefining the world order as we know it

The spread of the deadly Coronavirus through human-to-human transmission and the growing number of fatalities is giving birth to all kinds of conspiracy theories, blame games and racism. However, the growing preference for isolation, erection of walls, closing of boundries, restrictions on travel and tourism is also exhibiting that the world is no longer a global village and we are now divided into numerous Google villages.

The ills of globalisation and relative interdependence are visible in the acute dearth of protective gear for fighting the contagion, even in the mightiest of all countries, the US. Since China is the largest producer of protective gear like masks, ventilators, respirators, protective suits and testing kits, America’s helplessness and dependence on China, which controls 95 per cent of the US market for the supply of these kits is easily understandable. This is a warning sign for not just the global super power but also for other nations that they need to reduce such dependence and start production of everything, which used to be outsourced for manufacturing to China or other countries. The Coronavirus is shaping up to be an enormous stress test for globalisation. As critical supply chains break down, nations hoard medical supplies and limit travel, the crisis is forcing a major reevaluation of the interconnected global economy. Not only has globalisation allowed for the rapid spread of contagious disease but it has fostered deep interdependence between firms and nations that makes them more vulnerable to unexpected shocks. Now, firms and nations alike are discovering just how vulnerable they are.

Another major impact of the Coronavirus is the fact that it is challenging and redefining the world order as we know it. The inability of the US to quickly control the spread of this virus and save the lives of its citizens has exposed the weakness and lack of vision of the US leadership in taking stock of the situation and providing the much-needed guidance to the administration. As a result, the number of casualties today in the country has crossed the number of deaths in China, where the whole nightmare began.

The status of the US as a global leader has been built not just on wealth and power but also, and just as important, on the legitimacy that flows from its domestic governance, provision of global public goods and the ability and willingness to muster and coordinate a global response to crises. The Coronavirus pandemic is testing all three elements of US leadership and so far Washington is failing the test.

On the other hand, as this deadly virus travelled from China’s Whuan province to virtually every part of the globe, therefore, primarily China is being considered the villain by the world. This is also in major part due to the fact that it concealed the information about the contagion for a long time. Had it informed the global village in time, the precautions which are being taken now could have been taken earlier and the large- scale spread of the virus could have been averted.

At present, the concerns about the dominance of the world order through economics, expansion of trade, commerce and route connectivity have taken a back seat and the control of the pandemic has taken a front seat. Though by locking down Wuhan province through draconian measures, China succeeded in containing the spread of the outbreak to other parts of the country, hiding the news of the contagion it was unable to prevent its spread to the rest of the world. Apart from the 42,352 people across the globe who have died because of the Coronavirus, the other big casualty of the pandemic is the global village-based world order, as now every country has sealed its borders and even flights have been grounded for now. Currently, the only thing that is keeping the world united and linked is the internet as the Google village is available for accessing and exchanging information and ideas.

After being castigated and ostracized by the world community for hiding and spreading the virus globally, the Chinese President sought India’s support to confront its isolation and face the world bravely. Even in the time of a crisis China has not forgotten its world-domination ambitions and in order to show its greatness and maintainin its status as a major power on the world stage, as a goodwill gesture China is willing to share its experiences and strategy with India.

As the US fumbles around, China is moving quickly and adeptly to take advantage of the opening created by Trump’s mistakes, filling the vacuum to position itself as the global leader in the response to a major crisis. It is working to tout its own system, provide material assistance to other countries, and even organise other Governments. But the world community, including the US, is not going to forget what China has done and how Beijing is using this opportunity to increase its military and economic might by offering to supply the medical necessities to Europe and the US.

Beijing’s move to block the recently-called United Nations Security Council meet on the Coronavirus pandemic also indicates that China is aspiring hard to maintain its image of a generous leader of the world ready to help with loans and equipment. Chinese attempts clearly hint that this pandemic will surely change the global scenario but the power game will remain unhampered because China, even in the wake of the crisis, is not leaving any stone unturned to make its presence felt in the Indo-Pacific.

Although it was felt that the COVID-19 outbreak would halt China’s overseas investments, interestingly the signals coming from China right now indicate that it is not likely to stop overseas investment in its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project and will also keep on exploring the possibility of grabbing new markets for its goods, commodities and investments. Because, through this it can fill the power gap and make its presence and power felt in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in the BRI countries.

According to reports, recently Chinese military aircraft carried out anti-submarine drills in the contested South China Sea (SCS), to respond to patrols by US warships, which suggests that Coronavirus or no Coronavirus, China is not going to mend its ways and tone down its assertiveness and leave any opportunity to exhibit its power politics. The claims of controlling the COVID-19 in Whuan have made it more aggressive than ever. Even though the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) activities on the Tibetan plateau have reduced due to the outbreak, PLA intrusions were recently reported from Naku-la, south of the watershed in Northern Sikkim, a border said to be “settled” by China.

In view of China’s obvious moves for domination, most of the countries including the World Health Organisation are looking at the other major power in the region, India’s response and efforts to confront this challenge with interest and anxiety.

If this crisis is not handled carefully by India the death toll and the number of sick people would be unimaginable and would take the country back by decades, something which would not be in favour of New Delhi and its allies as they look to India to stop China’s march.

In this context it would be appropriate to highlight that while in the domestic sector India is taking all necessary steps to contain the outbreak, on the other hand regionally and internationally also India is at the forefront of the fight against Coronavirus.

The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s call for cooperation to fight the pandemic to the SAARC countries, places the nation at the front and centre of the fight against the pandemic in the region and gives it a place at the global power high table. With the creation of the $10 million SAARC Emergency Fund to fight Covid-19, India has also supplied testing equipment and sanitisers to Maldives, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. In a recent meeting the G-20 group also pledged to introduce $5 trillion into the global economy to blunt the affect of the virus. Prime Minister Modi has also advocated the need for developing a new crisis management protocol to deal with global health issues, which indicates patient and good leadership and signals India’s effective presence in the global power scenario. The seriousness and gravity shown by the Indian leadership and appeals to people for restraint and determination are a great example of ethical leadership in the time of a crisis. The well-timed lockdown and appeals by the leadership for social isolation are allowing all of us to forget the concept of global village and just turn into Google village with limited exposure to people but unlimited contacts for our well-being.

9,02-4-20,Savings cut,"The fact is that we cannot have cheap loans and high savings rates at the same time. The RBI is being practical’

With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashing lending rates for popular schemes at the recently-concluded Monetary Policy Committee meeting, it was only a matter of time before savings rates on a host of saving instruments — from the public provident fund (PPF), postal savings and even fixed deposits — in the banks were slashed. The present rate cut intervention was all but expected. Governments all across the world have announced rate cuts to stave off Coronavirus-related recession. But none had expected that cuts in the rates of small savings schemes, which offer assured returns and capital safety, would be so steep. The Indian Government has decided to cut small savings interest rates sharply by 70-140 basis points for the April-June quarter. The interest rate on PPF has been reduced from 7.9 per cent to 7.1 per cent per annum, a reduction of 80 basis points. For the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, the interest rate has been cut from 8.6 per cent per annum to 7.4 per cent per annum. Schemes with larger social intent, like for the girl child or the senior citizens, too, have not been spared. The present move comes close on the heels of the Central bank’s decision last week to slash the repo rate by 75 basis points, along with announcing a slew of liquidity-enhancing measures to counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, the Government has pursued a difficult path ahead as this decision is bound to face opposition but for greater public good, it has to take the bitter pill. This announcement may have surely raised the hackles of some senior citizens and other small savers dependent on the interest income for everyday survival but the fact is that right now, the Government needs to encourage people to spend money so as to deal with the flood of economic issues from a realistic perspective. It needs to bridge the gap between deposit rates and earnings from small savings schemes. In view of this, the monetary policy cannot be determined by the wishes of a vocal minority. The Government should not be dependent on consumers, attracted by the promise of cheap loans, to spend. With India’s banking sector still trying to recover from the profligacy of a decade ago, will banks be willing to forward money in the form of more consumer loans? For, bankers are in no doubt whatsoever that several businesses, which were viable and profitable before China’s gift to the rest of the world, will be hard hit and India will be on the verge of bankruptcy once everything gets going again. Banks must not be reluctant to pass on the benefits to the borrowers. Some industries will be worse affected than others, travel and tourism and all its allied sectors have already incurred losses in crores. Possibility of a global recession, too, cannot be ruled out. But the Government will have to spend its way out of this crisis. Commentators have suggested that the Seventh Pay Commission’s recommendations be put on hold for now as tax revenues, both direct and indirect, are going to plummet this fiscal year and the forthcoming one as well. Indeed, to spur spending, the Government should even look at reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate for several sectors. To cite an example, high excise duties on the automobile industry can be lowered. Buyers will look to buy vehicles if they see a good deal.

To spur spending, cutting bank rates will clearly not be enough. Innovative thinking is needed. This will hurt some people, savers in particular, but getting a stalled economic machine restarted will take a bit of sacrifice from everyone. It will not be easy, particularly in times of crisis when the natural human tendency is to keep cash assets and savings locked up. Cutting savings rates is a way to encourage spending. While many people are unsure of their economic future right now, spending will be essential for everyone to get economic activity going again. And if that means making a bit less money from our savings, so be it.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/savings-cut-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/savings-cut.html
10,02-4-20,Putting lives above money,"Governments are putting the lives of the old ahead of the alleged needs of the economy. Because that’s what their people really want

The basic choice all along with Covid-19 has been: Do we let the old die, or do we take a big hit economically? So far, the decision almost everywhere has been to take the hit and save the old (or most of them), but in some places it has been a very near-run thing. The number of confirmed cases globally is now 8,60,696 and number of casualties has touched 42,352. Already, at 4,055 the number of deaths from Coronavirus in the United States (US) have surpass the total number of people who have died in China (3,312) from what US President Donald Trump generally calls the “Chinese virus.”

China has four times the population of the US but in the end around 50 times as many Americans will die from the Coronavirus. That is according to Trump’s own prediction on March 29 in the speech where he finally did a U-turn, that “only” 1,00,000-2,00,000 Americans will die because of his wise decision to extend the national lockdown to April 30.

It was a decision he took long after the last minute, if “last minute” is defined as the last moment when the right decision would have held American deaths down to the Chinese level. But Trump was not alone in this dereliction of duty: His “Mini-me” equivalent across the Atlantic, Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, also waited much too long, and the United Kingdom (UK) will be lucky to escape with 20,000 deaths.

Incidentally, Johnson’s Chief Political Adviser, Dominic Cummings, is also believed to have experienced mild Coronavirus symptoms including a cough and is self-isolating. The Prime Minister and the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, are already self-isolating after developing symptoms towards the end of last week.

So, why did they wait so long before imposing the restrictions on movement that will break the chain of transmission of Covid-19? Because locking down the people also means locking down the economy: A huge numbers of people will lose their jobs, at least temporarily and the stock market will crash.

Whereas if you don’t impose the restrictions, perhaps on the plausible pretext that you are pursuing an alternative solution called “herd immunity”, then the economy will keep ticking over nicely. However, achieving herd immunity requires 60 per cent-70 per cent of the population to have had the disease — and with this particular Coronavirus, about one or two per cent of those people will die.

But who cares? Almost all the victims will be over 70, two-thirds of them will be male and at least half of them will also have “underlying conditions” or “comorbidities” that are already forcing the health services to spend a lot just keeping them alive. They are entirely dispensable to the economy. We would be even richer if they did die.

Did Johnson understand that this was the real strategy? Possibly not: He’s never been a “detail” man. But his Svengali, Cummings, certainly did understand it and seems to have been perfectly fine with it. What forced Johnson into a thinly-disguised about-face two weeks ago was one or both of the following facts. One: Almost everybody his policy was condemning to death was somebody’s beloved father or mother, uncle or aunt. And two: It amounted to carrying out a cull of Conservative voters, since two-thirds of British people in the over-70s group vote for the Tories.

He was late but not too late. Even the strictest measures now will not keep the British death toll under 20,000, according to the Imperial College London group that did the key calculations two weeks ago — but half a million would have died without them. And exactly the same equation applies to Donald Trump.

It’s always tough to know what Trump really believes, because he will say whatever he thinks works best politically at this precise moment. If it flatly contradicts what he said yesterday, he doesn’t care. And if some journalist calls him on the contradiction, he just denies what he said yesterday. It doesn’t matter if the statement is on the record; it’s “fake news.” We cannot know if Trump ever really understood the choice he was making when he condemned lockdowns and repeatedly promised the imminent “reopening” of the economy. And then, two weeks after the Imperial College group published its prediction that without lockdowns 2.2 million Americans would die, he finally read it and reversed course. Or so we are supposed to believe.

He even claimed credit for saving two million American lives by abandoning his old strategy (if that’s the right word for it). His real calculation, at some level of his conscious or unconscious mind, was that his re-election in November would be even more damaged by two million needless American deaths on his watch than by a deep recession and huge unemployment.

But at least half of the Americans who will still die would have survived had he moved two weeks sooner, when he already had ample evidence that it was the only sane course. Exactly the same criticism applies to Johnson. But here’s a consoling thought. Everywhere from China and India to Spain and Russia and even in the UK and the US (after stalling as long as possible), Governments are putting the lives of the “useless” old ahead of the alleged needs of the economy. Because that’s what their people really want.

11,02-4-20,Bollywood blues,"The film industry is staring at a Rs 1,300 crore loss and a revision of star values. Will this demolish star domination?

The Coronavirus is a great leveller. The once soaring jet-setters around the globe are now just like the rest of us, confined to the walls of their own homes. Who would imagine Hollywood star Tom Hanks getting it of all people while scouting for locale of his new film? Back home in Bollywood, reality has hit hard too as stars take to micro-blogging sites, using their home diaries and even plebeian activities to stay relevant. With all big ticket releases stalled and shooting schedules cancelled because of the nationwide lockdown, our film industry is looking at a projected loss of Rs 1,300 crore. What’s more, the sudden career break is not doing anything good to stars whose market value is decided by hits and misses. Elaborate film sets now lie empty and Mumbai’s mega tourist attraction, Film City, has cancelled all tours indefinitely. Big-budget ventures like Akshay Kumar’s Suryavanshi, Kabir Khan’s 83, starring Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, and Salman Khan’s Radhe have been postponed. And with festival celebrations forever changing in a post-COVID-19 India, there is not much cheer around a big Eid or Diwali release. But Bollywood is not all about stars. There are character artistes, technicians, spot boys and logistics staff, who are all hired on a temporary basis, have no long-term security cover and are suddenly jobless. The distributors and cinema hall owners have all flatlined in their ventures. By rolling out 1,500 films a year, the Indian film industry is one of the country’s biggest generators of employment. As for debutantes, who have invested their all in a film career, this lull will affect their ability to get work as producers will prioritise pending projects first.

This time of crisis has also brought out the philanthropic side of numerous celebrities. Of course, the big fish in the industry are trying to do their bit for COVID-19 management. Akshay Kumar has donated a whopping Rs 25 crore to the PM Relief Fund. Kartik Aaryan has donated Rs 1 crore to the PM Cares Fund. Superstar Rajnikanth has donated Rs 50 lakh to the Film Employees Federation of South India to help workers who are losing their jobs due to the shutdown. Varun Dhawan has pledged Rs 30 lakh contribution to the PM Cares fund and Rs 25 lakh to the Maharashtra’s CM Fund. One would have expected Bollywood’s royal clans to do some more but at the moment they haven’t. Perhaps, this may serve as a reality check to their s/hero worshipping fans. Going forward, maybe brands need to think their hefty endorsement fee for some so-called stars. Only those who helped and contributed in their own way will come out with a stronger, more loyal fan following than those who did not.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bollywood-blues-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/bollywood-blues.html

21,02-4-20,TB patients more vulnerable to coronavirus: Doc,"





|

As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the world, there is anxiety among experts fighting TB that what this pandemic will do to the much older infectious killer tuberculosis, as a person with pulmonary TB is more vulnerable to coronavirus.

Dr Surya Kant Tripathi, head of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at King George’s Medical University, said that Uttar Pradesh had not suspended its fight against TB. Despite the lockdown and coronavirus threat, the DOT Centres were working and patients were being given a month’s medicine, he told ‘The Pioneer’ on Tuesday.

Earlier, the patients were called on daily basis and were asked to take medicine in front of the TB health worker.

“It is a fact that any person with compromised lung is vulnerable to coronavirus. People having TB need to take more precautions,” said Dr Tripathi, who is also head of UP Chapter Tuberculosis.

Dr Tripathi said that the TB was the leading killer and an estimated 4.35 lakh people died every year because of this disease. “So on an average, over 1,000 people die every day of TB,” he said.

“We have asked the TB health workers not to compromise and test any person for both TB and COVID. The primary symptom of both the diseases is same. In TB the cough is accompanied with sputum while in case of COVID-19, it is dry cough. Otherwise, both the patients have fever. In case of COVID-19, the infected person will develop pain in the body which he cannot conceal,” he said.

Manjusha Srivastava, a TB health worker is however a bit nervous about the spread of COVID-10.

“The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading its tentacles. We have so many untested TB patients. We, of course, have a lot of untested COVID-19 patients. Once the coronavirus cases start coming in large numbers TB will take a beating,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tb-patients-more-vulnerable-to-coronavirus--doc.html

29,02-4-20,NMDC denies CSR benefits to Odisha border villages,"The Chhattisgarh-based National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) Nagarnar has neglected the Odisha border villages in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, alleged local outfit Zilla Nagarika Surakhya O Sachetana Mancha.

Speaking to reporters, Mancha legal advisor Narshinga Tripathy said, ""We have petitioned to Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and CM Naveen Patnaik about the neglect.""

He said as per the norms and provision of NMDC, Nagarnar Chhattisgarh, more than 100 villages of Odisha’s Kosagumuda block in Nabarangpur district and Kotpad block in Koraput district which are at a radius of 6 km of the steel plant and mostly inhabited by the tribals and backward people, should have been included in the CSR programme.

As part of CSR, the NMDC has taken up multifarious initiatives and has implemented several development projects in the focus areas of Chhattisgarh like education, cultural development, potable drinking water and sanitation, healthcare, skill development, livelihoods support, agriculture and infrastructure development etc. However, bordering Odisha villages were completely neglected, alleged Tripathy.

Is this not prejudice and step motherly attitude meted out to the villages of Odisha by the NMDC? Tripathy asked.

""We also informed that after the construction of dams over the river Indravati for Nagarnar project, hundreds of villages of the Kosagumuda and Kotpad blocks of Odisha will be submerged in rainy season. The inhabitants of the villages will suffer untold miseries and difficulties due to flood,"" told Tripathy.

For the establishment of the steel plant, more than 90 per cent of raw materials like sand, boulders, chips, metal, bricks etc. are imported from Odisha, including the labourers and masons. However, due to the step-motherly attitude of the NMDC, the people here are getting nothing in return, Tripathy said.

The Mancha demanded inclusion of the peripheral villages of Odisha in the CSR activities under NMDC for the all-round development of the tribals and backward people near the project area.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nmdc-denies-csr-benefits-to-odisha-border-villages.html

At the same time, the Deputy Commissioner has asked the private hospitals, with 10 or more beds, to set aside isolation beds, wards or other infrastructure at the disposal of Mohali Civil Surgeon.

He also made it clear that the private hospitals will not charge from the patients, referred by the Civil Surgeon, and the patients have to pay only for the consumables like medicines, syringes etc used in the treatment at the rates prescribed by the Government.

For the purpose, the Deputy Commissioner has constituted an advisory committee headed by the Mohali Civil Surgeon to assess and identify the required private health infrastructure to be used or set aside in case any of contingency.

The set of directions came on the day the district reported three more corona positive cases, taking the total number of patients to 10.

As per the orders issued by the DC, all private hospitals (having 10 beds or more) shall provide an inventory of their beds (including ICU), ventilators or respirators, laryngoscopes, PPE and any other essential item as specified by the Civil Surgeon, Mohali (CSM).

The Committee will decide the number of beds, ventilators or ambulances etc on the basis of overall capacity of the hospital and strictly on the principle of equity.

The orders added that the hospitals have been directed that to ensure that staff including doctors, nurses, and paramedics etc are all be available on duty and no one shall refuse treatment to COVID19 positive or suspected cases.

Pertinently, there have been many reports of non-cooperation, under-reporting of capacity, exorbitant charging, refusal to set apart and create isolation facilities and even turning away of patients by private hospitals in the district.

Moreover, it has been reported that in some cases, the hospital management has stated that their staff has refused to treat or attend to COVID positive or even suspected cases.

“The private sector in the district has a strong health infrastructure which is crucial to supplement ICU beds or ventilators needed in the district.

So it is imperative to take urgent and essential steps to synchronize the strategies or infrastructure for prevention and treatment of the pandemic,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pvt-hospitals-not-to-refuse-treatment-to-covid-19-cases--mohali-dc.html

40,02-4-20,Ghat linked to Odisha Statehood drive lies neglected,"Even as Odisha celebrated its foundation day on Wednesday, a spot at Baleswar town bearing historical importance continue to lie forgotten and neglected.

The place is Gadgadia and it is in a shambles. History says Odisha could retain its identity of having its own language and literature by a movement that sparked from this place.

It is claimed Gadgadia was the place of congregation of then social thinkers and saviours of Odia language, Fakir Mohan Senapati, Radhanath Ray and Madhusudan Das.

Each evening they used to sit here near a pond ghat , known as Gadgadia ghat and used to discuss about the contemporary issues, challenges and solutions.

They braced up for a bigger movement , when a Bengali teacher , Kantilal Bhattacharya remarked Odia was not a separate language.

In the year 1870, Kantilal, a teacher of the Balasore Zilla School, published a book named ""Odia Ekta Swatantra Bhasanoy"".

He strongly described that Odia was a dialect of Bengali language. His view insulted all Odia-speaking people. There after another notable scholar, Rajendralal Mitra of Bengal also had a negative view.

Against these anti-Odia activities, there were strong protests from Odia elites like Fakir Mohan, then a Dewan with Nilgiri Maharaja, Radhanath a teacher in Mission school and Madhusudan also a teacher in the Zilla School.

The trio vowed to save the language against Bengalis threat and began to write in Odia. They conceived the idea of forming a State wide organization in 1,877 and formed the Utkal Sammilani in 1903. They continued to ignite the mind of youth to develop patriotism towards Odisha and Odia language.

And in 1936, Odisha (Orissa) earned distinction of separate State based on language. Since the area Gadgadia bears a historical significance, there have been demands from various quarters including the literary bodies, to beautify the pond area by clearing the encroachments, renovating ghats and install statue of these three eminent personalities.

It was promised by successive elected representatives but never translated in to action.

“It is a sacred place and should be developed without further delay,” observed poet, writer and critic Krushna Kumar Mohanty.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ghat-linked-to-odisha-statehood-drive-lies-neglected.html

He added that as a precautionary measure, the State police have earmarked 713 people in the state who had attended the congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin area of Delhi anytime from January 01 this year. Ashok Kumar claimed that the data of the police is very exhaustive there is little chance of any big deviation from this figure of 713.

“The police have also identified 173 people who had come to the state from the congregation of Nizamuddin in last 28 days. All of them have been sent on quarantine,’’ he informed.

The FIRs have been registered in Srinagar and Udham Singh Nagar against such people. In Srinagar the police registered case against five residents of Bijnor who had attended the Jamaat programmes and had not informed the authorities

He appealed that the people who had attended the Jamaat meetings should not hide their travel histories and help in fight against the novel Coronavirus. “ It is in the interest of them and their families. If they fail to inform then cases would be registered against them,’’ Ashok Kumar said.

The congregation of Tablighi Jamaat which is in the centre of the storm and is being labelled as COVID-19 hotspot in India was held in Nizamuddin from March 10 to 13.

Ten people who attended the event have died so far from COVID-19.

On Wednesday, the authorities after a 36 hour long campaign cleared the six storied building of the Jamaat in Nizamuddin.

42,02-4-20,Corbett Tiger Reserve completes 47 years of conservation,"The first tiger reserve of the nation, Corbett tiger reserve turned 47 on Wednesday. It was on April 1, 1973 that the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced the formation of this tiger reserve. This tiger reserve is now considered one of the best not only in India but across the world for the conservation of its rich fauna and flora.

Established in 1936 as the Hailey national park and later renamed after famous hunter turned conservationist Jim Corbett who lived most of his life in Nainital district before shifting to Kenya, Corbett national park is situated on the banks of the Ramganga. It covers a total area of 1288.12 square kilometers of which 821.99 square kilometers is the core zone where tourists are not allowed. Corbett national park field director Rahul said that after the national park was declared a tiger reserve in 1973, the importance of this tiger reserve has increased considerably. After its creation, works for conservation of tigers were also stepped up here. There were a total of nine tiger reserves in 1973, which have increased to 50 in 2020. These include Corbett and Rajaji in Uttarakhand. The tiger census conducted in India during 2006 ascertained 1,411 tiger population which rose to 1,706 in the 2010 census. Similarly, the number of tigers rose to 2226 in 2014 and further to 2967 in 2018. Presently, Corbett is estimated to have more than 250 tigers.

According to Rahul, since Project Tiger (now National Tiger Conservation Authority) was launched, various works were undertaken for wildlife and biodiversity conservation in Corbett.

The national park has two divisions- Ramnagar tiger division and Kalagarh tiger division comprising of 12 ranges and four sub-divisions. Additionally, while one range is focused on eco-tourism, research work is carried out in another range. Conservation work focused on about 50 mammal species, 650 bird species and 25 reptile species is carried out in Corbett.

The Ramganga river is also the breeding ground for Ghariyal and crocodiles. The Mahasheer fish also thrives in this river.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corbett-tiger-reserve-completes-47-years-of-conservation.html

44,02-4-20,Can hot Indian summer seal fate of corona?,"There are now some early hints that COVID-19 may vary with the seasons. An unpublished analysis comparing the weather in 500 locations around the world where there have been COVID-19 cases seems to suggest a link between the spread of the virus and temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. The study has also shown higher temperatures are linked to lower incidence of COVID-19, but also says that temperature alone cannot account for the global variation in incidence.

The coronavirus belongs to the family of so-called “enveloped viruses”, which are coated in an oily coat known as a lipid bi-layer. These viruses are studded with proteins that stick out like spikes of a crown which gives them the name – Corona is Latin for crown. Recent research on other enveloped viruses had found that this oily coat makes the viruses more susceptible to heat than those that do not have one. In colder conditions, the oily coat hardens into a rubber-like state to protect the virus and give it a longer life outside the body, in warmer zones it just melts down, exposing and destroying the virus.

Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA have accessed data on a number of COVID-19 infections from different parts of the world and compared it with parameters of temperature and humidity. Their findings suggest that warm and humid weather is linked to slower spread of the virus. Accordingly, Asian countries experiencing monsoon may see lesser transmission of the virus. 90 per cent of the Novel Corona virus until March 28 has occurred in regions with temperature between 3 and 17 degrees Celsius.

Iran, which has accounted for about 90 per cent of the Corona virus cases in the Middle East, is unique as it sits on a plateau where winter conditions resemble those of more northerly countries. At the same time, many Southeast Asian nations with close business and tourism links to China have seen surprisingly few cases, even if we assume that their less developed public health systems are not properly detecting them. Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have each seen fewer cases than Estonia, Slovenia or Iceland, despite a combined population more than 100 times as large.

Temperature cannot be discounted as being a very important factor in how counter measures should be drawn for the future containment of the virus. Nations with lower temperatures and lesser humidity create a better environment for the spread of the virus, whereas nations with warmer weather may have a better chance of containment because of this factor.

In regar to temperature, the coronavirus can remain intact at 4 to 10 degree Celsius for a longer period of time, with the optimal temperature for the spread being 8.72 degree Celsius. At around 23–26 degree Celsius, the virus is no longer efficiently transmitted, but at 30 degree Celsius, it gets inactivated. In India and other nations with warm summers, the virus could be challenged at temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius and more.

Two scientists, Dr Malik Peiris and Dr Seto Wing Hong from the Hong Kong University have proved that that low temperatures and low relative humidity had allowed the SARS virus, which was a corona virus too, to survive much longer than they did in high temperatures and humidity. The HKU team argued that this was the reason why warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where there was intensive use of air-conditioning.

Another intriguing study by scientists in China too suggests the relationship between how deadly COVID-19 can be and the weather conditions. They analysed 2,300 deaths in Wuhan, and compared them to the humidity, temperature and pollution levels on the day they occurred. Although it has yet to be published in an academic journal, their research suggests mortality rates were lower on days when the humidity levels and temperatures were higher. Their analysis also suggests that on days where the maximum and minimum temperature ranges were greater; there were higher levels of mortality. But this work is largely also based on computer modeling, so the exact nature of this relationship, and whether it will be seen in other parts of the world, is still to be explored.

Dr Alan Evangelista, a microbiology and virology professor at St Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia found results similar to the other studies. His research showed that as humidity increases, the viral droplet size becomes larger and settles out of the air rapidly. In contrast, in low humidity, there is rapid evaporation of respiratory droplets and they remain airborne for prolonged periods, increasing the time and distance over which transmission can occur.

University of Utah physicists Saveez Saffarian and Michael Vershinin are conducting studies on how the virus's protective outer shell responds to changes in heat and humidity. According to the duo, “Viruses are not able to do anything on their own, as they are simply shells with genetic instructions tucked inside; when a virus invades a host's cells, it uses that cell's machinery to replicate itself, over and over again.

What we know is that the droplets are better at staying afloat when the air is cold and dry, when the air is humid and warm, they fall to the ground more quickly, making transmission harder.""

Dr Mohammad Sajadi, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland, too thinks weather might play a role.

Elizabeth McGraw, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, explained to the Time magazine: “The droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation.” Recent comments attributed to Professor John Nicholls from the University of Hong Kong’s Department of Pathology suggests that weather conditions will be a key factor in the demise of the coronavirus.

The 'Global Virus Network ' has predicted that weather modeling can explain spread of COVID-19. Their observation is that the spread of Covid 19 is along a narrow corridor of 30-50” Latitudes at consistently similar weather conditions of 5 to 11 degree Celsius and 47 per cent to 79 per cent humidity. They also suggested that a temperature rise of 12 degrees Celsius or higher, the viral transmission may be difficult.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/can-hot-indian-summer-seal-fate-of-corona-.html

To achieve the target, a task force chaired by Secretary Department of Economic Affairs has been constituted to draw up the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) from 2019-20 financial year to 2024-25, said officials.

The task force had deliberations with different stakeholders, including Ministries, State Governments, infrastructure companies, developers, bankers, NBFCs, and industry associations in drawing up the NIP over the last four months, said Union Secretary Economic Affairs Atanu Chakraborty.

In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance has released the summary of the report of the task force on NIP for FY 2019-2025 with recommendations on certain generic reforms, he said.

The task force in its detailed report will provide its recommendations on changes required to several key sectoral policies and other reform initiatives by the Central and State Governments soon, he added.

Notably, the NIP is a co-operative effort of all the Ministries/Departments of Union Government, States and the private sector.

Chakraborty said an action plan had been chalked out to accomplish the ambitious target of infrastructure investment in the next five years.

Also a Ministry level task force may be constituted to plan, prepare, bid, implement and monitor NIP projects for effective implementation within sanctioned cost and time, the Union Secretary said.

The Union Government has suggested putting a robust monitoring framework in place with escalation matrix to companies depending on the size, delay and complexity of unresolved issues.

The Centre has also advised to prepare an annual supplementary NIP report by March every year to update NIP with additional information provided by various Ministries, States and private sector, Chakroborty said.

In order to achieve the target, creating an enabling environment through optimal risk sharing, balanced PPP contracts by ensuring sanctity of contracts and enabling timely and efficient dispute resolution has been stressed.

The Union Government plans to showcase the NIP projects at all fora, including the Annual Global Investors Meet, expected to be organised in the second half of 2020, where top global investors will get to look at infrastructure opportunities, said sources. It has advised to take speedy action on the issues so that infrastructure development can spur the growth of the Indian economy.

The State Government’s flagship Make in Odisha programme, during which the State Government intends to attract huge investments, will also help the Centre in achieving the target, officials said.

60,02-4-20,People to celebrate Navami differently this year,"Even small religious and other gatherings can be dangerous in the current situation.

Therefore people need to maintain the rule of social distancing during the Chaitra Navratri too considering the threat of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), said Dehradun Chief Development Officer (CDO) Nitika Khandelwal. Also, the locals of the State have found different ways to celebrate Navami today rather than the traditional Kanyapujan.

Every year, the Chaitra Navratri is concluded with Kanyapujan on the eighth or ninth day called Ashtami and Navami respectively. This year due to the state-wide lockdown, people are avoiding Kanyapujan and planning to celebrate Navami in different ways.

While some people are planning to donate the money, others decided to feed stray animals during the lockdown.

""I am going to donate 10 times the money I spend every year on Kanyapujan to the Prime Minister's relief fund,"" said Mussorie resident Anita Sharma.

Haldwani resident Bhawana Panu said, ""There are several stray dogs and cows near the main market who must not be getting enough food during these days so my family and I have decided to feed them for the next five days during the 7 AM to 1 PM window.

We do not want to take any chances with the lives of little girls or ours by organising Kanyapujan. So this year, it is our way to celebrate the Navratri and thank the goddess.""

The CDO Nikita Khandelwal also stated that it is better to avoid any kind of gathering during the lockdown.

She said that the administration cannot enter into everyone's neighbourhood to check whether the family organising Kanyapujan is taking precautions like maintaining social distancing.

Therefore, people should act responsibly otherwise their actions may lead to bigger problems, said Khandelwal.

Moreover, she added that charges will be booked against those found violating the government directions and guidelines.

However, many people opined that the Navratri should be concluded as per the tradition, so they will organise Kanyapujan this Navami too.

""I get that the number of people infected with COVID-19 is increasing everyday but we cannot change our tradition entirely thinking about the risk it may pose to others. We will organise Kanyapujan while taking every precaution that ensures the safety of my family and others,"" said Dehradun resident Jaya Kandwal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/people-to-celebrate-navami-differently-this-year.html

69,02-4-20,"Corona carnage severe, but ex-CJI becoming MP hurts no less’","As the historic corona carnage keeps causing a complete stalling of human activity across the panicky ‘human world', eminent journalist Kumar Chellappan has chosen to brazenly defend former CJI Gogoi grabbing a Rajya Sabha seat within a couple of months of demitting office. Chellappan keeps harping on the point that it’s not new to have a former CJI becoming a lawmaker by being nominated by the President. Former CJI Ranganath Misra too had fought to be elected to the same House though after a period of seven years of demitting office. Chellappan has chosen to ignore the fact that the flak Justice Misra had attracted was enormous indicating the people had not approved of his action. Misra had famously headed a commission to inquire into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, which had claimed an estimated 3,000 lives. The commission’s findings were – from the benefit of hindsight today – calumnious. It simply found no one guilty. Misra’s next stop, after he superannuated, was a Rajya Sabha membership on a Congress ticket.

Ranjan Gogoi’s nomination to the Rajya Sabha and his TV interviews have generated considerable public discussion. Way back in 1972, advocate-turned Rajya Sabha member Baharul Islam too had resigned to become a judge in the Gauhati High Court, which clearly means he got himself elevated as interpreting law is a much more respectable job than making laws. But Islam had his quota of public beating too for having been slave to the prevailing political establishment. The story of Justice Islam, who had joined the Congress in 1956 and held several party posts till 1972, is even more astonishing. In April 1962, the Congress elected him to the Rajya Sabha; and after unsuccessfully contesting an election in Assam, he was re-elected to the Upper House and aligned with Indira Gandhi after the Congress split. In 1972, he quit the Rajya Sabha and was made a judge of the Gauhati High Court. He retired in 1980; but nine months later, he was elevated to the Supreme Court. Six weeks before he retired again; and a month after giving a clean chit to the then Bihar Chief Minister Jagannth Mishra in a corruption case, he quit as SC judge and filed nomination as a Congress candidate in Assam, an election that never took place because of the ongoing agitation in that State. The Congress then elected him for a record third term to the Rajya Sabha in 1983!

In 2010, former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan had appealed to the Supreme Court to take action against former highly corrupt CJIs. He had mentioned four names. In 2015, former SC judge Markandey Katju told at a public gathering that 50% of the higher judiciary was corrupt. Most amusingly, in April 2017, a CJI-headed SC Bench summoned Justice CS Karnan of Calcutta High Court in contempt for declaring publicly that Superior Court judges were corrupt. Unusually brave Karnan, in turn, summoned the CJI and six other SC judges to appear at his official residence. Karnan failed in his battle, was jailed and eventually retired ungracefully. But his sordid drama did uncover the state of morality and conduct of the members of the higher judiciary.

In January 2017, the Bar Council of India informed the apex court that only 55-60% of lawyers were genuine. Shockingly, judges have been chosen from the fraudulent lot over the years. Post-retirement employment of judges in tribunals, commissions or any such quasi-judicial assignments has never raised public eyebrows. But a top judge becoming part of the establishment is certainly not acceptable, especially when the Government is the biggest litigant at the courts of law at any given point in time.

Justice Gogoi may have done a grand job in the Ayodhya matter; but his Rafael deal judgement looks suspect even today. Not surprisingly, there is a public demand for reopening the case. Similarly, he left the Sabarimala matter hanging. He left it to a bigger bench; and, though he never stayed the prevailing judgement, he did not ensure women entered the shrine safely. He left the matter to the State Government to take care as was considered proper, which is gross violation of law.

Baharul Islam elevated himself from the Rajya Sabha to the High Court. But Gogoi demoted himself from the boss of the apex court position to a mean political stature; and that too in mad hurry. He shamelessly keeps saying he is not interested in becoming a Minister. Further, he keeps ranting that he will be at the Rajya Sabha only for sixty days in a year; and if only possible, he will not take the MP salary. But he never says he will grab the perks and other incalculable benefits for a whole 365 days because his CJI pension is a huge amount of money.

The case of Justice Sunil Gaur being made Chairperson of the Prevention of Money Laundering Appellate (PMLA) Tribunal in August 2019 is an archetypal example. Gaur retired as a Delhi High Court judge on August 22 just after rejecting on August 20 former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's plea for interim protection from arrest by the CBI in the INX Media case.

The issue of judges being influenced by potential post-retirement career prospects had also come up in the Constituent Assembly Debates (June 7, 1949). Professor KT Shah, Rajendra Prasad’s rival in the first Presidential Election of Independent India, moved an amendment to introduce a new Article (Article 193-A) in the Constitution calling for a complete prohibition on judges accepting Government jobs post retirement. The logic for the amendment, Shah believed, is ""so simple and the principle underlying it is so clear that there could be no difference of opinion unless you desire your judiciary to be subservient or in any way influenced by the executive"".

Interestingly, there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents the Government from offering and judges from accepting post-retirement jobs though Articles 148 and 319 already contain such restrictions for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chairperson of UPSC, respectively.

In May 1997, the Supreme Court in a Full Court adopted a 16-point charter entitled 'Restatement of Values of Judicial Life'. The document needs to be revisited to provide for detailed principles and guidance for judges to follow, including a resolution that it would be unethical and immoral for judges to discuss post-retirement career prospects until retirement.

Fortunately for him, Gogoi has slipped into the Upper House without provoking much public hue and cry only because everyone is busy fighting the lethal coronavirus around this time!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-carnage-severe--but-ex-cji-becoming-mp-hurts-no-less---.html

74,02-4-20,Leopard on prowl in Chandigarh,"A leopard on the prowl for a prey in Chandigarh is giving sleepless nights to the city dwellers. While the leopard sighting in Sector 44 on Tuesday triggered a panic among the residents especially living in southern sectors of the city, the officials of UT Forest and Wildlife Department are having a tough time to track down and capture the feline.

The complaints related to hearing of leopard growling and sighting continued to pour in on the helpline of UT Forest and Wildlife Department from various sectors on Wednesday. Such reports were received from Sectors 15, 31 and 38 till the evening.

A day before, the leopard was seen moving towards forest area around Sector 34-44 here on Tuesday morning. Following this, a combing operation was launched in the area but the UT forest officials are yet to capture the animal.

With deserted roads and the near-silent ambience all around due to imposition of curfew in the city, the leopard has reportedly strayed into the city from Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. The curfew was imposed on March 24 in Chandigarh to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of COVID-19.

Another leopard was tranquilized and captured from an upscale residential area in Sector 5 here on Monday.

Abdul Qayum, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Chandigarh while talking to The Pioneer said, “After analysis by experts, it was established on Tuesday evening that the pugmarks found in forest patch near Sector 34-44 was of a leopard. Apart from complaints of residents of Sector 15 and 38 on Wednesday, complaints of hearing of leopard growling were received twice from Sector 31, which has a small forest patch.”

A day before, a cage trap was set up in Sector 43 to catch the animal. Two more cage traps would now be set up in various parts of the city, he said.

Qayum further said that the Forest and Wildlife Department has also decided to carry out night patrolling from Sector 38 to 56 as these areas have small forest patches and the leopard could be hidden in these areas. The combing operation would continue the entire night for the safety of the residents, he said.

The leopard must have entered the city from the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, he added.

The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary spreads over an area of about 26 sq km in the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake, which is Chandigarh’s prime tourist spot. Leopards are a frequent visitor to the Sanctuary from forest areas of neighboring Haryana.

Furthermore even after the work commences, MGNREGA workers have to wait for more than a month to receive wages,” Sonia said in the letter.

“Given the urgency of providing support to the rural poor, due to lost wages, the government may consider immediate advance payment of wages for 21 days to registered and active MGNREGA workers. The advance may be adjusted against the work to be done by the workers, once MGNREGA sites are opened up,” she added.

106,02-4-20,Difficult to develop vaccine for prevention as virus mutating rapidly: Study,"Amid the coronavirus pandemic, a study by top Indian microbiologists have claimed that the strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 disease in India is not as deadly as the ones which are taking a toll in Italy, Spain and the US.

On Tuesday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said that three types of coronavirus strains are doing round in the country.

In an in-depth genomic analysis of rapidly revolving SARS-CoV-2(COVID-19) viruses, a team of scientists led by top Indian microbiologists discovered that strain found in India, matches with the sequence of new coronavirus found in Wuhan, and is less virulent.

However, while the strain is comparatively less virulent, the scientists also suggested that based on data, it is assumed that the virus is mutating very rapidly. It means that the vaccine developed for one strain might not work for other strains circulating in other countries.

If the virus after entering a human body mutates rapidly then it often becomes difficult to counter it.

The study analysed the data taken from different countries including, Italy, Spain, US, China, Nepal and India.

“The study shows that virus is mutating very rapidly. In simpler words, we can say the virus is cor hanging its structure quickly...which means it will be difficult to develop a vaccine for prevention from this dreaded virus.

“Even if we develop a vaccine, we are not sure that the same vaccine will work in other parts of the world, looking at the nature of different strains of COVID-19,” said Rup Lal, a senior scientist with The Energy and Resources Institute(TERI).

On why people are dying more in Spain, Italy and now in the US, scientist Vipin Gupta, a key member of Lal’s team, said in their study it was discovered that virus which changed itself rapidly in Europe and then in the US, was more devastating.

On being asked about the virus isolated here in India, Gupta said: “We cannot conclude but safely say at this point, that strains of virus found in India is less virulent when we compare it with the US’’.” During the study, Indian microbiologist discovered that genomes of six isolates, specifically from the US, were found to harbour unique amino acid and showed amino acid substitutions in proteins. Interpreting the scientific terminology for common man, Gupta, who specialises in Bioinformatics said, “This suggests the severity of mutating viral genome in the population of US. Simply to say the virus strain in US is quite threatening for humans”.

Efforts are on to identify and trace all the 1,103 persons from the State who had attended the congregation. The patients admitted to hospitals on Wednesday include two religious preachers from Myanmar and Indonesia respectively,” said the Health Secretary.

Officials of the department of health and local bodies are on a house-to-house search in Tamil Nadu to trace more than 500 persons who had attended the religious congregation held in New Delhi early last month and had gone missing since then. Most of them are feared to carry the deadly COVID- 19 the cause for corona disease.

The seriousness of the situation could be understood from the words of the State administration which accepted that the New Delhi returnees had turned the trajectory of COVID-19.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy himself came out on Wednesday morning and paid a surprise visit to some of the Amma Restaurants in the city that offer subsidised food to the common man. Amma Restaurants were launched by late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa and this had earned her a lot of good will among migrant workers and low income employees because they could get breakfast/lunch/dinner for Rs five each.

114,02-4-20,Intelligence agencies fail to read Tablighi Jamaat’s virus threat,"India’s external and internal intelligence agencies failed to read, assess and report the warning signals emerging from the Tablighi Jamaat stable within and outside the country.

As Tablighi Jamaat continued its ijtema (congregation) in Kuala Lumpur (Feb 27-Mar 1), Lahore (March 13), Sulawesi, Selatan in Indonesia (Mar 18), 26 Covid-19 positive Jamaat members were reported in Malaysia and 45 in Lahore and an unknown numbers in Indonesia. But India’s external Intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) did not report the viral epidemic at Tablighi events in the region or issue an alert to the effect.

Similary, the Intelligence Bureau ignored the foreign Tablighi members’ movement across the country spreading the pandemic to the hinterland.

The issue of the Jamaat’s congregation in Kuala Lumpur was highlighted there in the media due to the threat it posed to public health amid the coronavirus pandemic. Taking cognisance of the Jamaat-related developments in Malaysia, Indonesia did not allow the Tablighi to hold the congregation from March 17 to 19. However, a number of the Tablighis who had already arrived on the venue in Indonesia infected a number of co-participants.

While the COVID-19 outbreak trend was developing in the region in Tablighi’s congregations, hundreds of the Jamaat members were assembled in the Nizamuddin area despite concerned citizens expressing concerns to the authorities over the presence of so many people in a relatively small facility amid the push for social distancing.

The returning jamaats were given clear instructions by Tablinghi Jamaat chief Mohammad Saad to access more and more mosques after going back from Nizamuddin.

Scores of foreign Tablighi members spread across the country, spreading the coronavirus to the interiors of the country and posing a major threat to public health amid the ongoing lockdown in the country to counter the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is not the first time that the Research and Analysis Wing, responsible for gathering external intelligence, did not meet the expectations of the Government as it could not assess the mood in the European Union after the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act by the Parliament here.

120,02-4-20,Didi asks Modi for Rs 61K cr to ward off crisis,"Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has asked for Rs 61,000 crore from the Centre to ward off the crisis arising out of the corona endemic. This amount includes the financial dues that the ""Centre owes"" to the State.

A day before her video meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the Chief Minister has written a letter to the former seeking a financial package of Rs 25,000 crore to meet the expenses for providing free ration to the people of the State along with other public welfare schemes planned amid massive shortfall in the State’s revenue during post corona lockdown.

Apart from this the Chief Minister has also asked the Centre to clear the past dues amounting to about Rs 36,000 crore, senior officials said. The Chief Minister had earlier committed free ration to the 9 crore strong population of the State that started on Wednesday amid large-scale crowding of market places throughout the districts.

In the letter the Chief Minister wrote that her State’s finances “like many other States” were in a “dire situation with practically no revenue flows after the closure of all business.”

The letter further read that regardless of the grim situation on account of the lockdown the State has “somehow been able to pay the salaries, wages and pensions of Government employees this month though some major states of the country could not do that on full. And even with the massive debt trap left behind by the previous Government we were able to service the debt so far but future remains uncertain.”

Asking the Centre to sanction a special grant of Rs 25,000 crore Banerjee wrote that her Government “required to meet our commitments towards girl child, students, farmers, unorganized workers, weaker sections, minorities, SC, ST and OBCs. We are also having to honour our commitments of providing free ration to almost 9 crore people who need this so crucially to survive in this perilous time.”

Besides she reminded that the Centre was “yet to pay Rs 36,000 crore” due to the State.

The timing of the letter is crucial as it was written a day ahead of the video meeting the Prime Minister was likely to hold with the Chief Ministers on Thursday.

Banerjee who has earned appreciations for aptly managing the corona crisis till now later appealed to the people not to come out of their houses and throng places. “The coming two weeks are very crucial for us and it is a time we all should cooperate with each other to ward fight the disease by remaining indoors…. Please do not come out of your houses and crowd the streets… you will get time for gossiping in future but now it is time to handle the crisis,” she said.

The Chief Minister’s appeal came at a time when thousands of people were seen thronging the rural markets and ration shops --- throwing all cautions to the wind --- to procure 5 kgs of free rice promised by the Government. Large gatherings were seen at Coochbehar, North and South 24 Parganas, Burdwan and elsewhere Food and Civil Societies Minister JP Mullick said appealing to the people to maintain social distancing.

Meanwhile, the death rate compared to the number of Corona infections remained a cause of concern for the doctors even as Bengal recorded its 6th death late on Tuesday night.

Neither of the victims had a travel history, Health Department officials said adding they were trying to gather further information.

The Chief Minister later said that the man died of kidney ailments. The doctors too said he had been suffering from diabetes for the past 20 years and had been a renal patient adding however that he tested positive for the coronavirus.

More than 30 villages across eight districts of Jammu & Kashmir have already been declared 'red zones by the government, thoroughly restricting movement of people from one place to another.

At present, 52 patients have been kept in hospital isolation, 516 under hospital quarantine, and 3961 under home surveillance. Out of 977 samples, 911 have tested negative and reports of four are awaited.

Reversing the previous session’s gains, the 30-share BSE barometer Sensex slumped 1,203.18 points or 4.08 per cent to finish at 28,265.31.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty tanked 343.95 points, or 4 per cent, to close at 8,253.80.

Global equities skidded as weak factory data from Asia and a steady rise in coronavirus cases pointed to the tough road ahead for the world economy. Dismal auto sales numbers and reports of India missing its fiscal deficit targets by a wide margin further sapped investor confidence here, traders said.

Tech Mahindra was the top loser in the Sensex pack, crashing 9.21 per cent, followed by Kotak Bank (8.81 per cent), TCS (6.23 per cent), Infosys (5.65 per cent), Axis Bank (5.50 per cent) and SBI (5.26 per cent).

Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance and Titan were the only gainers, spurting up to 2.21 per cent.

According to traders, domestic equities plunged in tandem with global stocks as no respite from the coronavirus pandemic seemed in sight. Extensive lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus have severely hit business outlook, they said.

Around the world, total number of infected cases surged past 8.6 lakh, while deaths have crossed 42,000.

135,02-4-20,Global economy could shrink by almost 1% in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic: UN,"The global economy could shrink by up to one per cent in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, a reversal from the previous forecast of 2.5 per cent growth, the UN has said, warning that it may contract even further if restrictions on the economic activities are extended without adequate fiscal responses.

The analysis by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) said the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade. With nearly 100 countries closing national borders during the past month, the movement of people and tourism flows have come to a screeching halt.

""Millions of workers in these countries are facing the bleak prospect of losing their jobs. Governments are considering and rolling out large stimulus packages to avert a sharp downturn of their economies which could potentially plunge the global economy into a deep recession. In the worst-case scenario, the world economy could contract by 0.9 per cent in 2020,"" the DESA said, adding that the world economy had contracted by 1.7 per cent during the global financial crisis in 2009.

It added that the contraction could be even higher if governments fail to provide income support and help boost consumer spending.

The analysis noted that before the outbreak of the COVID-19, world output was expected to expand at a modest pace of 2.5 per cent in 2020, as reported in the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2020.

Taking into account rapidly changing economic conditions, the UN DESA's World Economic Forecasting Model has estimated best and worst-case scenarios for global growth in 2020.

In the best-case scenario with moderate declines in private consumption, investment and exports and offsetting increases in government spending in the G-7 countries and China global growth would fall to 1.2 per cent in 2020.

""In the worst-case scenario, the global output would contract by 0.9 per cent instead of growing by 2.5 per cent in 2020,"" it said, adding that the scenario is based on demand-side shocks of different magnitudes to China, Japan, South Korea, the US and the EU, as well as an oil price decline of 50 per cent against our baseline of USD 61 per barrel.

The severity of the economic impact will largely depend on two factors - the duration of restrictions on the movement of people and economic activities in major economies; and the actual size and efficacy of fiscal responses to the crisis.

A well-designed fiscal stimulus package, prioritising health spending to contain the spread of the virus and providing income support to households most affected by the pandemic would help to minimise the likelihood of a deep economic recession, it said.

According to the forecast, lockdowns in Europe and North America are hitting the service sector hard, particularly industries that involve physical interactions such as retail trade, leisure and hospitality, recreation and transportation services. Collectively, such industries account for more than a quarter of all jobs in these economies.

The DESA said as businesses lose revenue, unemployment is likely to increase sharply, transforming a supply-side shock to a wider demand-side shock for the economy.

Against this backdrop, the UN-DESA is joining a chorus of voices across the UN system calling for well-designed fiscal stimulus packages which prioritize health spending and support households most affected by the pandemic.

Urgent and bold policy measures are needed, not only to contain the pandemic and save lives, but also to protect the most vulnerable in our societies from economic ruin and to sustain economic growth and financial stability, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Liu Zhenmin said.

The analysis also warns that the adverse effects of prolonged economic restrictions in developed economies will soon spill over to developing countries via trade and investment channels.

A sharp decline in consumer spending in the European Union and the United States will reduce imports of consumer goods from developing countries.

Developing countries, particularly those dependent on tourism and commodity exports, face heightened economic risks. Global manufacturing production could contract significantly, and the plummeting number of travellers is likely to hurt the tourism sector in small island developing States, which employs millions of low-skilled workers, it said.

Meanwhile, the decline in commodity-related revenues and a reversal of capital flows are increasing the likelihood of debt distress for many nations. Governments may be forced to curtail public expenditure at a time when they need to ramp up spending to contain the pandemic and support consumption and investment.

UN Chief Economist and Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development Elliot Harris said the collective goal must be a resilient recovery which puts the planet back on a sustainable track. We must not lose sight how it is affecting the most vulnerable population and what that means for sustainable development, he said.

The alarms raised by UN-DESA echo another report, released on March 31, in which UN experts issued a broad appeal for a large-scale, coordinated, comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP).

According to estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, confirmed coronavirus cases across the world now stand at over 932,600 and over 42,000 deaths.

137,02-4-20,World virus toll over 45K,"More than 8.9L cases have been registered in 186 countries, 1,90,639 have been recovered; Europe toll tops 30,000 as UN warns of world’s worst crisis since WWII

The worldwide number of officially confirmed fatalities from the novel coronavirus rose to 45,309 on Wednesday. More than 902,715 declared cases have been registered in 186 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December. Of these cases, at least 1,90,639 are now considered recovered.

The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 30,000 lives in Europe alone, a global tally showed on Wednesday, in what the head of the United Nations has described as humanity’s worst crisis since World War II.

Italy and Spain bore the brunt of the crisis, accounting for three in every four deaths on the continent, as the grim tally hit another milestone even though half of the planet’s population is already under some form of lockdown in a battle to halt contagion.

Spain reported a record 864 deaths in 24 hours, pushing the country’s number of fatalities past 9,000.

The toll is only dwarfed by Italy’s, where the virus has killed nearly 12,500 people.

President Donald Trump has warned of a “very, very painful two weeks” as the United States registered its deadliest 24 hours of what he called a “plague”. In a scramble to halt the contagion, governments have shut schools, most shops, and ordered millions of people to work from home.

Cancellations of key events on the global calendar have swept both the sports and cultural worlds, with the Edinburgh arts festival the latest to be scrapped.

For UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the extraordinary upheaval spurred by the virus presents a real danger to the relative peace the world has seen over the last few decades.

The disease “represents a threat to everybody in the world and... An economic impact that will bring a recession that probably has no parallel in the recent past,” he said.

“The combination of the two facts and the risk that it contributes to enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict are things that make us believe that this is the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.”

With most business activity grinding to a halt for an undetermined period of time, scenes of economic desperation and unrest were emerging across the globe.

In Italy, queues were lengthening at soup kitchens while some supermarkets were reportedly pillaged.

Half a million more people now need help to afford meals, Italy’s biggest union for the agriculture sector Coldiretti said, adding to the 2.7 million already in need last year.

“Usually we serve 152,525 people. But now we’ve 70,000 more requests,” confirmed Roberto Tuorto, who runs a food aid association. It was crucial to “ensure that the economic crisis unleashed by the virus doesn’t become a security crisis,” he warned. The economic pain of lockdowns is especially acute in poorer nations.

In Tunisia several hundred protested a week-old lockdown that has disproportionately hit the poor. “Never mind coronavirus, we’re going to die anyway! Let us work!” shouted one protester in the demonstration on the outskirts of the capital Tunis.

Africa’s biggest city Lagos was just into its second full day of lockdown on Wednesday — but with some of the world’s biggest slums, home to millions who live hand-to-mouth, containment will be a challenge.

Wary of a collapse of the world’s economy, the globe’s leading central bankers have pumped billions of liquidity into the system.

In the European Union, the terms of a rescue plan threatened to divide the bloc.

Worst-hit Italy and Spain are leading a push for a shared debt instrument — dubbed “coronabonds”, but talk of shared debt is a red line for Germany and other northern countries.

The tone sharpened this week, with some Italian politicians even taking out an advertisement in a major German newspaper to remind Europe’s biggest economy of WWII debts to jolt it into action.

The economic cost of the crisis was still piling up as lockdowns remain at the forefront of official disease-stopping arsenals — a strategy increasingly borne out by science.

Researchers said China’s decision to shutter Wuhan, ground zero for the pandemic, may have prevented hundreds of thousands of new cases.

“Our analysis suggests that without the Wuhan travel ban and the national emergency response there would have been more than 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan” by mid February, said Oxford University’s Christopher Dye.

At the same time, focus is now turning to how asymptomatic cases may be fuelling the spread.

Germany and France were also ramping up testing of the population to establish how many already have immunity.

For now, the focus of the health sector in the hardest hit countries remains the scramble for available facilities to treat patients. Emergency hospitals are popping up in event spaces while distressed medical staff make grim decisions about how to distribute limited protective gear, beds and life-saving respirators.

In scenes unimaginable in peacetime, around a dozen white tents were erected to serve as a field hospital in New York’s Central Park. But even with the extended capacity, doctors say they are still having to make painful choices. “If you get a surge of patients coming in, and you only have a limited number of ventilators, you can’t necessarily ventilate patients,” Shamit Patel of the Beth Israel hospital said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/world-virus-toll-over-45k.html
138,02-4-20,"Trump says US headed for ‘very tough’, ‘painful’ two weeks","The US is headed for a “very tough two weeks”, President Donald Trump has warned, advising people to be prepared for the “hard days”ahead, as the country was at war with a deadly coronavirus pandemic that the White House projects could claim one to two lakh lives during the next fortnight.

Trump’s remarks came as Deborah Bix, a member of White House Task Force on coronavirus, based on a model from actual data from the ground, said the death toll in the US could be between 1,00,000 to 2,00,000, with the strict implementation of the existing mitigation measures including social distancing till April 30.

If no steps were to be taken, the death toll could range between 1.5 million and 2.2 million, Brix said on a day when the confirmed number of coronavirus infections in the US, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center website, zoomed to over 1,89,500, adding more than 25,000 new cases in a single day and the fatalities rose to over 4,000.

“I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,” a grim-faced Trump told reporters on Tuesday at a briefing which has now become his daily coronavirus press conference at the White House for more than 10 days.

“We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks and then, hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting after having studied it so hard, we are going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel. But this is going to be a very painful, very, very, very painful two weeks,” Trump said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-says-us-headed-for----very-tough--------painful----two-weeks.html
139,02-4-20,China-India at new starting point: Xi,"China-India relations are standing at a new starting point and facing new opportunities, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday, exchanging congratulatory messages with his Indian counterpart Ram Nath Kovind on the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties.

On April 1, 1950, India became the first non-socialist country in Asia to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China.

In his message to Kovind, Xi said China-India relations have experienced “extraordinary development” during the past 70 years. With joint efforts of both sides, the two countries have established a strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity, and are endeavouring to build an even closer partnership of development, he said.

The two sides enjoy increasingly deepening bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and constantly improving coordination on important regional and international affairs, Xi, who held two informal summits with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan and later in Mamallapuram in 2018 and 2019 which stabilised the bilateral ties, said. Xi said he attaches great importance to the development of bilateral relations with India and is willing to work with President Kovind to elevate China-India ties to a higher level, so as to bring more benefits to the two countries and contribute more positive energy to Asia as well as the world, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

President Kovind, in his letter to his Chinese counterpart Xi, conveyed warm greetings, felicitations and good wishes to the government and the people of China.

He noted that the two sides have made considerable progress, especially in the last few years, in enhancing their bilateral engagement in a number of areas, including political, economic and people-to-people ties.

Messages of felicitations were exchanged between the presidents, prime ministers and external affairs ministers of India and China on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

In his message to Prime Minister Modi, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said friendly cooperation and mutual benefit serve the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and will benefit Asia and the world.

Modi, in his message to Li, said coravirus pandemic is a reminder of the interconnected nature of the world and the need for adopting a global response to it. Modi also said good bilateral relations are conducive not only for the two countries, but also important from the perspective of peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the world.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-india-at-new-starting-point--xi.html

142,02-4-20,EMI moratorium: Borrowers unlikely to get significant gains,"Three-month moratorium on EMI payments offered by banks is unlikely to bring much relief to borrowers hit by COVID-19 lockdowns as they will have to bear the extra cost of interest charged by lenders and a longer repayment period, according to experts.

Experts feel that the three-month moratorium on repayment on loans to help people fight the impact of coronavirus seems to be benefiting banks rather than borrowers as they will have to pay accumulated interest through increased number of EMIs.

It is an expensive proposition for any borrower to opt for three-month suspension as announced by the RBI under the relief measures to mitigate the hardship of those hit by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

Last Friday, the RBI had announced that all term loans, including retail and crop loans and working capital payments, will be covered by the three-month moratorium. Banks will now have discretion in deciding the limits on working capital, with the RBI saying that no payment miss should be considered a default and reported to credit information companies.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/emi-moratorium--borrowers-unlikely-to-get-significant-gains.html

144,02-4-20,"GST mop-up slips below Rs 1 lakh cr-mark, March collection at Rs 97,597 cr","GST collections in March slipped below the psychological Rs 1 lakh crore-mark for the first time in four months to Rs 97,597 crore as COVID-19 lockdown that shut most businesses compounded tax collection woes in an already sluggish economy.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) mop-up in March recorded a 8.4 per cent decline over March 2019 collection of Rs 1.06 lakh crore. The collections were lower on account of dip in revenues from domestic transactions as well as imports.

In the last four months —November 2019-February 2020 — GST collection surpassed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark. In February, mop-up was Rs 1.05 lakh crore, January (Rs 1.10 lakh crore), December (Rs 1.03 lakh crore) and November (Rs 1.03 lakh crore). The number of GST returns filed during March was 76.5 lakh, lower than 83 lakh filed in February — reflecting poor compliance.

“The gross GST revenue collected in the month of March, 2020 is Rs 97,597 crore of which CGST is Rs 19,183 crore, SGST is Rs 25,601 crore, IGST is Rs 44,508 crore (including Rs 18,056 crore collected on imports) and Cess is Rs 8,306 crore (including Rs 841 crore collected on imports),” a finance ministry statement said on Wednesday.

The Government has settled Rs 19,718 crore to CGST and Rs 14,915 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement. The total revenue earned by the Central Government and State Governments after regular settlement in March, 2020 is Rs 41,901 crore for CGST and Rs 43,516 crore for the SGST, it added. The ministry further said that GST revenues from domestic transactions has shown a negative growth of 4 per cent over March, 2019. Taking into account the GST collected from import of goods, the total revenue during March, 2020 has also decreased by 8 per cent over March, 2019.

During this month, the GST on import of goods has shown a negative growth of (-) 23 per cent as compared to March, 2019, the ministry added. For the full financial year 2019-20, the GST from domestic transaction has shown a growth rate of 8 per cent over the revenues in the preceding year. During 2019-20, GST from import on goods fell by 8 per cent as compared to the previous year. Overall, gross GST revenues grew at 4 per cent year-on-year.

Tax experts, however, raised concern that GST collection number is likely to decline further next month on account of disruption in economic activity due to COVID-19 outbreak.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/gst-mop-up-slips-below--rs-1-lakh-cr-mark--march-collection-at-rs-97-597-cr.html

147,02-4-20,UK death toll crosses 500 mark in sharp daily spike,"The UK reported its biggest single-day coronavirus toll of 563 on Wednesday, taking the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the country to 2,352.

The Department of Health said 29,474 people have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 4,324 cases since on Tuesday, as the country remains under lockdown with the Government’s advice for people to stay at home and observe strict social distancing when outside for exercising or buying essentials.

The latest virus positive tests mark an increase of nearly 20,000 confirmed cases in the UK in just one week.

The Government has said its focus remains on ramping up testing for frontline National Health Service (NHS) staff, who are treating the rising number of patients coming through hospitals and clinics.

Downing Street spokesperson for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who remains in self-isolation after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week — confirmed more than 2,000 NHS frontline staff in England have been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began in a push to get healthy self-isolating medics back to work.

UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove had said on Tuesday that a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS, which employs 1.2 million in England, could not screen greater numbers of its staff for the virus.

Meanwhile, several makeshift hospitals are becoming functional across the UK as the NHS aims to boost its bed capacity to cope with the growing number of COVID-19 cases. It follows the conversion of London’s ExCel Centre into NHS Nightingale — a 4,000-bed hospital facility.

A push for more ventilators is also in place as a new set of manufacturers plan to deliver the first batch by early next week. “We are doing everything we can to support our NHS staff fighting this battle on the frontline, and it’s crucial we get even more ventilators there as soon as possible,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

“We have seen a fantastic response from businesses to our call for a national effort -- and I’m delighted these companies accepted the challenge to save lives across the country,” he said.

The Government said it has provided a number of letters of intent to purchase potentially thousands more ventilators with companies who have credible designs, subject to them passing the regulator and strict safety tests.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-death-toll-crosses-500-mark-in-sharp-daily-spike.html

Google, a company renowned for its elaborate annual stunts, told its employees it would “take the year off from that tradition out of respect for all those fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,” according to an internal email obtained by Business Insider.

149,02-4-20,Coronavirus having little impact on climate: UN agency,"Though factories have shut, planes have been grounded and cars left in the garage, the coronavirus pandemic is having very little impact on climate change, the World Meteorological Organization said Wednesday.

Any reductions in pollution and carbon dioxide emissions are likely to be temporary, said Lars Peter Riishojgaard, from the infrastructure department of the WMO, a United Nations agency based in Geneva.

“It does not mean much for climate,” he told a virtual press conference.

Riishojgaard said there was a lot of media speculation about what impact the global pandemic might have on the climate, greenhouse gas emissions and longer-term global warming.

“The answer to that is it probably does not mean very much,” he said.

While in the short term, carbon dioxide emissions would go down as cars stay put and aircraft remain on the ground, “we expect the impact will be fairly short-lived,” Riishojgaard said.

“The pandemic will be over at some point and the world will start going back to work and with that, the CO2 emissions will pick up again, maybe or maybe not to quite the same level.”

He said visibility in cities such as New Delhi had improved because there were fewer traffic-emitting fumes, but cautioned that it was only down to an “artificial halt” to normal activity.

“You could see it as maybe science experiment: what happens if all of a sudden we turn the whole thing off?” said Riishojgaard.

“It will lead some people, and perhaps also some governments, to rethink.” He reflected on China shutting down much industrial production during the Beijing 2008 Olympics.

“They demonstrated very clearly that you can absolutely, if you have enough control over the situation, you can turn off the air pollution,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-having-little-impact-on-climate--un-agency.html

151,02-4-20,Ayurvedic shield,"Here are some tips from experts to fight COVID-19 and keep calm while working from home

Can you recall the last time you stepped out with your children happily? When did you last shop for yourself? Don’t you miss the coffee breaks with your colleagues? Well, this conversation might seem far-removed from present day reality when the world is facing a crisis. A large part of the world, which wakes up to empty streets due to COVID-19, has accepted the lockdown and empty grocery stores as a way of life.

The virus has become a social and economic threat due to its global impact. It has changed the way we eat, socialise, work, play and travel. But what is even more scary is that we have not found its cure yet. Doctors and practitioners are still in the process of researching on a vaccine for this virus. Amidst all this crisis, there are experts who feel that following some Ayurvedic ways and building immunity can help us fight this virus.

Here are some tips from Ayurveda expert Acharya Manish and Ayurvedacharya Dr Partap Chauhan, director, Jiva Ayurveda, to fight the pandemic.

Ayurveda might prevent Coronavirus

In Ayurveda, strong digestion plays a vital role in fighting against any virus and disease. Opting for a healthier lifestyle and shifting towards organic products are important steps to fight the pandemic. Besides this, here are some tips by Ayurveda expert, Acharya Manish:

As we all know, this is the time of Navratra and people are fasting. Though people usually do it because of religious reasons but fasting at least once a week is good for health. It detoxifies the body and improves the immunity.

During fast eat salads, vegetables, dry fruit, seeds, coconut water and herbal tea. This diet may prevent the spread of the virus.

Take ayurvedic herbs such as giloy, turmeric, ashwagandha, tulsi and amla. They are effective in improving the immunity.

Since the virus is caused by coming in contact with infected patients, avoid that and follow hygiene guidelines like frequent handwashing and isolating oneself if there are any symptoms.

Avoid heavy meals, eggs, meat and fish these days.

Use napkins, tissue paper while sneezing and throw them in the bin after use.

Try not to come in contact with any animal.

Drink hot water, also called ushan Jal in Ayurveda. It is easily digestible and removes toxins from the body. It also helps to maintain the immunity of the body and protects it from viral infections and respiratory problems — one of the symptons of the virus.

Focus on building your immunity

You need to focus on building immunity not just to fight Coronavirus but all diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. “You must have seen that many people fall ill frequently or have cough most of the time while some rarely fall ill. This difference is because of the immune system. The ones with weak immunity frequently fall ill,” says Acharya Manish.

He adds that adding tulsi, guduchi and turmeric in diet can help in increasing the immunity of the body. Eating healthy food is the first step towards boosting immunity. One should also consume citrus fruits like oranges and grapes regularly. They have vitamin C which is believed to be effective in increasing the production of white blood cells. Broccoli also helps in increasing the immunity of the body as it contains vitamin A, C, E and a lot of fibre.

Ayurvedacharya Dr Partap Chauhan, director, Jiva Ayurveda, says that one should ditch regular tea. As we work from home, our routines have gone for a toss. To cope with work stress, we increase our caffeine doses. But it is time we replace our regular caffeine dose with an Ayurvedic tea. One can make it at home with ginger, tulsi leaves and honey. These ingredients are good for the respiratory system and immunity too. Not only this, these also give the added benefit of stress relief.

Herbs like brahmi, ashwagandha, jatamansi, sankhpuhspi, sarpgandha are also great for reducing stress.

Yoga, a necessity

“Yoga is no longer a lifestyle fad, it’s a necessity. Fix 30 minutes every morning for yoga. Composing your mind in the morning will fortify it for stress assaults all day long.

People have forgotten Ayurveda

It is one of the oldest systems of traditonal medicine. The ancient wisdom in this system has the potential to cure any disease. But Acharya Manish questions that why have people forgotten Ayurveda and it’s importance? Well, probably because it works slowly and people want faster results.

“In this fast-paced life people are sticking to allopathic medicines more as they give faster results. This is because it only kills the symptoms of the disease. On the other hand, Ayurveda works on the root cause. We need to focus on the fact that Ayurveda has a solution for all the diseases. It takes time but cures the diseases properly without any side effects,” adds Acharya Manish.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ayurvedic-shield-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/ayurvedic-shield.html

Actor Madhuri Dixit Nene feels that dance is one of the best forms of workout. As most people are locked in their homes now due to the nationwide lockdown, the veteran actor has teamed up with Kathak exponent Birju Maharaj and choreographers like Saroj Khan, Terence Lewis, and Remo D'souza to offer dance lessons on DancewithMadhuri.com.

Madhuri's online dance academy will give away two popular dance classes every week for free.

She says: “We want to provide people to relieve stress in the sanctity of their own home with an opportunity to relax and enjoy themselves. Dance is one of the best forms of workout, so it becomes a double bonanza to learn and get in shape,”

People asked me why I would choose to leave Canada to go to India when I don’t know anyone there. However, I have lived in many countries. So I’m a multicultural chick. So coming to India wasn’t scary. Also, being someone who is well-versed with Hindi cinema, I knew I wasn’t going to have any cultural shock.

—Nora Fatehi

Actor Anushka Sharma has had time for some reflection in life during the nationwide lockdown.

She says that she has realised, just having food, water, a roof over her head and the good health of her family are most important.

“Every dark cloud had a silver lining. And this time, while it may seem like the worst time and in so many ways it actually is, has also forcefully made us all stop and deal with things we might have been running away from, because either we were ‘busy’ or it was convenient to say we were ‘busy,’” Anushka said in a twitter post.

Daniel amused by the rumour

Actor Daniel Radcliffe says he was amused by the coronavirus hoax about him on Twitter.

The Harry Potter star became the first celebrity to become a coronavirus Twitter hoax when a tweet from a fake BBC News account falsely claimed that the actor had tested positive for coronavirus.

In an interview he said that he had been in hair and make-up before a play performance when the artist broke the fake news to him. He says, “I was quite amused by it. It’s not the first time I’ve had something crazy written about me.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-04-02.html
153,02-4-20,Making a difference,"Many Bollywood actors have come forward to contribute monetarily in these times of crisis

Actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas has decided to donate $100,000 along with the organisation BON V!V Spiked Seltzer to the women out there who are working for the betterment of society amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Taking to her Instagram Story, Priyanka revealed that she was supposed to launch a promotional campaign with the brand in the next few weeks but due to the coronavirus pandemic, she decided to halt the plan. She will now use the resources for the four women who are in need.

She posted a video in which is seen requesting her users to nominate such women. “Our worlds changed quickly, and needless to say, we couldn’t go forward with our original plans to launch this campaign. Each week I’ll go live with @BONVIVSeltzer to share the stories of four women who are overcoming the struggles of our new realities in their own powerful way. If you know a woman we should highlight, visit the link in my bio for next steps. We are all in this together. #togetherwomenrise #partner,” Priyanka wrote.

The actor also issued a statement, which read: “If you know a woman we should highlight, share her story with us, whether she is in the service industry, from a large business, small business owner, or first responders on the front lines. We want to commemorate her. #TogetherWomenRise.”

The actor and her husband Nick Jonas have also donated to organisations like the PM-CARES Fund, Unicef, Feeding America and Goonj.

There are several other actors from the industry who are doing their bit. Actor Ajay Devgn will also be donating Rs 51 lakh to Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) to aid daily wage film workers, who have been left without jobs due to the lockdown amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Confirming the news, Ashok Dubey, general secretary of FWICE, said: “Ajay has pledged to donate Rs 51 lakh to FWICE. I’m glad that people like Ajay and Rohit (Shetty) are helping the daily wage workers who need it the most during the downtime. We have received more enquiries from others wanting to provide monetary help. We are providing them the account details. I hope more and more people come forward to help daily wage workers,” Dubey added.

Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was the first industry bigwig who took the initiative to help the 25,000-odd daily wage workers of the film industry whose lives have been affected owing to the lockdown.

Filmmaker Rohit Shetty subsequently donated Rs 51 lakh to FWICE. Frames Production Company and Shashi Sumit Productions have also provided ration and money for the cause. FWICE will utilise all the donated money to help its daily wage workers like junior artistes, stunt artistes, light men, and spot boys amongst others.

Bollywood actor Vicky Kaushal also donated Rs 1 crore to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relief fund and Chief Minister's (Maharashtra) relief fund, to lend support to the ongoing battle with COVID-19 pandemic.

He also shared a note on Instagram: ""While I am blessed enough to be seated with my loved ones in the comfortsof my home, there are many who are not as fortunate. In this time of crisis, I humbly pledge to contribute an amount of Rs. 1 crore to PM-CARES and Maharashtra Chief Minister Relief Fund. We are in this together and we'll win this together.

154,02-4-20,Exploring the fun side,"Cricket is not just a sport, it is the heart of Indians. It’s something that unites us. With its mission to inspire creativity and bring joy, TikTok, a platform for short format videos has become the go-to platform for cricketers from all over to explore their fun and creative side.

Cricketers such as Suresh Raina, Yuzvendra Chahal, Virender Sehwag, Irfan Pathan, Mohammad Shami, Chris Gayle and Yusuf Pathan have joined TikTok to showcase their talent apart from cricket. Many of them can be seen experimenting with the new filters available on the platform such as submarine game, zoom my face and halloween, making fun and comedy videos. They can also be seen participating in the ongoing challenges and sharing their fitness regime, inspiring millions on the platform.

With over three million followers on TikTok, India’s finest right-arm-leg spinner, Chahal is a big hit on TikTok. His comedy videos and fun banter with fellow cricketers leaves his fans in splits of laughter. Sharing his experience on TikTok, Chahal said, “It is amazing to be on this platform as it helps me explore my fun side. I’ve come across some users who are sharing different and exciting content.

155,02-4-20,"Mass testing, empty ICUs: Germany scores early against virus","Late last year — long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus now sweeping the globe — scientists in Germany sprang into action to develop a test for the virus that was causing an unusual respiratory disease in central China.

They had one by mid-January — and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later, around the same time that Europe’s most populous country registered its first case.

“It was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China, then we had to start testing,” said Hendrik Borucki, a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare, which operates 19 labs in Germany.

That quick work stands in stark contrast to delays and missteps in other countries. Coupled with Germany’s large number of intensive care beds and its early social distancing measures, it could explain one of the most interesting puzzles of the COVID-19 pandemic: Why are people with the virus in Germany currently dying at much lower rates than in neighboring countries?

The numbers are remarkable: As confirmed cases in Germany passed 71,000, the death toll Wednesday was 775, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In contrast, Italy has reported almost 106,000 infections and more than 12,400 deaths, while Spain has more than 102,000 cases with over 9,000 deaths.

France has four times as many virus deaths as Germany and Britain has twice as many, even though both countries have fewer reported infections.

There may be many factors at play, but experts said early on that fast and widespread testing gave Germany an edge.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin’s Charité hospital — established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/mass-testing--empty-icus--germany-scores-early-against-virus.html
156,02-4-20,Afghanistan Govt holds talks with Taliban on prisoners’ swap,"Afghan Government representatives have met with the Taliban in Kabul for the first time to discuss a prisoner swap aimed at jump-starting a floundering peace process, officials said on Wednesday.

The two sides met on Tuesday and would meet again on Wednesday for further talks being observed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, Afghanistan’s Office of the National Security Council said on Twitter.

“The two sides held face-to-face negotiations about the release of Afghan National Defense and Security Force personnel as well as Taliban prisoners,” the security council said. It was the first time the hardline Islamists had been invited to Kabul to meet directly with Government officials since they were toppled in the US-led invasion of 2001. The two sides had spoken previously in a videoconference to discuss the prisoner issue.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP that a “technical team” was in Kabul purely to facilitate the prisoner swap, and not for additional negotiations.

“The prisoners to be released should be those whose names are on the list... That is why our technical team is there... It is not a negotiation, and there will be no political talks there”, Mujahid said. Washington signed a deal with the Taliban in late February that promised the withdrawal of US and foreign troops from Afghanistan by July next year, provided the Taliban start talks with Kabul and adhere to other guarantees.

The deal required the Afghan Government — which was not a signatory to the accord — to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners and for the insurgents to release 1,000 pro-government captives in return. The imbalance is one of many aspects of the agreement that observers say gives the Taliban the better bargain. The swap was supposed to have taken place by March 10, at which point peace talks between the Taliban and the government were meant to begin.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/afghanistan-govt--holds-talks-with-taliban--on-prisoners----swap.html

Of the total deaths, some 51 people were killed in shelling and air strikes by the Syrian regime, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The bulk of the remaining casualties were caused either by explosive remnants or mysterious “assassinations”, the Observatory added.

The civilian death toll was more than double that of March in February, when a regime offensive on Syria’s last major rebel bastion was still in full swing. According to the Observatory, the number of deaths that month stood at 275. The war in Syria has left more than 380,000 people dead since it started nine years ago.

The highest civilian death toll recorded in a month since the start of the conflict was 1,590 in July 2016, when battles between rebels and the regime raged in the northern province of Aleppo.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/syria-war-records-lowest-monthly-death-toll-in-9-yrs.html
159,02-4-20,"China reveals 1,541 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases amid concerns of second wave of infections","For the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak, China on Wednesday revealed the presence of 1,541 asymptomatic cases carrying the deadly novel coronavirus, raising concerns of a second wave of infections amid the relaxation of stringent measures in the country initiated to contain the deadly disease.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who carry the virus but do not show any symptoms and can cause sporadic clusters of infections. In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said it would begin to release the data of asymptomatic patients. A total of 1,541 asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 have been put under medical observation in China by the end of Monday, including 205 imported cases, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the NHC in a statement.

Besides the asymptomatic cases, there are reports of 35 new imported cases and one domestic infection, NHC said on Wednesday. The total number of imported cases has risen to 806, it said. Seven more people have died of the disease, taking the total number to 3,312.

As of Tuesday, a total of 81,554 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 had been reported on the Chinese mainland.

The announcement about asymptomatic cases came as the other countries are including asymptomatic cases in their number of confirmed cases for their potential to infect others. Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that the data suggested that by the end of February, more than 43,000 people in mainland China had tested positive for the coronavirus but had no immediate symptoms. They were not included in the official tally of the confirmed cases. There is no official explanation why these cases have not been included earlier.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-reveals-1-541-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-amid-concerns-of-second-wave-of-infections.html
160,02-4-20,Ready to help end Saudi-Russian oil-price war: Trump,"US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was ready to help resolve an escalating oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia that has helped push crude benchmarks to 17-year lows.

The threat of a global recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic had already hammered prices when

Riyadh said last month it would raise exports after a production-cut agreement among top producers flopped in early March.

On Monday, Saudi Arabia said it would increase exports further to a record 10.6 million barrels per day from May, deepening a global supply glut as crude recorded its biggest monthly and quarterly price plunges in history.

Trump said he had spoken with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman by phone with the aim of halting the slide.

“The two countries are discussing it. And I am joining at the appropriate time, if need be,” Trump said.

Saudi Arabia had been exporting around 7.0 million barrels per day under an output reduction agreement among a 24-member producer alliance known as OPEC+, which included Russia.

OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement on further production cuts to shore up sagging prices as the coronavirus battered the global economy last month.

Analysts say Riyadh is engaged in a deliberate long-term strategy to capture greater market share by pressuring its high-cost rivals.

“Saudi policy will not just drive more expensive forms of oil production out of the market; it will also make it harder for renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels,” said Bernard Haykel, a Saudi expert at Princeton University.

The price war has also hit shale oil producers in the US, with Trump telling Tuesday’s press conference that the production dispute threatened “thousands and thousands” of jobs.

In a letter last week to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a group of US senators accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of waging “economic warfare against the United States”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/ready-to-help-end-saudi-russian-oil-price-war--trump.html
161,02-4-20,"UN, WTO: World faces food crisis in wake of coronavirus","The heads of three global agencies warned on Wednesday of the risk of a worldwide “food shortage” if authorities fail to manage the ongoing coronavirus crisis properly. Many Governments around the world have put their populations on lockdown causing severe slow-downs in international trade and food supply chains.

Panic buying by people going into confinement has already demonstrated the fragility of supply chains as supermarket shelves emptied in many countries.

“Uncertainty about food availability can spark a wave of export restrictions, creating a shortage on the global market,” said the joint text signed by Qu Dongyu, head of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roberto Azevedo, director of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

“In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, every effort must be made to ensure that trade flows as freely as possible, specially to avoid food shortage(s)” from developing, they said in their statement. “When acting to protect the health and well-being of their citizens, countries should ensure that any trade-related measures do not disrupt the food supply chain,” they added.

Over the longer term confinement orders and travel restrictions risk causing disruptions in agricultural production due to the unavailability of agricultural labour and the inability to get food to markets.

“Such disruptions including hampering the movement of agricultural and food industry workers and extending border delays for food containers, result in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste,” said the three leaders.

They also stressed the need to protect employees engaged in food production, processing and distribution, both for their own health and that of others, as well as to maintain food supply chains. “It is at times like these that more, not less, international cooperation is essential,” they said. “We must ensure that our response to COVID-19 does not unintentionally create unwarranted shortages of essential items and exacerbate hunger and malnutrition.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/un--wto--world-faces-food-crisis-in-wake-of-coronavirus.html
162,02-4-20,A note to parents,"MHRD prepares for school education amid lockdown due to Coronavirus pandemic and ensures that necessary lessons are able to reach students through online portals

In the wake of the nation-wide lockdown amid the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, children missing out on their education is a huge cause of concern for parents and teachers. However, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) is fully prepared to cope with the situation. The MHRD has been working on various projects through which quality education could be reached through various means of communication to all schools for the last five years.

The three organisations under the MHRD — the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) — are collaborating to pool up all resources at their disposal to make academic content reach school-level learners across India pursuing education through CBSE, NIOS or any other school boards of the country. Amit Khare, secretary of education, Government of India, personally discussed the plan with the organisations and given directions to work on a contingency plan.

The CBSE has developed the ‘DIKSHA’ portal, through which academic lessons in various Indian languages have been placed for different levels. The material has been divided into two major areas — for teachers and students. Students from different school boards of different states would be able to study adopted material for their state in their own language.

Similarly, the NIOS has made the content available for secondary and senior secondary classes on the ‘SWAYAM’ portal of the MHRD (www.swayam.gov.in/nios). Through the portal, learners can log in and study courses of their choice and also watch related videos and audio lessons. Later, they can also take online tests. The course-coordinating teacher will also be available to answer queries, if students have any. Another major initiative of NIOS is the running of four DTH TV channels on the SwayamPrabha bouquet of channels. While Channel 27 Panini is dedicated to secondary classes, Channel 28 Sharda is dedicated to senior secondary and Channel 30 Gyanamrit to sign language. There is also Channel 32 Vagda which will be dedicated to live, interactive classes.

The NIOS is also starting live sessions for students to ask questions and get answers. It has been conducting live interaction with teachers in the last two years but now this facility will be expanded to students. Santosh Mall, commissioner, Kendriya Vidyalaya, has assured to provide experts and teachers, who would be available to take questions through calls on Vagda channel. Anita Karwal, chairperson, CBSE, is coordinating with all the three organisations to make available online classes to all school children across the nation.

Parents, whose children sat for 12th board examinations in 2020, would be anxious to know about the results so that they don’t miss out on college admissions in India and abroad. However, there shouldn’t be any concern or anxiety as all the boards have deferred the examinations and as soon as the condition is normalised, all boards, including NIOS will conduct examinations after giving sufficient time to prepare. The evaluation will be done at war footing and results would be declared at the minimum possible time. Hence, students would have sufficient time to apply for admissions. Higher education institutions will also extend their admission deadlines.

Chandra Bhushan Sharma, chairman, NIOS, said, “We don’t want teachers to start preparing lessons to teach over the internet as this is a technical job for which they do not have prior training. They should concentrate on providing counselling and remedial lessons online in small groups. They should prod their students to log in to the online material, which has been prepared by expert teachers and media professionals.”

He added, “It has also been made compulsory for all cable operators to carry DD channels. We have also requested to the I&B Ministry to instruct cable operators to carry the SwayamPrabha channels. This will be a great service to the approximately 25 crore school-level learners in the country.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-note-to-parents-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-note-to-parents.html

“This includes the play-off matches for UEFA Euro 2020 and qualifying matches for UEFA Women’s Euro 2021,” said European football's governing body in a statement.

“All other UEFA competition matches, including the centralised international friendly matches, remain postponed until further notice.”

The decision followed a video conference with Europe’s 55 member federations as part of discussions on how to adapt the fixture calendar in the face of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The play-off semi-finals and finals that are supposed to decide the last four qualifying berths for the next European Championship were initially postponed at the end of March and pencilled in provisionally for June.

That was “subject to a review of the situation” amid uncertainty over how the pandemic will develop and whether many European countries currently in lockdown will be able to return to some kind of normality.

Friendlies that will not now go ahead include England’s matches in Austria and at home to Romania in early June.

However, UEFA have also stated a determination to finish all domestic and club competitions by June 30.

While that currently looks ambitious, clearing the international fixtures from the same month does buy some more time as they aim to complete the Champions League and Europa League competitions as well as domestic leagues.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/uefa-postpone-all-int---l-matches-scheduled-for-june.html

The Premier League is postponed until at least April 30 because of the pandemic and is likely to be delayed even longer when the English game’s stakeholders meet on Friday.

De Bruyne has not played since March 1 because of the health crisis and the miserable experience has underlined to the Belgian star just how much he loves the game.

The 28-year-old’s desire to prolong his career comes after he enjoyed a superb personal season with City after missing most of their treble-winning campaign last term due to injury.

“I told my wife I’m going to play a little longer,” De Bruyne said in an Instagram Live video Q&A with Belgium team-mates Romelu Lukaku and Axel Witsel.

“After this lockdown, I cannot stay at home. I told her I’m going to take two years more.

“It’s time to play football again. I miss it and it’s difficult. But we are not important, football is not important. People love football, but you need to stay safe.”

De Bruyne revealed his family, including his two children, had been ill during the virus lockdown, but he said they are better now.

“I’ve been at home now for two weeks,” he said.

“At the beginning, my family and my kids were a little bit sick so that was a little bit worrying but they are alright now.

“People ask why I’m not in Belgium. It's because I’m self-isolating in England. I live here so I’m here with my kids and wife.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kdb-vows-to-play-two-extra-years.html

Talking on Instagram Live with Rohit Sharma, Bumrah said: “I love Ibra. I can relate to his story that people did not take him seriously and then he became a star. I can relate as I think people took me lightly initially and then I proved them wrong, I am still trying.”

Bumrah is the No 1 ODI bowler at present. He rose through the ranks playing for Mumbai Indians in IPL and had a forgettable first outing .

On debut against RCB, Bumrah was smashed to three boundaries by Virat Kohli in his first-ever IPL over. However, what followed that was a ribbon-cutting to his glorious cricketing career.

Rohit and Bumrah, both teammates at Mumbai Indians, also spoke on Sri Lanka T20 captain Lasith Malinga who also plays for Mumbai Indians. Rohit asked Bumrah on his relation with Malinga.

“The communication was difficult initially. He taught me the mindset when he gets hit, he smiles. I used to get annoyed at the beginning but he explained there is no point getting angry,” Bumrah said.

Rohit said Mumbai had a balance team this term and would have done well.

169,02-4-20,RR open to shortened IPL among Indian players only,"Even a shortened IPL with just Indian players would be good enough in these “extraordinary times”, Rajasthan Royals Executive Chairman Ranjit Barthakur said on Wednesday, revealing that a final call on the glitzy event’s fate is unlikely before April 15.

The top executive spelt out his franchise’s wish even as the number of positive cases and death toll due to the pandemic continued to rise across the world.

“We are open to a shortened tournament with only Indian players, at the end of the day it is the Indian Premier League,” Barthakur said.

With a nationwide lockdown in place to combat the spread of the disease, the event seems unlikely to go ahead unless the BCCI figures an alternate window later in the year.

The RR executive though said they are confident that the Board will take a decision keeping in mind the best interests of the franchises.

“These are extraordinary times and the BCCI will do the best it can when things improve,” he said.

“Earlier we could not think of an Indians-only IPL but now there is enough quality to choose from. It is better to have an Indians-only IPL than not at all.

“When can we have it? That BCCI decides. And I think that call be taken only post 15th April,” Barthakur added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rr-open-to-shortened-ipl-among-indian-players-only.html

Warne said he ignored former skipper MS Dhoni and current captain Virat Kohli because he picked only those Indian players against whom he had played.

“I am only picking players that I played against and that’s why M S Dhoni and Virat Kohli are not going to be a part of the side. While Dhoni is probably the greatest wicketkeeper-batsman to have played the game, Kohli is one of the greatest batsmen across formats,” Warne said in Instagram Live post.

Warne also ignored VVS Laxman, who was once considered his nemesis. He justified his decision, stating that the stylish Hyderabadi batsman faced the axe to accommodate Ganguly.

“I went for Ganguly because I wanted him to be the captain of my side, that is why Laxman missed out,” he said.

Nayan Mongia was his pick as the wicket-keeper of the team, which also includes the likes of 1983 World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, spin duo of Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath among others.

The 50-year-old spin wizard named Virender Sehwag and Sidhu as openers in the strong batting line-up which also includes the likes of Rahul Dravid, Tendulkar and Mohammad Azharuddin.

On picking Sidhu ahead of other openers, Warne said the right-hander from Punjab was the best player of spin during his playing days.

“I had to pick Navjot Singh Sidhu because he was the best player against spin I have ever played against. All the other spinners I have played with, they have also told me that Sidhu was brilliant against them,” Warne said.

185,02-4-20,Bajrang No 2 in latest world rankings,"Star Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia is assured of a top-four seeding in the 65kg category at next year’s Tokyo Olympics even if he skips the last ranking series tournament, going by the latest world standings.

The fast-rising Ravi Dahiya also seems set for a top-four billing at the mega-event, which will be held from July 23 to August 8 next year.

Wrestling’s world governing body UWW announced the fresh rankings which placed Bajrang at number two in the 65kg category. Dahiya is fourth in the very competitive 57kg category.

Russian Olympic champion Gadhzimurad Rashidov leads the 65kg rankings. Four Points separate Rashidov (60), Punia (59) and Kazakshtan’s Daulet Niyazbekov (56) for the top seeding.

But the Russian and Indian wrestlers have such commanding leads over the field that they can sit out of the final ranking series event and still earn a top-four seeding at the Olympic Games.

Rashidov owns the top spot in 65kg after finally claiming his long-awaited world Gold in Nur-Sultan last season.

Punia began the year ranked number three with 25 points after his world Bronze medal. He has overthrown world finalist Niyazbekov for the number two ranking.

Punia added 16 points to his world championship total after he erased a three-point deficit against Jordan Oliver (USA) to win the 16-point Matteo Pellicone Ranking Series Gold medal.

Although he stumbled in the Asian finals against 2018 world champion Takuto Otoguro(JPN), Punia collected 18 points and pushed himself to within one point of the Russian defending world champion.

The 57kg is led by reigning world champion and number one from Russia Zaur Uguev (60 points).

World runner-up Suleyman Atli is firmly in the number two position after runner-up finishes at the World and European Championships. He has 58 points and is followed by Stevan Micic (48) and Dahiya (45).

Dahiya needs a 12-point finish at the final Ranking Series event to secure one of the top-four seeds. There is slim chance that the Indian wrestler can grab the number one seeding.

For that to happen, Dahiya would need Uguev, Atli and Micic to sit out of the final Ranking Series event and win Gold in a bracket with more than 11 wrestlers to earn the 16 points he needs to clear his top-three rivals.

Nurislam Sanayev is ranked fifth in this weight and trails Dahiya by six points.

World Championship Silver-medallist Deepak Punia is ranked second in 65kg behind Iranian great Hassan Yazdani, who underwent knee surgery earlier this year and had no choice but to skip the Matteo Pellicone and Asian Championships.

He commanded a 20-point lead over Deepak but the Indian wrestler closed that gap on Yazdani with a 14-point Asian championship Bronze-medal finish. Deepak leads Russian Artur Naifonov by seven points after the conclusion of the continental championship season.

No Indian figures in top-10 of the 74kg, 97kg and 125kg categories, the three other olympic weight categories.

The top four in each category will be seeded at the Tokyo Games.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bajrang-no-2-in-latest-world-rankings.html
186,02-4-20,"We are behind Aus & Eng in fitness, but not skill: Harman","India’s T20I captain Harmanpreet Kaur has said India’s domestic scructure is “five-six years behind” Australia and England, adding that skill wise they are at par with them.

India lost to Australia in the T20 World Cup final by 85 runs last month.

“Definitely we are five-six years behind them in these aspects,” Kaur told Mumbai Mirror.

“But now girls have understood their responsibility towards being fit. Earlier there used to be a huge difference between a domestic player and what is expected at the international level. But now some 30 girls are given individual programme by the BCCI.

“So when one of them is picked for India, she is not clueless about what is expected of her. As we keep improving our domestic level, the performances at the international level will improve. That is why I said we are five-six years behind these teams because our domestic set-up is not as good as it should be.”

“Now the players are getting more aware about being fit and following the right daily routines,” Kaur said.

“The things we have grasped in the last two-three years, England and Australia have been doing from long before.”

Kaur said it is more about fitness and not skills that separate them from Australia or England.

“Just the fitness. In these two countries fitness is part of their culture. Unfortunately, in India we start these things late,” Kaur told The Week.

“For the last three years the girls have been working hard on fitness. It does not improve overnight, we need to work on it for longer durations. Earlier, we would come close to these teams and lose, but now we are winning matches against them. Skill-wise we are better batters and bowlers than these two countries.”

Kaur’s form was poor throughout the World Cup campaign in Australia. But the 31-year old dashing batter said she is not thinking too much about pressure and also captaincy.

“From the outside it may look like that, but personally I have never felt so,” she said when questioned on the captaincy.

“I really enjoy this part. I feel more involved. The captaincy keeps me alert all the time. Earlier, I used to think about my performance alone. Captaincy has made me a better person. [ Now,] I cannot think only about myself, but [have to think] of other things, too.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-are-behind-aus---eng-in-fitness--but-not-skill--harman.html
187,02-4-20,No Wimbledon in 2020,"Wimbledon organisers on Wednesday scrapped the oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament for the first time since World War II as the coronavirus wreaks further havoc on the global sporting calendar.

The cancellation of the only grasscourt major at London’s All England Club leaves the season in disarray, with no tennis set to be played until mid-July.

“Devastated,” tweeted eight-time champion Roger Federer, while Serena Williams, who has won the tournament seven times, said she was shocked by the momentous decision.

Wimbledon was due to run for two weeks from June 29, with Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep set to defend their singles titles.

But tournament chiefs bowed to the inevitable on Wednesday, saying in a statement that they had made the decision with “great regret”.

US tennis chiefs responded by saying the US Open, due to finish a week before the rearranged French Open, was still due to take place as planned.

All England Club chairman Ian Hewitt said the decision to cancel Wimbledon had not been taken lightly.

“It has weighed heavily on our minds that the staging of The Championships has only been interrupted previously by world wars,” he said.

“But, following thorough and extensive consideration of all scenarios, we believe that it is a measure of this global crisis that it is ultimately the right decision to cancel this year’s Championships.”

Halep tweeted her disappointment.

“So sad to hear @Wimbledon won’t take place this year,” she said. “Last year’s final will forever be one of the happiest days of my life! But we are going through something bigger than tennis and Wimbledon will be back! And it means I have even longer to look forward to defending my title.”

Two-time champion Petra Kvitova said the cancellation was tough to take.

“I will miss playing on the beautiful grass and wearing my whites, BUT of course we know it will be back better than ever next year. And maybe we will all appreciate it even more!” she tweeted.

The decision to cancel Wimbledon was widely expected, with the world struggling to contain spread of COVID-19.

Organisers had earlier ruled out playing the event behind closed doors while postponing it would also have created its own problems, with shorter days later in the English summer.

The ATP and WTA have also cancelled the grasscourt swing in the build-up to the tournament, meaning the tennis season will not now restart until July 13 at the earliest.

The US Tennis Association said it was sticking to its August 31 to September 13 dates for the US Open in New York.

“At this time the USTA still plans to host the US Open as scheduled, and we continue to hone plans to stage the tournament,” it said in a statement.

“The USTA is carefully monitoring the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and is preparing for all contingencies.”

The cancellation of Wimbledon could mean multiple champions Federer, Serena Williams and Venus Williams have played at the All England Club for the final time.

Federer and Serena will be nearly 40 by the time of the 2021 championships and Venus will be 41.

Serena, beaten in last year's final by Halep, is stuck on 23 Grand Slam singles titles — agonisingly one away from equalling Margaret Court’s record.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-wimbledon-in-2020-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-wimbledon-in-2020.html

Expressions of interest will now be accepted until June 30, three months after the original deadline of March 31, the AFC said in a statement.

""The decision was taken in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic to allow member associations, many of whom have been affected by the global outbreak, sufficient time to meet their internal processes and timelines,"" it said.

China will host the next Asian Cup in 2023 but Saudi Arabia, which has a growing portfolio of large-scale sports events, is the only country so far to throw its hat in the ring for 2027.

Qualifying for the 2023 Asian Cup, like most other football worldwide, has been put on hold as countries batten down to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

189,02-4-20,Sport can play huge role in uplifting world from effects of pandemic: Morgan,"Sport can wait for now but on resumption, it could play a massive role in ""uplifting the world"" from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, feels England's limited overs captain Eoin Morgan.

Sporting activities the world over came to a grinding halt in the wake of the pandemic that has claimed more than 47,000 lives.

""Sport could play a huge role in uplifting the world and people's perspective on things,"" Morgan was quoted as saying by the ICC.

""Isolation encourages idle minds. Sport can create that theatre and that level of expectation around what it's like to be outside again and be active. If it came to it, I think it would be a huge step forward.""

Till the time the situation becomes manageable, the top English cricketer is ready to wait and do everything that is required to deal with the crisis.

""Obviously times are still uncertain at the moment. Realistically we can't think about playing until the situation is downgraded from a pandemic,"" said the 2019 World Cup-winning skipper.

Sportspersons, including cricketers, are doing their bit in the fight against the deadly virus. Morgan's teammate Jos Buttler has auctioned his World Cup-winning jersey to raise money, leaving the captain mightily impressed.

""It's an incredibly kind gesture. I'm not one for holding on to memorabilia. Other people are different. The shirt will go for a lot of money and it should do.

""But the gesture within itself to aid new equipment to be bought is absolutely outstanding,"" added Morgan.

Buttler's offer to auction the shirt he wore in the World Cup final has so far attracted bids in excess of 65,000 pound.

The money will be donated to the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals charity, Buttler had said.

The ministry said this in an advisory on human resource management of COVID-19 to provide guidance to the states on manpower that can be mobilized for the management of the disease along with possible role assignments and their training requirements.

""Although there is no evidence to widespread community transmission, 20 existing and 22 potential hotspots have been identified. The containment measures to break the cycle of transmission and clinical management of those affected would require large human resource,"" it said in the document.

The advisory stressed on capacity building, saying identified human resource needs to be trained online using online training programs developed by the ministry.

The training for different target groups shall cover areas like field surveillance, contact tracing, sampling, packaging and shipment of specimen, hospital infection prevention and control, including use of appropriate PPEs and biomedical waste management, clinical case management including ventilator management, training on managing quarantine and isolation facilities and community based training in pyscho social care, the document said.

The ministry advised states to identify and designate a nodal officer for training who will coordinate all these activities.

For COVID-19 management, it advised the district administration to pool-in the requisite human resources who would stay in the containment zone till such operations are over.

""For isolation areas, in addition to training, all hospital staff, dentists and AYUSH practitioners available should also be trained. Retired doctors and other healthcare professionals should be identified to work in non-COVID areas in hospitals in case of emergencies,"" the advisory stated.

For surveillance activities, the ministry said COVID Warriors @ 1 per 250 population may be identified and trained.

It stated quarantine facilities are meant to house asymptomatic cases and the number identified and trained manpower should be equal to the number of COVID Warriors.

The advisory highlights major areas where enhanced deployment of human resource is required such as surveillance activities at grass root level, supervisory management of containment operations, laboratory testing and clinical management of suspect/confirmed cases in isolation wards.

It also listed out critical care management of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases in ICUs, patient transportation and referral, cleaning, disinfection and waste management, management of quarantine, isolation facilities and pyscho-social care as some of the important areas.

192,02-4-20,Putin extends non-working period to end of April to curb coronavirus,"President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Russians will continue not going to work while receiving pay until the end of the month to combat the coronavirus.

""I've taken a decision to extend the period of non-working days until April 30,"" Putin said in an address, adding that each region can decide what lockdown measures are needed.

Since Monday Russians have had a period of national non-working days when they are still entitled to full pay in a bid to reduce transmission of the virus.

In his second televised address on Russia's response to the virus, Putin said that in Moscow ""so far it has not been possible to turn around the situation despite the measures taken by federal and city authorities."" The capital city with more than 12 million inhabitants has seen the most cases so far.

Moscow has been under lockdown since Monday with all but essential shops closed and residents told to stay at home.

""The threat remains"" Putin said, with the peak of the pandemic still to come both globally and in Russia.

Regional authorities should take decisions on what needs to be shut down based on the ""objective situation"" while ensuring people's safety, Putin said.

He said Russia will take further measures and it was possible the period of non-working days could be reduced if the situation improves.

193,02-4-20,"US begins repatriation of its nationals from India, receives help from govt: official","The US has begun repatriation of its stranded nationals, who want to return home, from India which is undergoing a 21-day lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus pandemic, a senior American diplomat has said, praising the Indian government for extending full support to undertake this ""important mission"".

The repatriation from India is part of the massive effort being undertaken by the US for its citizens from across the world. So far, the US has repatriated over 30,000 citizens from over 60 countries on more than 350 flights.

""We began our repatriation efforts from India yesterday with a flight that brought in some 170 US citizens,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.

""We will begin a steadier flow of flights out of New Delhi and Mumbai in the coming days, really beginning toward the end of this week and into the weekend,"" he said in response to a question.

There are more than 80 flights scheduled or in the planning stages from various locations, he added.

Reluctant to share the specific numbers which remain highly dynamic, Brownlee said the number from India is in the multiple thousands, who have indicated a possible interest in being repatriated to the US.

""We have found the Government of India has been very cooperative and very helpful with us in arranging these repatriation flights. We are thankful to them for their assistance and their support as we undertake this important mission,"" Brownlee said.

The US has run into some complications with regard to its efforts in Africa because of the closures in airspaces there, he added.

In Africa, out of the 57 international airports on the continent, over 30 of them are either at restricted or no operations, and every repatriation flight is being negotiated by the country team on the ground on a case-by-case, flight-by-flight basis in a great number of the countries involved, said William Walters, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Operations, Bureau of Medical Services in the State Department.

The United States has some 20 million people living overseas.

Walters said the Department of State was making every effort to assist US citizens overseas who wish to return to the country.

""But as the COVID-19 situation develops, our ability to provide such assistance, whether working with commercial airlines or arranging for evacuation flights, may become more limited or even unavailable,"" he said.

Brownlee said that if US citizens wished to return to America, they should make arrangements to do so now, and contact the nearest embassy or consulate for assistance.

""There's no guarantee the Department of State will be able to continue to provide repatriation assistance, and transportation options from many countries to the United States may become unavailable in the future, even in a few weeks' time,"" he warned.

Those who choose to remain overseas should be prepared to remain there for the foreseeable future, he asserted, in an indication of the gravity of the situation.

""If you were on the beach when an earthquake struck, you wouldn't just stand there waiting for the coming tsunami. You would head for higher ground immediately. Well, in this case, the earthquake has happened. It's time to seek higher ground now, and not hope for rescue later,"" Brownlee said.

A nationwide 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 24 in India to check the spread of coronavirus as social distancing is possibly the only way to prevent people from infecting the deadly virus.

A total of 932,605 COVID-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 16,809 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The US has reported 213,372 COVID-19 cases, the highest in the world, and over 5,000 people have died due to the disease.

""Apart from cleaning the surfaces, other objects like light switches, desk, keyboards, doorknobs, toilet, closets should also be cleaned. Please make sure that you do not touch any object while cleaning with bare hands; gloves are necessary and make sure to dispose of these gloves after the cleaning is done,"" Gupta told IANS.

In case when you are buying vegetables and fruits from outside, please make sure that you clean the bag very carefully before entering the house.

If possible, it is advisable to keep the bags outside your home or in a corner for at least 24-48 hours.

""Considering coronavirus spreads through droplets, please make sure to wash your vegetables and fruits in potassium permanganate solution or you can also wash it with hot water as well for at least 5-10 minutes,"" the doctor emphasised.

195,02-4-20,Trump proposes USD 2 trillion infrastructure fund,"US President Donald Trump has proposed a massive USD 2 trillion infrastructure plan, along with several other measures like corporate deductibility for restaurants and entertainment facilities to stimulate the American economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump's proposal comes days after he passed a USD 2.2 trillion stimulus package that gives USD 3,200 on an average to an American family of four and massive financial assistance to small and medium enterprises, big corporations and the country's travel and tourism industry.

I already proposed almost 0 interest on bonds and I proposed a USD 2 trillion infrastructure plan which would not only fix our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and other things but will also do something very good, it is called jobs, Trump told reporters at his daily televised news briefing on Wednesday.

I am also asking that restaurants and entertainment facilities go back to the old deductibility from corporations where corporations can buy because otherwise a lot of these restaurants are going to have a hard time reopening, he said.

According to an official report, a record 3.3 million workers filed for jobless benefits in the week ended March 21, the most ever recorded.

According to an estimate, some 47 million people could be rendered unemployed by the crisis.

If US can spend USD 8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, Trump argued that USD 2 trillion is needed to be spent on roads, bridges and tunnels, which are in bad shape.

What we want to do in our country you know it's time that we spend money on our country, he said.

That is what we are going to do. It's time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools and all of the things that we are supposed to be spending on and people are finally getting used to it and you could look at all of what we have done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places, way back in other countries to by the way and I have gone to other countries that are very rich I said I am sorry you are going to have to reimburse us for our cost, he added.

Trump assured the people of a booming economy once the virus is defeated.

I do think once we get rid of the virus, I think we're going to have a boom in economy. I think it's going to go up rather quickly, maybe very quickly, and maybe slowly. But it's going to go up, and it'll all come back. And I think it's actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus, he said.

196,02-4-20,"France reports record 509 more coronavirus deaths, toll tops 4,000","France on Wednesday reported its highest daily number of deaths from COVID-19 since the coronavirus epidemic began, saying 509 more people had died in hospital to bring the toll to 4,032.

There are now 24,639 people hospitalised in France with COVID-19, with 6,017 of them in intensive care, health official Jerome Salomon told reporters in his daily update. The death toll on Tuesday had risen by 499.

The French figures include only those who died in hospital and not those who died at home or in old people's homes.

The number of confirmed cases also rose by 4,861 to 56,989. Many cases however go unregistered because of a lack of testing equipment.

Salomon noted that the number of people in intensive care was already above France's pre-crisis intensive care capacity of around 5,000.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic and officials have repeatedly warned it will take time for the measures to bear fruit.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told a parliamentary committee Wednesday that when the confinement finally came to an end, it would likely be a step-by-step process.

He said it would probably not be ""all at once, everywhere and for everyone"" indicating it could to subject to where people live, testing and their age.

The possibility in the coming weeks and months of stepped-up testing would allow the government to ascertain ""the proportion of our fellow citizens who have been contaminated"" and thus the degree to which the French population has immunity, he said.

France is currently carrying out 30,000 tests a day, far fewer than in neighbouring Germany, a weakness that has been repeatedly noted by the right-wing opposition.

But France is hoping to greatly ramp up testing in the coming days and weeks with the arrival of serology blood tests and then rapid tests that can provide results in minutes.

The government's strategy is aimed at limiting the peak of the epidemic so that the health system is not overwhelmed.

Hospitals have been under immense stress in the east of the country -- one of the worst hit areas -- but also in the region around Paris. One hundred more patients will be transferred from Paris to elsewhere in France on Thursday.

US-Iran tensions soared following the January 3 Washington-directed strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani outside Baghdad airport.

Trump said at an evening White House briefing that his administration has received intelligence that Iran is planning a strike, but did not provide additional details.

Iran has been blamed for an uptick in rocket attacks targeting Iraqi military bases hosting US troops. Three separate attacks in the span of a week struck Camp Taji and Basmaya bases, killed three coalition servicemen, including two Americans, and injured scores of others.

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted: ""Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on US troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!""

Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and has steadily reimposed US sanctions on Iran that had been eased or lifted under the terms of the deal.

Last week, the administration slapped new sanctions on 20 Iranian people and companies for supporting Shia militia in Iraq held responsible for attacks on bases where US forces are located.

200,02-4-20,Have quarantined myself on doctors' advice: Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi,"Amid a country-wide manhunt by police for participants of last month's Tablighi Jamaat meet at Nizamuddin here, jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi on Thursday said he has quarantined himself on doctors' advice.

""We should help and support our government in dealing with this crisis. I have also quarantined myself in Delhi under instructions from doctors. This precautionary measure is not against the principle of faith so it's important to adopt such steps,"" he said in an audio clip.

""I appeal to all my jamaat to follow the instruction of our government,"" Saad said in the clip.

The authorities across states have identified more than 6,000 people who attended the Nizamuddin Tablighi Jamaat congregation.

The mid-March Islamic religious discourse was attended by thousands of Jamaat members, along with hundreds of foreigners -- many of them suspected to be coronavirus positive -- and has triggered a nationwide scare of community spread of the virus.

""There's no doubt that this pandemic is the result of sins we humans have been committing. We should pray to Allah for forgiveness while staying at home. This way, we will be able to please our lord to show mercy on humankind and save them from this pandemic,"" Saad said.

Instructions of ulemas, government, and doctors need to be followed and no one should stray out of home and organise gatherings, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/have-quarantined-myself-on-doctors--advice--tablighi-jamaat-leader-maulana-saad-kandhalvi-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/have-quarantined-myself-on-doctors--advice--tablighi-jamaat-leader-maulana-saad-kandhalvi.html
201,02-4-20,"2,012 cases; Tablighis under lens","Govt says spurt not a national trend, 386 new cases in 24 hours till last night

In its biggest spike till date, India over the past 24 hours till Wednesday night recorded 386 new cases of coronavirus taking the tally to 2,012 with the Government blaming the spurt in cases on the travel by members of Tablighi Jamaat and asserted that it was not a national trend.

“The number of positive cases has gone up since Tuesday. One of main reasons for it is travel by members of Tablighi. This is not a national trend,” said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Union Ministry of Health.

According to Ministry’s website, the total number of active COVID-19 cases reached 1,637 in India by Wednesday noon, whereas the death toll has risen to 42 from 32 recorded on Tuesday.

Globally, the death toll due to novel coronavirus in the US has reached 3,400, surpassing China. The global death rate has reached past the 44,000-mark while around 9 lakh are infected by COVID-19 across nearly 170 countries.

Dr R Gangakhedkar, scientist from ICMR, said so far, 47,951 tests for COVID-19 conducted in country out of which 4,562 tests done at ICMR network labs on Tuesday. On a query, he said Hydroxychloroquine is not to be used on every person.

“This is not for everybody. It is just a demonstration study for doctors and their contacts of lab confirmed cases caregivers and data will be analysed which will tell if we can recommend or not the drug to the people who come in their contacts,” he said.

Agarwal said 74 flights operated till date under Lifeline Udan for transporting medical cargo across the country. So far over 22 tonnes cargo was transported on March 31, he said.

Following the Supreme Court directives, the Health Ministry on Wednesday called for providing a social protection to migrant workers, saying they are prone to social, psychological and emotional trauma in lockdown situations.

Immediate concerns faced by such migrant workers relate to food, shelter, healthcare, fear of getting infected or spreading the infection, loss of wages, concerns about the family, anxiety and fear.

“Sometimes, they also face harassment and negative reactions of the local community. All this calls for strong social protection,” the Ministry said in a document.

It further said migrant workers faced the situation of spending a few days in temporary shelters, which may be quarantine centres, while trying to reach to their native places, are filled with anxieties and fears stemming from various concerns, and are in need of psycho-social support.

Meanwhile, several State Governments have continued the difficult task of tracking the movements of Tablighi attendees in the Delhi conference, including foreigners and their “human contacts” as more Jamaat delegates who transited through Jamaat Markaz (centre) in Nizamuddin East were quarantined in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra while 140 of delegates were reported untraceable in Hyderabad.

Over 250 foreign nationals have been quarantined or admitted to isolation wards in various States in the country following the disclosure that they had attended the Tablighi conference. A total of 16 States have been searching for Tablighi members.

According reports, at least 200 from Karnataka, 140 from Andhra Pradesh and 45 from Telangana have been identified. The total number of those who attended the conference varies from State to State with Maharashtra listing 185 and Karnataka estimating 342 to have participated in the meeting.

With the Tabligh incident spiking the coronavirus numbers in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Maharashtra Chief Minister and asked the State to trace out the missing Jamaat members who attended the Delhi conference. The State DGP held a Press conference to give his account on the issue.

The aim of the search for Tabligh attendees is to prevent them from inadvertently creating new clusters of infection across the country. The magnitude of the task is immense: Three southern states — Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka — were trying to track at least 2,500 people, many of who had tested positive for coronavirus.

In Kashmir 855 people (at least 167 attendees and people in contact with them) were being traced, only nine had been found.

In Tamil Nadu, the State was tracking at least 1,500 people, 300 of whom were still untraceable as of Tuesday night.

Nearly 300 people from across Karnataka attended the congregation, State Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Tuesday, creating a “dangerous situation”. Only 26 of the delegates (all from Bidar) have been traced. The Tumakuru preacher who attended the meet is learned to have had direct contact with at least 82 people, including 45 family members. The 26 delegates who were traced all tested negative, State Health Minister B Sreeramulu tweeted.

In UP, police in 18 districts had tracked down 128 of the 157 people from the State who had attended the congregation. While 120 were found quarantined in Delhi, eight were traced to their native villages and cities and have been quarantined at home. A search is on for the remaining 29. The police also traced 95 others who had attended Jamaat event and were not on the list of 157 from UP shared by the Delhi Police.

A total of 185 people from Maharashtra had attended the congregation, officials said. Maharashtra Minority Development Minister Nawab Malik, however, said he had learned “from the media” that 109 people from his State had attended the meet.

“I have asked officials to find out how many actually attended it. We are also talking to members of the Tablighi Jamaat to find out,” he said. The Ahmednagar district administration later said it had found 35 returnees, mostly foreign nationals.

At least 20 villages across Bandipora, Pulwama, Shopian and Budgam in J&K have been identified as red zones and the administration has prepared a 50-page list of people from the UT who either attended the event at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz or had been on contact with attendees.

A total of 1,548 people have been evacuated from the Nizamudddin Markaz. Of this, 441 have been hospitalised because they exhibited symptoms while the remaining 1,107 people have been quarantined. Of those hospitalised, 24 have already tested positive for Covid-19 and, given the symptoms and history of direct contact with positive cases, doctors said there was a high likelihood of many others testing positive.

Tamil Nadu Health Secretary Beela Rajesh announced that by Tuesday at least 67 of the Tablighi Jamaat cluster had tested positive, taking Tamil Nadu’s positive cases to 124, the third highest after Maharashtra and Kerala; 50 of these infections were recorded on Tuesday.

The TN Government also admitted that at least 300 of the 1,500 delegates from the State were untraceable. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami appealed to people to come forward for screening.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2-012-cases--tablighis-under-lens-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/2-012-cases--tablighis-under-lens.html
202,02-4-20,"Markaz cleared, raids on to arrest fugitive cleric","2,361 evacuated from Delhi Tablighi centre; quarantined people’s movement tracked: Kejriwal

Even as the authorities have cleared Tablighi’s Nizamuddin headquarters and evacuated 2,361 people in 36 hours till Wednesday evening, Nizamuddin Markaz cleric Maulana Saad has been untraceable since March 28 after he was served a notice by the Delhi Police.

“Police teams are raiding several places across the western Uttar Pradesh and Mewat region in Haryana to nab Saad,” said a senior police official.

Police have also recovered an audio clip in which Saad can be heard saying there is no better place to die than in a mosque. The audio clip is believed to be of March 18. “Leaving mosques would bring no good. Do not leave mosques even if trusted doctors ask you to,” said Saad in the audio clip.

On Tuesday, a First Information Report (FIR) was filed against seven people, including Saad, Zeeshan, Mufti Shehzad, M Saifi, Younus, Mohammed Salman and Mohammed Ashraf.

The police have registered the FIR under sections of the Epidemic Disease Act and other sections of the IPC, for not following Government orders on the management of the Markaz in relation to a social, political or religious gathering and thus endangering the lives of the people.

Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said authorities are tracking mobile phones of people under quarantine to check their movement.

Tablighis, including foreigners from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Algeria, Djibouti, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, England, Fiji, France and Kuwait, had assembled at Nizamuddin Markaz, which is among the major COVID-19 hotspots in the country, to participate in religious congregation from March 1 to 18.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the premises have been vacated after a 36-hour effort by the concerned agencies.

“The staff of health, administration, police and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) worked together in this 36-hour operation, putting their lives at risk. Hats off to all of them,” Sisodia said in a tweet. The total number of coronavirus cases in Delhi climbed to 152 on Wednesday.

Sisodia further said a list has been prepared in which the phone number and other details of these people were noted and handed over to the Delhi Police cyber cell for further action.

“The police will trace their movements’ history. With the help of their mobile phones details, police can easily find out that how many people have come to their contact and police can easily find out their whereabouts,” said Sisodia.

He appealed to the people, who came to Nizamuddin West to participate in the Markaz in March to contact administration without any further delay and surrender to the local medical facilities immediately so that they can go through a proper medical checkup.

“I request all people who came here for Markaz to corporate with the police and local administration. If you will create any trouble for local police and administration and not voluntary disclose about you and later if it emerged that you are infected and hiding your diseases, then a strict action will be taken against you,” said Sisodai.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/markaz-cleared--raids-on-to-arrest-fugitive-cleric-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/markaz-cleared--raids-on-to-arrest-fugitive-cleric.html
203,02-4-20,Spurt in patient numbers with alcohol withdrawal symptoms,"Already busy tackling the Covid-19 cases, doctors across the country are finding themselves hard-pressed with spurt in number of patients reporting alcohol withdrawal symptom because of non availability of “booze” due to the ongoing lockdown.

Doctors from country’s premier health institute AIIMS said that people with alcohol withdrawal related problems are coming at their emergency department as OPDs are closed. “When they are deprived of alcohol or substance they are so depended upon they will face varying degree of health related issues. Usually, heavy drinkers need proper counseling and medication,” said Dr Atul Ambekar, Professor of Psychiatric at National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre of AIIMS..

Superintendent Dr Uma Shankar from Mental Health Hospital in Erragadda, Hyderabad, said that a as many as 100 persons with withdrawal symptoms visited the outpatient ward on Monday. She said many of them were treated as outpatients and a few were admitted for constant observation.

According to the doctors, there would be four to five alcoholics among an average 30 outpatients on any normal day. However, the number suddenly increased manifold since Saturday. At least three cases of suicide were reported from the State after the lockdown was announced last week.

Dr Smita Deshpanday, Professor of Psychiatrist from Delhi-based RML Hospital said that such tipplers develop serious problems like alcohol withdrawal fits, hallucinations and depression. However, all patients do not require hospitalisation. They need proper guidance, good food and regular intake of healthy fluids. “In fact this is the golden chance for the Government to treat their heavy dependence on alcohol and tobacco as such products weaken their lung systems,” she added.

Indian medical Association Kerala president Dr Abraham Varghese echoed similar views stating that those showing withdrawal symptoms should be provided scientific treatment, which can be given at homes or in hospitals. “They need treatment. Giving them booze is not a solution,” he said.

Liquor is out of bound across the country except Kerala and Meghalaya, which recently allowed the sale of liquor with a medical testimonial from a qualified doctor due to rising cases of suicide. .

Their decisions have drawn flak from the Indian Medical Association which feels that it would only encourage others to fake their health conditions. Interestingly, there are various global studies that say that alcohol withdrawal never results into a suicide unless the person is suffering from other mental health issues such as depression.

Kerala has seen nine deaths including suicides not due to the infection but because of the non-availability of alcohol. In Karnataka too, reports of addicted people along with alcohol consumption issues were brought to them by their family members were brought to the notice of the Government.

Alcohol is among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide, with 3 million deaths per year attributable to alcohol.

According to a report published in The Lancet last year, Indians are drinking more than ever before, with the annual per capita alcohol consumption going up by 38 per cent in seven years to 5.9 litres (ltr) in 2017, up from 4.3 ltr in 2010. The study on harmful alcohol use in 189 countries said that globally, alcohol intake increased from 5.9 ltr per adult per year in 1990, to 6.5 ltr in 2017, and the total volume of alcohol consumed per year went up by 70 per cent - from 20,999 million ltr in 1990 to 35,676 million ltr in 2017.

If current trends continue, the world will not meet the WHO’s target of reducing harmful use of alcohol by 10 per cent by 2025. “To achieve global targets to reduce harmful alcohol use, the authors call for effective policy measures such as the WHO best-buys, including increasing taxation, restricting availability, and banning alcohol marketing and advertising, to be introduced globally, especially in rapidly developing countries with growing rates of alcohol use,” said the report.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spurt-in-patient-numbers-with-alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/spurt-in-patient-numbers-with-alcohol-withdrawal-symptoms.html

206,02-4-20,Centre tweaks domicile rules for J&K jobs,"The Centre has ordered changes in the domicile status rules for Government jobs in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and also amended 109 erstwhile State Acts and repealed 29 Acts, drawing flak from the political parties of the Union Territory.

According to the notification, anyone who has resided in J&K for 15 years or has studied in the State for seven years, and appeared in either the Class 10/12 examination, will be eligible for domicile certificates. This would allow them to apply for gazetted and non-gazetted Government jobs. The new rules also state that migrants registered by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner need not fulfil the amended requirements.

According to the new rules, children of officials with the Central Government, all India services, public sector undertakings, public sector banks, statutory bodies, Central universities and recognised research institutes of the Central Government who have served in J&K for 10 years will also be eligible to apply for gazetted and non-gazetted Government jobs in the UT. The drastic changes were implemented through the J&K Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020, issued late Tuesday by the Centre.

As per the earlier rules, only J&K residents were eligible to apply for jobs or own immovable property in the erstwhile State. The Union Government’s new decision comes amid apprehension in the UT that there would be a demographic change in J&K following the scrapping of Article 370, which guaranteed State subjects the right to jobs, owning property and legislating laws. It also comes at a time when J&K, along with the rest of the country, continues to be under a lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.

The latest MHA order also defines domicile as an administrative category rather than identity-based residency.

In the gazette notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, classified as extraordinary, the Centre has repealed the J&K Civil Services (special provisions) Act.

It has also introduced changes in Sections 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the J&K Civil Services (decentralisation and recruitment) Act, 2010. The Act is among 109 laws of the erstwhile State that have been amended through Tuesday’s order that also repeals 29 other laws. While Section 5A now states that no person shall be eligible for appointment to a post carrying a pay scale for not more than Level 4 “unless he is a domicile of UT of J&K”, in Sections 6, 7 and 8 the words “permanent resident of the State” have been substituted with “Domicile of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir”. These sections of the J&K Civil Services Act, 2010, dealt with appointments at district, divisional and State levels.

The Section 13 of J&K Civil Services Act, 2010, which has been omitted completely, defined residence in the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir. The new rules have also been extended to children of those who fulfil the above mentioned criteria even if they do not live in J&K.

Political parties in the Valley termed the Centre’s new rule as adding insult to injury of the people as the rule lacked the promised protections. The National Conference termed the new rules as hollow and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said the rules will give rise to massive problems for residents of J&K.

“Talk about suspect timing. At a time when all our efforts & attention should be focused on the #COVID outbreak the Government slips in a new domicile law for J&K. Insult is heaped on injury when we see the law offers none of the protections that had been promised,” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said in a series of tweets. The former Chief Minister who just released from detention said the new law was so hollow that even politicians with “Delhi’s blessings” were forced to criticise it.

“You can imagine how hollow the domicile law is from the fact that even the new party created with Delhi’s blessings, whose leaders were lobbying in Delhi for this law, have been forced to criticise the #JKdomicilelaw,” he added. Omar was apparently referring to the criticism of the domicile law by Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party founder Altaf Bukhari.

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the rules will give rise to massive problems for residents of J&K.

“The domicile law as it appears is not only trying to shake the boundaries of an already existing State, but it is also trying to give rise to massive problems for residents of J&K,” tweeted the PDP.

The party said the Centre’s “manipulation of the law” would only further alienate the people.

“As the GOI (Government of India) tries to manipulate a law that provides guarantees to Kashmiris, it is only further alienating people, by depriving them of their constitutional rights. When GOI imposes orders that relegate elected Kashmiri leaders to nothingness, GOI shows how it doesn’t want local Kashmiris to govern the land they fought for,” the PDP said.

Jammu & Kashmir People’s Conference (JKPC) led by Sajad Gani Lone said the Presidential order defining the domicile law issued at the depth of night while the world is under the grip of a deadly pandemic, falls way short of expectations even for those who expected some relief and some reconciliation process.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-tweaks-domicile-rules-for-j-k-jobs-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/centre-tweaks-domicile-rules-for-j-k-jobs.html
207,02-4-20,"Daniel Pearl murder: Pak court commutes death sentence of top al-Qaeda leader, sets 3 others free","A Pakistani court on Thursday overturned the death sentence of British-born top al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was convicted in the abduction and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl here in 2002.

Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story on the alleged links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.

Sheikh was arrested from Lahore in February 2002 and sentenced to death five months later by an anti-terrorism court.

The incident came three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.

On Thursday, the Sindh High Court commuted the death sentence of Sheikh, 46, to seven years in prison. Sheikh has been in jail for the past 18 years.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha also acquitted the three others - Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil- serving life sentences in the case, the Dawn newspaper reported.

The bench announced the verdict on the appeals filed by the four convicts 18 years ago.

It also dismissed an appeal of the state seeking enhancement of life term of the three co-accused, the paper said.

According to the report, Sheikh's seven-year prison will be counted from the time served in jail.

While arguing the case, the lawyers for the appellants submitted that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove its case against their clients beyond any reasonable doubt and prosecution witnesses were mostly policemen, whose testimonies could not be relied upon.

They had further contended that Naseem and Adil's confessions before a judicial magistrate were defective and not voluntary.

They also argued that the recovery of the laptop from Naseem was shown to have been made on February 11, 2002, while computer expert Ronald Joseph had deposed that he was given the computer for verification on February 4 and he examined the laptop for six days.

Deputy Prosecutor General Saleem Akhtar had supported the trial court's verdict and submitted that the prosecution had proved its case aga inst the appellants bey ond a shadow of doubt and had requested the court to dismiss the appeals, the report said.

According to a report in The Express Tribune, in 2014, an anti-terrorism court had acquitted Qari Hashim, a co-accused in the case due to a lack of evidence. The same year, Sheikh allegedly attempted suicide in his prison cell by hanging himself with a cloth from the ventilator.

In January 2011, a report released by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University following an investigation into his death revealed that the wrong men were convicted for Pearl's murder.

In February 2016, the Pakistan Army arrested more than 100 militants and foiled a jailbreak attempt by al-Qaeda terrorists to free Sheikh and other leaders of the terror group.

Thursday's verdict came more than a month after Paris-based Financial Action Task Force warned Pakistan that stern action will be taken against it if the country fails to check the flow of money to terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others.

The FATF, which supervises effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing, last year placed Pakistan on its 'Grey List' of countries for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups like LeT and JeM.

If not removed off the list by April end, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

209,02-4-20,North Korea insists it is free of coronavirus,"North Korea remains totally free of the coronavirus, a senior health official in Pyongyang has insisted, despite mounting scepticism overseas as confirmed global infections near one million.

The already isolated, nuclear-armed North quickly shut down its borders after the virus was first detected in neighbouring China in January, and imposed strict containment measures.

Pak Myong Su, director of the anti-epidemic department of the North's Central Emergency Anti-epidemic Headquarters, insisted that the efforts had been completely successful.

""Not one single person has been infected with the novel coronavirus in our country so far,"" Pak told AFP.

""We have carried out preemptive and scientific measures such as inspections and quarantine for all personnel entering our country and thoroughly disinfecting all goods, as well as closing borders and blocking sea and air lanes.""

Nearly every other country has reported coronavirus cases, with the World Health Organization saying on Wednesday that there were nearly one million confirmed infections globally.

Aside from China, South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus, which has claimed more than 45,000 lives around the world.

Experts have said the North is particularly vulnerable to the virus because of its weak medical system, and defectors have accused Pyongyang of covering up an outbreak.

The top US military commander in South Korea, General Robert Abrams, said last month he was ""fairly certain"" the North had confirmed cases of the virus.

US President Donald Trump also said North Korea ""is going through something"" and offered ""cooperation in the anti-epidemic work"", in a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

And Choi Jung-hun, a former North Korean doctor who fled to the South in 2012, told AFP: ""I heard there are many deaths in North Korea but the authorities are not saying that it's caused by the coronavirus.""

As part of its anti-virus efforts Pyongyang put thousands of its own people and hundreds of foreigners -- including diplomats -- into isolation and mounted disinfection drives, with state media constantly exhorting citizens to obey health directives.

Published images have shown universal face mask use, with the exception of leader Kim Jong Un, who has never been seen wearing one, even though for several weeks the officers alongside him when he supervised firing exercises donned black coverings.

More recently his aides have also been seen without face masks, although defector Choi said that did not signal the North's containment efforts had been widely successful.

""Everyone accompanying Kim Jong Un is under strict control and safe from any virus threats,"" said Choi.

Pyongyang -- which is subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes -- has sought virus-related aid.

In February, Russia's foreign ministry said it provided Pyongyang with 1,500 coronavirus diagnostic test kits at its request ""due to the persisting risk of the new COVID-19"".

The United Nations has granted sanctions exemptions to relief groups including Doctors without Borders and UNICEF on items such as diagnostic kits, face masks, protective equipment and disinfectants.

UNICEF confirmed its shipment of supplies -- requested by the North's health ministry -- arrived in Pyongyang overland from China last week.

The World Health Organisation plans to spend 900,000 to support Pyongyang's coronavirus response activities, according to data posted on the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs website. (AFP)

In a video message, posted on Twitter, the Tony Award-winning actor said he recently got the confirmation that his test for COVID-19 came positive.

I've been laying low for the last couple of days because I could feel my body fighting something unusual. I just got confirmation that I've indeed tested positive for the coronavirus, Mitchell said.

The 62-year-old actor said he has already been keeping himself isolated from the rest of his family for the past few days.

The other good news is that for the last number of days, probably three or four, every day that has passed has been better than the previous, Mitchell said.

So I'm pretty sure I'm over the hump for this right now. I just wanted to let you know so you don't worry about me, he added.

Mitchell, who has been working in theatre for the past three decades, is best known for his performances in musicals like Kiss Me, Kate , King Hedley II and Sweeney Todd , among many others.

Over the years, he has also made appearances in shows such as Will Smith-starrer The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , Ugly Betty , Glee , Mr Robot and most recently Prodigal Son .

214,02-4-20,"27 feet, not 6 feet, social distancing needed: Study’","A new study shows that current physical distancing guidelines provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may not safeguard you against coronavirus infection. A research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association warned that the gas cloud from a cough or sneeze may help virus particles travel up to 8 metres.

The existing guidelines issued by the WHO and CDC are based on outdated models from the 1930s of how gas clouds from a cough, sneeze, or exhalation spread. Study author, MIT associate professor Lydia Bourouiba, however, thinks otherwise as she says that exhalations cause gaseous clouds to travel up to 27 feet (8.2 metres).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a specialised US health agency, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for six and three feet (0.9 m and 1.8 m) of space for maintaining social distancing to keep at a bay the droplets of coronavirus causing deadly Covid-19.

In a Journal of the American Medical Association article published last week, Lydia said peak exhalation speeds can reach 33 to 100 feet per second (36 km/h and 110 km/h) and ""currently used surgical and N95 masks are not tested for these potential characteristics of respiratory emissions.”

Lydia was doing research on dynamics of exhalations (coughs and sneezes, for instance) for years at the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory.

Her research could have implications for the global COVID-19 pandemic, though measures called for “there’s an urgency in revising the guidelines currently being given by the WHO and the CDC on the needs for protective equipment, particularly for the frontline health care workers,” A Lydia told US TODAY.

WHO's advisory suggests that ""droplets can travel only short distances through the air and either land on people or land on surfaces that people later touch."" This is the basis for the hygiene protocol that urges people ""to wash hands frequently and not touch the face, because that could bring the virus into contact with the nose or mouth.""

Lydia's research, however, calls for better measures to protect health care workers and, potentially, more distance from infected people who are coughing or sneezing. She said current guidelines are based on ""large droplets"" as the method of transmission for the virus and the idea that those large droplets can only go a certain distance.

Dr. Paul Pottinger, an infectious disease professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, said questions remain about the distances at which the virus is effective.

""For me, the question is not how far the germs can travel, but how far can they travel before they're no longer a threat. The smaller the germ particles, the lower the risk that they might infect somebody who would breathe them in or get them stuck in their nose or their mouth,"" Pottinger told US TODAY.

WHO referred to a recent scientific brief on the methods of transmission, which recommended ""droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients.""

Bourouiba said she wants to see recommendations made based on current science not ""policies based on supply, for example, because we don't have enough PPE (personal protective equipment).""

""Although there remains a lot of questions to be addressed about how much virus is at a given distance or not, we have no answer one way or another at this time,"" she said. ""Therefore, the precautionary principle should drive the policies to state that we should have high-grade respirators used for healthcare workers.""

""Once that's decided, that's the thrust that's needed to now mobilise most effectively the kind of tremendous high production level that is possible to reach in a great country like the United States. This thrust is not happening,"" she added.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/27-feet--not-6-feet--social-distancing-needed--study----2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/27-feet--not-6-feet--social-distancing-needed--study---.html

219,02-4-20,Australia's coronavirus testing rate best in world: Morrison,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday said Australia has taken the global lead in terms of testing people for the novel coronavirus as over one per cent of the country's population has been tested for the virus which has killed over 40,000 people globally.

Nationally, over 5,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been reported and 24 people have died.

With over 260,000 coronavirus tests have been carried out across the country, Morrison said ""We are the first country, to the best of our knowledge, that has been able to exceed that mark.""

Those testing levels equate to more than 1 per cent of the population, he said while giving the health crisis updates.

""The testing resources that we are putting in place have been absolutely fundamental to our tracing... to ensure that we can restrain the growth and the spread of the virus,"" he said.

""Those testing figures are the result of some incredible work that has been done by the health ministers, the securing of the testing materials themselves, and their application right across the country,"" Morrison said.

""It has been an extraordinary, mammoth testing effort and that has put Australia on top when it comes to ensuring we have the best information on tracking this virus.""

The bulk of Australia's deaths from coronavirus have been in New South Wales. That state is also home to about half of the nation's total number of coronavirus cases.

On Wednesday, Morrison released a video message urging Australians to collectively fight the crisis stating that it would be needed for ""months and years"" once the country enters the recovery phase.

He said the unprecedented 130 billion Australian dollars in wage subsidies that was announced this week was ""an incredible amount"" but proof the government would do whatever was necessary to ensure workers and business bounce back.

On Monday, Morrison announced a historic wage subsidy to almost six million workers who would receive a flat payment of 1,500 Australian dollars per fortnight through their employer, before tax.

The new payment scheme will help keep Australians in jobs as tackle the significant economic impact from the coronavirus, he said adding that the payment will be open to eligible businesses that receive a significant financial hit caused by the coronavirus.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) in its daily report also said 37 new asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus were reported on Wednesday from the Hubei province.

It said 35 new imported cases were reported on the same day bringing the total number of cases with the infection from abroad to 841. While no locally transmitted cases of the virus were reported from the COVID-19 epicentre Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan.

However, six persons died in the province of the disease on Wednesday.

The province also confirmed 37 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients bringing the total to 721, all of whom had been put under medical observation.

Since Wednesday, China began releasing the data of the asymptomatic cases which numbered more than 1,300 following public concern.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who are tested positive but do not show any symptoms with potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections.

The NHC said all the people with asymptomatic cases would be put into compulsory 14-day quarantine.

In Hubei province, 1,132 patients are still being treated in various hospitals for the COVID-19 of which 280 are still in severe condition and 120 others in critical condition.

Hubei has so far reported 67,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases in total, including 50,007 in Wuhan, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

As of Wednesday, a total of 81,589 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported on the mainland, and 3,318 people had died of the disease.

Meanwhile, China has begun airlifting its citizens stranded abroad through chartered flights.

China has arranged nine special flights, three from Italy and six from Iran, to bring 1,466 Chinese citizens home between March 4 and 26, Lyu Erxue, deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said.

From Iran alone, the special flights flew back 976 Chinese citizens, most of whom were Chinese students, he said, noting that the fourth such flight taking off from Italy is scheduled to bring back 180 Chinese citizens to the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou.

Another plane departed from Shanghai for London on Thursday morning to bring back 180 overseas Chinese students home, the first such flight orchestrated for Chinese citizens in the United Kingdom, according to Lyu.

For Chinese citizens who remained abroad, 116 tonnes of health supplies have been delivered to the Chinese embassies and consulates in seven countries, including Italy, the United States, France and the United Kingdom as of Wednesday, with the rest of the 300-tonne supplies bound for 12 countries to be delivered before April 10, according to Lyu.

To minimise the risk of the imported cases, the CAAC said it sought to keep international flights per week under 134, including necessary ones to carry Chinese studying or living abroad back home.

The CAAC said it so far has organised 178 planes to send 100 medical experts and workers, as well as more than 2,635 tonnes of supplies to 40 countries worldwide to help fight the pandemic.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-reports-35-new-imported-coronavirus-cases--six-deaths-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-reports-35-new-imported-coronavirus-cases--six-deaths.html
221,02-4-20,"Belgium's coronavirus death toll tops 1,000","The number of deaths attributed to the global coronavirus epidemic in Belgium increased sharply and passed the 1,000 mark on Thursday, health officials said.

The official toll in the country of 11.4 million has doubled in the space of three days, in part because figures have been updated with a backlog of fatalities from retirement homes.

There have now been 1,011 deaths and 15,348 officially recorded cases since the start of the outbreak, officials told a daily news conference.

""Ninety-three percent of deaths involve an elderly person of more than 65,"" said Dr Emmanuel Andre, the government health spokesman.

Earlier this week Andre confirmed the death of a 12-year-old girl among those infected with COVID-19.

Belgium has entered what authorities hope will be the nation's peak period of the pandemic, and around half the intensive care beds in hospital units across the country are occupied, Andre said.

The country has imposed a similar national lockdown to those in its European neighbours, with restaurants, bars and non-essential firms shut, school suspended and public events banned.

Belgium even put its year-old search for a stable coalition government on hold for a while, with parliament giving caretaker premier Sophie Wilmes a mandate to tackle the virus.

Per capita Belgium remains among the worst hit countries in Europe.

He is also the man who penned the story of the Rajkummar Rao-starrer ""Omerta"" that released in 2018. Mukul says he does not feel the pressure of finding a balance between the two callings, as writing is just a ""passion"".

""I am an actor who also writes. I love reading so I read a lot of books. The interest in writing has developed recently. When I was writing the story of 'Omerta' I was not writing it to make a film or something. But when a filmmaker like Hansal Mehta picked up my story and turned it into a film, I thought that now I can consider myself as a legitimate writer. Having said that I am an actor and I will remain that. Writing is a little box of interest that I take out once in a while,"" Mukul Dev told IANS.

""State Of Siege: 26/11"", directed by Matthew Leutwyler, has Mukul playing Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. The show also features Arjan Bajwa, Arjun Bijlani, Vivek Dahiya, Sid Makkar, Tara Alisha Berry, Khalida Jaan, Jyoti Gauba, Roshni Sahota, Suzanne Bernert, Naren Kumar and Jason Shah.

""Since I am an actor and am shooting most of the time, I have time in between shots and I keep writing then. I am surrounded by people who are filmmaker, producer and actors. So once in a while, they also inquire if I have a story or somethin. If they like it, they eventually make something out of it. But that is a time-consuming process and I see no reason of stop acting for my writing. Writing is a passion,"" he shared.

So, what is his favourite topic to write about? ""I like to write on anything that is intriguing, unheard of -- something that is offbeat. I used to love reading Richard Bach. So yeah, writing will happen side by side,"" he replied.

223,02-4-20,Padma Shri awardee & former 'Hazuri Raagi' at Golden Temple dies of coronavirus in Amritsar,"A Padma Shri awardee and former 'Hazuri Raagi' at the Golden Temple who was undergoing treatment for coronavirus here died early Thursday morning, taking the COVID-19-related death toll to five in the state, a health official said.

The 62-year-old 'Gurbani' exponent had recently returned from abroad and tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, the official said.

Principal, Government Medical College, Sujata Sharma said his condition started deteriorating on Wednesday evening and he was put on ventilator support. He died at 4:30 AM on Thursday.

The man was admitted to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital here for chest infection after he had complained of breathlessness and dizziness, she said.

According to officials, he had held a large 'sammelan' (religious gathering) in Delhi and some other places after he returned from abroad.

He had also performed a 'kirtan' at a house in Chandigarh on March 19 along with his family members and other relatives.

The samples of his two daughters, son, wife, a driver and six others, who went along with him to Chandigarh, would be taken for testing for the virus, officials said.

The Chandigarh administration has also been informed about the religious gathering at sector 27 in Chandigarh to take necessary steps in this regard, they said.

The man was awarded the Padma Shri in 2009. He had the knowledge of all the 31 'Raags' in the Gurbani of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhism.

With his death, the total count of COVID-19-related deaths rose to five in the state.

Punjab has so far reported total 46 coronavirus cases -- 19 from Nawanshahr, 10 from Mohali, six from Hoshiarpur, five from Jalandhar, three from Ludhiana, two from Amritsar and one from Patiala.

Of the 46 cases, one patient was discharged from hospital after his second test results came to be negative.

The 81 new cases registered included 57 from Mumbai, nine each from Pune and Ahmednagar, five in Thane and one in Buldhana, with the positive cases crossing the 400 mark in less than 24 hours from 335 on Wednesday.

Details of the new fatalities are awaited, said officials.

On the other hand, 42 persons have fully recovered in the state and have been discharged from hospitals.

The city's worst nightmare came true when at least two Covid-19 cases were reported from Dharavi - notorious as Asia's biggest slum and world's most congested district - in central Mumbai.

While a 53-year old man with no history of foreign travel has reportedly succumbed in a government hospital late on Wednesday, a 51-year old civic sanitation employee was found positive on Thursday, sending shockwaves throughout Dharavi.

Moving swiftly, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), with a police team, promptly sealed off the entire building No. 9 in Punjabi Camp, Sion-Koliwada area amidst howls of protests and abuses.

Officials have so far chosen to officially play down the incidents and are not confirming the death of the 53-year old man ostensibly to prevent panic in Dharavi.

In another cause for concern, Health Minister Rajesh Tope announced that 1,400 persons who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi last month have been identified and process is on to track and quarantine them.

So far, around the test results of 46 persons who returned from the event have proved negative and the reports of the remaining 3 are awaited.

Besides, more than 200, including several foreigners, in different parts of the state are already under quarantine with complete protocols implemented.

The MCGM has also released a list of all its containment (quarantine) areas in the city to help the people and avoid these localities where either Covid-19 patients have been found or suspects are kept in isolation.

They include several residential complexes across the city which are now sealed with entry-exit barred for all till the isolation periods are over, while the civic body is fumigating various localities and housing complexes around Mumbai.

The state government has now opened around 3,500 temporary camps for housing migrant labourers across the state where they are getting food, accommodation and other basic needs till the lockdown period is over.

Early on Thursday, police detained around 325 migrants who attempted to sneak out of Maharashtra in container trucks to Rajasthan and further investigations are on.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced the latest toll in a news conference and confirmed 3,111 new infections over the past 24 hours, bringing Iran's total to 50,468.

He said 16,711 of those hospitalised had so far recovered.

Iran has been scrambling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak since it reported its first cases on February 19.

After weeks of refraining from imposing a lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided last week to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.

There is no official lockdown within Iran's cities, although the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.

Rouhani warned at a cabinet meeting on Thursday that there was no quick fix.

""Coronavirus is not something for which we can point to a certain date and say it will be completely eradicated by then,"" he said.

Rouhani said the virus ""may be with us in upcoming months, or until the end"" of the current Iranian year, in March 2021.

The country, one of the world's worst hit by the pandemic which originated in China, must remain vigilant and more limitations may be implemented, he said.

Iran has closed schools and universities until early April and also four key Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom.

229,02-4-20,328 new COVID-19 cases and 12 deaths reported since Wednesday: Health ministry,"About 400 COVID-19 cases have been found in the country whose epidemiological linkage can be traced to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, the Health Ministry said on Thursday, indicating that the number could go up as testing and contact tracing was underway.

Addressing the daily briefing on the coronavirus situation in the country, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said 328 new cases of the coronavirus infection and 12 new deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 1,965 so far in India.

""Yesterday, the cabinet secretary through video conferencing with chief secretaries and DGPs asked them to initiate intensive contact tracing of Tablighi Jamaat participants and implement containment measures on a war-footing,"" Agarwal said.

Based on contact tracing and sampling conducted so far, about 400 positive cases have been identified whose epidemiological linkage can be traced to the Tablighi Jamaat cluster, he said.

These numbers are increasing as more samples are being tested, Agarwal said.

Regarding the Dharavi coronavirus case in Mumbai, he said the building there has been sealed and sample collection and contact tracing is going on as per protocol.

Appropriate action is being taken in that particular case as per protocol, he added.

On instances of medical professionals contracting coronavirus infection, Agarwal said that in majority of the cases doctors who caught the disease, and subsequently infected people associated with them, were not on COVID-19 duty. He said that there have been limited cases of doctors on duty testing positive for coronavirus.

In this context, he also highlighted the importance of training that is provided through AIIMS in coordination with states on hospital-related infection prevention control to healthcare workers and urged all of them to take precautions while dealing with COVID-19 patients.

Reacting to the attack on frontline healthcare workers, Agarwal said people should not misbehave or attack those who are rendering service despite the risk of contracting the deadly infection and reminded how people had enthusiastically expressed their solidarity with the healthcare professions during the Janta curfew on March 22.

Responding to a question over some doctors resigning because of shortage of personal protection equipment (PPEs), he acknowledged that there were problems related to the paucity of those items, and said that orders had been placed for over 1.5 crore PPEs and their supply had already started.

As far as N-95 masks are concerned, he said domestic manufacturing of the masks has been stepped up and order for over 1 crore masks have been placed with the supply to some extent started.

""The stocks of PPEs and N-95 masks which were available at the state and country level have been distributed to states in proportion to the number of coronavirus cases reported from them,"" Agarwal said.

The joint secretary said that the prime minister in a high-level meeting with the chief ministers of states/UTs, through video conference, urged them to manage the crisis at the district-level and to focus on testing, isolation and quarantine facilities.

States were also requested to upgrade healthcare human resource, conduct online training of frontline workers as well as increase the strength of existing capacity through involvement of retired health workers from government, private hospitals and NGOs, he said.

The official said that under the orders of the Supreme Court, states have been directed to take effective measures to fight fake news in order to prevent panic among people.

The ministry with the help of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Science (NIMHANS) has recommended general public measures to be taken on mental health for the elderly and children to deal with anxiety and stress due to the coronavirus outbreak, he said.

231,02-4-20,We have stopped respecting nature: Pankaj Tripathi on COVID-19,"From reading books, spending time with his daughter to to making 'daal' in different ways, life has suddenly stopped being dictated by the clock for actor Pankaj Tripathi, who is taking a break due to the coronavirus lockdown.

One of the busiest actors in Bollywood right now, Tripathi said the isolation period has made him view nature differently and why respecting it is the only hope for humanity.

""I am relaxing, reading books like one on Nargis Dutt called 'Darling Ji', 'Indian Method in Acting' by Prasanna, reading my daughter's geography book. I am doing all those things I was unable to do earlier due to my busy schedule.

""I was not getting the time to rest so now I get up a little late as I don't have a 7 am shift. As I am not going to work, sometimes I am unaware about time, day and date. Earlier, life moved according to the time,"" he told PTI in an interview here.

The actor said he gets to sit by the window and watch the sunset, which is not always possible.

""I didn't know that I can see a beautiful sunset from my house but now I see it every day, I had never seen such clear and beautiful sky in the last 10 years, I can see the stars shining now. I believe we all have stopped respecting nature as human beings. We are today using nature as a tool to just click a selfie so that we can post it on Instagram,"" he said.

Tripathi said it is important for everyone to plant a tree.

""I am sure we will overcome this (coronavirus) as the world has witnessed many such pandemics before. But it is time we start respecting nature,"" he said.

""Out of 130 crore of the Indian population not even 120 crore of them would have planted trees. It should be made mandatory for every person to plant a tree.

""If you don't have land of your own, one can get in touch with an NGO instead of gifting bouquets and plants. We believe oxygen and water come for free and rains also come automatically. Going ahead we all have to be careful.""

Tripathi was shooting for the season two of Hotstar Special series ""Criminal Justice"", but as a precautionary measure the team stopped shooting from March 14.

He has been at home since.

""I followed the guidelines like maintaining social distancing, washing hands. I had stopped going out from March 14 much before the Janata Curfew was announced,"" he informed.

The actor said he was contemplating about going to his hometown in Bihar to be with his parents but as situation worsened he couldn't go. But he is in constant touch with his family.

""They are fine. There are not many people living there so they are, as it is, maintaining social distancing. I wasn't getting time to go there because of my packed schedule. This time I was thinking about visiting my parents as there were no shoots happening. But now due to lockdown, I can't.""

The actor urged everyone to remain indoors as that's the only way to contain the spread of the pandemic.

""As a responsible citizen, we should follow the lockdown and I urge everyone that this is the fight we all should win by sitting at home and maintaining hygiene. Precaution is the only cure for this epidemic.""

Tripathi stays in Madh Island, which he said is an isolated area, and he stocked the essentials that would last a few days.

""I am not someone who will panic over basic essentials. I don't know why people are panicking about availability of food items. There is lockdown in the country, there is no scarcity of food. I am cooking food for my daughter and I have learnt we can make 'daal' in so many different ways.

""Because of lot facilities available to us, we have become lazy and we have stopped becoming innovative in our thinking,"" he said, adding, his wife made masks at home from cotton cloth.

""If she didn't try this we would have ended up buying mask from outside. We usually become creative and innovative only when there is a dearth of anything.

""One should take this situation positively and learn a lot of things from it. In this fast paced world we have forgotten to enjoy life and we are just running, including me,"" he added.

On the work front, Tripathi has a slew of projects up for release including director Kabir Khan's ""83"", the ""Gunjan Saxena"" biopic starring Jahnvi Kapoor, filmmaker Anurag Basu's multi-starrer ""Ludo"", Kriti Sanon's ""Mimi"", ""Kaagaz"", which is produced by Salman Khan and American action-thriller film ""Extraction"" from Netflix.

He has also shot for the second season of Amazon Prime Video original series ""Mirzapur"", while some portions of ""Criminal Justice"" are yet to be shot.

Asked if he is watching anything on TV or on the web, and pat comes the reply, ""No entertainment for me at the moment. I don't watch TV or anything on digital anyway. I'd rather spend my time with family, reading books and cooking.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-have-stopped-respecting-nature--pankaj-tripathi-on-covid-19-2020-04-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/we-have-stopped-respecting-nature--pankaj-tripathi-on-covid-19.html
232,02-4-20,Start Microsoft Teams video call directly from Slack,"In a bid to simplify life for millions of people working from home, enterprise messaging platform Slack has launched a new app to integrate its rival Microsoft Teams video call features into its chat app.

According to The Verge, Slack users will be able to set Microsoft Teams Calls as the default calling provider from Thursday.

Once you've set up the Teams app in Slack, you'll be able to start a call by simply using the command /teams-call.

You will also be able to see the participants in a meeting before you join in.

Alongside the Microsoft Teams integration, Slack is also launching VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) phone integration with Zoom, Cisco Jabber, RingCentral and Dialpad productivity services.

Slack has seen nearly 350 percent growth in calls made or received in its chat app over the past month, as enterprises and SMBs adopt remote working during the new coronavirus pandemic.

Microsoft's unified communications platform for workplace called Teams has reached 44 million daily active users (DAUs).

The Teams' nearest competitor Slack last announced 12 million DAUs in October.

Microsoft is planning to introduce a real-time noise suppression feature for Teams meetings this year.

233,02-4-20,Zoom bug can let hackers steal your Windows password,"Slammed for the lack of users privacy and security by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and cybersecurity experts, video meeting app Zoom is also prone to hacking, a new report has claimed, saying an unpatched bug can let hackers steal users Windows password.

The ï¿½Zoom client for Windows' is vulnerable to the 'UNC path injection' vulnerability that could let remote attackers steal login credentials for victims' Windows systems, reports TheHacckeNews.

The latest finding by cybersecurity expert @_g0dmode, has also been ""confirmed by researcher Matthew Hickey and Mohamed A. Baset,' the report said late Wednesday.

The attack involves the ""SMBRelay technique"" wherein Windows automatically exposes a user's login username and NTLM password hashes to a remote server, when attempting to connect and download a file hosted on it.

""The attack is possible only because Zoom for Windows supports remote UNC paths, which converts such potentially insecure URLs into hyperlinks for recipients in a personal or group chat,"" the report claimed.

Besides Windows credentials, the vulnerability can also be exploited to launch any programme present on a targeted computer.

Zoom has been notified of this bug but the flaw is yet to be fixed.

""Users are advised to either use an alternative video conferencing software or Zoom in your web browser instead of the dedicated client app,"" said the report.

Another media report claimed that Zoom doesn't use end-to-end encryption to protect calling data of its users.

As businesses, schools and colleges and millions of SMBs use video conferencing tool Zoom during the work-from-home scenario, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned people about porn material being popped up during the video meetings.

The Boston branch of the law enforcement agency said it has received multiple reports of Zoom conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language.

The video conferencing app late last month updated its iOS app to remove the software development kit (SDK) that was providing users' data to Facebook through the Login with Facebook feature.
