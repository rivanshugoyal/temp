0,12-2-20,The big picture,"TRAI needs to allow the broadcasting sector to flourish by scaling down economic regulations and taking stock of the performance of last-mile distributors

Much has been written about the uproar over the telecom regulator’s decision to bring in amendments to the New Tariff Order (NTO). Dubbed NTO 2.0, the revised tariff order has met with severe criticism and legal armour from broadcasters, who have accused the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of sabotaging the sector by introducing clauses that will allegedly erode subscription revenues, push broadcasters towards an advertising-led revenue model and destroy the level-playing field in favour of Distribution Platforms (DPOs) and advertisers.

The TRAI, on its part, has argued that the amendments were necessary as the NTO had failed to meet its objective of giving adequate choice to consumers through rampant “misuse” of power and flexibility granted to broadcasters. But, perhaps, the most stinging reason that led to these amendments was the TRAI’s inability to keep cable bills in check, prompting consumers to downsize on TV viewing.

There are compelling reasons to scrutinise the regulator’s tinkering with the Network Capacity Fee (NCF) to expand the reach of Free-To-Air (FTA) channels under the NTO 2.0. There was widespread belief that the TRAI would waive off or at least reduce the NCF under its amendments to make TV viewing more affordable. Far from it, the TRAI has replaced the old NCF structure with a two-slab one that further expands the ambit of FTA channels.

To recapitulate, the NTO issued last year mandated DPOs to provide 100 FTA channels, which included 76 private ones and 24 Doordarshan (DD) channels to every subscriber for Rs 130, excluding tax. Under the amended NTO, the TRAI has asked DPOs to provide up to 200 channels, excluding 24 DD channels for Rs 130. The regulator also introduced another slab — for more than 200 private FTA channels and 24 DD channels, the NCF would be Rs 160 excluding tax.

The TRAI may have had the best intentions in introducing the two-tier NCF structure. “TRAI recognises that the new regulatory framework implemented in 2019 caused distortions that led to price increases in the TV market. Primary among them is a reduced incentive for distributors to improve the quality of service on account of the NCF. Consumers also pay more to watch the same content and it’s tedious for them to keep track of the number of subscribed channels, as a result of the NCF. Through this two-slab system, TRAI ostensibly seeks to address such documented challenges,” says Vivan Sharan, Partner, Koan Advisory.

Despite its stated intention, however, the revision in NCF — along with the mandate to reduce the MRP of channels from Rs 19 to Rs 12 to be part of a bouquet — has raised difficult questions, many of which reflect the TRAI’s own inconsistencies.

For one, the NTO was introduced last year in an attempt to empower consumers and give them the freedom to choose what they want to watch and pay only for that. The TRAI has repeatedly argued that the introduction of à la carte pricing was necessary as broadcasters were dumping “unwanted” channels on consumers through bundling and bouquet formations. But here’s the catch, while the TRAI is attempting to restrict broadcasters from bundling or forming bouquets, doesn’t allowing a distribution platform to offer 200+ FTA channels tantamount to bundling? Then again there’s an issue of who really benefits from the introduction of the new NCF structure — consumers or DPOs?

Chairman of Star and Disney India Uday Shankar points out the anomaly, “If the regulator is so concerned about bringing down the price for the consumer, then why in the name of an NCF, are the distributors being allowed to charge as much as Rs 160? Theoretically, they can charge anything up to Rs 160 for only providing FTA channels. Just to understand the ludicrous contradiction of this order, the same channels could be obtained by the consumer by going to DD Free Dish. So something that the Free Dish makes available for free, the regulator, in the name of bringing down the burden on the consumer, has allowed the DPOs to charge up to Rs 160.”

Broadcasters are bemused that the TRAI is willing to give private DPOs the upper hand even at the cost of the Government’s own DD Free Dish. “Doesn’t TRAI favour private and commercial DPOs vis-a-vis DD Free Dish DTH, where the subscriber has to incur a one-time cost for a Set Top Box and gets the FTA channels for free for life but has to pay private DPOs a monthly NCF for those same channels?,” asks an executive from a leading broadcaster on condition of anonymity. The executive argues the TRAI is not only destroying DD Free Dish’s viewership but consumers are repeatedly “fleeced” each month in the name of NCF.

The legal head of another popular broadcaster laments that the TRAI has played into the hands of DPOs, granting them unequivocal authority to create base packs for consumers. “DPOs will now create a base pack of 224 poor-quality FTA channels priced at Rs 160 and push these onto consumers. Meanwhile, as a content creator, my relationship with my consumers is curtailed, I lose the authority to decide how my channel will be carried by the platforms and the reach it will garner, and my economies of scale have been eroded too,” says the legal executive who does not wish to be named.

Distributors, however, say there is no inherent benefit to them as claimed by broadcasters. The CEO of a leading Multi-System Operator says on condition of anonymity, “The NCF was never designed as a premise to offer FTAs to consumers. Platforms charge consumers NCF to cover the cost of setting up the infrastructure to carry channels and their operations. As part of that commitment, the TRAI directed us to offer 100 FTAs under the NTO. So FTAs are incidental, not the primary reason why NCF is levied.”

Then there’s the critical issue of guaranteeing choice to consumers. Broadcasters allege that while the TRAI seems to be offering a wider viewing through the 200+ FTAs, there is no real choice on offer. “MSO head-ends are not capable of delivering differential packages of FTA channels to every household taking into account their age, language and genre preferences. So where is the choice as far as FTAs are concerned?,” asks the senior executive. All of this could have perhaps been pardonable if the new NCF structure could guarantee lower cable bills, a claim TRAI is only happy to make. Broadcasters, however, are quick to burst the bubble. “DPOs will charge a MRP of either Rs 130 or Rs 160 for the FTA channels and then consumers have to opt for à la carte channels or broadcasters’ bouquet or DPO bouquets to watch their choice of channels. So how will the two-slab NCF actually reduce bills?,” argues the executive. To put it another way, the NCF itself serves as the biggest single-fixed component of monthly cable bills.

Distribution platforms have another point of view and say the NCF’s two-pronged approach will ease cable bills and satisfy even conscious TV watchers. For a fee of Rs 130 and taxes, an entry-level consumer can now avail up to 200 FTA channels, giving him a wider basket. Then again, even if a consumer opts for the entire universe of pay channels, the TRAI has limited the NCF to Rs 160 a month, which hitherto increased as the number of channels increased (an additional NCF of Rs 20 was charged for every slab of 25 channels).

Broadcasters argue the reduced MRP caps and new NCF structure will limit the number of channels in pay bouquets, erode the value delivered to consumers and the loss of subscribers and revenues will force more pay channels to become FTA, which solely rely on advertisement revenue for their business.

As more channels become FTAs, it will also force broadcasters to fight a hard battle with DPOs to be included in their FTA base packs, giving platforms the upper hand to negotiate higher carriage fees. Put together, this will negatively affect the quality of programmatic content and the viewing experience for consumers.

“Smaller broadcasters pay channels may convert to FTA to remain attractive for consumers, following the introduction of new economic regulations on bouquets. If more such pay channels become FTA, broadcasters will cease to invest in high-quality, niche content. This will negatively impact content quality,” says Sharan.

As more channels become FTAs and more air-time becomes available, ad rates will fall and advertisers will gain immensely. This will lead to an increase in number of advertisements on TV. “This will only expedite the migration of consumers to other digital platforms, where they not only enjoy high quality content but also without the frequent interruptions of advertisements,” says the head of another broadcaster.

The TRAI did not respond to an email seeking replies on the new amendments that come into effect on March 1.

Experts say TRAI needs to allow the broadcasting sector to flourish by scaling down economic regulations and taking stock of the performance of last-mile distributors. “The NCF has certainly increased the cost of watching TV. This can only be remedied by enhancing competition among last-mile TV distributors, not by more economic regulations,” says Sharan. “Distributors must do justice to consumers by actually using revenues from NCF to improve quality of service. A transparent ecosystem-wide audit is desperately needed. Logically, this should precede regulatory changes,” he concludes.

The legal executive warns that should the TRAI continue with excessive and arbitrary regulatory measures, it will push the broadcast sector on to the same thorny path as the telecom sector.

“Until a decade ago, India boasted 14 telecom players; today we are staring at a duopoly. The broadcast sector is headed in the same direction. More channels are forced to go the FTA way, leading broadcasters are not launching new channels and smaller, niche channels are shutting shop. Ultimately, if the broadcast sector perishes, so will the distribution platforms,” he says.

1,12-2-20,It’s good to know your value,"Rating a company is a useful piece of business intelligence and should be undertaken annually by firms

Valuation of a company is extremely important. If there is one thing that is common to a company of any size, be it a multinational firm with a global footprint, or any of its individual businesses or a small, single-product business, it is valuation. Anytime during the lifetime of a business, the requirement for its valuation emerges, specifically when considering the purchase or sale of a company or any line of its business.

A firm may sell a part of its business while restructuring or dispose some of its operating divisions. Other companies and investors, mainly institutional, are buyers of these firms. Valuation of a business concern is the baseline for any negotiation. Once a corporation knows its value — which can be obtained through a reputed valuation service — it can negotiate with the buyer and can reject the deal, if the offer made is less than what is required.

A company may require additional funds from time to time to run smoothly or prevent any financial distress. Any potential investor scrutinises the value of the firm and may also derive its valuation based on any future cash flows. Since the investors are interested to increase their return on investment (ROI), they are keen to fund any business when they feel their funds can take the company to the next level and improve its valuation. Both buyers and sellers have to find the economic value of either the entire company or the specific line of business with some reasonable correctness. With increased globalisation, mergers and acquisitions have become the norm for businesses to survive and in this context, valuation has become crucial.

Another important reason for valuation of one’s company is not for others but for self. The goal of any business in today’s scenario is shareholders’ wealth maximisation and value management has become a key strategic objective. Many corporations measure economic value creation for the company as a whole, periodically, using different techniques to measure performance against planned targets and suitably reward managers on achieving the same. So whether it is for other buyers or self, a company is valued economically at least once in its lifetime.

A firm is assessed by valuing its equity and the total company. Equity of any company is valued by measuring the expected future cash flows to the shareholders. The expected dividend paid by a company over a reasonable period of time is the stake of any shareholder of a firm, plus the present price of the expected values of equity at the end of this time. This reasonable period of time varies depending on the industry — three to five years for fast-changing industries like IT and longer, like 10 to 20 years for resource-based industries like oil. By discounting these annual dividend cash flows, one gets to derive the value of equity.

Free cash flows are used to find the value of the entire company and any past and projected earnings are transformed into a net cash flow framework. The first step is to project the earning patterns and the simplest way to do it is to keep the current level of earnings constant. However, such a simple measure is unrealistic in case the cash flows are expected to either grow, decline or show a cyclical pattern. So a year-on-year projection for as far as possible into the future is required. The second step is to convert the earning patterns into cash flows by adjusting the after-tax earnings with non-cash items like depreciation. Estimating future investment outlays to achieve the current level of earnings is the next and the third step. These future investments could be buying a new plant and machinery, putting money in research and development and any incremental working capital requirements. The final step is to estimate the ongoing market value of the business at a point in time. This approach can be further refined in a multi-business company, where the operating cash flows of each business unit are discounted. However, it needs to be understood that there is nothing automatic about estimating future cash flows and coming to an economic value of a business. Since these are estimations, each investor, buyer or an analyst, is free to choose the assumptions for predicting cash flows and interpret the results in their own manner. So there would definitely be a difference between the economic value of a company from the point of view of buyers and sellers and negotiating skills come into play here.

Valuation of a company is not without its challenges. To begin with, valuation has to deal with the problems of estimations and forecasting and an attempt at quantification of available objective data. Valuation of a business is one of the most complex tasks for any analyst since the entire process depends upon estimation, specific skills like prediction of earnings, cash flows, assessment of risk, strategic insight and interpretation of the impact of combining management styles, operations and resources.

Valuation should help companies establish new goals to increase their worth over the coming years. It should be an annual affair to undertake all three main types of valuations and to measure growth, losses and identify room for improvement. Knowing the valuation of one’s company is after all a useful piece of business intelligence.

2,12-2-20,Kejriwal reinvented himself to win Delhi,"However, the AAP and the Delhi Chief Minister should remember that there are many challenges aheadif they want to move to the national stage

Whoever thought seven years ago that the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal would come this far to bag the throne of Delhi for the third term? Though the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had arrived as a disruptive force in 2013 and was dismissed as an upstart, its chief Kejriwal surprised critics with his ability to grasp the pulse of the public and change for the better in this roller coaster political ride. There was a method to his madness though his critics called him an “anarchist.” Delhi was not the end of his ambition, as he took on Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the party contested on 400 seats. Even after winning this time around, the AAP was talking of nation-building. But for now, Kejriwal must be satisfied with the landslide win in the Delhi Assembly polls. This is the second time the “Modi magic” did not work in Delhi elections, that too just six months after the BJP’s impressive 2019 victory. The fight was between the AAP and the BJP with the Congress not anywhere in the reckoning.

The BJP had gone all out to win back the State — as it had been in the political wilderness in the Capital for almost three decades now — bombarding the city with high-profile leaders.

So, what worked for Kejriwal this time? The coup was that he did a “Modi on Modi.” The BJP leader won the 2014 elections on the promise of development and Kejriwal did the same in the Delhi polls.

To his credit, he delivered on that promise and after five years at the helm the Chief Minister did not go to the Delhi voters empty-handed. He was armed with his welfare measures, including free water, cheap power, improved health services, better educational facilities, doorstep delivery of services to the common man, free bus rides for women, better street lighting, CCTVs and so on and sought votes on his Government’s performance. Though Kejriwal’s critics alleged that he was doling out sops with the taxpayers’ money, his projection of the AAP as a party that works for the poor went in their favour.

Kejriwal also wisely kept himself away from the Shaheen Bagh controversy, anti-CAA protests and hate politics, though Muslims are part of his core voters.

Second, Kejriwal is nothing if not a quick learner. He realised his mistakes and changed his style of functioning after the AAP’s humiliating defeat in the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections in 2017. But the real change came after the AAP got a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

So Kejriwal attempted an image makeover and from the angry young man in 2012, he transformed into a “vikas purush (development man).” The “muffler man,” Kejriwal discarded his muffler and also projected himself as a family man. The winning tactic was that Kejriwal preferred to fight for Delhi strictly on bread and butter issues. Also, he consciously stopped his confrontationist politics and surprised many when his party supported the contentious Bills on the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the Rajya Sabha. He also welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. All these have resulted in a better relationship between the Delhi Chief Minister and the Prime Minister. Modi even sent Kejriwal birthday greetings when the latter turned 51.

Fourth, he scrupulously kept the poll narrative to local issues while the BJP raked national and divisive issues with motormouths giving hate speeches and trying to vitiate the atmosphere.

Fifth, Kejriwal also abandoned his constant fight with Delhi’s Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) after the Supreme Court ordered the L-G to work on the “aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.” The constant court battles, too, have stopped.

Sixth, and more importantly, neither the Congress nor the BJP had any credible leaders to match Kejriwal’s stature. The BJP was betting on the Modi magic while the Congress was invoking the work of Sheila Dikshit.

In short, his victory was due to four main factors. First, Kejriwal was successful in making the people believe that he merited another chance. Second, people saw him as a “doer” as compared to his earlier image of a political upstart. Third, was the decline of the Congress and lack of any credible leader in the BJP. Fourth he was successful in nurturing of the “poor” as his constituency. He got credit for the regularisation of illegal colonies and stayed away from polarising politics. However, the AAP and its chief should remember that there are many challenges ahead if they want to move to the national stage.

3,12-2-20,No josh in defence Budget,"Winning elections and wars are not in the same league. The Govt can no longer camouflage its declining defence modernisation programme with high symbolism and hyper-nationalism

Two recent trends inimical to the country’s national security — the politicisation of the military and a flat and negative defence modernisation Budget — worrying as they are, will soon become the new normal. In this space, I have written enough as to how the ruling political elite has milked the armed forces for electoral gains — be it during the Uri surface strikes or Balakot air strikes — but in the process, it has brazenly politicised them. Carrying pictures of serving Army officers on political posters by the BJP is terrible. But terming the Army and the Air Force as “Modiji’s sena” is unacceptable. So is the usage of Air Force commanders to legitimise breaches in the procurement procedure to justify the purchase of the Rafale aircraft.

During the Karnataka elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi needlessly revived seven-decade-old political events involving Gen KS Thimayya but erroneously named Gen KS Cariappa, thus hurting both families. In contrast, it was heartening to listen to the new Army Chief when he reminded his soldiers about the Constitution. It was, however, disappointing that he read out the Government’s political script on the merits of its actions in Jammu & Kashmir, especially when the legislation is under arbitration. The deep selection of Service Chiefs, overriding the seniority norm and the appointment of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) will have political resonance.

The ruling dispensation has become immune to criticism by the Election Commission, its political opponents and the veteran community about involving both serving and retired personnel to promote its partisan agenda, much of which is sub-judice. The Prime Minister’s choice of themes, while speaking to the military during the inauguration of the National War Memorial (NWM) or the young cadets at the National Cadet Corps (NCC) during the annual parade recently, was political and inappropriate. Feeding impressionable cadets with political achievements while casually claiming that India could defeat Pakistan in war in seven to 10 days has left many bedazzled. Fuelling nationalistic hype when the military is starved of funds for modernisation is intriguing. The Prime Minister, aiming with a Kalashnikov rifle at the highly exaggerated achievements of the Defence Expo 2020, which is now held wherever the Defence Minister’s political constituency is, will become an ironic visual.

Military politicisation peaked at the NCC rally. Strangely none of the Service Chiefs nor the CDS present there stopped the Prime Minister from speaking to the cadets about the political events aimed at the Delhi elections. In contrast, recently the Australian CDS, Gen Angus John Campbell, did precisely this: Tap his Defence Minister Christopher Pyne when he switched from speaking about military issues to answering political questions in the presence of senior military officers, telling him that he would ask the military to move out — and they did. Campbell did not want his officers to be seen backing his Minister over his party’s claimed political achievements.

For the fourth year in a row, defence allocation was not mentioned during the 2020-21 Budget presented this month. In her marathon speech, the Finance Minister quoted a Tamil sage and said: “Just as national security was important a millennium ago, for her Government, it is the number one issue today.” But the funds she provided for defence modernisation suggested otherwise. According to one official in the Ministry of Defence, the funds are barely sufficient to pay instalments for weapons purchased earlier. The Defence Minister issued a lofty Press release, lauding the Budget, without mentioning a word about the impoverished plight of his own Ministry. Similarly, the Prime Minister, who is still nursing the surgical strike’s hangover, said nothing, though his remarks on defeating a nuclear-armed Pakistan in seven to 10 days remained puzzling, especially as officials in the Ministry of Defence have said that ammunition for a 10-day intense war will be available only by 2022-23.

US Ambassador Kenneth Juster said recently that the economic slowdown, which the Government has not admitted to as yet, will affect modernisation of defence capability. On paltry modernisation funds year on year, former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said, “Defence forces do not have the mechanism to spend the money; we do not have the funds to give them; will have funds only once the tax net expands.” Since 2014, when the BJP came into power, defence Budgets have been at their lowest since 1962 at around 1.5 to 1.6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). BJP’s own stalwarts in the Standing Committee on Defence and Estimates Committee, Gen BC Khanduri and MM Joshi, had pointed out big holes in defence preparedness. Khanduri lost his job for indicating this.

Soon after the current five per cent dismal increase in defence allocation, the CDS apparently put the lid on any comments by single Service Chiefs, telling some journalists that the Budget was adequate; that the management of the Budget is critical; and that it is more of a management issue than a question of adequate funds. He also said that he would prioritise acquisition, raise age of retirement to 58 years, create funds from within and if necessary, take additional requirements to the Government. The Prime Minister, while speaking to the NCC cadets, mentioned the appointment of the CDS, elaborating that along with single Service Chiefs, this represented one plus one plus one, equalling 111, implying that the CDS is the Alibaba of defence issues.

The decision on One Rank, One Pension (OROP) taken by the Prime Minister in the heat and dust of the 2014 election campaign was one he must be regretting now. The defence pension Bill has reached Rs 1.33 lakh crore, which is more than Rs 1.18 lakh crore for salaries and Rs 1.11 lakh crore for capital. In 2010, it was Rs 41,000 crore and last year it was Rs 1.13 lakh crore. Another Rs 6,500 crore will be required for OROP equaliser this year. This incongruity in tooth to tail ratio must be corrected. Equally, more funds must be allotted for modernisation to catch up with China, whose defence Budget is three times more than India’s.

Clearly, the josh of the surgical strikes is no cover for lack of defence preparedness. Winning elections and wars are not in the same league. The Government can no longer camouflage its declining modernisation programme with high symbolism and hyper-nationalism. Its seriousness about defence can be judged from the appointment of five Defence Ministers in six years. Still, the CDS is a positive step though the way he has been located in the hierarchy, he is another ‘1’ in the Prime Minister’s 111 arithmetic.

The politics of national security has trumped its economics, leading to the 15th Finance Commission fire-fighting for the creation of additional defence funds. Given the tight fiscal situation, the Government should temper its national security ambitions and goals and leave the professional military alone.

4,12-2-20,AAP ki Dilli,"The verdict brings a whiff of reassurance in times of toxic politics and knocks out the BJP’s oversized ambitions

Without taking away any credit from the quiet resilience and perseverance of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the real winner of the Delhi Assembly elections has been the Indian citizen. In a poll that was meant to be local but turned into a national referendum, they chose what they wanted to as Indians, scything through the hate politics and toxic rhetoric of the times, reclaiming the sensibility of what public life and politics should be, owning nationalism on their fingertips and showing the possibilities of plurality. And as Chief Minister-elect Arvind Kejriwal paid obeisance at the Hanuman mandir yet again, something that was mocked by the BJP earlier on in the campaign, he proved that Hinduism was not the sole custodianship of the saffron guild. And as the popular tagline of a steel major goes, Delhiites also chose development for themselves, the only capital that works to win hearts. Had this not been so, then there would be no faith left in the politics of performance and the needle would have swung back to the politics of opportunism. Finally, it was the culmination of the civil society movement that birthed Kejriwal in the first place. This was much-needed at a time when Delhi was besieged with the worst images of divisive politics that played out as brutal crackdowns on protesters against the citizenship law, on students who dared to dissent and on women who decided to lead a rights movement. And what a knockout punch Delhiites have delivered with their monolithic support to the AAP which hit the ball out of the park with 62 seats, losing only five seats from 2015. The AAP’s welfarist schemes on power, education, healthcare and housing, some of which have picked up global awards, have undoubtedly congealed people’s faith. Its reliance on the youth brigade, considered well-meaning and uncorrupted, have lent credence to the belief that they would be empowered to drive governance in a manner that no political party can. Still the naked display of majoritarianism and the BJP’s organised choreography of imagined threats to our identity did leave it worried, particularly in the last days of campaigning. Then there was the BJP’s juggernaut with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah at the helm, unleashing a high decibel campaign. But Kejriwal sagaciously side-stepped every polarising trap set by the BJP. He didn’t attack Modi, knowing he still has a godman-like hold of the mass consciousness. He softly peddled his Hindu identity, inclusive as opposed to the BJP’s exclusive version. He shunned optics with the Muslim community while convincing them privately that it was a politically motivated design and that he would still be theirs. His cadres helped students hit by police brutalities. He didn’t oppose nationalist moves like abrogation of Article 370 or take a stand on the massive protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), saying they were the purview of the Centre. And he pointedly stuck to concerns within the territoriality of the city-State, leaving out bigger issues like law and order since they didn’t come under his jurisdiction. This honesty and humility worked as a strategy. AAP 2.0 also relied on some staples of traditional politics, taking in turncoats, conducting live sabhas for a direct interface and a la Modi, asking dramatically, “Kejriwal vs who?” The impatient disruptor is now a mature politician and has become one with the winning ways of the Delhi durbar.

The BJP, which had made Delhi a high stakes battle, was grotesquely trapped in its own mesh. It’s a huge loss of face for a party which thought that the city’s 81.86 per cent Hindus, most of them refugees, would get carried away by its justification of citizenship and otherisation politics. And a wave in its favour would cascade to States awaiting elections next year. Thankfully, Delhi has thinking Hindus. Of course, the BJP continues to be a national party in the absence of a federal front, though it is quickly losing its States to strong regional satraps and is now confined to only an odd 30 per cent of the map. This will mean a new paradigm of Centre-State relations where stronger States will form a phalanx and could bring in resolutions against Central policies or create hurdles in their implementation. And though AAP has revived its aspirational designs, with calls of “associate with AAP for nation building,” fact is the umbrella effort hasn’t worked for any regional party so far. Neither have federal leaders been able to project a mutually agreed upon national face. They have to agree on a first among equals at some point. Which brings us to the Congress, pathetically down to four per cent of the votepie from nine in 2015. While it may claim it wilfully underplayed itself to defeat the BJP, fact is its vote shifted to the BJP as the AAP held on to its figure from last time. The time for its rebuild is over, it has now been relegated to becoming a C-team player, a realisation yet to dawn on its arrogant leaders. One doesn’t know if the Delhi vote of 2020 can be called historic or not but it certainly lauds the city’s exceptionalism in exceptionally turbulent times.

5,12-2-20,Goon attack at Gargi,"Were the girl students at DU college attacked simply for organising a fest celebrating diversity?

As our students continue the renewal process in society by asking questions of the establishment, they are being projected as the new threats to democracy. It isn’t surprising then that in the past three months, there has been a systematic assault on public universities and students ever since the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). As if the January 5 incident — where masked men entered the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and beat up teachers and students — was not enough, some goons allegedly molested girl students at Gargi college. Unidentified men gatecrashed the premises during their annual fest, which was themed on diversity, abusing, groping, molesting and harassing them. As if they were being punished and psyched out for encouraging liberal conversations with an assault where it hurt most, their dignity. Contributing to the horror was the mismanagement by the Delhi University (DU) Vice-Chancellor, the college administration and the police. What was most shocking was that the principal, herself a woman, underplayed the incident and asked the girls to leave if they felt “unsafe.” Such bigoted view of the principal is certainly neither enlightening, nor reassuring to students, who are being told to not practise what they learn, namely free speech, in campuses across the country. How many heads of institutions will abdicate their responsibility now?

The less said about the passive behaviour of the Delhi policemen, who were to ensure the safe conduct of the fest, the better. Looks like mute spectatorship is their practised drill now as they failed to seal the college premises and allowed hooligans to jump the gate even as the girls screamed for help. They did not even file a complaint until four days later. Although a probe into this matter has been ordered, what needs urgent redressal is how the goons sneaked into the campus without I-cards. The bigger question is: How do we ensure safety for women students who are being intimidated for being free-thinkers? No politics of divergence can justify the horror the girls underwent. When a woman’s honour becomes a political tool of negotiation, then we as a society are definitely not respecting her.

12,12-2-20,6L children administrated deworming medicine across Bokaro,"At least six lakhs children in the age group of 1 to 19 years were administered deworming medicine, under the National Deworming campaign on Monday. Under the campaign, there is a target to provide deworming medicine- Albendazole tablets (400 mg) to nearly eight lakhs children, informed Dr AK Pathak Civil Surgeon Bokaro.

“Those children who missed out the dose on Monday (10 February) will get it on a mop-up round on 17 February,” he added.

Aiming to improve health and nutrition-level of children across the district our health workers will provide medicines free of cost to all children during the mop-up rounds too. As worm infection adversely affects children's health in many ways. Worms consume nutrients from tissues of the human body, which leads to the deficiency of nutrients in children, hampering their mental and physical growth, said CS.

Albendazole is a safe deworming medicine for both children and adults.

This medicine makes the worm unconscious and their grip is loosened from the intestines and they come out of the body with faeces when it would be taken in powder form along with water or chewed dry, he said.

Children with excessive infection may experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration, stomach pain and fatigue, after consumption of the medicine. Such situations can be easily managed by school teachers or Aanganwadi workers, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/6l-children-administrated-deworming-medicine-across-bokaro.html
13,12-2-20,"Psychiatrists, counsellors start lending a helping hand to school students","With ICSE and CBSE examinations about to begin and kicking-off of State board’s matric and intermediate exams, students are bound to pile on themselves additional mental pressure to prepare for them. Games, movies, television and other leisure activities are stopped for the preparations of examinations. Students are not found at cinema houses, restaurants and other places of entertainment during the examination days.

While CBSE has started its online counselling for students from February 1, several city- based organisations are helping students cope with stress this board exam season.

Gurpreet Kaur, deputy director, 'Jeevan', city-based suicide prevention centre said that the centre has shared the soft copies of posters of do's and don'ts during exams with all the schools. They have the printed ones at their centre too in case they want the hard copies.

“We have also requested all the schools to share our contact numbers 9297777499/ 9297777500 with the students through their messaging system and request them to contact us immediately in case they feel stressed. The centre has also shared the soft copy of a letter to parents in which there are certain guidelines on how to keep the home environment stress free so that their children can perform better.

All this might turn out to be a frightening experience but doctors advise following a normal routine to avoid the added stress when exams are on one’s doorstep. Extra stress and mental pressure adds to the anxiety of the little learners and may result in slip-ups during the finals.

Father Pius Fernandes, principal, Loyola School advises students to take care of their health during the exam preparations and follow a normal routine during this period. Parents should play a supportive role at this stage.

“Examinations are for everyone and have a well-defined role in a person’s life. Students should be motivated by their parents and not overburdened by the pressure to perform. Emphasise on building confidence and help their children succeed,” said the principal.

“One must try to maintain one’s usual daily routine and not refrain from refreshment and relaxation. Anything in continuity can be hazardous. Make exams a part of life, break the silence and never treat it as an unusual phenomenon taking place. Live life and do well,” advised a psychiatrist to the students studying for the boards this year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/psychiatrists--counsellors-start-lending-a-helping-hand-to-school-students.html
14,12-2-20,NML signs MoU with Firozabad firm for e-waste recycling,"CSIR- National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur and UNQ. IND. PVT. LTD., Firozabad inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to boost cooperation in the sector of e-waste recycling. NML signed an MoU for technology transfer for the extraction of cobalt metal/ salt from black powder of lithium batteries. MoU transfer took place in presence of the company's director, Anuj Kumar Garg and RK Rathor along with Dr. Indranil Chattoraj, director NML, Sanjay Kumar, head MER Division, Dr. Manis Kumar Jha, senior principal scientist & project leader, Jhumki Hait, principal scientist.

On this occasion, Garg expressed satisfaction and was also very much excited for this part to extract cobalt from waste mobile phone batteries. He said soon they will start the process on ton scale in association of NML. Dr. Manis Kumar Jha, senior principal scientist of CSIR-NML, Jamshedpur said that NML has expertise in developing feasible technologies to treat electronic waste being generated in huge quantity. He marked that NML is ready with different technologies and wished to enhance and explore more potential in the area of e-waste recycling so as to enhance its societal uses in health, agriculture, industrial application, training and exchange of knowledge. Director NML, Dr. Indranil Chattoraj was very happy to express his feeling as NML has transferred more than 10 technologies in very short period and said much more is expected in recent times. The transfer of MoU was mentioned to be a great step towards the ""Swachhata Abhiyan"" and each team member was very much proud to be a part of this 'abhiyan'.

Both sides agreed to further explore more possibilities for collaboration in areas of electronic waste recycling.

Huge generation of mobile phone batteries, its rudimentary disposal, improper collection system as well as lack of cost-effective processing technology has resulted in loss of valuables encapsulated in it. No effective technologies exist at present within the country for safe recycling of electronic waste in the industry. In this regard, CSIR- National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur has made sincere efforts towards the ecological recovery of cobalt and other valuable metals from the black powder and other constituents of LIBs.

But heterogeneous nature of variety of batteries (branded, local and cheaper) received from the municipal waste put forward a great challenge during the technology development.

The active cathode materials of LIBs contain variable concentration of cobalt, lithium, copper, manganese, etc. which make the chemical processes for metal recovery more complex. But the hydrometallurgical route adopted by the CSIR-NML team is very selective and exigent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nml-signs-mou-with-firozabad-firm-for-e-waste-recycling.html
15,12-2-20,CM stresses need for awareness on women empowerment,"Stressing the need for making people aware about women empowerment and safety at local level, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the State Commission for Women (SCW) should form a committee at the grassroots level and formulate a strong action plan.

Yogi said SCW should also make people aware of women-related schemes run by the government so that women empowerment campaign could be taken to a new height.

The Chief Minister was addressing a women’s awareness programme organised by UP State Commission for Women at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow on Tuesday.

Yogi said that the Commission had several tasks to perform in the context of Uttar Pradesh. “If the Commission can connect with the awareness programmes, our strength can increase manifold and questions on female safety can be put to rest,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that each family should have toilets under ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ as it was important for health as well as for women’s dignity.

“Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was successfully implemented across the country by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also, our government has integrated 1090 helpline numbers with ‘Dial 112’ and if a woman calls the number, she can get immediate help anywhere,” the Chief Minister said.

Yogi said that there should be no discrimination between boys and girls in the state and awareness should be created over this. He said that UP government was in the process of forming 218 Fast Track Courts to curb crime against women in the state.

A total of 74 such fast-track courts are related to POCSO Act (for crime against women and children),” the CM said.

Yogi said that the government has been successful in punishing criminals involved in crimes against women during the last six months.

“Besides, district magistrates and superintendents of police have been directed to meet with district judges and identify women-related crimes. This will help in punishing the culprits in a time-bound manner by taking them to fast-track courts,” he said.

Yogi said that these were some of the steps taken by the state government to instill fear in the minds of criminals.

Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, UP ministers Mahendra Singh & Suresh Khanna, Lucknow mayor Sanyukta Bhatia, chairperson of UP State Commission for Women Vimla Batham, and chairperson of women’s commissions of various states were present at the function.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-stresses-need----for-awareness-on----women-empowerment.html

Raju took the girl to his house where he raped her and later strangled her to death. He later put her body into a sack and covered it with a bucket. The victim’s parents were not at home when the incident took place. When the parents returned and found their daughter missing, they started searching for her. When the victim’s uncle enquired from Raju about the child, he became nervous and rushed into his house. The child’s parents followed him in and found her slippers lying in the courtyard.

17,12-2-20,BJP MLA accused of raping widow,"Yet another Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Bhadohi MLA Ravindranath Tripathi caused major embarassment to the ruling dispensation when he, along with six aides, was accused of raping a widow. Police claimed to have received a complaint and were probing its veracity before initiating any action.

Earlier, BJP MLA from Bangarmau (Unnao) Kuldeep Sengar and former Union minister Swami Chinmiyanand were accused of rape and sexual assault. Police officer Ram Badan Singh said: “The woman, whose husband died in 2007, met Ravindranath Tripathi’s nephew in 2014. She alleged in her complaint that she was physically exploited by him for the next several years on the promise of marriage.”

“The complainant further said that the MLA’s nephew lodged her at a Bhadohi hotel for about a month during the 2017 UP Assembly polls, where she was raped by the MLA and his aides,” Singh added.

The complaint has now been handed over to the Additional SP for investigations. A number of BJP MLAs and even Cabinet ministers have earlier been accused and booked for rape and other sexual offences.

Among people who have been accused but not convicted as yet are Swami Chinmayanand, Bhojpal Singh, Venkatesh Maurya and Nihal Chand. Others like Kuldeep Singh Sengar, Vijay Jolly, BJP corporator Bhosale, Hamid Sardar and Pramod Gupta were accused and convicted of rape.

Sources said that the recent rape charge against the BJP MLA came just ahead of the Budget Session of UP Assembly and the opposition would use it as a weapon to corner the ruling party on law and order.

After the accused murdered the victim’s father, senior officers suspended the local station house officer and outpost incharge to save themselves the blushes.

As per reports, the victim was raped by Aazhman Upadhyay in Tilak Nagar area of North Kotwali in August last year. But Upadhyay evaded arrest and had been on the lam ever since.

After he dished out another threat on February 1, the family filed another complaint with the police, but even then no action was taken against the accused. No police protection was provided to the family either.

The police claimed that they failed to locate the criminal and sought attachment of his property and executed it recently. However, on Monday night, the girl’s father was shot dead near his house.

To set the records straight, SSP of Ferozabad Sachind Patel suspended three policemen for laxity.

19,12-2-20,Power Corporation Trust moves NCLT to recover dues from DHFL,"Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Contributory Provident Fund Trust moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover dues from Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). The Trust, which manages the provident fund of employees of Power Corporation, claimed that the beleaguered non-banking lender owed it more than Rs 148 crore that it invested in DHFL’s fixed deposits.

The rip-off surfaced in November last year and the state government tasked the the Economic Offences Wing of UP Police with conducting the probe. So far, several officers of the power utility, including former MD AP Mishra, sharebrokers and DHFL employees, have been arrested.

The state government had also undertaken the guarantee to pay provident fund to power employees if the Trust failed to honour the obligation.

A separate application was filed by a group of deposit holders who sought release of their fixed deposits. A counsel representing the Trust and deposit holders told the tribunal that claims have been made with Committee of Creditors (COC) to DHFL through email apart from representations.

Meanwhile, UPPCL sources said that the two-member bench of NCLT, comprising judicial member Rajasekhar VK and technical member Ravikumar Duraisamy, had granted two weeks’ time to DHFL’s administrator to reply and directed the Trust to wait for the CoC’s decision.

The sources said that DHFL’s administrator, however, sought more time to respond. The DHFL informed the tribunal that the next meeting of creditors may be held this month. The dispute stems from Bombay High Court and Debt Recovery Tribunal’s interim orders to hold repayment by home financier to its fixed depositors.

On November 20, Reserve Bank of India had superseded the Board of DHFL in light of governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations. The RBI also appointed ex-MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank R Subramaniakumar as administrator of DHFL. The government had accorded RBI the power to appoint administrator in the last Union Budget. DHFL is one of the biggest defaulters in the country that owes almost Rs 1 lakh crore (over $14 billion) to its debtors.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/power-corporation-trust----moves-nclt-to-recover----dues-from-dhfl.html
20,12-2-20,Priyanka’s visit to Azamgarh causes discomfort to Akhilesh,"The proposed visit of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Azamgarh on Wednesday has caused discomfort to the Samajwadi Party as Azamgarh is the Lok Sabha constituency of party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

On February 5, the Azamgarh police had booked 135 people for sedition naming 30 of them in FIRs for protesting against the CAA. Besides, 20 people were arrested, including an Ulema Council leader.

The SP chief has been on the receiving end of local people’s ire over his protracted absence from the constituency and posters have been pasted on walls across the city questioning Akhilesh’s absence in the wake of the recent police crackdown on anti-CAA protesters.

The SP contested the 2017 Assembly polls in alliance with Congress and Priyanka had negotiated seat-sharing with Akhilesh. Ignoring the objections by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, the SP chief had left over 107 seats for the Congress.

Priyanka will be visiting SP’s pocket burrough Azamgarh to meet people who suffered due to the police brutality during the recent anti-CAA protests on Wednesday.

Protesters, including women, in Bilariyaganj area of Azamgarh were injured after police cane-charged them to disperse the anti-CAA protests.

Earlier, Priyanka had visited families of the victims of anti-CAA protesters who died in police firing in Meerut, Bijnore and Ferozabad while Akhilesh had sent a party delegation to those families with a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as compensation.

“It’s a futile exercise by Priyanka and she will draw a blank as people are aware of the designs of the Congress and BJP. If she is so concerned about people’s welfare, she should visit the Congress-ruled Rajasthan where close to 100 children died in a government hospital in Kota,’’ SP spokeswoman Rajendra Chaudhary said.

As per a Congress party release, Priyanka will reach Azamgarh on February 12 and meet people who were booked and manhandled by the police for participating in protests against CAA in Bilariaganj area of Azamgarh last week.

Her visit is being seen as an attempt to strengthen the party base in the SP stronghold after posters claiming Akhilesh as ‘missing’ were put up by workers belonging to the minority cell of Congress last week.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka---s-visit-to----azamgarh-causes--discomfort-to-akhilesh.html

24,12-2-20,Chandigarh push for green mobility in tricity,"In order to promote green mobility, as many as 1000 CNG (compressed natural gas) auto rickshaws each from Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana will ply in the tricity area under a reciprocal agreement.

The decision was taken at the meeting of Transport Secretaries of Chandigarh Administration, State Governments of Punjab and Haryana held under Manoj Parida, Advisor to UT Administrator on Tuesday.

During the meeting, the UT Administration pushed for plying of green vehicles in the tricity area including Chandigarh, Panchkula (Haryana) and Mohali (Punjab).

Initially, a proposal to mutually allow additional 500 CNG autos for entry in Chandigarh from Punjab was agreed in principal. The issue was raised as the Administration demanded ban on diesel autos in the tricity area.

The three stakeholders decided that the data of all these CNG autos will be shared by the three authorities amongst themselves for Police Checking.

The Administration also requested Haryana Government to open more CNG pumps in Panchkula to reduce the crowd of autos at CNG pumps of Chandigarh.

At present, Haryana-registered auto rickshaws are not allowed to enter Chandigarh for ferrying passengers. And, around 500 auto rickshaws registered with Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA) in Mohali, are allowed to enter Chandigarh.

UT Advisor Manoj Parida said green vehicles will be encouraged in the tricity area. The movement of 1000 CNG autos each from three stakeholders will be allowed on reciprocal basis in the tricity of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali, he said.

Apart from this, the issue of exemption of payment on state road tax on tricity busses was discussed wherein both the states have agreed in principal regarding exemption of tax.

Notably, this was a long pending issue for the UT Administration. The Administration was not charging road tax on other States Transport Vehicles but it was forceD to pay tax to Haryana Government.

At the meeting, Haryana Government has agreed in principle to allow exemption of payment on state road tax to buses of Chandigarh Transport Undertaking.

Punjab Government also agreed to the proposal of UT Administration regarding permitting the school buses from Chandigarh to the entire district of Mohali, instead of only Mohali city limits.

The meeting was attended by UT Adviser Manoj Parida, UT Transport Secretary AK Singla, Punjab Principal Secretary Transport Umashanker, Haryana Additional Secretary Transport, Virender Singh, SSP Traffic Shashank Anand.

Committee of Director Transport constituted

During the meeting, a committee of Director of Transport Department of Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana has been constituted to look into the issue of entry free of Ola and Uber cabs in Chandigarh.

Apart from this, the committee will also examine the proposal of uniform speed limits on the artery roads connecting to Chandigarh.

Notably Uber and Ola drivers had on Monday called off their strike after 11 days following assurance from the Chandigarh Administration that their demand regarding rationalisation of permit and entry fees across the tricity will be looked into.

The cab drivers had gone on strike on January 30 after State Transport Authority started challaning vehicles, not registered in Chandigarh, that didn’t have entry fee receipts.

The Administration had recently allowed the drivers to clear the dues for remaining seven quarters by March 31.

The drivers had on Monday also agreed to pay outstanding entry fee of two quarters - Rs 2,000 per taxi to the STA by February 15.

The other demands of cab drivers include tax should be same for tricity of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula, base fare for ride (0-5 km) should be reserved as Rs 100 and for further ride Rs 15 per km, it should be given to driver, waiting charges (during jam and others) should be Rs 5 per minute, daily allowance should be Rs 2000 per day for outstation and should be given to drivers, no parking fee at public places for cabs, parking space should be arranged for cabs at public places, pick up should not be given more than 2 km, driver insurance should be done by companies, increment policy among others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chandigarh-push-for-green-mobility-in-tricity.html
25,12-2-20,Transport Dept launches special drive to check filthy songs,"To curb the use of video or audio clips glorifying drugs and gun culture in buses plying across the State, Punjab Transport Department carried out a five-day special drive challaning 212 buses.

“The special drive was launched from February 7 to 11, 2020, on the directive of the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, during which all the Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) held meetings with transporters, sensitizing them about the ill-effects of playing obscene or vulgar songs on the psyche of youngsters,” said a spokesperson of the Chief Minister’s Office on Tuesday.

The spokesperson said that all the stakeholders were sensitized that such things encourage youngsters to go astray and succumb to the growing violence and gun culture being propagated through such filthy songs.

The teams also emphasized the need to educate the drivers and conductors to refrain from such unhealthy practices, which blatantly pollute our glorious culture.

During the drive, in all 509 buses were checked, of which 212 were found violating such norms and challaned.

The spokesperson further disclosed that such campaigns would be vigorously carried out frequently in future also and special instructions had already been issued to the Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDMs) and RTAs’ secretary to address this issue on top priority during their routine checking.

They had also been asked to send monthly reports in this regard, added the spokesperson.

It may be recalled that Captain Amarinder Singh had expressed deep concern over the growing trend of propagating violence and gun culture in Punjabi songs.

Reiterating his Government’s firm commitment, the Chief Minister has directed the Transport Department to further intensify its efforts against playing obscene or vulgar songs in buses, as these are not only detrimental to our rich culture but also cause a distraction to the driver, resulting in unsafe driving and endangering the lives of people.

Notably, the Punjab Police has recently booked Punjabi singers Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu (Sidhu Moose Wala) and Mankirat Aulakh for propagating violence through a video clip uploaded on social media.

Likewise, showing zero-tolerance against films instigating youngsters to take up arms and disturb peace and harmony, Capt Amarinder also ordered a ban on the screening of movie ‘Shooter’ which is based on the life of the notorious gangster Sukha Kahlwan.

Subsequently, the Punjab Police also registered a case against producer or promoter KV Singh Dhillon and others for allegedly promoting violence, heinous crimes, gangsterism, drugs extortion, threats, and criminal intimidation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/transport-dept-launches-special-drive-to-check-filthy-songs.html

33,12-2-20,Punjab AAP celebrates part's victory in Delhi,"The reverberations of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) victory celebrations in the Delhi elections on Tuesday was felt in Punjab, with the party’s state unit receiving the much-needed boost to resurrect itself after virtually disintegrating into pieces following infighting.

The state’s principal opposition party even now, AAP in Punjab is now looking at setting its own house in order and to take on the Congress head-on. At the same time, the party is throwing its door open for those “misguided” leaders to return to the party fold.

But besides the much-need boost, the party needs much more than that. It needs to combat the power struggles, unabated infighting, splits, desertions disarrayed organizational structure, and empowering the local leadership.

Punjab is the only state after Delhi where AAP has managed to emerge as one of the major political force. However, after its unpredicted entry into Punjab politics with four Lok Sabha seats in 2014, the party has failed to keep up the momentum over all these years.

From four seats in 2014, the party has come down to just one in 2019 parliamentary polls. In assembly elections too, AAP could not live up to the expectations of the people. Positive to form the government, the party could win just 20 seats in 2017 elections, ending up as the main opposition party in 117-member House, with Congress emerging as the single largest party with 77 seats.

The only encouraging point is that the party had pushed the SAD-BJP combine, which had ruled Punjab for 10 years in a row, to the third spot with 15 seats for the Akali Dal and just three for the saffron party.

However, after that the party continued to disintegrate with little patience, facing defeat after defeats in by-elections. All its candidates, except the state party unit chief Bhagwant Mann, lost their security deposits.

“This is not the right way to look at it…It has to be seen in different dimensions. Everyone said that AAP came down from four to one, but AAP also rose from zero to 20 in 2017 elections, while SAD came down from 56 to just 15. BJP, which was 12 in 2012, came down to just three five years’ after,” argued AAP’s senior leader Aman Arora.

Arora, who is also Sunam MLA, maintained that the party’s win in Delhi is a “big advantage” for us in Punjab. “Under the guidance of Arvind Kejriwal, we would make a new beginning here and we will work more actively, raising people-centric and Punjab-specific issues, so that we can save Punjab in 2022,” he added.

It was after AAP’s 2015 Delhi win that the party received groundswell support in Punjab. Now with AAP’s another resounding victory in the national capital, the party’s somewhat dispirited cadre is expecting to be galvanized to secure a possible win in the next assembly election.

In fact, the Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar minced no words to underscore that a win in Delhi would mean that the people of Punjab may give “another chance” to AAP. “AAP has been rocked by dissensions and desertions for a long time and I have my doubts whether AAP leaders will be able to get their act together and make something of it,” Jakhar had said a day before.

Another senior AAP leader, requesting anonymity, maintained that the party has to “put its house in order first, and in fact, we need to start right now to make a mark in 2022”.

“Desertions and dissidence within has affected the party a lot, and we have seen that in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. We have to come together, stand united, to throw these traditional political parties, Congress, SAD and BJP, which are fooling people by playing fixed matches,” said the leader.

Arora said that there are some leaders who were misguided by others, and we would be happy to welcome them back. “Those leaders who are standing and agreeing with the principles of Arvind Kejriwal and that of AAP, those who take party’s and people’s interest first, are still under the same banner…Those who have been misguided by others…they will also understand that it is also better to stay within the party,” he added.

In a veiled message to the disgruntled and those who have left the party, Arora maintained that we are working under Kejriwal’s leadership, and “all the state’s specific decisions will be taken by the party’s Punjab unit as it is competent enough…I believe that now, many people will themselves come under the party’s umbrella soon”.

Political observers believed if AAP managed to plan its strategy right, the party could be a tough nut to crack in 2022 elections, especially at a time when the Congress Government is under attack from all sides for its failure to fulfill its pre-poll promises.

On the other hand, SAD is also passing through its worst political phase with former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal virtually hanging his boots, and the senior leaders deserting the sinking ship. BJP, at the same time, is struggling to maintain its hold.

Even as the SAD has all along been maintaining that the next state assembly polls would be a direct contest between Akali Dal and the Congress, it would not be right to sideline AAP as it could best fit in the political vacuum being created in Punjab. And all it needs is a better strategy.

“We need to start afresh…bring everyone together. Plan things accordingly…and keep raising people’s issues as this is what the AAP in Delhi has done. We will continue to raise people’s issues, Punjab’s issues just like we raised the issues of illegal mining, costly power and power agreements with private thermal plants,” said Arora.

He said that Delhi results have sent a message to the leaders of all parties that people will vote for development — be it education, water or electricity. “After Delhi, AAP is strong in Punjab. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has adopted the path of his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal but the people of Punjab want development and a positive environment in the State. AAP will form the next government in the state,” added Arora.

Party’s state political affairs committee member Harchand Singh Barsat said that AAP would replicate the Delhi model in Punjab in the 2022 assembly election. “AAP’s unprecedented victory has sent out a message loud and clear across the country that the elected governments would have to work harder to bettering education, health care, cheaper electricity, safety and security of women, et al,” he said.

Hailing the victory, the Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema said that it was the victory of good over the evil forces. “The people of the country have rejected the politics of hatred peddled by the BJP and voted for the Kejriwal government’s development agenda,” he said.

Other than Delhi, AAP has experimented with electoral contests in assembly polls only in the states of Haryana and Punjab. In Haryana, AAP remained non-existential and drew a complete blank in the recently concluded assembly elections.

VICTORY CELEBRATIONS IN PUNJAB TOO

The victory slogans of AAP’s win in Delhi was heard loud and clear in Punjab too with the party workers and leaders celebrating the resounding successive victory in the national capital.

The party workers in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Chandigarh, Hoshiarpur, Bathinda and other places were seen dancing to the dhol beats and distributing sweets.

As trends were showing AAP’s victory in Delhi, party workers gathered outside Bhagwant Mann’s Sangrur office and started raising slogans in favour of Arvind Kejriwal and the MP.

“We are celebrating the party’s victory by holding a march in the town. Now, the AAP will win in Punjab in 2022,” said Narinder Kaur Bharaj, an AAP youth leader.

AAP’s Doaba zone president Tarundeep Sunny said the unprecedented victory of the party in Delhi polls will transform the political scenario across the country.

The people of Delhi have for the third time reposed their faith in Kejriwal after witnessing good governance during a small stint of rule of only 49 days in 2013 which helped the party to come to power with a thumping majority winning 67 seats in the 70 member Delhi Vidhan Sabha in 2015.

This time the party not only struck a hat-trick, but returned to power again with the thumping majority winning 63 seats leaving only seven for the main rival BJP.

AAP hopeful of forming govt in Punjab in 2022: Mann

AAP’s star campaigner and Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday said that party’s victory in the Delhi assembly elections by a thumping margin was a historic day in Indian democracy and they are hopeful of forming government in Punjab in 2022.

“People of Delhi have voted for the Arvind Kejriwal model of governance. They accepted his development agenda and gave their mandate to AAP. Though the BJP tried to play divisive politics in the name of Hindus and Muslims, the voters rejected hate politics,” he said.

Downplaying Congress’ repeat of 2015 humiliation in Delhi Assembly polls, Punjab Cabinet Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot on Tuesday termed the election results as “BJP's defeat” in Delhi and not of the Congress.

Dharamsot, reacting on poll results, said that his party was not defeated in the Delhi election as its tally remained at zero like in 2015, and so it was the BJP’s loss.

“We were zero earlier, and this time too we are zero. So it's not our defeat. It's a defeat for the BJP,” he told the reporters referring to the election trends which gave the Congress no seat in the Delhi assembly election.

The Congress had not won even a single seat in the 2015 Assembly polls too.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-aap-celebrates-part-s-victory-in-delhi.html

37,12-2-20,SCPCR holds meet with CBSE schools’ representatives,"The State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) held the meeting with representatives of several CBSE schools on Tuesday regarding the anomalies in the schools resulting from lack of awareness.

Several significant issues were discussed in the meeting which was attended by the chairperson of SCPCR, Usha Negi, the director of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Jharna Kamthan chief education officer Asha Rani Painuly and various teachers and principals of CBSE schools.

One of the major issues was the lack of the fulfilment of the right of children to free and compulsory education under the RTE Act by most of the schools. Under the Act, every school has to give admissions to at least 25 per cent of students who live Below Poverty Line (BPL) for which the central government pays the schools.

However, most of the schools manage to give admissions only to nine per cent students in spite of the central government paying them for 25 per cent quota of students. Therefore schools were told to complete their target of giving admissions to the said percentage or the government will stop paying schools. The chairperson of SCPCR also talked about the harassment of students who take admission under the RTE Act and instructed the schools to be more sensitive and responsible toward every student.The hiring of at least one special educator in every school had been made compulsory by CBSE in 2017 so that schools do not deny admission to any handicapped student. However, there are only a few schools that have appointed special educators; therefore SCPCR has instructed schools to appoint the said educators. The schools were also instructed to hire a psychology teacher and to form a POCSO committee so that children can easily approach the administration regarding any problems. The schools were instructed to equip the school buildings with appropriate fire safety measures too. The other issues include schools running without affiliation and No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the government, exclusion of NCERT books from syllabus, and schools not working as per the guidelines of CBSE and the Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scpcr-holds-meet-with-cbse-schools----representatives.html

40,12-2-20,Cabinet nod to free treatment of severe ailments,"The Cabinet on Tuesday gave its nod to ensuring treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh to people suffering from severe diseases such as cancer, kidney failure and liver disorders under the Mukhyamantri Gambhir Bimari Upchar Yojana (MMGBUY). However, the Government will bear the treatment cost of only those patients who belong to families that generated an income of less than Rs 8 lakh per annum for three consecutive years, Cabinet Secretary (In-Charge) Ajoy Kumar Singh said.

“All types of cancer will be covered under the scheme. Besides, patients in need of kidney transplant and the ones suffering from serious liver disorders will also be eligible for free treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh under the scheme,” said Singh. “The Government has tied up with 41 hospitals, including some of the most reputed hospitals from across the country, for this purpose,” he added.

The Cabinet on Tuesday also decided to provide free treatment to acid attack victims under the same scheme. However, there will be no upper limit for the cost of treatment in case of an acid attack victim undergoing treatment under the said scheme. “There will be no upper limit of Rs 5 lakh for acid attack victims undergoing treatment under the scheme. The Government will bear all the expenses of treatment even if it exceeds Rs 5 lakh,” said Singh.

A district level committee headed by the concerned Civil Surgeon will have the independent authority over releasing the treatment cost for patients who fall in the eligibility criteria. The committee, Singh said, will also have representation of a local MLA or his appointed representative. “The income certificate will have to be issued by the Circle Officer and produced before the district level committee,” he added.

The amount will be transferred to the account of the hospital through Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) or a demand draft will be issued in favour of the concerned hospital. At present, only Ayushman Bharat Yojana of the Centre provides free treatment to patients in need of surgeries. However, the scheme only covers Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. The MMGBUY, on the other hand, comes as a major relief for the working professionals and smalltime businessmen in Jharkhand, most of who earn less than Rs 8 lakh in a year.

The 41 hospitals enlisted by the Government for the scheme include big names such as Apollo Hospital Kolkata, Fortis Hospital Kolkata and Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.

The Cabinet on Tuesday also decided to hold the Budget session from February 28 to March 28 and table the Budget on March 3. The Budget session will have 19 working days, and it will remain suspended in between due to Holi vacation. The Cabinet on Tuesday passed a total of five proposals.

It decided to disburse Rs 12.27 crore for payment to Central and State Security Forces deployed in Jharkhand during the 2019 Assembly elections.

43,12-2-20,CM hails AAP victory in Delhi,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren congratulated Arvind Kejriwal on the victory of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi Assembly election the results of which was announced today. In the Assembly election, the AAP won 62 seats, the BJP which planning to make a comeback lost heavily. Despite BJP star campaigners jumping in campaigning for party candidates, BJP managed to win only eight seats. The Congress party which had ruled the State for maximum years failed to even open its account in Assembly election.

Soren speaking to media persons here, said that the victory of AAP was certain and now it will propel positive politics in the country.

Taking a jibe on another defeat of the BJP, Soren said had the BJP leaders would have put same energy in work rather than campaigning in Delhi assembly elections, the results would have been different.

On the question of the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi elections by the Health and Education model, Hemant Soren said that the party won because of such policies of Chief Minister Kejriwal.

He said that good things always happen in the world and at the same time other states should not hesitate in adopting such policies and models.

The defeat of BJP in Delhi Assembly election is second electoral defeat within two months.

BJP which was yet to recover from Jharkhand Assembly election rout, the Delhi results is an alarm bell for introspection of BJP. Former BJP leader and two-time Finance Minister of India, Yashwant Sinha took to Twitter to take dig jibe at his 'ex' and say, ""Congratulations to my old party. They have more than doubled their tally in Delhi state assembly elections. Sterling performance.""

Sinha the former MP from Hazaribag had served as India's Finance Minister from 1990 to 1991 under Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and from 1998 to 2002 under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Yashwant Sinha is also father of Hazaribag sitting MP Jayant Sinha.

47,12-2-20,Forest economics training begins at FRI,"Officers of the Indian Economic Services are undergoing training on forest economics at the Forest Research Institute (FRI) here. Inaugurating the training FRI director AS Rawat spoke on the history of scientific forestry and forest research in India.

He told the participants about organisational structure of Forest Research Institute and Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education. He emphasised that natural forests should be kept for providing ecosystem services and protection. Only salvage felling is allowed in natural forests in most of the forest areas.

The demand of commercial and industrial wood should be met from trees outside forest. Referring to the tangible and intangible benefits provided by forests to mankind, he said that the tangible benefits include timber, fuel wood, fodder and non wood forest products which are measurable and directly used by the people.

The intangible benefits are not directly measurable, which are realised without extracting re­sources from the forest, and are further divided into two subcategories: ecosystem services, such as soil and water protection, biodiversity, and climate modulation; and preservation values, which refers to the value that people place on preserving forests in their present state.

Recreational or cultural uses of forests can have extractive value (such as hunting and fishing), non-extractive value (such as bird watching and hiking for re­laxation and spiritual renewal).

According to FRI scientists, forest economics deals more narrowly with choices about how for­ests are managed and used; how other factors of production like labour and capital are used in forest production, utilisation, and con­servation; and what and how much forest products are produced and marketed. Forest economics applies the discipline of economics to deci­sion making in forestry and covers the whole forest sector. To enlighten the participants on the issue lectures of subject experts from Forest Departments of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand, Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi, Centre Academy for State Forest Service, Dehradun, Wildlife Institute of India and FRI will be delivering talks during the training which will conclude on February 14.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/forest-economics-training-begins-at-fri.html
48,12-2-20,"Southco, RD dept blame each other","Two days after 10 persons were killed and 30 others injured when a bus came in contact with live 11-KV wire at Mendarajpur in the Golanthara area in Ganjam district, the Southco and the Rural Development (RD) Department have started blaming each other for the mishap, adding much to the agony of victims’ families and local people as well.

While the injured persons are now fighting for their lives in hospitals, mere suspension of four engineers i.e. two from each department is not suffice but a sheer eye wash, said an aggrieved local man who did not wish to be identified.

Addressing a Press meet, Bharatiya Bikash Parishad (BBP) State president Surendra Panigrahi and senior CPI(M) leader Ali Kishore Pattnaik demanded that the AO and CEO of Southco are immediately arrested for their negligence.

Panigrahi demanded that an FIR be lodged immediately at the Golanthara police station against the concerned engineers, including the Chief Engineer and the Southco MD and more compensation be paid to victims’ families by the both the Government and the Southco.

The documentary evidence clearly shows that the Executive Engineer of the RD Department appears to be responsible for the tragedy. According to information, the Executive Engineer of the Southco in its letter No 1272 (4) issued on July 4, 2018, addressed to the EE of the RD Department, had expressed serious concern as to how the road widening work from Mendrajpur to Dankalpadu and village Manikpur under Kanisi and Golanthara Electrical sections was undertaken without intimating the Southco authorities. Due to such widening work, the poles of existing 11-KV lines came to the middle of the road, posing threat for lives of road users, the letter read.

Even the said letter reveals further that the Southco had submitted an estimate to the RD Department for shifting and re-erection of the existing 3p-3w 11 KV OH line and a 63-KVA DP mounted 11/0.4 KV substation (without transformer) from middle of the road to the roadside to which the EE of the RD Department did not pay any heed.

Besides, the Southco gave an option to the RD Department to carry out the pole shifting and erection work by any authorised electrical contractor by depositing only six per cent of the total cost towards supervision charges. To this also, the RD Executive Engineer remained as a mute spectator.

When contacted, the Southco CEO said that if the NHRC gives a directive to pay compensation, the Southco would certainly consider such an order on humanitarian ground.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/southco--rd-dept-blame-each-other.html
49,12-2-20,CAMPA: Odisha forest area has increased by 274 sqkm,"The investment under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) has yielded good result in the State with an increase of forest area by 274 sqkm during last two years as per India State of Forest Report (ISFR), a biennial publication of Forest Survey of India.

This was known in a State-level Steering Committee Authority of CAMPA held under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy here on Tuesday wherein Additional Chief Secretary Dr Mona Sharma outlined the issues for discussion.

CAMPA Chief Executive Officer Uma Nanduri said, “As per ISFR- 2019, the forest area in Odisha has increased by 274 sqkm within the year 2017 to 2019. Besides, the tree cover area has also increased by 655 sqkm. Odisha has been projected as a lead State in different parameters of forest management and has been placed at 6th position at the national level.”

“This has been possible because of different initiatives and projects taken under CAMPA,” said PCCF Sandeep Tripathy.

Chief Secretary Tripathy directed officials to focus on effective implementation of wildlife management plan and growth of biodiversity. He also directed the Forest & Environment Department to enhance mangrove forest coverage in Bhitarkanika.

The committee approved the Annual Action Plan of 2020-21 with a total outlay of Rs 803.65 crore. The major activities include block plantation, assisted natural regeneration, bald hill plantation, maintenance of previous year’s plantation, fodder and fruit-bearing plantation, bamboo culture, wildlife management, etc.

A target was set to undertake plantation in 1500 hectares of land at the rate of 1,600 plants per hectare during 2020-21. The issue of protection from forest fire also figured in the meeting. An amount of Rs 41.13 crore was approved for maintenance of fire protection line, operation of 216 fire protection squads and support to VSS for fire protection works.

Nanduri said, “As of now, a total forest area of 55,534.40 hectares has been diverted for different purposes in Odisha. Against this, 72,606.57 hectares have been stipulated for compensatory afforestation. Till September, 2019 afforestation was done in 64,135.27 hectares. The APO 2020-21 has planned for plantation in 4,355.35 hectares. The balance area of 4000 hectares will be planted in APO 21-22.”

PCCF Tripathy said, “DGPS survey of the entire forestland of 60,991 sqkm has been undertaken applying RS and GIS techniques. This has proved to be very useful in monitoring of forest area, wildlife and maintenance of different assets. The method has been accepted as a best practice at the national level and the Government of India has advised other States to emulate the model.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/campa--odisha-forest-area-has-increased-by-274-sqkm.html

51,12-2-20,Marandi announces JVM-BJP merger,"Having in denial mode for more than a month amidst speculations of merger of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) with BJP, JVM chief Babulal Marandi today announced the merger of his 14-year -old party with the saffron party.

Marandi announced the decision to merge JVM with the BJP on February 17, after the central committee meeting of the party unanimously approved the party's merger with the BJP. The merger of JVM with BJP will be big bash with a grand function at Sri Jagannath Maidan of State Capital in presence of BJP national president, JP Nadda, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP national general secretary Om Prakash Mathur among other senior leaders. Marandi has asked his party leaders and workers from Panchayat level, which is lowest level in organization to attend the JVM merger with BJP on February 17.

The JVM chief talking to media persons said, “At the working committee five resolutions were passed. The working committee today gave its nod for expulsion of former MLA Bandhu Tirkey and Pradeep Yadav from party. The two other resolutions which the party passed were giving nod to merger of JVM legislature party with BJP in Assembly and fourth the merger of party with BJP.” The JVM working committee also gave its nod for transfer of property of party with BJP.

Marandi claimed that most of the members at working committee gave their consent for merger of JVM with BJP.

Sources said that it will be a win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats.

The Saffron party’s debacle in tribal areas raised eyebrows of higher-ups in the BJP and they had made mind to amend the mistakes committed by projecting unpopular face in tribal areas. A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “The plot of JVM merger with BJP was going round for months. We were looking for a leader who could match the stature of Hemant Soren at the same time having a clean image in such a situation there was no bigger tribal leader than Marandi.”

Effable, suave and soft in nature, Babulal has been a loyalist of RSS and it seems to have paid him a rich dividend. He was felicitated with the coveted post of first CM of Jharkhand when it became a separate state on November 15, 2000. However, his stint as the CM could not last for a long time and he had to step down on March 17, 2003.

The BJP leader said, “After the merger of JVM with BJP, the saffron party will either give him the post of State president or leader of opposition in Assembly as BJP is yet to take any final decision on appointment of any leader in these two posts.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marandi-announces-jvm-bjp-merger.html

53,12-2-20,CM asks MLAs to have healthy debates in Assembly,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday urged all the legislators of the fifth Jharkhand Assembly to move beyond party divides and contribute towards productive functioning of the Assembly. Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a two-day training session for legislators in Project Building, Soren said that serving the people of the State should be paramount for every legislator irrespective of party lines, ideology and personal opinions.

“The Assembly is the largest Panchayat of the State. This is where all the decisions related to development of the State are taken. Being the leader of the house, I expect my fellow legislators to avoid disruptions in the Assembly sessions and participate in healthy debates over relevant topics,” Soren said.

The two-day training session for legislators, including ministers, is aimed at ensuring smoother functioning of the Assembly by sensitising the members of the house.

“Many of our legislators have several years of experience under their belt. Some legislators have made it to the Assembly for the first time. The training session, however, is equally helpful for experienced as well as newbie legislators,” said Assembly Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahato.

The Chief Minister on Tuesday said that higher strength in the Assembly does not give any political party the right to pass decisions that may not go down well with the common people or hurt the sentiments of any group.

The remark comes at a time when the opposition in the Centre is criticizing the ruling NDA Government for passing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) amid widespread protests.

“Having strength in the house does not entitle a party to pass decisions that may have negative impact on the masses or a group. The opposition has to play a crucial role in the Assembly for smooth and productive functioning of the house,” he said.The first Assembly session under the current Government was held on January 6 in the old Vidhan Sabha building this year. The current State Assembly has 29 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) legislators, 16 Congress party MLAs, one Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLA, 25 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs, three Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) MLAs and the remaining seven are independent candidates.

At present, there are 11 ministers in the State Cabinet including Chief Minister Hemant Soren. The tripartite alliance of JMM, Congress party and RJD dethroned the former BJP Government here by crossing the magic figure of 41 in the Assembly. Results for the Assembly elections were declared on December 23 last year.

Training and sensitization of legislators has been a regular practice in Jharkhand. Some former Governments also planned to rope in premiere B schools such as the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) for imparting trainings to the legislators here. Some legislators have made it to the State Assembly for the first time in the current Government, while many have decades of experience, sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-asks-mlas-to-have-healthy-debates-in-assembly.html
54,12-2-20,ASI terms Sun Temple photos ‘misleading’,"A day after multiple photos of the Sun Temple at Konark purportedly showing replacement of sculptures with plain stones surfaced on social media, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) issued a clarification in this regard saying that the images are “misleading”.

The images with sculptures are from the Natya Mandap of the temple while the photos showing plain stones are from the plinth of Jagamohana (the main temple), the ASI said.

The tweet regarding replacement of sculptures with plain stones is false and misleading, it said. The ASI further added that the plain stone work shown in the image was done in the mid-1980s. “ASI used plain stone only wherein there was no evidence left and as per ASI’s the then archaeological policy, only such portions were filled with plain stones. ASI would like to confirm that no sculpture has been replaced,” it said in a statement.

64,12-2-20,Soren stresses on solar power in State,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren continued his marathon review meetings of various departments on Tuesday and asked officials to complete works started in the year 2015 by March 31 this year.

Reviewing the works of Energy dept the CM asked officials to assess current and future needs of domestic and commercial use properly in the State. He asked to assess the infrastructure and transmission lines of the State and finish the works going on since 2015 by March 31 this year.

The CM asked officials to work more on electricity based on solar power. He asked them to stress on installing solar power units in toals, Panchayats and villages.

Soren said that works should be done by focusing on rural development. Under MGNREGA 100 days’ employment is guaranteed but now on an average 41 days employment is being given. This has to be taken to 100 days at any cost so that villagers could get employment, he added.

The CM expressed concern on the fact that under MGNREGA Jharkhand is getting less wages for labourers. “In Jharkhand the rate is RS 171, but many other states are getting more. A study can be done on this and a proposal should be sent to the Centre. Increasing wage payment would help increase the nutrition of labourers,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that food should reach every poor old and widow. When a person becomes disabled from work on the basis of age in the village, then it is our responsibility to reach him. The department should prepare such a scheme so that the needy can be linked to food security.

A review by the Finance and Commerce Tax Department emphasised increasing the State's revenue.

The Chief Minister said that strict action should be taken against those who evade taxes and keep government money in private account.

65,12-2-20,Suspense comedy drama ‘Thane Ki Raat’,"A suspense comedy drama ‘Thane ki ek Raat’, written by IPS Officer Sanjay Ranjan Singh is going to be staged in the State Capital on February 29 and March 1 under the aegis of the Department of Art and Culture, Jharkhand in association with Aparna Sewa Sansthan Samiti.

The play has been directed by Abhiraj Kumar, while popular television actor Jitendra Vadher will be seen playing the lead role of the ‘Thanedaar’.

Other prominent actors include Pooja Kumari who plays the Thanedaar’s wife and Shubhankar Kumar as the Chowkidaar.

Priyanshu Raj, Ravi Rao Ambedkar, Pragya Kumari and Chandan will also be seen in character roles.

“The play talks about a shocking incident. It states that while being in the police willingly or unwillingly how one tends to be a part of an untoward incident and how it hampers the day to day functioning of the police station. The story is basically based on these two streams,” said Singh.

The suspense comedy drama portrays the day to day functioning of a police station and shows how an untoward incident which takes place at the venue is handled by the officials.

“The story revolves around how during the course of an interrogation, when a custodial death takes place, how the entire incident is kept under cover and away from the senior officials as well as the media. How ‘Badabadu’ who is the Thanedaar along with the ‘Chotababu’ and the other officials tries to keep the incident away from the limelight,” said the director Kumar.

The director further added that the play shows how the officials strive to remove all traces of evidence and also the body of the victim. “In order to add humour to the play, it shows how everyone is lying and also trying to cover up for each other,” added Kumar.

Talking about the characters, Kumar stated that though ‘Chowkidaar is a person of a lower designation, he is one of the most important individual in a police station who knows the local language and the surrounding very well.

Kuma has directed previous plays like ‘Ketki’ in which he was also seen on stage. Vadher has been a part of television shows like Sawdhan India, Crime Patrol Haunted Nights and Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hain.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/suspense-comedy-drama----thane-ki-raat---.html
66,12-2-20,‘Talcher-B'grh rail link delay due to Govt apathy’,"The much-awaited rail link between Talcher and Bimalagarh is still neglected by both the State and the Union Governments, alleged the Talcher-Bimalagarh Rail Link Action Committee here.

According to committee president Adwaita Prasad Biswal, the demand for Talcher-Bimlagarh Rail link (TBRL) was initiated 53 years back. After much hue and cry and intensive public agitation, the project of 149.743 km was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2003-04 and the Railway Ministry decided to construct the rail line. But unfortunately, after 16 years, 50 percent of the land acquisition work is pending and the budgetary sanction to the project is very feeble in comparison to other projects, he told.

Biswal alleged that while last year budgetary sanction for the project was more than Rs 280 crore, but this year it got reduced to Rs 140 crore. Despite this, Biswal said he was sceptical about the expenditure of allocated money as there was sluggish move by the State Government for land acquisition.

He said still half of the land required was to be handed over by the State Government to the Railways. He further said while the State Government was working hard to provide land for Khurda-Balangir railway project free of cost but for the Talcher-Bimalgarh project, the Railways had already deposited money with the State Government for compensation against acquiring the land.

However, despite this there has been inordinate delay in land acquisition by the district administrations of Angul, Deogarh and Sundargarh.

He added that if the State Government and district administrations showed sincere interest to hand over the unused land of the Government then about 2/3rd required land would be acquired.

But despite the instructions from the Private Secretary of the CM to the concerned district Collectors, these works are not completed. On the other hand, taking the plea of land acquisition, the budgetary allocation by the Union Government has been reduced, Biswal lamented.

According to him after forest land clearance about 562 acres of private land and 163 acres of Government land acquisition was pending. He said though the project target was March, 2022, now it was extended to December, 2023.

Briefing on the project and further course of action noted tread union leader Bishnu Mohanty said the action committee would be making a coordination with the State Government to arrange a joint meeting of the three district administrations, railway authorities, people’s representative of the areas through which the rail line to be passed and the action committee members would make a target oriented guideline for early acquisition of land. Besides, the committee involving the local people will meet the three district Collectors to persuade them to acquire the land by March of this year and if they failed, then the action committee would resort to agitation.

Rourkela Steel Plant Executive Association president Bimal Bisi said with the completion of the rail project, the Rourkela Steel Plant would save about Rs 100 crore per year in transportation of coal.

It may be noted here that with the construction of the Talcher-Bimalagarh rail line, the rail distance between Rourkela and Cuttack will be shortened by 120 km. Among others, action committee members Harihar Routray, Rourkela Bar Association president Ramesh Bal, Biman Maity and Srimanta Behera were present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---talcher-b-grh-rail-link-delay-due-to-govt-apathy---.html

As part of its plan to place a sustained impetus on higher education over the next three decades, the State Government, helmed by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, has ensured the land security of all Government colleges in the State.

The land belonging to over 170 colleges has been transferred to them and land records have been appended accordingly.

Leveraging technology the State higher education department is ensuring the uninterrupted transmission of virtual classrooms.

Besides helping meet standardised academic and skill development objectives, virtual classrooms are especially beneficial for students in relatively smaller or backward centers.

Robust measures are also being implemented across all campuses to imbibe students with enhanced soft skills to heighten their employment prospects.

In a bid to promote e-governance and real-time communication and coordination across all centres, the department has also created email accounts for 6,500 Government officials and employees and launched a new Content Management System (CMS) based website.

Streamlining procedures, college admissions have been linked to the mponline portal of the State Government. Launched during the academic session 2019-20, the move had resulted in a total 5.35 lakh admissions in campuses across the State.

An internal grievance redressal system has been made available online for State Government employees while a separate online module has been put in place for college teachers to help them file and assess Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs).

In an endeavour to promote notable academic and research work conducted by teachers, the achievements of nearly 2,200 faculty members are being linked to the department portal under the Rajiv Gyan Jyoti Mission.

Bringing full transparency in the system for appointment of assistant professors, librarians and sports officers, the State Government has made the application process available online. Nearly 3,000 applicants have benefited from the move.

Drawing on the expertise and experience of retired faculty members, the higher education department is in the process of setting up consultative committees for colleges and universities under the Margdarshan Yojna.

The State Government has been entrusted with a fund of Rs 104 crore under the centrally sponsored Rashtriya Uchhattar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).

While the Aadarsh Mahavidyalaya has been dedicated to citizens in the tribal dominated Jhabua district, another seven such ideal campuses are under various stages of completion in the State.

The development of infrastructure for two universities and eight new college campuses has also been completed.

A fund of Rs 22 crore has been earmarked for improvement of infrastructure and enhancement of quality at 200 college campuses chosen for the purpose.

Heightening private participation in the higher education sector, four new private universities have been established. While two of these universities are based in the State capital, Bhopal, one each is located in Raisen and Jabalpur districts.

The State Government has initiated steps for the establishment of Knowledge Corporation Limited with a view to heighten quality in higher education and skill development initiatives.

In an attempt to motivate and promote better performance by colleges and faculty members, the higher education department will soon announce State level awards for excellence in higher education.

Decks have also been cleared for filling of faculty positions which have been lying vacant at colleges across the State.

Calling for an expansion and enhancement of higher education facilities, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has repeatedly underlined the need to ensure greater contributions from youth towards the creation of a happier, healthier and wealthier Madhya Pradesh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nath-push-for-higher-education-revamp.html
70,12-2-20,"Order passed by SC surprising, contrary to spirit of Constitution: CM","Chief Minister Kamal Nath has described order passed by Supreme Court in the case of Uttarakhand State Vs Mukesh Kumar on February 07, 2020 as surprising and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.

Kamal Nath said the denial of BJP ruled Uttarakhand State in not providing reservation in direct recruitment and promotion to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, exposes the double standards used by BJP and its true face among masses.

The action by BJP Government is reflection of reality they have towards Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The report by special committee constituted by Uttarakhand Government was also ignored in the case which had clearly stated that there is not enough representation of scheduled castes and tribes in the Government service in the State.

Despite the fact BJP Government opposed the reservation in the Supreme Court.

The working and thinking of BJP is against the interests of Dalit and tribals as it is constantly taking decisions against the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and is working against the sentiments of the Constitution.

In the constitution, Baba Saheb Ambedkar has given the right of reservation to strengthen the weaker sections socially, economically and link them to the mainstream of society.

The Congress party will not allow these provisions to be abolished under any circumstances. The Congress is committed to continue the reservation system.

The CM made it clear that the Madhya Pradesh Government is in favor of providing reservation in Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for this they would present their support strongly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/order-passed-by-sc-surprising--contrary-to-spirit-of-constitution--cm.html

“They said the Shaheen Bagh would feel shock but look now they are hiding away from the media after the shock,” Azad said, adding it was all power of democracy and the public but some people have forgotten this in autocracy.

Notably, Bhopal’s Iqbal Maidan is witnessing an anti-CAA protest since December 10.

Praising the Muslim women for taking forward the anti-CAA fight with courage, he said when I had visited Shaheen Bagh, he had told the women that a single Shaheen Bagh won’t do, we need 5,000 of them. Those who called them sisters during triple talaq are not able to hear their voices now.

The Delhi’s educated public has replied to the question whether the public is powerful or the government, he added. He assured the Muslims that he would not let anyone thrown away into detention camps.

Saying that Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2003 had formulated rules saying the NRC would be done through NPR. First they did notebandi and now they are set to snatch away your votes, alleged Azad a lawyer by profession.

The Bhim Army chief further claimed that those who won’t be able to prove their citizenship would be reduced to refugees without any constitutional rights. Your jobs, assets, education and everything would be snatched away, Azad warned Muslims and Dalits claiming 44 per cent Dalits have no land whatsoever so with Muslims, they would also be targeted with lack of papers so it was high time they put up a fight with Muslims.

Azad claimed that they (BJP) are apprehensive people adding that earlier they sought documents post 1971 and later the Home Minister backtracked saying documents of post 1947 would be acceptable and those born here need not worry.

He requested Kamal Nath government urging it to withdraw cases slapped on Dalits for April 2 agitation, act against Tikamgarh violence against Dalits and prevent excesses on Dalit government staffers in Madhya Pradesh.

“Now I am making a polite request but let me make it clear that I urge MP Gvernment to expand the jail in Bhopal as I would re-visit with a challenge if our demands are not met,” claimed the visiting leader who announced that on their legal intervention, the High Court in Uttar Pradesh has ordered FIRs on those responsible for deaths of 24 protesters recently.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ravan--public-power-was-on-exhibition-in-delhi-polls.html

Today, I was saved by my fellow brothers but next time I will burn myself when no one is around and only the state government will be responsible for my death.” “Tomorrow it will not be just Ravi but we all will immolate ourselves. If the government and the department will keep ignoring us then this is the only choice we have to bring our ministers and officials to their senses,” added Rahul Kumar, another protesting driver.

“The protesters are aggravated by the hollow assurances of the government and also at how we are being fooled by the traffic department. First, they set our routes and announced it through the media without discussing it with us and claimed it happened with our agreement.

Secondly, they gave us 31 routes to operate our e-rickshaws which were almost the same as before, except they reduced our route in some areas,” said the district president of Devbhoomi e-rickshaw welfare society Ravindra Tyagi.

He said that he expects from the people working in the field of water conservation to give their important suggestions to make this law practical and effective. They should also suggest measures how to ensure water for people in future.

""The Delhi poll results indicate 'winds of change' are blowing in the country. The results are not surprising to me,"" Pawar told reporters in Pune.

""The BJP, as usual, played the communal card to polarise votes, but failed,"" he said.

After winning the Patparganj seat in a close contest, AAP senior leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the BJP of indulging in the politics of hate.

""We indulge in politics of development not politics of hate,"" he told reporters.

Even as Congress failed to open its account in this election, its senior leader P Chidambaram congratulated the AAP and said it had defeated the divisive politics of the BJP.

""AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP. I salute the people of Delhi who have set an example to other states that will hold their elections in 2021 and 2022.""

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray congratulated the AAP and the people of Delhi and said, ""People have shown that the country will be run by 'Jan Ki Baat', not 'Mann Ki Baat'. BJP called Kejriwal a terrorist but couldn't defeat him,"" he said.

""Development agenda has won, I congratulate Arvind Kejriwal. The Delhi polls have become bipolar, there was nothing for Congress in these polls,"" Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.

Samajwadi Party(SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav said the poll outcome showed that Indians were both ""socially liberal and politically intelligent"".

""Most Indians are still socially liberal and politically intelligent and are against those that drag religion, which is such a personal issue into politics, for political gains.

""It is also an auspicious sign and healthy message for the peace and development of the country,"" the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister tweeted.

CPI-M veteran and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan hailed Kejriwal's win as a victory for inclusive politics.

""Congratulations to @ArvindKejriwal and @AamAadmiParty on a resounding victory in Delhi elections. Let this victory be a harbinger for pro-people and inclusive politics in our country,"" Vijayan said in a tweet.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said Delhi has given a befitting reply to the BJP's ""politics of hate and violence.""

""Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty and the people of Delhi who have given a befitting reply to BJP's politics of hate and violence. Union ministers called for 'gaalis' and 'golis'. People have given their answer,"" Yechury said in a tweet.

CPI General Secretary D. Raja congratulated Kejriwal on phone.

DMK chief MK Stalin said the victory is an indication that ""development trumps communal politics.""

""Federal rights and regional aspirations must be strengthened in the interest of our country,"" he said.

RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said the victory marks the defeat of ""politics of polarisation"".

""Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal ji & Delhi! You have defeated negative & blatant hate politics decisively. Your verdict marks the defeat of politics of polarisation and division. I sincerely hope BJP takes a cue from this result and shuns communalism & bigotry once for all,"" he said.

Calling Kejriwal as a leader who heralded development, former Karnataka Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy said people have taught a lesson for labelling him a ""terrorist"" and also upheld the necessity of a regional party.

""Heartfelt congratulations to @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty. People of Delhi have showed that ""fascist ideology"" will never win their hearts.

""Congratulations to AAP and voters of Delhi for testifying that successful politics with development as criteria (to win polls), amidst money and muscle power,"" Kumaraswamy tweeted.

104,12-2-20,Counseling offers opportunity to talk: Archbishop Leo Cornelio,"Counseling offers the opportunity to talk about social, emotional, or behavioral problems that are either causing distress or interfering with your functioning,” said Archbishop Leo Cornelio at the inauguration of ‘Ashadeep’, a Centre for Wholeness, at Seva Sadan in Bhopal on Tuesday.

He added these days the topic psychology is more in demand, whereas the other fields are more in decline, because, as the technology grows, people seek more comfort and get into more anxiety, depression and suicides. It is the need of the hour to intervene this type of crisis to create a tension free and happy life.

‘Ashadeep’ is a centre for all types of counselling towards mental, psychological, social and economic free stress to have joyful and contended life.

Vinay Mishra, psychologist, a faculty from BSSS College said that people are prone to get mental ill health due to harming environment in the modern world. Such centres are more in demand to intervene the mental crisis in order to establish overall health and wellbeing.

105,12-2-20,BJP's overlooking local issues helped AAP,"nAs BJP's a good two-decade-old bid to seat itself in Delhi failed again, it could still draw solace from the happy increase in its voting percentage that it could link to its high-pitch 'nationalist' push which, ironically, also may have cost it most of the seats by overlooking the local issues and aspirations that, largely, fed the winner AAP's poll campaign.

BJP's manifesto spelt out 'bijlee, panni aur makaan' but it did not become the integral part of the its electioneering in the national Capital and thus could not catch the imagination of urban as well 'jhuggi-jhopri' clusters who continued to latch on to AAP's 'free doles'.

Preliminary analysis showed that a section of the traditional Congress voters, mainly the upper castes, may have voted for the BJP. The 38.46 per cent votes collected by the BJP in 2020 which is 6.46 per cent higher than that of 2015 Assembly poll's 32 per cent may give BJP food for thought to rework its poll strategy for the coming Assembly polls, particularly in Bihar and West Bengal, which are set for a rather complex election battles.

Delhi poll results have some seminal lessons for the ruling party with a huge and well-oiled machinery with over 11 crore party workers across the country.

There is no doubt that nationalistic 'chest-thumping' needs to be carried by the strong legs of State-specific-developmental issues which find easy coherence with all sections of the voters — be they economically deprived or the middle and upper-affluent class.

BJP stretched its dependents on Prime Minister Narendra Modi too far and it was unrealistic that he would fit-in well in the micro level Delhi State poll campaign vis-à-vis a hands-on Chief Minister running for his third term.

Not projecting a State-level Chief Ministerial candidate deprived Delhi voters a comparison scale with which they could gauge BJP's depth and commitment to outflank Arvind Kejriwal's 'leadership' . A Rs lethargic dependenceRs on Modi-Shah for delivery had also distanced State voters , always wanting to be closeted with its local leadership.

Reverses in Delhi poll is another call for the BJP to evolve its state leadership and fast decentralise its decision making for better results. In this respect ,the party could take a lesson from the book of the Congress, another national party, though it drew a blank in the Delhi poll with just four per cent vote share.

The posters at the BJP's Delhi unit office carried the message, ""Vijay se hum ahankaari nahi hote, haar se hum hatash nahi hote (Victory doesn't make us arrogant, and defeat doesn't dishearten us). The message has enough wisdom and energy quotient to carry the national party forward — if followed in true spirit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-s-overlooking-local-issues-helped-aap.html
106,12-2-20,From Anna’s anti-graft movement to 3rd time Chief Minister of Delhi,"nFor the third time Arvind Kejriwal, an engineer-cum-civil servant-turned-politician won the Delhi Assembly Elections with development agenda. For 2020 elections in city, the Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 62 of Delhi's 70 seats, leaving the BJP with eight and decimating the Congress.

Slipping back in time about nine years ago, Kejriwal joined Anna Hazare during the Lokpal movement in 2011 before quickly enlarging his canvas, first as a satyagrah activist and then as founder of the cleverly named AAP that took on the might of the BJP to reclaim Delhi for a third time on Tuesday.

The name of his party as carefully chosen as his public persona perhaps, Delhi's 51-year-old Chief Minister is the embodiment of the everyday man but one who has tailored his politics and campaign in keeping with the times.

As he emerged on the victory stage to loud cheers from his AAP supporters and shouted ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"", 'Inquilab Zindabad"" and ""Vande Mataram"" before saying ""I love you"" to Delhiites, many remembered the earnest activist who went on a hunger strike for a Lokpal bill in 2011. The year after, in 2012, he started his political party and emerged as a mascot of an alternative brand of politics - and the 'aam aadmi' politician with his muffler casually wrapped around his neck, and sometimes his head, oversized shirts and open toed sandals.

Though his ambitions to make the AAP a national party have not met with much success, the Delhi Chief Minister's hat is one that will stay — for the next five years at least.

His effort to be seen as a direct challenger to Narendra Modi came a cropper in 2014 when he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi. He tried to make an electoral dent in Punjab and Goa in 2017 but that didn't work either. So Delhi it is for the moment.

In 2013, he became Chief Minister but only for 49 days, images of him sleeping in his utilitarian Wagon R while on 'dharna' for a Jan Lokpal (ombudsman) wrapped in a cotton quilt against the cold winter nights making the front pages.

Battling allegations of being autocratic and unyielding in his politics, Kejriwal resigned soon after, only to bide his time till 2015 when he scripted a stunning win to bag 67 of Delhi's 70 seats.

Earning the moniker 'mufflerman' for his fondness for the muffler, Kejriwal runs his party with the proverbial iron fist and has learnt to temper his aggression, say people close to him.

Notwithstanding the electoral triumph for BJP in the May Lok Sabha polls, the IIT graduate has managed to anchor a campaign that wooed all sections in the city.

He announced in the beginning of the campaign that he will run a positive campaign fought on the basis of his government's development work in the last five years. His main poll planks were schemes such as free bus travel for women in DTC buses, free 200 units of electricity, installation of 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras and free 20,000 litres of water.

During the election campaign, Kejriwal attacked BJP on several occasions, asking who is their chief ministerial candidate. He was careful, however, to not speak out too clearly on the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh, the centrepiece of the BJP's campaign.

He was called a ""terrorist"" by BJP leaders, but Kejriwal hit back saying voters could back the BJP if they thought so or opt for his party if they view him as a son of Delhi.

Born on August 16, 1968 in Hisar in Haryana to Gobind Ram Kejriwal and Gita Devi, Kejriwal is a man of simple tastes.

His family is always by his side.

Kejriwal, who lives with his parents, wife Sunita and two children, is often seen going out for a quiet meal or the occasional film. Both daughter Harshita and son Pulkit are IIT products.

On Tuesday, the self confessed film buff and fond husband told his cheering supporters from the victory dais that it was Sunita's birthday.

A strict vegetarian who prefers home-made food, Kejriwal is married to Sunita, who is also an Indian Revenue Service officer and his batchmate. He is known to be an ardent practitioner of Vipassana, and seldom misses his yoga and meditation sessions.

The Ramon Magsaysay award winner was part of Team Anna that also included India's first IPS officer and now Puducherry governor Kiran Bedi and lawyer Prashant Bhushan.

He was the civil society representative member of the committee constituted by the government to draft the Jan Lokpal bill, following the campaign for introduction of the anti-graft legislation.

Kejriwal did a degree in Mechanical Engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur.

He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and, after working for three years, resigned in 1992 to take up the Union Public Service Commission examination which he cleared to become an IRS officer. He also worked with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata.

Kejriwal worked with people in slums through an NGO called Parivartan he set up with his confidant Manish Sisodia.

His efforts towards the enactment of the RTI Act to empower the poorest citizens of India won him the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership in 2006.

In February 2006, after resigning as joint commissioner in the Income Tax Department, he became a full-time activist and started another NGO, Public Cause Research Foundation, with his award money as a corpus fund.

Will this man with many accomplishments manage to break out of Delhi to extend his political reach to other parts of the country? That's the challenge facing the AAP today.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/from-anna---s-anti-graft-movement-to-3rd-time-chief-minister-of-delhi.html
107,12-2-20,Delhiites repose faith in AAP,"Relentlessly pursuing the governance model for the common man, the Delhi Government led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has showed the way of 'unprecedented victory' for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) divisive politics.

In Delhi where the legislative Assembly enjoys power slightly more than municipal corporations, people have reposed their faith into AAP, the party which worked on the primary needs of people by delivering its promises on education and health. It has still a lot to do because the next five years will be more challenging for AAP with perennial issues like — air pollution, traffic jam, crime, unchecked migration amidst the complexities of multiple authority system in the Government of National Capital Territory Delhi (GNCTD)

As the AAP has completed its first full tenure of five years and the struggle for the State-level party is not over as many challenges ahead to pursue Governance model for Arvind Kejriwal from Players' building popularly known as Delhi Secretariat.

Well aware about local issues, Delhi has kept 'nationalism' aside and soulfully participated in battle where consequences directly affect to their pocket showing unconditional support by giving 63 seats to AAP when opposition managed to get seven seats. The mandate is high as nearly two million people practiced their vote.

Delhi, the heart of India from where all orders that are passed, affects State, national or international politics but as it has taken the shape of urban jungle falls under seismic zone IV with intermingling habitat and livelihood and unplanned rickety infrastructure in such scenario, the Delhi Government has to work with the Center for the betterment of it.

At time when Delhi Government's education model has been awarded at national level, it is equally important for the elected government to escalate the infrastructure with the possibilities of maximum registration of locals who voted for the government.

The multiplicity of authority, three power centers with intermingling responsibilities and denying statutory empowerment to Resident Welfare Association for the maximum participation of citizen in governance because variant lifestyles of inhabitants do not allow one show fits all as Delhi has a system — Urban / Rural villages, unathorised/ resettlement colonies , planned developed colonies, Lutyens Delhi and Cantonment.

Amid all these complexities, Municipal laws and delimitation of wards on the basis of population is big target to provide development and quality services both in city like Delhi, hence another challenge for the evolving AAP.

However, in this Assembly elections, structural reforms of governance model was a subject matter of Election discourse at state level despite the fact, only Center can reform the structure of Delhi's Governance through Parliament while Delhi assembly can empower bodies like RWAs

Another important factor which play crucial role in the Development of Delhi is land and it is equally important to mention here that MPD -21 gas been amended 248 times by land owning authority - DDA, hence a question has raised what is the sanctity of a Master Plan which changes at the whims for a vote.

In such occurrence, skewing the balance of political power to areas with dense population versus planned developed colonies is another factor which has played vital role in assembly elections also while the challenge ahead is to formulate separate MCD's based demography not the geography.

Another decisive factor is land -law and order under center, MCD under Lieutenant Governor and Delhi government have played havoc in managing city state with a burgeoning population while the recent clear cut delineation of responsibilities accorded by Supreme Court gas solved the equation but structural safe guards need to be introduced for overall development of Delhi.

Furthermore, strengthening RWAs for the last mile delivery of government services as the Courts, Police and various government departments turn to RWA's for help in maintenance of parks, parking , providing Colony Security, reporting Encroachments, controlling Dengue even however when it comes to pinning accountability of officials for certifying quality of work done or non availability of services, these RWAs ignored.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhiites-repose-faith-in-aap.html
108,12-2-20,Mandate proves true meaning of nationalism: AAP,"Taking a dig at the BJP which has been riding high on the patriotism wave during campaigning, AAP candidates after being declared winners, asserted that the mandate given to them has proved what true nationalism is.

Following the lead at several constituencies, there was a joy and happiness among the AAP workers, however, the workers from other parties including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress left the voting counting centre till afternoon.

In South Delhi, at Jija Bai Industrial Training institute counting centre, the votes counting for Mehrauli, Chhatarpur and Malviya Nagar constituencies were going on. The candidates from the party had reached the counting centre early morning and several workers from BJP and AAP were seen waiting for result outside the counting centre. However, there were no workers from the Congress party.

Till 12 pm, the air was tense as the fortunes kept fluctuating between the BJP and AAP. AAP candidates surged ahead in the afternoon and it started dawning upon BJP workers that their party was over. They started leaving the centre. AAP candidates, Somanth Bharti, Kartar Singh Tanwar and Naresh Yadav won Malviya Nagar, Chattarpur and Mehrauli seats by defeating their counterparts with a huge margin.

Anand Kumar, who was distributing sweets, said that this is victory of works done by AAP Government. ""There will be more facilities for poor and a middle class person in Arvind Kejriwal's this term Government. People of Delhi trust Kejriwal and they have faith in his work,"" said Kumar.

""The BJP had tried to make this election communal but people of Delhi want development and peace. Through this election they have shown that development is what they want,"" said Sandhaya, an AAP worker in South Delhi.

Similar environment were witnessed at other counting centers as well. AAP supporters started coming out of their houses and reached one after another to show solidarity with the party. On the other hand supporters of the BJP started leaving seeing AAP candidates taking a sizeable margin on all the seats.

While no Congress supporter was seen at counting center. AAP supporters reached at Dhirpur counting center where counting for Timarpur, Burari, Matia Mahal, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Ballimaran and Karol Bagh Assembly seats was going on and started celebrating with dhol and sweets.

110,12-2-20,BJP fails to convert vote share into seats,"With vote share of 53.60 per cent and winning 62 seats, the Arvind Kejriwal led Aam Admi Party (AAP) repeated its 2015 feat in the national Capital while BJP has improved its vote share by over 6 per cent but failed to convert it into seats in the Delhi Assembly polls 2020. The saffron party received 38.49 percent votes and managed to win only eight seats. Delhi has recorded a voter turnout of 62.59 per cent when elections were held on Saturday, after an acrimonious campaign and with tension high after three incidents of gunfire at or near protest sites in four days. CPI, CPI (M), NCP, RJD and RLD got lesser votes than NOTA.

According to the Election Commission (EC) data, the ruling AAP saw a slight dip in its vote share. It has received 53.64 per cent of the votes. Maintaining the vote share by the AAP is the indication that the party has strong base in Bihari and Poorvanchalis in unauthorised colonies and Muslim areas. This is because of free electricity, free water and free bus travelling for women. In the last Assembly elections, it had bagged 54.5 per cent of the votes.

The BJP improved its vote share but failed to convert it into seats. The saffron party won 38.45% of the votes cast. This was higher than the 32.3 percent vote share for the BJP in the 2015 elections. It is the third straight electoral setback for the BJP after losing Jharkhand and Maharashtra elections last year. In Delhi, BJP never succeeded in one to one electoral contest. In 1993, the saffron party had managed to win due to triangular contest between the Congress and Ramvir Singh Bidhuri led NCP. Between 1998 and 2013, the saffron party had lost in one to one electoral battle.

The elections marked the continuing decline of the Congress in the national Capital, where it was in power from 1998 to 2013. The party had won 4.27 percent of the votes, down from the paltry 9% it had secured in 2015. In the 2008 elections, the Congress had a vote share of 40%, which was almost reduced by almost half when the AAP came along in 2013. The Congress was not in second place in any of the 70 seats in the city, and 63 candidates has forfeited their deposit. However, Congress leaders had revealed ahead of the result day that their party was tacitly backing AAP and hence did not do any intense campaigning in a bid to refrain BJP from coming to power in the national capital. According to the Election Commission, a candidate has to forfeit his or her security deposit if they receive fewer than one-sixth of the total votes polled - or less than 16.66% of the votes.

As per the data, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) received 0.71 percent vote share. Interestingly, None of the Above (NOTA) got 0.47 percent vote share which is more than the CPI which received 0.02 percent; CPI (M)'s 0.01 percent vote share and Sharad Pawar's NCP managed only 0.02 percent vote share. Janata Dal (United), has contested the polls in two assembly seats-Sangam Vihar and Burari, got only 0.87 percent votes. Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party contested from Seemapuri and got 0.36 percent votes.

The BJP had campaigned aggressively for the February 8 Assembly election, and banked on the image and policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Union Home Minister Amit Shah led the campaign charge for the party in Delhi, and addressed a number of rallies. He also conducted door-to-door campaigns.

The main election issue for BJP, which centred its campaign around nationalism, was the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA protest in south Delhi's Shaheen Bagh.

127,12-2-20,"Sitharaman counters PC’s jibe, defends moves","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday came out with a strong counter to former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s ‘incompetent doctors’ overseeing the economy comment, saying she doesn’t want to learn from those who gave “faulty remedies”, under whom FDI literally ran away and “cronies” fled the country after defaulting on bank loans.

In her usual combative style, she defended her handling of the economy citing “seven specific green shoots” in rising foreign direct investment (FDI), net foreign portfolio inflows, kicking off of Rs 103 lakh crore infrastructure pipeline, jump in foreign exchange reserves, GST collection topping Rs 1 lakh crore in six months in current fiscal, rebound in industrial production and surge in stock markets.

Defending her Budget for 2020-21, she reeled out announcements of last year including reduction in tax rate on income generated by companies, compared steps taken by the Congress-led UPA during global financial crisis of 2008-09 and took credit for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cutting interest rates by as much as 135 basis points last year to boost growth from its worst showing in 11 years.

She first spoke at length in the Lok Sabha, giving out statistics and hard data to defend not just budgetary allocation but also the slippage in fiscal deficit target for the third year a row.

Hours later, she came to the Rajya Sabha with a shorter and crisper reply, much of which targeted Chidambaram who had on Monday stated that the ""economy was perilously close to collapse and was being attended by incompetent doctors"" and that the Government had predispositions.

""A lot of assumptions were being put on us. One thing I concede and that is it is certainly predisposed about not repeating faulty remedies that the UPA Government gave in 2008-09. None of that will be repeated by us,"" she said.

""What was the remedy offered in 2008-09 and what did it result in. We certainly don't want that burden on the economy for today or for the future,"" she said adding the UPA during 2004 and 2014 was ""very fortunate"" to inherit a cushion in the good work of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government of the previous five years.

The Finance Minister

said she would take comments and suggestions made by everyone but not ""when you are constantly throwing barbs at us"".

Stating that the Government was trying to bring back a number of cronies ran away from the country after taking money from banks, she said: ""So that twin balance sheet problem is not something which I would not want to learn from those very competent doctors.""

Again, the NPAs running into lakhs of crores of rupees was a fallout of ""another remedy offered during the 2008-09 crisis"".

""We certainly do not want to inherit or copy those remedies of competent doctors,"" she said and went on to cite double-digit inflation, high fiscal deficit and Government liability being passed on to oil companies to dress up the balance sheet as other ills of the UPA era.

Sitharaman said in 2012-13, foreign investment recorded a negative 36 per cent growth. ""Literally FDI ran out of this country. And this is competent doctors holding the economy together.""

On Chidambaram's charge of the Modi Government has a predisposed mindset about foreign trade agreements, she said the pacts signed during UPA are being reviewed as they are ""harming"" the country. Chidambaram's speech had more sarcasm than content, she said.

On the economy, she said the size of the Indian economy has grown from USD 2 trillion to USD 2.9 trillion in five years that saw an average growth rate of 7.45 per cent in inflation of around 4.5 per cent.

Listing initiatives taken by the government, she said, increasing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), rise in factory output and over Rs 1 lakh crore GST collection in six months of current fiscal were indications of green shoots in the economy. Referring to visible indicators of green shoots, the Finance Minister said the forex reserve is at an all-time high and the stock market is upbeat.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sitharaman-counters-pc---s-jibe--defends-moves.html

129,12-2-20,Assam NRC list data goes offline from official website,"All data of the final list of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has been made offline from its official website due to non-renewal of contract with the IT firm Wipro, prompting the Opposition Congress to doubt it as a ‘malafide act’.

The complete detail of exclusion and inclusion of bonafide Indian citizens in the NRC was uploaded on its official website ‘www.nrcassam.nic.in’ after the final list was published on August 31, 2019.

However, the data was not available for the last couple of days and it created panic in the public, mostly among the people excluded from the list as the rejection certificates were yet to be issued.

When contacted, NRC State Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma accepted that the data have been made offline, but refuted the allegation of any ‘malafide’ intent in it.

“The cloud service for the huge set of data was provided by Wipro and their contract was till October 19 last year. However, this was not renewed by the earlier Coordinator. So, the data got offline from December 15 after it was suspended by Wipro. I assumed charge on December 24,” Sarma told PTI.

He informed that the state coordination committee had decided to do necessary formalities in its meeting on January 30 and wrote to the Wipro during the first week of February.

“Once Wipro makes the data live, it will be available for the public. We hope that people will be able to access it in the next 2-3 days,” Sarma said.

Reacting to the development, Leader of the Opposition in Assam Assembly Debabrata Saikia wrote to the Registrar General of India and requested him to look into the matter urgently.

“It is a mystery as to why the online data should vanish all of a sudden, especially as the appeals process has not even started due to the go-slow attitude adopted by the NRC Authority. There is, therefore, ample scope to suspect that the disappearance of online data is a malafide act.

“Indeed, the deletion of data from the NRC website at a time when the appeals process is yet is start, is prima facie a deliberate violation of the directive issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

“This act also violates the rules pertaining to the NRC, which stipulates various processes post publication of the NRC,” Saikia wrote in the letter.

The final NRC was published by excluding 19,06,657 persons. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/assam-nrc-list-data-goes-offline-from-official-website.html

In Kohima NPF secretary general Achumbemo Kikon and other leaders sat on dharna with banners and placards some of which read “CAA is a threat to all indigenous communities of North East”, “Injustice cannot be a law”, “CAA murdered secularism” and “CAA is draconian law”.

Addressing the gathering, Kikon said the claims of the state government that Nagaland is protected by Inner Line Permit (ILP) and that the state wont be affected as we have been exempted from the purview of CAA is “totally misleading”.

He said that Nagaland having its borders with Assam is not far from being overshadowed by illegal immigrants.

“If we (Nagas) remain silent even we are at danger of facing a similar situation,” said Kikon.

131,12-2-20,AMU students march against police action on protesters in Kanpur,"Hundreds of Aligarh Muslim University students, who included a large number of girls, took out a candle-light march inside the campus in protest against the police action on anti-citizenship law protesters in Kanpur and on Jamia Millia Islamia students in Delhi.

After the march Monday night, the AMU Students Coordination Committee submitted a memorandum, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, to authorities, seeking his intervention on the issue. The committee also demanded the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

By venting fury against the protesters, especially women, police was adding fuel to the fire in UP, the memorandum claimed. It said UP police, instead of allowing peaceful protests, is aggravating the situation by indulging in “wanton brutalities”.

The committee demanded that the president intervene to prevent deterioration of law and order.

Early Monday, UP police allegedly tried to remove the protesters from Kanpur’s Mohammad Ali Park. The protesters accused the police of resorting to lathicharge but senior officials denied the charge.

Similar protests have been continuing in Delhi. On December 15, Delhi police stormed into Jamia, looking for protesters who had indulged in arson, and allegedly beat up students. The same night, police also entered the AMU and clashed with students protesting against Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

On Tuesday, former AMU Students Union Vice President Hamza Sufiyan, who is among the four students whose surety of Rs 1 lakh has been seized by police, said he was being “framed” by district authorities for the violence on December 15, despite he providing documentary evidence, including call records, to the Human Rights Commission to prove he was not in Aligarh that night.

Sufiyan said in a statement that the police was “harassing” him even though the CCTV footage showed he was not present during the clash at Baab-e-Syed Gate of the university on December 15.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/amu-students-march-against-police-action-on-protesters-in-kanpur.html

133,12-2-20,Ex-Arunachal CM Kalikho Pul’s son found dead in UK,"A 20-year-old man, believed to be the son of former Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Kalikho Pul, has been found dead in the bedroom of his flat in the coastal town of Brighton in south-east England.

Shubanso Pul was found dead by the local police officials on Sunday, who said there were no suspicious circumstances around the death which seems to imply a possible suicide.

“At 3.41pm on Sunday (February 9) police were called to an address in Falmer where a 20-year-old man was found dead in a bedroom,” an East Sussex Police statement said.

“There were no suspicious circumstances. The coroner for Brighton and Hove has been informed,” the statement added.

The coroner will now open an inquest into the death, which is when the cause of death will be confirmed.

Shubanso, the son of Pul with his first wife Dangwimsai Pul, was reportedly a student at the University of Sussex.

Meanwhile, his family in Itanagar is trying to get in touch with the Indian High Commission in the UK to bring Shubanso’s body to India.

With the support of a few elected members of the Congress and the BJP, Pul became the chief minister for a brief period in 2016. However, the Supreme Court ruled against the appointment, leading to his ouster. He himself was found dead in his official chief ministerial residence in Itanagar on August 9, 2016, with an alleged suicide note.

While Dangwimsai Pul, the first wife, had moved the Supreme Court seeking a probe into the death and allegations of massive corruption mentioned in her husband’s suicide note, the BJP gave a ticket to his third wife, Dasanglu Pul to contest the by-elections from Hayuliang, which she won.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ex-arunachal-cm-kalikho-pul---s-son-found-dead-in-uk.html

135,12-2-20,Budget fails to address economy challenge: Opp,"Before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharama came out with a strong counter, the debate on the budget for 2020-21 on the second day in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday saw the Opposition hitting out at the Government for not taking adequate steps to revive economy and the ruling party MPs stressing that the fundamentals of the economy were strong.

Opposition members said the Budget has not lived up to expectations and fails to address challenge faced by the Indian economy. They also attacked the Union Government for the ""step- motherly"" treatment to States and privatisation of public sector units including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

Expressing concern over the state of economy, Binoy Viswam(CPI) said it was already on ""ventilator"" and not in the ""ICU"" as mentioned by Chidambaram on Monday. He also termed the budget for 2020-21 as failed budget.

PL Punia (Congress) said the Government is not ready to accept the crisis in the economy and urged the Finance Minister to consult experts to address the problem.

He also charged the government of doing nothing for the welfare of scheduled castes and tribals, saying sub-plans be restored for SCs and Tribals.

K Keshava Rao(TRS) said the budget has set up an ambitious disinvestment target and would be difficult to achieve. He said the dual tax system proposed in the Budget would benefit chartered accountants. The TRS member also raised the issue of ""step motherly"" treatment being given to States in devolution of taxes.

Veer Singh(BSP) said the Centre has ""ruined"" the Indian economy and unemployment is at a 45 year-high.

136,12-2-20,CBI gives clean chit to its former Special Director Rakesh Asthana,"The CBI on Tuesday gave a clean chit to former CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana and chief of Research and Analysis Wing Samant Kumar Goel in a bribery case registered by the agency in 2018 following a bitter feud between the then chief of the anti-corruption body Alok Verma and his deputy Asthana. Goel's name found reference in the FIR but he was not a named accused in the case.

Following the clean chit to Asthana, there is a strong buzz in the bureaucratic circles that he might be appointed as the Delhi police commissioner as the incumbent Amulya Patnaik is scheduled to retire on February 29.

Both Asthana and Verma had traded charges of corruption against each other following which the Government in a midnight action decided to bench them out from the premier agency.

The agency has also cleared DSP Devender Kumar accused in the case but chargesheeted Dubai-based businessman Manoj Prasad who was earlier arrested by the agency.

The agency has submitted before the designated court that further probe against Manoj's brother Somesh and another accused Sunil Mittal is required. Officials said the probe has not yielded any evidence to corroborate Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Babu Sana's allegations against Asthana, Goel and Kumar that they received bribe to save the controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

Asthana was booked on the allegations of IPC section relating to criminal conspiracy besides corruption and criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act on a complaint filed by Sana. On October 15, 2018, the CBI had registered an FIR against Asthana for allegedly taking a bribe from Sana.

In his complaint, Sana had alleged that he paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to Asthana to get relief in an ongoing investigation linked to Qureshi.

The alleged bribe money was paid over a 10-month period beginning December, 2017. Sana was being probed by an SIT headed by Asthana.

In his complaint, Sana had alleged that he had had met Manoj who claimed to have good relations with Asthana. Sana also alleged that Manoj''s brother Somesh would also help him in getting a clean chit in Moin Qureshi case probe from Asthana.

Asthana has denied all allegations against him and pinned the blame on the feud with Verma, leading to the registration of the case against him.

The chargesheet against the private person and clean chit to the government servants comes as the Delhi High Court had last month gave a four week deadline to complete the probe or else ensure the presence of CBI Director RK Shukla before the court on the next date of hearing on February 12.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-gives-clean-chit-to-its-former-special-director-rakesh-asthana.html

He also said no Bill will be taken up and the House will only discuss Budget in the backdrop of reports in the media hinting that some important Bill may be initiated.

The Budget session of Parliament, which started on January 31, will go on a break from Tuesday and meet again on March 2. As the House met for the day, Naidu said no bill will be taken up and the House will only discuss the budget and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's reply later in the day.

138,12-2-20,Centre rejects AP Govt's proposal to release payment under PM-KISAN,"In a major jolt to the Jagan Reddy dispensation, the Ministry of Agriculture has rejected Andhra Pradesh Government's proposal to release the payment under Rythu Bharosa scheme for farmers from the PM-KISAN yojana. The Andhra Pradesh Government has sought a lumpsum amount from PM -KISAN scheme to give benefit to its Rythu Bharosa scheme which proposed to give Rs 12,500 per year to each farmer family.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday said the Andhra Pradesh Government under its Rythu Bharosa scheme proposed to give Rs 12,500 per year to each farmer family inclusive of a benefit of Rs 6,000 given under PM-KISAN. The State Government scheme also aimed to cover the tenant farmers. ""State Government had requested to release the payments under PM-KISAN scheme as a lumpsum amount instead of payments in installments. The request of Government of Andhra Pradesh was not accepted,"" he said. The state's proposal was ""not accepted"" because PM-KISAN was meant to provide income support to all land holding farmers' families in the country, subject to certain exclusions.

An amount of Rs 2,000 was paid in three equal installments to enable farmers take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs so as to protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in farming activities, he added.

Under PM-KISAN, the central government provides a payment of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 to 14.5 crore farmers across the country. The eligibility of farmers to join PM-KISAN is determined by the respective state governments on the basis of Operational Guidelines of the Scheme.

As per the 2015-16 agriculture census, there are about 83.90 lakh landholdings in Andhra Pradesh. So far, 54.45 lakh farmers have registered under PM-KISAN, the Union Minister said in a separate reply.

To those registered between December 2018 and March 31, 2019 in Andhra Pradesh, the centre has paid the first installment to 36.40 lakh beneficiaries, second installment to 34.11 lakh beneficiaries, third installment to 33.78 lakh beneficiaries and fourth installment to 31.35 lakh beneficiaries, he added.

To those registered between April and July 2019 in the state, the centre has released first installment to 7.92 lakh beneficiaries, second installment to 7.64 lakh beneficiaries and third installment to 7.35 lakh beneficiaries.

To those registered between August and November 2019, the centre has released the first and second installment to only one beneficiary but to those registered between December 2019 and March 2020, the centre has paid the first installment to 6.84 lakh beneficiaries of Andhra Pradesh, the minister added.

Sharing all India figures, Tomar said a total of 9.60 crore farmer families across India have been successfully registered under PM-KISAN as on February 6. Of this, 8.44 crore beneficiaries have received benefits.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-rejects-ap-govt-s-proposal-to-release-payment-under-pm-kisan.html

140,12-2-20,Magic Remedies Bill to curb fake ads,"Advertisements that mislead consumers by promising fair skin or offering cure for hair loss and infertility in women, enhanced sexual performance, increasing brain capacity among others will attract jail term upto five years and a fine up to Rs 50 lakhs as per the draft of Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) (Amendment) Bill, 2020.

The proposed legislation, drafted by the Union Health Ministry, has also widened its ambit to cover from print media to electronic media, the internet and websites besides making several additions to the list of diseases, disorders, conditions covered in the existing Act.

The proposal for the amendments follows concerns raised by the Advertising Standards Council of India, industry watchdog, from time to time, alleging that in the absence of the proper legal ambit the gullible consumers were being taken for a ride by the unscrupulous advertisers.

The Draft Act, which is available on the website of the Ministry for public comments, says that medicines, ""magic remedies"" and products to cure any of 78 diseases, disorders, conditions named in the draft should not be advertised, a senior health ministry official explained.

Prohibition of advertisements include those claiming treatment of AIDS, encephalitis, drugs or treatment for sexual impotence, premature ejaculation and spermatorrhoea, AIDS, improvement of memory, improvement in height of kids/adults, improvement in size of sexual organ, duration of sexual performance and disorders of menstrual flow hysteria.

The other advertisements which have been banned under the draft are on claims on power to rejuvenate, obesity, maintenance or improvement of the capacity of the human being for sexual pleasure, insanity, increase in brain capacity and improvement of memory and improvement in height of children/adults.

As per the draft, the first- time convicted will be given jail term upto two years and a fine up to Rs 10 lakh as opposed to the existing provisions of six months' jail time and an unspecified fine, for second conviction, jail term will increase to five years and a fine up to Rs 50 lakh.

The draft bill also proposes an expansion of definition of an advertisement. It says, ""any audio or visual publicity, representation, endorsement or pronouncement made by means of light, sound, smoke, gas, print, electronic media, internet or website and includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper, invoice, banner, poster or such other documents.

The ASCI in its periodical reports has listed dozens of misleading advertisements that violate the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act. These advertisements have made claims related to asthma, cancer, diabetes, increased height, obesity and sexual performance among other health and cosmetic conditions.

141,12-2-20,"Under pressure from new Mins, BSY reshuffles portfolios","A day after allocating portfolios to ten newly inducted Ministers of his Cabinet, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday reshuffled them apparently under pressure from some newly inducted Ministers.

According to an official notification issued by Governor Vajubhai Vala, Anand Singh, who was allotted the porfolio of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumers Affairs on Monday, has now been given the charge of Forest, Ecology and Environment Department.

BC Patil, who was given the charge of Forest Department, has now been allocated Agriculture department, which was additionally held by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

Yediyurappa has taken back the Small Scale Industries portfolio from K Gopalaiah and has now allocated him Food, Civil Supplies and Consumers Affairs Department.

The additional charge of sugar department that Gopalaiah had has been given to Labour minister A Shivaram Hebbar.

According to BJP sources, Singh, Patil and Gopalaiah were unhappy with their portfolios and had exerted pressure on the Chief Minister to change the departments assigned to them.

Though there was demand for plum portfolios like Energy and Bangalore Development that are with the Chief Minister currently, Yediyurappa has not allotted them as it may give rise to rift within, as several senior party leaders and Ministers have been eyeing the departments.

The other minor changes that have been done in Tuesday’s reallocation include Minority Welfare department that was with Animal Husbandry, Haj and Wakf Department Minister Prabhu Chauhan, which has been given to Textile Minister Shrimant Patil.

Similarly Ecology and Environment has been divested from Mines and Geology minister CC Patil and allotted to Anand Singh along with Forest. Urban Development minister B A Basvaraj will have the responsibility of Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB) and Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), excluding Bangalore Development and related department and Directorate of Town Planning.

Yediyurappa on February 6 had expanded his Cabinet by inducting 10 of 11 legislators who had won the bypolls in December on the BJP ticket after defecting from the Congress and JD(S) and subsequently facing disqualification. During the portfolio allocation on Monday, the Chief Minister had assigned the plum Water Resources Department to Ramesh Jarkiholi, who had played a key role in the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government that paved the way for the BJP to come to power.

With the BJP leadership making it clear that there will be no more Deputy Chief Ministers, the post that he was eyeing for, Jarkiholi had put pressure for the Water Resources Department.

Athani MLA Mahesh Kumathalli, the only newly elected BJP legislator after defecting from the Congress who was not made minister during the recent expansion, has expressed displeasure over him being appointed as chairman of Mysore Sales International Limited (MSIL), stating that he was not interested in it.

“When I was told that I will be made chief of board or corporation, I had said give me Land Army (Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited) as I am a Civil Engineer and I can perform better in it.

Last night I got to know I have been given MSIL, I am going to Bengaluru and meet the Chief Minister.

If they want to give, let them give Land Army, I am not interested in MSIL,” Kumathalli told reporters in Belagavi.

“I should have been made minister, but due to certain reasons and in the interest of the party I remained patient.

I have been promised that I will be made minister in the next expansion,” he added.

With a few new Ministers still unhappy over their portfolios, disgruntlement among the party’s old guard over them being left out during the expansion, regional and caste imbalance in the cabinet, Yediyurappa may have to look at another round of expansion, probably along with rejig in the days ahead, party sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/under-pressure-from-new-mins--bsy-reshuffles-portfolios.html
142,12-2-20,"Janta malik hai, says Nitish Kumar","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday side-stepped queries on the outcome of assembly polls in Delhi, where the coalition comprising his JD(U), BJP and LJP has been drubbed by the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, with a terse observation will of the people is supreme.

‘Janta malik hai,’ said Kumar with hands folded above his head and the ghost of a smile playing on his lips as he sauntered past a posse of journalists tossing queries on the sidelines of a function where he unveiled a statue of RSS ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

The JD(U), of which Kumar is the national president, had contested two assembly segments in Delhi Burari and Sangam VIhar — and is trailing in both by huge margins.

Although the JD(U) has never been a major player in the national Capital, the current elections were significant because it was the first time that the BJP a formidable force in Delhi chose to take its smaller allies in Bihar along to take on the huge challenge posed by Arvind Kejriwal’s party, which is less than a decade old.

The tie-up in Delhi had been frowned upon by JD(U) national general secretary Pavan Varma a former diplomat, who aired his differences in the open and faced the axe.

Similar was the fate of Prashant Kishor whom the chief minister had made his party’s national vice-president and whose position in the JD(U) had become increasingly untenable on account of his collaboration with Kejriwal in the capacity of an election strategist.

An indignant Kishor has threatened to visit Patna after the dust settles in Delhi and unveil his future strategy, besides ‘exposing’ Kumar.

The torpid opposition in Bihar, led by Lalu Prasad’s RJD with the Congress as a major ally, is likely to experience a burst of vigour on account of the results in Delhi, despite their dismal performance, which came barely a couple of months after the BJP’s ouster in the adjoining Jharkhand.

However, the development is likely to be received with a sense of relief by the JD(U) as the party will now be even more hopeful that Nitish Kumar’s detractors in the BJP will be kept on a tight leash.

After the Lok Sabha polls last year, several BJP leaders in the state had begun to make statements that time had come for the saffron party to stake claim for the chief minister’s post, thereby threatening to upend the alliance with the JD(U).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/janta-malik-hai--says-nitish-kumar.html

145,12-2-20,"Sanskrit is spiritually pure of all languages, claim linguists","An international conference on languages held in Sarawak, Malaysia between February 5 and 8, selected Sanskrit as the language which emits the ‘most positive vibrations’ and ‘spiritually pure in nature’.

The Conference on Asian Linguistic Anthropology (CALA 2020) held at Sarawak analysed the findings on the research held in eight national and 11 international languages and came to the conclusion that ‘languages in written and spoken formats can emit either positive subtle or negative subtle vibrations’.

The scientific research on the spiritual purity of Sanskrit held by Dr Jayant Athawale, Rendy Ekrantio and Sean Clarke of the Maharshi Adhyatma Viswavidyalaya, Goa, and titled ‘Spiritual Vibrations of the Most Popular Languages And their Scripts’ found that languages differ at a vibrational level and have a subtle impact on the people using the language.

The MAV linguistic researchers used aura and energy scanners and measured the subtle positive and negative energies. According to Ekrantio, an Indonesian linguistic researcher, pursuing his research on Sanskrit and other languages in MAV, the team studied the subtle energy released by the translation of the sentence ‘The Sun Rises in the East and Sets in the West’ in eight national and 11 foreign languages. The subtle energy in the print out of sentence in each language was checked.

The languages with the Devanagari script had the most positive readings in contrast to the other languages, which emitted negative vibrations.

‘Sanskrit was found to be the language with the highest spiritual purity, followed by Marathi,’ said Ekrantio explaining the important observations and conclusions made by the team during the research.

To drive home that their findings were not something out of the blue, the scientists translated the same sentence into English, Mandarin and Sanskrit and studied how people’s aura gets affected by these languages.

The sentence — ‘The Sun rises in the East and sets in the West’ and the respective translations in the 3 languages by native speakers of that language were recorded. Two subjects of average spiritual level (which means that they were not doing any spiritual practice) were asked to listen to each recording for 10 minutes.

After listening to each recording the effect of the sentence on the subjects was measured. Neither of the subjects had any psychological affiliation for any of the 3 languages. Both the subjects were negatively influenced by the Chinese and English languages. This means that their auras became more negative.

Along with that, they lost any traces of positivity. However, when they listened to the sentence recorded in Sanskrit their negative aura reduced considerably and they gained a positive aura in just 10 minutes,’ said Sean Clarke, a former officer of the Indian Navy who quit his jobe to pursue his interest in

linguistics.

Parapanangadi Unnikrishna Panicker, leading Sanskrit scholar who belongs to the rare breed of students trained in the Gurukul system said that Sanskrit is the most civilised and cultured languages in the world because of its purest form. ‘Those who use the language on a daily basis understand its divinity and purity. This controversy over Sanskrit itself is unwarranted,’ said Panicker.

Ekrianto observed that educational institutions should keep the spiritual purity of the language in mind while choosing or promoting languages to be taught as part of the curriculum. Dr MG Gireeshan, physicist, vice-principal, and head of research, Jai Bharat College of Arts and Science said that he agreed with the findings of MAV scientists.

“The uniqueness of Sanskrit slokas is the sudden synchronization of high and low-frequency sound waves. This leads to a compression in the atmosphere resulting in the formation of positive fields and positive energy,” said Dr Gireeshan who felt this was an area which should be pursued with vigour.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sanskrit-is-spiritually-pure-of-all-languages--claim-linguists.html

President Trump will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump and they will visit India on February 24-25, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

She said, President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked on the telephone over the weekend.

“During a phone call over the weekend, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed the trip would further strengthen the India-US strategic partnership and highlight the strong and enduring bonds between the American and Indian people,” she said.

The President and the First Lady will travel to New Delhi and Ahmedabad, which is in Prime Minister Modi's home State of Gujarat and played an important role in Mahatma Gandhi's life and leadership of the Indian independence movement, the White House said.

Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had travelled to India in 2010 and 2015.

“President Trump's trip to India is timely in view of the bilateral trade issues that need to be resolved and in light of the collaborations between the US and India in various realms,” MR Rangaswami, Indian-American philanthropist and head of Indiaspora, told PTI.

Describing it as a significant visit, Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum, noted that the last three American presidents had made trips to India.

“It's essential to send a message to the region that India is a significant partner and the president values that,” Aghi told PTI.

India has a role to play not only in its immediate neighbourhood, but in making sure that the South China Sea and the Indo Pacific region is part of the international global order, he said.

Trump's visit follows Modi's tour of the US in September, during which he met with the US President in New York on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.

The meeting had come just days after the two leaders attended the mega 'Howdy Modi' rally in Houston which was attended by more than 50,000 Indian-Americans.

The two leaders also met in August at the G7 summit held in the French town of Biarritz.

Prime Minister Modi, while interacting with the media alongside President Trump, had rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/trump-to-visit-india-on-feb-24--25--white-house.html

Cruise ship Diamond Princess with 3,711 people on board arrived at the Japanese coast early last week and was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the novel virus on the ship.

Around 60 people tested positive of the virus on Monday, taking the total number of those infected on the ship to 130. Authorities had initially tested nearly 300 people when the ship arrived at the Japanese coast.

“The situation is being monitored closely,” an Indian Embassy official told PTI on asked if there are any arrangements made by the mission to deboard the Indians from the ship.

“There are a total of 138 Indian nationals on the ship. The Indian Embassy is in touch with them,” the official said, adding that the Indians on the ship have not been tested for coronavirus.

Those on the ship have been asked to wear masks and allowed limited access to the open decks as they are advised to remain in the cabins most of the times to contain the spread of the virus, according to media reports.

Meanwhile, the operator of the ship on Monday vowed to refund all 2,666 passengers due to the on board outbreak of the new coronavirus.

Carnival Japan Inc., the Japanese branch of Princess Cruise Lines Ltd., which operates the ship, said refunds will be offered via travel agencies through which the passengers made their bookings.

The company will additionally cover all costs incurred by those quarantined aboard the ship since last Tuesday, when passengers were originally scheduled to disembark at Yokohama.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/in-touch-with-citizens-on-board-japan-cruise-ship--indian-embassy.html

150,12-2-20,"Didi: Defeat of hatred, money power & victory of democracy","Describing BJP’s defeat and Aam Aadmi Party’s victory in Delhi Assembly elections as a defeat of hatred and money power and victory of democracy and development, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday attacked the saffron outfit saying it was fast becoming a ‘Stateless party’ with the federal States going out of its hands one after the other.

The Chief Minister who congratulated her Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal for his hat-trick in the Capital polls said ‘politics of hatred and politics of vendetta has lost to democratic forces and politics for development. The Delhi elections have once again proved that the people want food, development, employment, peace and not hatred…. Look how the people of India voted for the BJP in 2019 General elections and in return it gave the people Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens.’

She said if the BJP did not rectify itself then soon it will be routed from all the States in India. ‘They are fast becoming a stateless party and if they continue to spread hatred like this then they will soon they will get zero seats in India,’ she said accusing the BJP of playing politics of hate and vendetta to win elections.

‘Look how just eight months back they had tasted a resounding victory in the general elections. But they failed to retain that by taking anti-people steps. Today when the country’s economy is in the doldrums they are selling out the Government concerns, reducing jobs … and then in a bid to divert attention spreading politics of hatred. But the people of India have seen through their clever politics and have started rejecting them. Look how one after the other they lost Maharashtra, Jharkhand and now Delhi,’ she said.

‘The elections have proved that they have rejected their leaders, their money which they have been splurging to win elections and their spiteful politics… It has proved that false pride, fake news and money power will lead them nowhere in the Indian politics,’ she maintained.

On whether the Delhi elections were a referendum against the CAA and NRC, Banerjee remained non-committal on directly connecting the two issues. However she asserted ‘the people have made their minds clear that they want roti, kapra aur makaan more than anything else like NRC.’

She hoped the BJP will take a lesson from the defeat and retrace its steps and ‘reject CAA, NRC and other anti-people decisions.’

On whether she would attend Kejriwal’s swearing-in ceremony she said she would love to do that ‘but as you know my Assembly session is on and so I will have to take into account other engagements before taking a decision on attending his function in Delhi,’ adding ‘I have already congratulated Kejriwal ji for his massive victory.’

Calling Kejriwal as a leader who heralded development, the former Karnataka Chief Minister said people have taught a lesson for labelling him a ‘terrorist’ and also upheld the necessity of a regional party. ‘Heartfelt congratulations to @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty.

People of Delhi have showed that ‘fascist ideology’ will never win their hearts.

Congratulations to AAP and voters of Delhi for testifying that successful politics with development as criteria (to win polls), amidst money and muscle power,’ Kumaraswamy tweeted.

Welcoming the mandate of the people, he said in a series of tweets that the mature voter of Delhi did not change his stand, despite BJP’s might, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the entire Central Government on its side.

‘People have taught lesson for calling someone who heralded development (Kejriwal), a terrorist.

By upholding the necessity of a regional party, people of Delhi have also

set a model by clearly stating that development is their only priority,’ he said in another tweet.

Kumaraswamy was referring to remarks by BJP MP Parvesh Verma at a poll rally, calling Kejriwal a ‘terrorist’ over his alleged support to an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest in south Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.

Both Kumaraswamy and Kejriwal have bonded at several occasions in the past.

The Delhi Chief Minister had attended Kumaraswamy’s swearing in as Chief Minister of the coalition government in May last year.

152,12-2-20,Jan Ki Baat won over Mann Ki Baat: Uddhav,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said here on Tuesday that through Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party’s landslide victory in the Delhi Assembly polls, the people in the national Capital had shown that the country would henceforth run on ‘Jan Ki Baat’ and not ‘Mann Ki Baat’, while NCP chief Sharad Pawar said that the process of the BJP’s removal from power at the Centre had begun.

Uddhav took an indirect dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he congratulated Arvind Kejriwal and people of Delhi on AAP’s superlative performance in the Assembly polls.

Without taking Modi’s name, Uddhav – who is also the president of the Shiv Sena—said: “I would like to extend my heart-felt congratulations to Arvind Kejriwal and the people of Delhi on AAP’s victory in the Assembly polls. The people of the Delhi have shown that the country would henceforth run ‘Jan ki baat’ and not Rs Mann ki baat’ “.

“Despite the fact that there is a government of nationalistic ideology, the principal ruling party – despite having used all its might— could not withstand the power of humble broom (the AAP’s poll symbol). The strong party fielded its top leaders in its campaign, dubbed Kejriwal as a terrorist, ignored local issues and tried to divert the attention of people using international issues. Despite all this, the ruling party at the Centre could not defeat Arvind Kejriwal in the polls,” Uddhav said.

“The people of Delhi stood solidly behind a honest person who believed in development matters of the national capital and reposed their confidence in democracy. The people have not only shown that they are as patriotic as those in the ruling party at the Centre but they have also removed the misconception sought to be created by the party in question that all those opposing it were traitors,” the Sena president said.

Congratulating Kejriwal on behalf of Maharashtra and the Shiv Sena on AAP’s electoral success, Uddhav wished him all the best for his development-oriented tenure as the chief minister.

While congratulating Kejriwal on AAP’s victory in the Delhi Assembly polls, Pawar came out with a sharp reaction. “The process of the BJP’s removal from power at the Centre has begun. The BJP has already suffered defeats in the earlier Assembly polls. The serial of the BJP’s debacles will not end here. The people are now of the opinion that they want to elect governments that believe in development work”.

“In Delhi Assembly polls, the fight was basically between the two parties. The people did not consider the thrird party (Congress). More than whom to elect, the people showed that they were more interested in whom to defeat,” the NCP chief said.

“I am not all surprised by the outcome in the Delhi Assembly polls. A large number of Marathi-speaking people live in Delhi. When I made enquiries with them, they showed their preference to Arvind Kejriwal,” Pawar said.

“Despite the fact that Delhi is a State where Prime Minister Modi lives, people talk more about Arvind Kejriwal than the former. He has resolved the issues of people and children in the national capital are being inculcated with good values because of the good education they are being imparted,” the NCP chief said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/jan-ki-baat-won-over-mann-ki-baat--uddhav.html

‘He (Kejriwal) remembered Hanuman for the firsttime and recited Hanuman Chalisa and he was blessed by the Pawan Putra,’ he said.

The industry is keeping a close watch to see if shuttered factories in China reopen in the coming days and supplies resume sometime this week.

""Yes, the industry is already feeling the impact and some products and models have been impacted. It is still early to draw any conclusion as select factories are slated to resume production in a phased manner,"" India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA)

Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.

He declined to comment on the specifics, but added, ""we are in a wait-and-watch mode this entire week.""

Industry watchers, however, admitted that the situation on the ground is bad, as the supply lines for smartphones predominantly come from China. At the same time, they said the market itself is slow and demand sluggish.

When contacted, realme in an e-mailed response said its supply chain has not been affected for the time being and that ""there has been no significant effect in stocks/production for realme in India"" during the said period.

""All realme smartphones sold in India are manufactured in India, with more than 7500 local workforce and more than 50 per cent local supplies...Due to objective reasons such as logistics obstruction and delay in resumption of work caused by the epidemic, some supplies from China might face slight delays but no major impact as of now is there for our future product plans,"" it added.

The company said it is closely monitoring the impact on the smartphone industry.

E-mail queries sent to Xiaomi, Oppo, vivo and POCO on the impact on supplies went unanswered.

Meanwhile, reports suggest that one of the large contract manufacturers and component suppliers has resumed operations in one of its plants in China, but is operating with only a small fraction of its workforce.

The death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 1,016 with 108 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province, while the confirmed cases of infection have soared to 42,638.

Without naming Congress leader P Chidambaram, she took on the former finance minister for his remarks that the chief of defence staff should strongly protest against the reduced budget allocation for defence sector and that his party would stand in his support.

Talking about previous UPA government, Sitharaman said ""the entire defence ministry was paralysed, the defence of India was paralysed, they did not have an equipment and look at the way, bullet-proof dresses were not available"".

""What about Rafale? Why didn't they buy it?. So having paralysed the defence of India, it is very odd that a former minister wants the defence ministry to protest. I am shocked at the way in which governance is being treated,"" she said. In a marginal hike, the defence budget was increased to Rs 3.37 lakh crore for 2020-21 against last year's Rs 3.18 lakh crore, notwithstanding expectations of a significantly higher allocation to fast-track long-pending military modernisation efforts.

Sitharaman had served as Defence Minister in the first term of the Modi government.

Speaking on allegations and questions raised on the data and account fudging by the government, she highlighted that between 2005-2006 and 2010-11, every year there was issuance of oil bonds.

Referring to visible indicators of green shoots, the Finance Minister said the forex reserve is at an all time high and the stock market is upbeat.

""Global sentiment is in favour of India. Foreign investors continue to show confidence in India and that is why the country has attracted a net FDI of USD 24.4 billion in April-November 2019-20 as against USD 21.2 billion in the same period the previous year,"" she said.

166,12-2-20,Nath pushes for higher edu revamp,"Strengthening infrastructure, the Kamal Nath Government is ensuring that higher education opportunities are made available to each deserving and talented student in Madhya Pradesh.

As part of its plan to place a sustained impetus on higher education over the next three decades, the State Government, helmed by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, has ensured the land security of all Government colleges in the State.

The land belonging to over 170 colleges has been transferred to them and land records have been appended accordingly.

Leveraging technology the State higher education department is ensuring the uninterrupted transmission of virtual classrooms.

Besides helping meet standardised academic and skill development objectives, virtual classrooms are especially beneficial for students in relatively smaller or backward centers.

Robust measures are also being implemented across all campuses to imbibe students with enhanced soft skills to heighten their employment prospects.

In a bid to promote e-governance and real-time communication and coordination across all centres, the department has also created email accounts for 6,500 Government officials and employees and launched a new Content Management System (CMS) based website.

Streamlining procedures, college admissions have been linked to the mponline portal of the State Government. Launched during the academic session 2019-20, the move had resulted in a total 5.35 lakh admissions in campuses across the State.

An internal grievance redressal system has been made available online for State Government employees while a separate online module has been put in place for college teachers to help them file and assess Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs).

In an endeavour to promote notable academic and research work conducted by teachers, the achievements of nearly 2,200 faculty members are being linked to the department portal under the Rajiv Gyan Jyoti Mission.

Bringing full transparency in the system for appointment of assistant professors, librarians and sports officers, the State Government has made the application process available online. Nearly 3,000 applicants have benefited from the move.

Drawing on the expertise and experience of retired faculty members, the higher education department is in the process of setting up consultative committees for colleges and universities under the Margdarshan Yojna.

The State Government has been entrusted with a fund of Rs 104 crore under the centrally sponsored Rashtriya Uchhattar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).

While the Aadarsh Mahavidyalaya has been dedicated to citizens in the tribal dominated Jhabua district, another seven such ideal campuses are under various stages of completion in the State.

The development of infrastructure for two universities and eight new college campuses has also been completed.

A fund of Rs 22 crore has been earmarked for improvement of infrastructure and enhancement of quality at 200 college campuses chosen for the purpose.

Heightening private participation in the higher education sector, four new private universities have been established.

While two of these universities are based in the State capital, Bhopal, one each is located in Raisen and Jabalpur districts.

The State Government has initiated steps for the establishment of Knowledge Corporation Limited with a view to heighten quality in higher education and skill development initiatives.

In an attempt to motivate and promote better performance by colleges and faculty members, the higher education department will soon announce State level awards for excellence in higher education.

Decks have also been cleared for filling of faculty positions which have been lying vacant at colleges across the State.

Calling for an expansion and enhancement of higher education facilities, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has repeatedly underlined the need to ensure greater contributions from youth towards the creation of a happier, healthier and wealthier Madhya Pradesh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nath-pushes-for-higher-edu-revamp.html
167,12-2-20,Centre rejects AP govt’s proposal to release lumpsum payment,"The Centre has rejected Andhra Pradesh government’s proposal to release the payment under PM-KISAN scheme as a lumpsum amount instead of installments, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar informed Parliament on Tuesday. Under PM-KISAN, the central government provides a payment of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 to 14.5 crore farmers across the country.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Tomar said the Andhra Pradesh government under its Rythu Bharosa scheme proposed to give Rs 12,500 per year to each farmer family inclusive of a benefit of Rs 6,000 given under PM-KISAN. The state government scheme also aimed to cover the tenant farmers. “State government had requested to release the payments under PM-KISAN scheme as a lumpsum amount instead of payments in installments. The request of Government of Andhra Pradesh was not accepted...,” he said. The state’s proposal was “not accepted” because PM-KISAN was meant to provide income support to all land holding farmers’ families in the country, subject to certain exclusions.

An amount of Rs 2,000 was paid in three equal installments to enable farmers take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs so as to protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in farming activities, he added. The eligibility of farmers to join PM-KISAN is determined by the respective state governments on the basis of Operational Guidelines of the Scheme. As per the 2015-16 agriculture census, there are about 83.90 lakh landholdings in Andhra Pradesh. So far, 54.45 lakh farmers have registered under PM-KISAN, the Union Minister said in a separate reply. To those registered between December 2018 and March 31, 2019 in Andhra Pradesh, the centre has paid the first installment to 36.40 lakh beneficiaries, second installment to 34.11 lakh beneficiaries, third installment to 33.78 lakh beneficiaries and fourth installment to 31.35 lakh beneficiaries, he added.

To those registered between April and July 2019 in the state, the centre has released first installment to 7.92 lakh beneficiaries, second installment to 7.64 lakh beneficiaries and third installment to 7.35 lakh beneficiaries. To those registered between August and November 2019, the centre has released the first and second installment to only one beneficiary but to those registered between December 2019 and March 2020, the centre has paid the first installment to 6.84 lakh beneficiaries of Andhra Pradesh, the minister added.

Sharing all India figures, Tomar said a total of 9.60 crore farmer families across India have been successfully registered under PM-KISAN as on February 6. Of this, 8.44 crore beneficiaries have received benefits. Against the budgetary allocation of Rs 75,000 crore for this fiscal, funds amounting to Rs 44,516.7 crore have been transferred in the bank accounts of beneficiaries across the country, he added. Tomar said PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing scheme in which the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned states on PM-Kisan web-portal. The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by the concerned states/union territories undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various agencies concerned before making payment to the beneficiaries. Hence, merely registration on the portal does not ensure benefit transfer to the beneficiaries, he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/centre-rejects-ap-govt---s-proposal-to-release-lumpsum-payment.html

Led by gains in index heavyweights RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 236.52 points, or 0.58 per cent, higher at 41,216.14. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 76.40 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 12,107.90. NTPC, Maruti Suzuki, SBI, PowerGrid, Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement and Axis Bank rose up to 2.95 per cent. On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Mahindra and Mahindra, Nestle India, TCS and Sun Pharma shed up to 0.75 per cent. Global markets rose as China re-opened for business after a forced extension to the Lunar New Year holiday because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 1,000 people and disrupted major global supply chains. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul settled with significant gains. Japanese markets remained shut for a holiday. Stock exchanges in Europe also opened on a positive note. “Easing concerns over the coronavirus issue after the drop in fresh cases came as a breather for markets. Since the full impact of the virus issue still remains unknown the extended shutdown is expected to dent economic growth this quarter.

“We expect the domestic market to stay focused on the last batch of Q3 numbers and CPI inflation for the month of January. As per the consensus, inflation is expected to remain elevated confirming the recent action by the central bank,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

169,12-2-20,‘Coronovirus unlikely to impact Indian port operators’,"Coronavirus outbreak in China is expected to have a minimal impact on the Indian ports it rates due to low China-related throughput they handle, ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Tuesday. The agency, however, said the outbreak is a “credit negative” for port operators in Asia Pacific.

Over 800 people have died since the oubreak last month in China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it as a global emergency. The rating agency said the share of China-linked container cargo is less than 5 per cent by volume for the Indian ports it rates. Additioally, manufacturers will likely seek alternative sources of supply for components to the extent that supply chain disruptions in China persist, it said.

Similarly, on the bulk handling side, Moody’s said the domestic ports it rates handle “negligible” volumes linked to China and are unlikely to be impacted. The outbreak is credit negative for Asia-Pacific’s port operators as it is disrupting domestic and global supply chains and lowering discretionary consumer spending, which will reduce the throughput growth of Asia-Pacific’s ports in 2020, the agency added.

Extended factory shutdowns in China and containment measures in Asia-Pacific countries have hit manufacturing and logistics sectors in China because of shortage of workers and manufacturing parts, creating knock-on effects for global supply chains, it explained. It added that shipping companies like AP Moller-Maersk and CMA CGM SA recently announced blank sailings — reducing vessel calls to China — reflecting weakened output from China and low global trade activity because of the outbreak. On the cruise shipping side, the quarantine of ships in Hong Kong and Japan will reduce the activity, it said. Additionally, containment measures by countries will lower cruise docking at terminals and therefore the revenue derived from this business activity, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---coronovirus-unlikely-to-impact-indian-port-operators---.html
170,12-2-20,Govt to clarify on use of railway land by Concor,"The government will clarify on use of concessional railway land by Concor before the country’s largest container train operator is privatised, an official said on Tuesday. The Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor) has built terminals to house containers on land leased from the Indian Railways on a per container licence fee basis. On the other hand, terminals run by existing private container train operators are built on land purchased from the market.

Also, Concor currently gets land from the Indian Railways at a concessional rate as compared to other inter-modal operators, an arrangement which may have to be altered once the firm is privatised. Firms such as Adani Ports may be interested in picking up stake in Concor but would like clarity on the land use as well as the concessional arrangement the firm has with railways for transportation of containers. The Cabinet, in November last year, had approved strategic sale of 30.8 per cent stake, along with management control, in Concor out of the government equity of 54.80 per cent. The government will retain 24 per cent stake post sell-off but without any veto powers. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) held roadshows for the strategic sale of Concor in Canada and Singapore last month during which investors had raised queries on land usage post its strategic disinvestment. “Investors have raised queries on the land issue and asked to make very clear submission in what way the leased land, where the Concor has established its stations, would be available going forward and what will be the pricing,” an official told PTI.

He said the Ministry of Railways will clarify the policy before the Expression of Interest (EoI) inviting bidders is issued. “This is an issue that is to be resolved,” the official said. Shares of Concor closed at Rs 574.35, up 0.25 per cent on the BSE. At the current market price, sale of 30.8 per cent stake in Concor would fetch the exchequer over Rs 30,000 crore. The government has set a disinvestment target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore in the next fiscal from CPSEs, up from Rs 65,000 crore in the revised estimates of Budget this fiscal.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-to-clarify-on-use-of-railway-land-by-concor.html

172,12-2-20,Trump admn proposes $1.5bn fund,"The Trump administration has proposed $1.5 billion in budgetary allocation for 2021 fiscal for the strategic Indo-Pacific, which it said was part of its efforts to ensure that the region remains free, open, and independent of ""malign Chinese influence"".

China has been trying to spread its influence in the resource-rich Indo-Pacific region. To counter Beijing, the US has been pushing for a broader role by India in the strategically important region.

Beijing lays claim to huge swathes of the sea in the South China Sea where it has set up military facilities and artificial islands.

The US has long accused China of bullying Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei who have contesting claims over the South China Sea.

The White House in its budgetary proposal for the financial year 2021, beginning October 1, 2020, said, the future of the Indo-Pacific, which contains roughly half the world's population and many of the fastest-growing economies, is critical to US security and long-term economic interests.""

""The Budget provides USD1.5 billion for the Indo-Pacific, reflecting a strong Administration commitment to ensuring that the region remains free, open, and independent of malign Chinese influence,"" it said.

This funding supports democracy programmes, strengthens security cooperation, improves economic governance and facilitates private sector-led economic growth, the White House said.

A total of USD 30 million has been included in the budget for the global engagement centre dedicated to countering foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation from China, it added.

The budget also provides USD 0.8 billion for the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for private sector development internationally to support corporate growth in less-developed countries and to provide a transparent, high-quality alternative to ""predatory Chinese international lending"" in the Indo-Pacific and other strategic regions, it said.

In the budgetary proposals, the Pentagon alleged that Beijing continued to violate the sovereignty of Indo-Pacific nations and expand its control abroad under the pretense of the Belt and Road infrastructure investments.

According to the Pentagon, in the Indo-Pacific, the Department of Defense is strengthening and evolving US partnerships into a security architecture that helps uphold a ""free and open"" order.

""With India, DoD is expanding military-to-military cooperation and improving interoperability, including by establishing a new tri-service amphibious exercise, TIGER TRIUMPH,"" the Pentagon said.

The US, India and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China flexing its military muscles in the region, which is a large swathe of land and sea stretching all the way from the west coast of the US to the shores of east Africa.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-admn-proposes--1-5bn-fund-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trump-admn-proposes--1-5bn-fund.html

174,12-2-20,15 Rohingya refugees drown after boat sinks off B’desh,"At least 15 women and children drowned and more than 50 others were missing after a boat overloaded with Rohingya refugees sank off southern Bangladesh as it tried to reach Malaysia on Tuesday, officials said.

Some 138 people — mainly women and children — were packed on a trawler barely 13 metres (40 feet) long, trying to cross the Bay of Bengal, a coast guard spokesman told AFP.

“It sank because of overloading. The boat was meant to carry maximum 50 people. The boat was also loaded with some cargo,” another coast guard spokesman, Hamidul Islam, added.

Seventy-one people have been rescued including 46 women. Among the dead, 11 were women and the rest children. Anwara Begum said two of her sons, aged six and seven, drowned in the tragedy. “We were four of us in the boat... Another child (son, aged 10) is very sick,” the 40-year-old told AFP. Fishermen tipped off the coast guard after they saw survivors swimming and crying for help in the sea.

The boat’s keel hit an undersea coral in shallow water off Saint Martin’s island, Bangladesh’s southernmost territory, before it sank, survivors said. “We swam in the sea before boats came and rescued us,” said survivor Mohammad Hossain, 20.

Coast guard commander Sohel Rana said three survivors, including a Bangladeshi, were detained over human trafficking allegations. Nearly one million Rohingya live in squalid camps near Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar, many fleeing the neighbouring country after a 2017 brutal military crackdown.

With few opportunities for jobs and education in the camps, thousands have tried to reach other countries like Malaysia and Thailand by attempting the hazardous 2,000-kilometre journey.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/15-rohingya-refugees-drown-after-boat-sinks-off-b---desh.html

181,12-2-20,LPG price hiked by Rs 144.5 per cylinder,"Cooking gas LPG price on Wednesday was hiked by a steep Rs 144.5 per cylinder due to spurt in benchmark global rates of the fuel.

But to insulate domestic users, the government almost doubled the subsidy it provides on the fuel to keep per cylinder outgo almost unchanged.

LPG price was increased to Rs 858.50 per 14.2 kg cylinder from Rs 714 previously, according to a price notification of state-owned oil firms.

This is the steepest hike in rates since January 2014 when prices had gone up by Rs 220 per cylinder to Rs 1,241.

Domestic LPG users, who are entitled to buy 12 bottles of 14.2-kg each at subsidised rates in a year, will get more subsidy.

The government subsidy payout to domestic users has been increased from Rs 153.86 per cylinder to Rs 291.48, industry officials said.

For Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries, the subsidy has increased from Rs 174.86 to Rs 312.48 per cylinder.

After accounting for the subsidy that is paid directly into the bank accounts of LPG users, a 14.2-kg cylinder would cost Rs 567.02 for domestic users and Rs 546.02 for PMUY users.

The government gave out 8 crore free LPG connections to poor women under PMUY to increase coverage of environment-friendly fuel in kitchens.

Normally, LPG rates are revised on 1st of every month but this time it took almost two weeks for the revision to take place - a phenomenon which industry officials said was due to approvals needed for such a big jump in subsidy outgo.

Others said the decision to defer the increase could have been because of assembly elections in Delhi.

However, the official said that as of now there is no clarity if the trade pact will be signed during President Trump's visit on February 24-25.

Multiple rounds of talks have taken place between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in the past few weeks over telephone.

The two countries are negotiating a trade package to iron out certain issues and promote two-way commerce.

India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and greater market access for its products from sectors like agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, data localisation, and cut on import duties on some information and communication technology (ICT) products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.

184,12-2-20,"Coronavirus death toll in China crosses 1,000","Global efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak intensified on Tuesday with a team of WHO experts holding in-depth exchanges with specialists here, as the death toll from the deadly infection in China crossed 1,000 while the confirmed cases rose to 42,708.

The World Health Organisation convened a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday to fast-track promising tests, drugs and vaccines to help slow the outbreak that has spread to over 20 countries, including India.

The death toll on Monday rose to 1,017 with confirmed cases totalling to 42,708 in China. The confirmed cases abroad have gone up to 390, health officials here said.

A 15-member advance team of the WHO specialists led by Bruce Aylward, a veteran of past public health emergencies which arrived here on Monday night, began consultations with their Chinese counterparts on Tuesday.

They will join with Chinese experts to conduct in-depth exchanges on the situation and epidemic prevention and control, China’s Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said.

“We welcome experts from all countries, including the United States, to participate in the team of experts. We believe that after consultation and communication, we can

make appropriate arrangements for the joint team in China,” he said.

Some 400 scientists will be meeting on February 11-12 in Geneva to discuss all aspects of the virus, the WHO announced. “On 11-12 February, WHO is convening a global research and innovation forum to mobilise international action, and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities to contribute to the control of #2019nCoV,” a WHO tweet said.

This is the biggest gathering of specialists to evaluate the coronavirus which surfaced in December last year and wreaked havoc in China.

The Chinese Government has sealed 18 cities with over 50 million people in the virus-hit Hubei province including its provincial capital Wuhan to prevent its spread.

Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO told the media in Geneva that it is important to have risk management procedures associated with the virus are worked out at the earliest.

“You can’t shut the world either and normal activity must go on,” he said. The two-day forum in Geneva will try to work out a roadmap to deal with the coronavirus in China and around the world. This includes the development of medication and vaccines, state run CGTN TV reported on Tuesday.

The world’s leading experts will bring together all their expertise from around the globe to focus their attention on how best to try and defeat the coronavirus, the report said.

They will examine issues like how to fill the knowledge gaps of virus, focus their discussions on specifics like how it is transmitted in particular. Most crucial is to develop medicine in particular and a vaccine to contain it.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has removed several senior officials in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, for their mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Those sacked included the party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission, and the head of the commission, official media reported.

Last week, three Chinese officials of the Red Cross Society in Hubei province were punished for improperly dealing with donations for the prevention and control of the epidemic.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-death-toll-in-china-crosses-1-000.html

“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was quoted by the official Chinese media as saying at a media conference in Geneva on Tuesday.

189,12-2-20,Re-shape education,"Technology can have a major impact on classroom teaching. Amol Arora shares trends that can no longer be ignored by the sector

Technology has changed the way we look at the world . With various path-breaking technologies emerging every year, we are observing changes in different spheres, education being no exception. Keeping up with the emerging technology trends can have a major impact on the way education is being imparted in schools today. It will help offer students with latest opportunities and unique learning experiences that they need and deserve.

What exactly are the educational technology trends that have been making major waves in the recent years? Here’s a list of trends in the current education environment that you should not miss out on.

Digital Books

Digital textbooks have brought a radical transformation in the world of education, with higher education slowly adopting the digital era. Learning from plain textbooks in traditional classrooms is not exciting and would be outdated soon. Digital textbooks and Tablets are engaging and help save many textbooks every year. Textbooks are getting more expensive as they need to be revised or updated every few years. Textbooks are usually used for at least seven years before a new edition comes out, not giving children access to the latest information. A digital textbook or a Tablet is not only cost efficient but can easily be updated to reflect the most recent data. It helps provide students with the best content with the best learning outcomes at the best possible prices!

Multi-sensory Classrooms

With advanced technology, classrooms are now being given a multi-sensory learning environment through interactive whiteboards. They are a smart way to help students learn better and engage them completely. They offer a huge step forward in educating the next generation of students. Interactive whiteboards support visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning styles, leading to consistent improvement in the learning outcomes. They aid in teaching abstract and complex concepts to the students in a more engaging and fun way. They also allow teachers to record instructions which can later be shared with the students for revision.

Remote Learning

This is reshaping education like never before. There are no limitations of time and distance, and all one needs is a reliable wi-fi connection paired with apt mobile technologies. High quality of learning is made possible for students by providing them access to educators or subject matter experts who may not be reached due to distance or time constraint. Education can be tailored to suit the needs of the students when various technologies like video conferencing, social media, pre-recorded videos, class forum are clubbed. Remote learning model also allows students who to attend classes virtually.

Interactive Gamification

This concept of applies game-design thinking to various classroom activities to make them more engaging and fun. Educational video content can be taken to the next level by adding gamification. Interactive things are always more easy to remember and retain. Learning process can become easy. The whole idea is to use the typical game technique of giving challenges, give rewards to winners, then provide harder challenges with even bigger rewards. There is a science behind it. When you win at a game, your mind releases dopamine that triggers motivation and pleasure. This makes learning an overall positive experience, one that you don’t have to force students to enjoy. The main concept of interactive gamification is to challenge the students, let them feel great about overcoming the challenge, then challenge them more.

VR and AR

Virtual Reality (VR) is the next big thing in the education sector, enhancing student learning and engagement. It cuts across all the barriers and gives a feeling of things being right in front of your eyes. Students find themselves immersed in what they are learning and are able to process the information better.

Augmented Reality (AR) is another technology that can take learning to the next level. The educators can use AR in innovative ways to make any boring lesson interesting and interactive. It can be used to overlay interactive digital elements like text, image, video clip and animation to give real-time experience. The AR can promote 21st century skills like critical thinking analysis, creativity and problem-solving.

Block-chain Technology

Another emerging technology is block-chain technology which is especially useful when there is a need to collaborate distributed information in a database. In education sector, it can prove to be very useful in exam management, verification of student credentials and certificate verification.

Life-long learning records can also be managed using Block-chain. Learning, being a broad process calls for effective analysing and tracking to understand the results better. Learning analytics using emerging block-chain technology, is reshaping how learning behaviours of children are being monitored. It is helping teachers to provide students with targeted improvement to courses and help them deliver enhanced results.

Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is the latest buzzword that is finding its way into various sectors, including education. AI has revolutionised the way curriculums are being implemented in schools, and has given birth to innovative ideas.

There are various AI applications for education today that have made learning more convenient and personalised. Thanks to smart devices, the educational materials are becoming more accessible to students. It has also resulted in automation of administrative jobs, allowing educators to spend more time with students. In future, AI can also aid in providing detailed analysis of student performance in the examinations, as a teachers' ability to comprehend student performance has its own limitations. As per studies, adoption of AI in education sector will explode over the next five years.

These were a few trends that have taken the education sector by storm. There is so much to discover and the opportunities ahead are very exciting.

190,12-2-20,‘Set realistic and practical study goals’,"Exams are round the corner. With it comes hours of exhaustive study and revision. Panicking is common among students. CHANDAN PODDAR shares tips that can help

A little stress can be a good thing: It can be that motivational push that we need to get things done. After months of attending lectures in schools, coaching classes, submitting different assignments and attempting to read around your subjects, exam season is finally here. With it comes hours of exhaustive study and revision, which can be a difficult thing to manage. Panicking before, during or even after an exam is common among students.

Remember that there is usually a rational solution to every problem, even if you can’t see it at first glance.The earlier you start, the more prepared you will be. Starting early allows you some extended time to learn and revise the contents. As rote learning is just not effective for everyone and will only create more stress.

Plan your revision to utilise the times when you think you are at the peak of your productivity levels. Setting realistic or practical goals, whether you have several weeks, days or hours before your exam, helps you to put everything into perspective - acceptance of your situation and working within the realms of what all you have maximises your output.

Below are tips that can help:

Devote at least one hour to one subject.

Inform your parents that you are going to study and not to disturb meanwhile.

Focus on past examination questions to understand the perfect nature of the exam. Generally, eighty per cent of paper comes from past examination questions.

Give your best without thinking rest. Do as much as you can then prey the God to fill in the blank.

Take the blessings of parents and touch their feet every morning.

Before starting studies, remember Almighty for at least five minutes and ask for the strength to complete your targets.

Research says that revising with peers is an effective study technique as it allows individuals to better absorb their subject. Ask a friend or your parents for help. Asking for help is never shameful. Sometimes it may be useful to have someone hear you summarise points or to practise an oral presentation.

Stress and sleep have a two-way relationship. Effective time management includes getting enough rest and good sleep, which leaves you feeling more energised so that you’re able to focus when studying.

Have a clean, quiet, well-ventilated space to work, with easy access to any materials you need. Find out exactly what the exam involves. Are there past exam papers you can look at to help you understand what to expect?

Make a plan of what you want to cover in each study period. Take regular short breaks of about five-10 minutes. Don’t consume energy drinks, coffee or any other stimulants as these can make you feel agitated; drink water instead. Avoid junk food also.

Reward or pamper yourself when you achieve your study goals, such as watching an episode of your favourite TV show or going for a walk. Work out on how long you have for each question and stick to it. If you have time at the end you can complete unfinished questions. Work on questions that you find easiest first. Manage time before the end of the exam to revise answers and make necessary changes, if any.

Last but not the least: Believe in yourself.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---set-realistic-and-practical-study-goals---.html
191,12-2-20,mindIT,"Education in every sense is one of the essential factors on which the growth and sustainable economic development of a country depend. It enhances people's understanding of themselves and the world. By raising people's productivity and creativity, education facilitates entrepreneurship and technological advances, which further helps in securing the economic and social progress of the country.

But, while it is easier for the students in urban cities to access education through schools/colleges that are complemented by state-of-the-art infrastructure, facilities, and teachers, schools in rural areas of India struggle with necessary facilities like toilets and lack a proper teaching staff. Needless to say, this results in a reduced sense of motivation among students and becomes a significant cause of poor quality of education in rural areas.

Cracking competitive examination a distant dream for small-town and rural students: In India, admissions in a majority of prestigious colleges and selection for most of the Government jobs are decided by competitive exams like GATE, SSC JE and others. Unfortunately, only the students from big cities and financially sound background can afford coaching fees to be able to crack these exams. A significant number of aspirants in tier II and tier II cities, as well as the rural provinces, have no access to quality and affordable training to appear for such examinations to secure dream jobs that can take them ahead in life and make them capable of improving their living situations. They also lack the motivation on the back of cut-throat competition from students of metro cities preparing through the assistance of coaching centres.

Dawn of ed-tech platforms making quality education accessible to all: To battle this imminent problem, there are a handful of coaching institutes that are taking the online route to deliver high-quality learning to the underprivileged students of the country. Their motive is to facilitate every economically-backward student to live their dream and achieve something big in life through the provision of quality education at subsidised rates. The online education platforms get highly-experienced and educated faculty onboard to deliver online lectures to students from rural areas at a minimum cost, compared to offline coaching institutes. This enables the students to not only get access to the quality education they lacked but also get taught by teachers who are enthusiastic about teaching, which goes a long way in boosting their morale.

Stressing on vernacular content: While online education enhances the learning outcome of students, language poses a barrier when it comes to teaching in rural areas. Since India is home to a huge population of multilingual individuals that speak and read in different languages, other than English or Hindi, educators need to craft vernacular content to effectively cater to this segment. This reflects in the lower CAGR at which English users are expected to grow by 2021, which is only 3% as compared to 18% of the regional language users.

Understanding the magnitude of vernacular content in online learning platforms, edtech players have started rolling out fresh content in various languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Malayalam, among others, thus making learning accessible, especially to those students who fail to crack various competitive exams due to poor command in English or Hindi languages.

There are 300 million students in India and a huge chunk of residing in villages and small towns where quality learning material is not easily accessible. Considering every student is born talented, all they need is the right guidance. As per KPGM Google Report, the size of online education in India will be $1.96 billion by 2021. However, it is now the Government's responsibility to pay more attention to this area by creating a highly scalable Internet network infrastructure in rural India to avoid any hurdle in the process of delivering unmatched learning experiences to the student community in India.

194,12-2-20,Study abroad ‘There are perks minus stiff competition’,"Students can avail several benefits under new policies in Australia, says Rohit Sethi

Australia has traditionally been among the top study abroad destinations for students in India. The new rules effectively revised the definition of regional areas in the country. Following their implementation in the end of 2019, Regional Australia now includes all of the country with the exception of three areas — Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne.

It is an obvious fact that cities — epicenters of innovation and progress — provide a superior range of access, opportunities, and options. So, how does asking students to shift to regions that are comparatively less equipped with facilities and amenities be to their advantage?

While cities indeed represent a treasure trove of lucrative opportunities, the same also causes urban hubs to become overcrowded. This naturally results in the competition for said opportunities – be it educational or employment – to rise in intensity. By encouraging migration to Regional Australia, the Federal Government is providing students and migrants with the opportunity to avail more or less equivalent – if not superior – perks minus the stiff competition.

But that’s not the end of it. Top benefits that students stand to avail under the new policies

Favorable post-study work visa terms: As compared to those studying in cities, international students willing to study at regional universities stand to avail one extra year on their post-study work visa, as per the revised regulations.

Extra benefits in points system for PR: New rules also benefits in extra benefits in points system which make them eligible for Permanent Residency (PR) to international students who choose to study at regional universities.

Special tertiary scholarships: Under the new policy, nearly 1,000 scholarships will be granted annually for the next four years to both domestic and international students applying for regional universities after November 2019.

195,12-2-20,Secure your future with AI,"Want to manage your business? AI is transforming it and plays a central role in cloud telephony. Yatish Mehrotra tells you how

Starting an entrepreneurial journey is exciting. Individuals who embark on such journeys are usually ambitious, motivated, and have a vision. Today, it is easier than ever to be an entrepreneur because many new technologies make managing a business simpler. While the element of risk that comes with starting a business remains; it is easier to manage using technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud telephony.

To remain competitive most businesses use AI and cloud telephony. To stay competitive new businesses must adopt them too. Both technologies confer advantages to companies that use them; some such benefits are as follow.

Easy to set-up

An advantage of using cloud telephony instead of PBX and EPBAX lines is that the former can be set up in less than a day, often in a matter of hours. A PBX or EPBAX line, on the other hand, may take days to become operational. In the competitive world of business, it is essential to deliver services as quickly as possible; this makes cloud telephony a vital technology for businesses.

There are other advantages of using cloud telephony too. Everyone knows that traditional phone lines are prone to becoming inoperative during bad weather. For entrepreneurs, not hearing a dial tone when they need to make an urgent call is frustrating. Because entrepreneurs value efficiency and time, they recognise cloud telephony as an ideal communication technology. A cloud telephony system never fails even in the harshest weather.

In addition to failure during bad weather, traditional PBX and EPBAX lines are prone to crash for a variety of other reasons. Hence the reliability of cloud telephony systems is an important reason why entrepreneurs adopt them.

Grows with businesses

Entrepreneurs who use PBX and EPBAX lines must change their businesses phone number when they move to new premises. A unique business number every few years diminishes an enterprises image. Customers and vendors may view it as unreliable. Also, customers who don’t have its new number may not be able to buy its products and services.

The problem of having to change phone numbers when relocating is not an issue with cloud telephony. A business that uses cloud telephony doesn’t need to change its phone numbers when it moves to new offices. It may change offices as many times as necessary and still use the number it had in its first location. Businesses that have the same phone number they did when they opened enjoy greater trust.

Another even more significant advantage of using cloud telephony is the system can be effortlessly scaled up or down. As a business’ requirements grow its cloud telephony system matches them. When a business’ employee strength grows from ten to one hundred its infrastructure requirements change. It needs more telephone numbers and lines to accommodate the larger workforce. Cloud telephony is an ideal technology because growing business can quickly increase the number of their telephone lines.

Because cloud telephony can be scaled rapidly, businesses can increase the number of lines they use when they expect a surge in call volumes. When call volumes taper, they can easily use fewer lines. Rapid scalability such as this offers enormous advantages to businesses. Business can quickly buy subscriptions to match an increase in demand and vice-versa.

AI gives an edge

A cloud telephony system stores data on the cloud where sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms can analyse it. AIs ability to analyse and glean insights from data stored on the cloud gives businesses that use cloud telephony an advantage. AI is becoming more intelligent every month, making its predictions about future events highly accurate.

For instance, a company that uses a cloud telephony system may find the system alerts an agent that an incoming call is from someone angry at his employer. It may also make useful suggestions to help placate such callers. AI can’t replace agents, but as it grows more powerful, it can make the agents better at their jobs.

In addition to alerting agents about callers’ temperament, AI can inform entrepreneurs about their customers’ intents. AI is intelligent enough to predict with a high rate of probability which customers are considering ending their relationship with the business.

By bringing to the attention of entrepreneurs those customers who are considering ending their relationship with a company, AI gives time to act and win back trust.

Most entrepreneurs today understand that using a cloud telephony system is important for their business to succeed. They like the flexibility of being able to scale the system as their organisation grows and cancelling subscriptions when needed.

AI is transforming business and plays a central role in cloud telephony. Entrepreneurs want to use AI to manage their enterprise; cloud telephony lets them do so. The predictive ability of AI, when deployed among dozens of employees, adds considerable value to a business; entrepreneurs recognise this.

People driven by the zeal to succeed on entrepreneurial journeys and have fun along the way know some technologies help do both. Cloud telephony is considered a valuable tool by young entrepreneurs because most of them know innovative technologies are critical drivers of success. Such entrepreneurs are digital natives who recognise that adopting technology in businesses increases productivity. They are comfortable with technology and understand its potential.

198,12-2-20,MBA outlook 2020 report,"Shiksha, a part of Info Edge Limited recently conducted a survey on MBA aspirants and rolls out the survey report titled MBA Outlook 2020 that touches every aspect of the students who want to pursue a post-graduation degree in management. The study rightly identifies the changing trends, factors and mindset of MBA aspirants and the parameters that play a crucial role in the college selection process.

MBA Outlook 2020, a study on and for MBA students conducted by Shiksha, highlights 10 different facets. These are:

Popular MBA entrance exams across regions: According to the report, XAT, IIFT, CMAT, NMAT, SNAP and UPSEE are popular entrance exams apart from CAT and MAT in the North.

CAT and MAH-CET are the most popular entrance exams in West followed by CMAT, SNAP, NMAT and MAT. On the other hand, MAT is more popular than CAT in eastern India followed by IIFT, IBSAT, SNAP, NMAT,TISSNET and OJEE.

Average count of MBA entrance exams given by students across regions in India: The data shows 86 per cent of the students in South enrol for two or fewer MBA entrance exams whereas this average stands at 69 per cent in North and Central India. In West and East of India, as many as 85 per cent students enrol for only three or fewer MBA entrance exams. The percentage of students, who enrol for four or more entrance exams, is the highest in Central India at 23 per cent followed by West, East and North with an average of 14 per cent. In South India, there are only 5 per cent such students.

College location preference (region-wise) for MBA students in India: Over 75 per cent of the students from South and West want to study in their respective regions, the report says. However, there are only 25 per cent such students in Central and East. Students from all across India except those from the Central and Eastern regions are least interested in studying MBA from Central and Eastern regions.

Cities preferred by students to study MBA in India: The report shows 70 per cent of the students from West India want to study in more than 400 MBA colleges located at Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. The majority of the students from East India are more interested in large cities such as Bengaluru, Delhi, Pune and Kolkata. Only 22 per cent of the students from East want to study in their own region.

Information most wanted by aspirants while researching for MBA colleges in India: According to the study, authentic or verified college reviews given by students and college rankings published by credible sources are considered necessary information by students while researching, followed by placement, fees &scholarship, admission requirements, programmes offered and alumni success stories.

Only 10 per cent of the students in North India prefer International Business as their MBA specialisation.

Of all the MBA specialisations Business Analytics & Digital Marketing are gaining swift popularity among the students.

Top representatives of a college that students want to interact with for admission related information: Aspirants prefer to interact with current students of colleges to get more information and resolve their doubts and confusion, the report unveils. Colleges should focus on the interaction of their current students with prospective students for better engagement and higher conversions.

Top concerns of students before taking admission in a college in a particular region: Shiksha survey 2020 shows, College reputation and accreditation is by far the most important concern of the students across India. Financial concerns are the second most important criterion for the students across India except North, Central and South, where skill learning and student development become a larger concern. Most of these concerns are evenly spread across regions. Concerns such as discrimination, poor infra and student diversity are of least importance across regions in India except for North and South.

Top value-ads that students are looking for from a college before deciding on admission: A corporate exposure/projects and skill development programmes are prominent value-ads for the students from North and East. Colleges can use them as a marketing proposition to influence students’ decisions.

Work-experience while studying, practical classes and new & advanced equipment are emerging value-ads for the students from Central India.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/mba-outlook-2020-report.html

202,12-2-20,‘There are perks minus stiff competition’,"Students can avail several benefits under new policies in Australia, says Rohit Sethi

Australia has traditionally been among the top study abroad destinations for students in India. The new rules effectively revised the definition of regional areas in the country. Following their implementation in the end of 2019, Regional Australia now includes all of the country with the exception of three areas — Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne.

It is an obvious fact that cities — epicenters of innovation and progress — provide a superior range of access, opportunities, and options. So, how does asking students to shift to regions that are comparatively less equipped with facilities and amenities be to their advantage?

While cities indeed represent a treasure trove of lucrative opportunities, the same also causes urban hubs to become overcrowded. This naturally results in the competition for said opportunities – be it educational or employment – to rise in intensity. By encouraging migration to Regional Australia, the Federal Government is providing students and migrants with the opportunity to avail more or less equivalent – if not superior – perks minus the stiff competition.

But that’s not the end of it. Top benefits that students stand to avail under the new policies

Favorable post-study work visa terms: As compared to those studying in cities, international students willing to study at regional universities stand to avail one extra year on their post-study work visa, as per the revised regulations.

Extra benefits in points system for PR: New rules also benefits in extra benefits in points system which make them eligible for Permanent Residency (PR) to international students who choose to study at regional universities.

Special tertiary scholarships: Under the new policy, nearly 1,000 scholarships will be granted annually for the next four years to both domestic and international students applying for regional universities after November 2019.

203,12-2-20,"Didn’t deserve to win: Kohli criticises bowling, fielding","India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday berated his bowlers for their mediocre performance as he tried to explain the team’s first ODI series whitewash in over three decades, saying that the visitors lacked composure all through.

“The games were not as bad as the scoreline suggests. It boils down to those chances that we didn’t grab. I don’t think it was enough to win games in international cricket,” Kohli said in the post-match presentation.

“With the ball, we were not able to make breakthroughs, we were not at all good on the field. We haven’t played so badly but when you don’t grab those chances, you don’t deserve to win,” he added.

“Batsmen coming back from tough situations was a positive sign for us, but the way we fielded and bowled, the composure wasn’t enough to win games,” he asserted.

The ineffectiveness of Indian bowlers can be gauged from the fact that the attack couldn’t dismiss the complete rival line-up even once.

Kohli lauded New Zealand for bouncing back after the T20 hammering.

“New Zealand played with lot more intensity. We didn’t deserve to win because we did not show enough composure,” he said.

The batting mainstay is looking forward to the Test series, which begins on February 21, to make amends for the disappointment.

“I think because of the Test Championship, every match has that more importance. We have a really balanced Test team and we feel we can win the series here, but we need to step on to the park with the right kind of mindset,” he said.

His opposite number Kane Williamson, who missed the first two games due to injury, was lavish in his praise for the home team’s grit.

“An outstanding performance, very clinical. India put us under pressure, but the way the guys fought back with the ball and kept them to a par total. The cricket in the second half was outstanding to see,” he said referring to the side’s effortless chase of a 297-run target.

“We know how good they (India) are at all formats but for us the clarity about the roles the guys had was the most important thing. Outstanding effort against a brilliant India side,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/didn---t-deserve-to-win--kohli-criticises-bowling--fielding.html
204,12-2-20,Success is the sweetest revenge,"In a stunning reversal of fortunes, an underwhelming India suffered their first ODI series whitewash in more than three decades as New Zealand completed a 3-0 sweep with a five-wicket victory in the third match at Bay Oval in Tauranga on Tuesday.

It is the first whitewash for India in 31 years in a series in which all matches have been played. They were beaten 5-0 by the West Indies back in 1989 in an away assignment.

This came within days of India sweeping a five-match T20 series.

“They (New Zealand) played with a lot more intensity after the T20 series. They deservedly won 3-0,” said India captain Virat Kohli after the shocking turnaround for both the sides.

Henry Nicholls scored 80 in 103 balls and Martin Guptill made 66 off 46 as the Black Caps scored 300 for five in 47.1 overs. Colin de Grandhomme smacked 58 not out off 28 balls at the end to help seal the win with 17 deliveries to spare.

Earlier, India had scored 296 for seven after being put into bat, thanks to K L Rahul’s (112) fourth ODI hundred.

Chasing a sub-par 297, New Zealand got off to a flying start as Guptill and Nicholls put on 50 off just 40 balls. Overall, they added 106 for the first wicket.

Gupitll smacked six fours and four sixes as the Indian new ball bowlers faced an onslaught. Shardul Thakur (1-87) and Navdeep Saini (0-68) struggled to find their rhythm and were taken for runs, while Jasprit Bumrah finished the series wicket-less.

Yuzvendra Chahal (3-47) provided the breakthrough, bowling Guptill in the 17th over. At the other end, Nicholls scored a half-century off 72 balls and anchored the innings.

He added 53 runs with Kane Williamson (22), but Chahal struck twice and Ravindra Jadeja (1-45) removed the in-form Ross Taylor (12) cheaply. New Zealand were reduced to 189 for four in the 33rd over at that stage.

Taylor was adjudged player of the series for amassing 194 runs in three innings and being dismissed only once.

De Grandhomme took centre stage then and smashed a half-century off only 21 balls. His explosive knock included six fours and three sixes, as his fifth wicket partnership with Jimmy Neesham (19) came off only 31 balls.

India’s fielding was lax and failed to build pressure on the Black Caps, an apt representation of their struggles in this series.

This was after Rahul’s first hundred at number five helped anchor India's innings.

He hit nine fours and two sixes, and rescued India from a precarious 62 for three.

He put on 100 runs with Shreyas Iyer (62 off 63 balls) for the fourth wicket, and later on another 107 runs with Manish Pandey (42 off 48 balls) for the fifth wicket. Hamish Bennett finished with 4-64 from ten overs.

India made another poor start. Kyle Jamieson (1-53) bowled Mayank Agarwal (1), who has suffered a torrid tour of New Zealand thus far. The big blow came when Virat Kohli (9) was out caught at third man in the seventh over.

Prithvi Shaw provided the initial flourish with 40 off 42 balls, but he was run-out going for a suicidal second run in the 13th over.

Iyer and Rahul then anchored the Indian innings. The former batted steadily and reached his half century off 52 balls, his third 50-plus score in this series.

But Iyer couldn’t carry on, out caught off Jimmy Neesham (1-50).

It was down to Rahul then, who crossed 50 off 66 balls. His partnership with Pandey progressed well as India reached 250 in the 45th over.

Rahul’s hundred came off 104 balls, and he perished in a bid to accelerate. This is where India’s innings fell apart, as Pandey also holed out off Bennett shortly afterwards.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/success-is-the-sweetest-revenge-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/success-is-the-sweetest-revenge.html
205,12-2-20,"Australia beat India by 11 runs, win women's tri-series final","Opener Smriti Mandhana's 37-ball 66 went in vain as Australia beat India by 11 runs to win the Tri-Nation Women's T20 Series here onWednesday.

Set a target of 156, India were all out for 144.

Left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen was the star of the show with brilliant figures of 5/12 in four overs.

Opting to bat, Australia managed to post 155 for six in their stipulated 20 overs. Chasing a challenging target, Mandhana was up to the task at hand and smashed 12 boundaries in her knock at the Junction Oval.

However, Mandhana's dismissal in the 15th over, caught brilliantly by Nicola Carey in the deep mid-wicket, turned the match in Australia's favour as they put the brakes on India's scoring while at the same time taking wickets.

It was the departure of skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, in the 16th over, which dashed India's hopes of a victory.

Earlier, India's Rajeshwari Gayakwad leaked 19 runs in the last over to let Australia off the hook and post a challenging total on the board.

Opener Beth Mooney top-scored for the hosts with an aggressive 71 off 54 balls, hitting nine boundaries.

208,12-2-20,Trump says looking forward to visiting India,"US President Donald Trump has said that he is looking forward to his first visit to India later this month and indicated that the two countries may sign a trade deal.

At the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump is slated to travel to India on February 24 and 25. In addition to New Delhi, he will stop in Ahmedabad in Gujarat to address a joint public meeting with Modi at a stadium.

""He (Modi) is a great gentleman and I look forward to going to India. So, we'll be going at the end of the month,"" Trump told reporters in his Oval Office, a day after the White House announced dates of his anticipated India trip.

Responding to a question, the president indicated that he is willing to sign a trade deal with India if it is the right one.

""They (Indians) want to do something and we'll see... If we can make the right deal, (we) will do it,"" said Trump, a fortnight ahead of his visit to the country as the 45th US president.

India's new Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI that Trump's forthcoming visit is a ""reflection of the strong personal rapport"" between Trump and Modi.

""It also demonstrates their strong desire to take the relationship to new heights,"" said Sandhu, who had presented his credentials to Trump in Oval Office last week.

Over the last three years, Trump and Modi have developed a personal friendship and in 2019, the duo met four times including their joint address before a strong 50,000 crowd of Indian-Americans in Houston.

This year, they have spoken over the phone on two occasions, including the one over the weekend.

""Just spoke with Prime Minister Modi,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question on his India visit.

Excited to travel to India later this month, said Trump referring to his conversation with Modi during which the prime minister apparently told him about the hundreds and thousands of Indians who would be there to welcome him in Ahmedabad.

Trump jokingly told reporters that now he will ""not feel good"" about the size of the crowd that he addresses in the US which is usually between 40,000 to 50,000.

""He (Modi) said we will have millions and millions of people. My only problem is that last night we probably had 40 or 50,000 people... I'm not going to feel so good... There will be five to seven million people just from the airport to the new stadium (in Ahmedabad),"" Trump said.

""And you know (it) is the largest stadium in the world. He's (Modi) building it now. It's almost complete and it's the largest in the world,"" Trump said.

The two leaders are expected to joint address a massive public rally at the newly build Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Being built at an estimated cost of USD 100 million, the Motera Stadium with a seating capacity of 100,000 spectators will be the world's largest cricket stadium overtaking the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-says-looking-forward-to-visiting-india-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/trump-says-looking-forward-to-visiting-india.html

211,12-2-20,Struggling Sakshi seeks another trial to remain in hunt for Tokyo berth,"Struggling Sakshi Malik is desperately seeking another round of trials to remain in contention for a Tokyo Olympics berth as she gears up for the upcoming Asian Wrestling Championships in non-Olympic category.

The Rio Olympic Bronze medallist was humbled by two-time Cadet World Champion Sonam Malik during the trials in the 62kg category.

The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has already made it clear that it may hold fresh trials if the performance of the winners are not satisfactory at the tournament in Italy and in the upcoming Asian Championship.

Sonam had lost the first round of the ranking series event in Rome but if she manages to finish on the podium during the Asian C’ship, beginning February 18 in New Delhi, the WFI perhaps won’t stop her from competing at the Asian Olympic qualifier in March.

“I am hopeful for another round of trials. If I qualify in that I will have two more chances, the Asian World Olympics qualifiers and the World Olympics qualifiers. I want to qualify in the two key tournaments,” Sakshi said.

“Preparations for the AWC has been good. I will give my best, be it any competition, and win medals. I am working hard on my technique. I need to make sure that I don’t repeat the same mistakes that I have made in the previous tournaments,” she added.

During the trials, the 18 year-old Sonam was trailing 6-10 but levelled the scores with a four-point throw to shock Sakshi.

Sakshi then got the chance to compete at the Asian C’ships in non-Olympic 65kg category.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/struggling-sakshi-seeks-another-trial-to-remain-in-hunt-for-tokyo-berth.html
212,12-2-20,Indian women’s eye T20 tri-series title,"Their batting woes sorted, India will fancy their chances of claiming the women’s T20 tri-series when they face Australia in the summit clash today.

After failing to fire in unison in their first three league matches, India produced a good batting show to record a seven-wicket win over Australia on Saturday, which took the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side into the final.

The two sides are on equal footing having won a match against each other in the double-legged league.

Senior opener Smriti Mandhana continued to be the batting bulwark along with Harmanpreet, but the most heartening thing was that 16-year-old Shafali Verma came good in the last game against Australia.

After two failures, Shafali’s 49 off 28 balls gave India a flying start and her innings contained eight fours and a six. Her senior opening partner Mandhana, on the other hand, anchored the 174 run chase with a solid knock that comprised seven boundaries.

Jemimah Rodrigues also contributed with a quickfire 19-ball 30, while Harmanpreet chipped in with a run-a-ball 20 to help India chase down the target.

The Indian bowlers have been doing well in this tournament with the likes Deepti Sharma and Rajeshwari Gayakwad producing consistent performances. In the penultimate league match against England, the Indian bowlers did well to not allow the opponents an easy win while defending a small total.

Australia got a boost after an easy win over England a day after losing to India. They have a strong batting line-up with opener Berth Mooney among runs and one-down Gardner in tremendous form.

Key players Lanning and Ellyse Perry have also been in good touch. The only struggling batter has been the opener Alyssa Healy.

Gardner had top-scored against India in the second league match between the two sides, while Mooney played a big part in the win against England, which took the home side to the final.

The tournament is a preparatory event for the T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women---s-eye-t20-tri-series-title.html
213,12-2-20,5 players charged by ICC after U-19 WC final,"Two Indians — Akash Singh and Ravi Bishnoi — and three Bangladesh players were on Tuesday found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute and handed suspension points for the ugly on-field confrontation that marred the Under-19 World Cup final in South Africa.

Akash and Bishnoi along with Bangladesh’s Md Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain and Rakibul Hasan were found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct after the two sides nearly came to blows following Bangladesh’s three-wicket win for their maiden U-19 World Cup title in Potchefstroom, on Sunday.

“Five players have been found guilty of a Level 3 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Support Personnel ... (they) were charged with violating Article 2.21 of the code, whilst Bishnoi received a further charge of breaching Article 2.5,” the ICC said in a statement.

The article 2.21 of the ICC code relates to conduct that bring the game into disrepute. It covers public acts of misconduct, unruly public behaviour and inappropriate comments which are detrimental to the interests of the game.

One suspension point amounts to a player being ineligible for one ODI or T20I, U-19 or A team international match. However, all of these players are set to progress to the senior set up now and are unlikely to be affected by this.

“All five players have accepted the sanctions proposed by ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup Match Referee Graeme Labrooy,” it added.

All charges were levelled by on-field umpires Sam Nogajski and Adrian Holdstock, third umpire Ravindra Wimalasiri as well as fourth umpire Patrick Bongni Jele. Level 3 breaches carry a minimum penalty of four suspension points and a maximum penalty of 12 suspension points.

The suspension points will be applied to the forthcoming international matches the players are most likely to participate in at either senior or U-19 level.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/5-players-charged-by-icc-after-u-19-wc-final.html

Former world number one Srikanth, the up and coming Lakshya Sen and Subhankar Dey won their respective singles matches easily.

Srikanth took just 23 minutes to beat Dmitriy Panarin 21-10, 21-7 while Sen was even quicker, notching up a 21-13, 21-8 win over Artur Niyazov in 21 minutes. Dey beat Khaitmurat Kulmatov 21-11, 21-5 in 26 minutes in the third singles.

World Championship Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth, who was not fielded in the singles on Tuesday, teamed up with Chirag Shetty in the doubles, but lost to the Kazakh pair of Niyazov and Panarin 21-18, 16-21, 19-21.

215,12-2-20,Williamson expecting full strength squad for Tests,"New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson on Tuesday hoped for a full-strength squad for the Test series against India after managing the limited overs leg with injury-ravaged outfits.

“We are expecting all of those guys to be fit for the first Test and they’ve been tracking nicely. It’s an exciting opportunity against one of the best sides in the world,” Williamson said.

“It’s part and parcel of the game that you get guys who get injuries. We’ve obviously had a lot of that in recent times to deal with but there have not been any excuses.

“Guys have come in to try and play the roles that they’re given to the best of their ability and learnt a heap along the way,” he added.

The skipper said that the limited-overs’ leg would not have much bearing on the ensuing two Tests, though they can still look to carry a bit of confidence from the 3-0 ODI series whitewash of the visitors.

“Obviously, a different side and a different format. Throughout a series you’re always trying to touch on areas as a group. It’s a different format but there are some parts guys will get confidence from going into that series.

“The focus does change but I know the guys are looking forward to that series.”

216,12-2-20,ODIs defeat isn’t something very serious to ponder about: Chahal,"India have been so consistent in the last five years that the ODI debacle against New Zealand is not worrying, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal said on Tuesday, playing down the rare series-whitewash the Black Caps inflicted on them.

“Overall, if you see it is just the fourth or fifth series loss in the last 4-5 years. The other team is also here to play. You cannot win every match. We have won one series, lost the other, so it is not something too serious to ponder over,” Chahal said at post match conference.

He said the youngsters will learn a lot from the experience of playing in New Zealand.

“Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal came into the side, so youngsters got to play outside India. It is not easy to play in New Zealand. But overall if we see, it is just an ODI series. We did win the T20 series 5-0, first time, that’s a positive for us as well,” added Chahal.

Chahal was all praise for the hosts but admitted fielding is a concern for India.

“They have played quite extraordinarily in this series. So we need to appreciate that. Poor fielding happens at times. Once in 10 series it happens, we have time until the next ODI series. We have seen what are the shortcomings and we have enough time to work on it before the next series,” he said.

When asked why he and Kuldeep Yadav have not played together since the World Cup, he said, “Ravindra Jadeja is playing extraordinarily well, whether it is batting or bowling or fielding. So, I play half the matches and Kuldeep plays half the matches.”

“Main motive is to do what is best for the team. In Asia Cup all three of us have played together as well. If wickets allow that, maybe all of us will play together again.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/odis-defeat-isn---t-something-very-serious-to-ponder-about--chahal.html

218,12-2-20,Shiv Sena bashes BJP...with AAP's broom!,"Stating that the victory of Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Assembly election was not surprising, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday termed it as a personal defeat for BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

The Sena said that despite deploying almost the entire Union Cabinet, over 150 MPs, state Chief Ministers and ministers, more than 200 MLAs from across India, the BJP suffered a ""clean sweep"" by AAP's 'jhadu' (broom).

""This is a rare instance when a Chief Minister (Arvind Kejriwal) went to the people with his performance record and sought votes against this, the BJP's 'in-the-air' policies failed,"" said the Sena, in strong edits in the party-run newspapers, 'Saamana' and 'Dopahar Ka Saamana'.

The anti-BJP diatribe came a day after Sena President and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray without naming the BJP - said that the people of Delhi have listened to 'Jan ki baat' and 'Mann ki Baat' will have no relevance in the country now.

It added that with AAP victory in Delhi, and the recent Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition taking power in Maharashtra, the BJP has lost out on the country's political capital and the commercial capital due to its ""selfishness and arrogance"".

""In Delhi, the BJP was always confused on what issues to confront AAP with, so as usual it raked up emotional and communal issues like Hindu-Muslim, patriotism and anti-nationalism. However, the voters kicked aside these and overwhelmingly voted for Kejriwal's performance in the past five years, giving AAP 62 out of 70 seats,"" the Sena said.

Referring to the BJP's victory on all seven Delhi Lok Sabha seats barely eight months ago, the Sena said it was ""a one-sided win"" since there was nobody strong enough to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""In February 2020, the BJP heated up the political atmosphere with issues like CAA-NRC, there were sit-in protests in Shaheen Bagh to which the BJP gave a 'Muslim only' tag to grab votes, but failed in all its tactics as the Delhiites remained solidly behind AAP,"" the Sena pointed out.

Thumping Kejriwal's back, it lauded him for the unprecedented strides in education and health which have grabbed global attention, and the relief like free water and power but ""without misleading the people"" that helped him notch such an impressive hat-trick win.

""The police administration does not come under Kejriwal's purview. When the law and order deteriorated in Delhi, he effectively blamed Modi-Shah, who retaliated by calling him a 'terrorist'. Ultimately, Kejriwal's broom swept aside all and he rode back to power,"" the Sena said.

In conclusion, the Sena said though BJP may be 'satisfied' it got more seats (eight of 70) and even notched a slight increase in the vote share, but finally it was Kejriwal's superior performance which won the day for him.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shiv-sena-bashes-bjp---with-aap-s-broom--2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/shiv-sena-bashes-bjp---with-aap-s-broom-.html

Chacko tendered his resignation from his post on Wednesday to party interim President Sonia Gandhi. The resignation comes a day after the party's dismal performance in the Delhi Assembly polls in which it scored a zero.

This is the second resignation in the party following its complete rout in the Assembly poll.

On Tuesday evening, party State chief Subhash Chopra quit after owning the defeat. He said that he could not do much for the party, and hence was leaving the post.

This is not the first time that Chacko has offered his resignation from the Delhi in-charge post. Last year also he had put in his papers, but was asked to stay on till the elections.

After Tuesday's poor showing, the rift within the party is now out in the open with the first salvo coming from Sharmistha Mukherji on Twitter, who said ""we should shut shop"" while attacking former union minister P. Chidambaram after he expressed happiness about the BJP's dismal show in the Delhi Assembly elections.

The Congress, which ruled the state for 15 years, could not perform well in the elections, and the local leaders were quick to put the blame on the central leaders.

Congress leaders from former chief minister late Sheila Dikshit's camp attacked Chacko over leaking a letter written by her son Sandeep Dikshit, a two-time MP, in which he had alleged that ""Chacko was responsible for the death of the former Chief Minister, who was under immense pressure from the Delhi in-charge"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chacko-quits-as-delhi-congress-in-charge-after-poll-debacle-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/chacko-quits-as-delhi-congress-in-charge-after-poll-debacle.html

The Union Home Ministry clarification came in view of reports that data of the final list of the National Register of Citizens has been made offline from its official website.

""The NRC data is safe. Some technical issues are in visibility on cloud. These are being resolved soon,"" a home ministry spokesperson said.

The data was not available for a couple of days and it created panic in the public, mostly among the people excluded from the list as the rejection certificates were yet to be issued.

NRC State Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma accepted that the data has been made offline, but refuted the allegation of any ""malafide"" intent in it.

The cloud service for the huge set of data was provided by IT firm Wipro and their contract was till October 19 last year. However, this was not renewed by the previous coordinator.

So, the data got offline from December 15 after it was suspended by Wipro, Sarma said.

He said the state coordination committee had decided to do necessary formalities in its meeting on January 30 and wrote to the Wipro during the first week of February.

""Once Wipro makes the data live, it will be available for public. We hope people will be able to access it in the next 2-3 days,"" Sarma said.

232,12-2-20,"Charge sheet filed in Rakesh Asthana bribery case, CBI informs HC","The CBI informed the Delhi High Court Wednesday that it has filed a charge sheet in the bribery case allegedly involving its then special director Rakesh Asthana.

The high court was hearing CBI's pending application in which it had sought more time to complete the investigation in the case lodged in 2018.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru was informed by Additional Solicitor General Vikramjit Banerjee that the CBI has already filed a charge sheet before the concerned trial court in the case.

The court noted that now nothing survives in the agency's application in which it had sought more time to complete the probe.

The CBI had Tuesday filed a charge sheet against Dubai-based businessman and alleged middleman Manoj Prasad in connection with the case.

It had given a clean chit to Asthana in the charge sheet.

The agency has also absolved RAW chief S K Goel, who was under the scanner in the case. CBI DSP Devender Kumar, who was arrested in 2018 and later got bail, also got a clean chit by the probe agency.

The high court on January 8 had directed the CBI director to be present before it on February 12, if the agency fails to complete the investigation in the bribery case.

It had pulled up the CBI for not completing the investigation in a time bound manner despite multiple court orders passed in the case and for repeatedly seeking extension of time to conclude the probe.

The court had noted that initially on January 11 last year the agency was granted 10 weeks to complete the investigation and thereafter, the CBI approached the court with several applications seeking to extend the time which was allowed.

Asthana, CBI's then Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Devender Kumar and businessman Manoj Prasad were booked on allegations of criminal conspiracy, corruption and criminal misconduct under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Kumar, earlier the investigating officer in a case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi, was arrested on allegations of forgery in recording the statement of Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Babu Sana, who had allegedly paid a bribe to get relief in the case.

Kumar was arrested on October 22, 2018 and granted bail on October 31, 2018.

The high court had in January 2019 disposed of three petitions of Asthana, Kumar and Prasad by a common order in which the CBI was directed to complete the investigation in the case within 10 weeks.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/charge-sheet-filed-in-rakesh-asthana-bribery-case--cbi-informs-hc-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/charge-sheet-filed-in-rakesh-asthana-bribery-case--cbi-informs-hc.html
233,12-2-20,Kejriwal retains supremacy,"Delhi votes for development, freebies

Arvind Kejriwal- led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) re-affirmed its supremacy over the BJP in the high octane Delhi Assembly elections by winning 62 seat out of 70. The AAP managed to retain its vote — 53.57 per cent this time against 54.3 per cent in 2015 — and beat the anti-incumbency and the poll campaign blitzkrieg of Home Minister Amit Shah-led BJP.

The national Capital witnessed an intense poll campaign led by the BJP’s humongous poll machinery backed by organisational set-up, against Kejriwal who changed his tactics and did not indulge into the slanging match with the saffron party despite being provoked on several occasions.

However, the BJP could add another five seats to its tally of 3 in 2015 and increase its vote share by over 6 per cent to 38.49 per cent, but that was too little to stop the AAP juggernaut. The Congress which had ruled Delhi for 15 uninterrupted years till AAP came to the scene was vanquished as its 63 out of 66 candidates lost their deposits in the AAP tsunami. The Congress’ ally RJD too lost its deposit on four seats.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from New Delhi, his deputy Manish Sisodia from Patparganj, Raghav Chadha from Rajender Nagar were notable winners. The BJP won five seats, while the Congress scored unenviable “zero”.

The high voltage elections also saw Kapil Mishra, a former Minister in the Kejriwal Government who had rebelled against AAP, losing to AAP’s sitting MLA Akhilesh Pati Triptahi from Model Town Assembly seat.

Sisodia, the architect of AAP’s educational revolution in Delhi, won a tough battle against rookie Ravinder Singh Negi of the BJP by over 3,000 votes from Patparganj seat. He had many anxious moments before emerging victorious in the 15th round. AAP’s Okhla candidate Amanatullah Khan, who was in the eye of storm for his alleged association with the Shaheen Bagh protesters, defeated BJP’s Braham Singh by 71,827 votes.

Shaheen Bagh, which falls under the Okhla Assembly constituency, turned out to be the epicentre of anti-CAA protest with women and children holding sit-in protest for about 50 days. Continuous media attention has kept the pot boiling which the BJP capitalised on during poll campaign.

Seelampur, which also witnessed violence during an anti-CAA protest, saw AAP’s Abdul Rehman emerging victorious against Kaushal Kumar Mishra of the BJP. Rehman defeated his rival by a margin of 25,000 votes.

Raghav Chadha, who was fielded from the Rajinder Nagar constituency in place of the sitting AAP MLA, defeated his BJP rival Sardar RP Singh by 20,058 votes.

Atishi, who was fielded from Kalkaji, won by 11,393 votes defeating BJP candidate Dharambir Singh.

Social Welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam who was fielded from Seemapuri won by defeating BJP ally Lok Jan Shakti Party’s Sant Lal. AAP’s SK Bagga won from Krishna Nagar constituency where he was pitted against BJP’s Anil Goyal. The Tri Nagar and Shalimar Bagh seats also went to the AAP.

AAP’s Preeti Tomar won the Tri Nagar seat by 12,000 votes, while Bandana Kumari emerged victorious on the Shalimar Bagh seat by a margin of 800 votes. AAP’s Kuldeep Kumar defeated Raj Kumar of the BJP from the Kondli seat.

Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat of the AAP defeated the BJP’s Ram Chander Chawriya from Sultanpur Majra, a reserved seat.

Mohinder Goyal of the AAP won the Rithala seat after defeating BJP’s Manish Chaudhary, while Jangpura seat was won by AAP’s Praveen Kumar, who defeated BJP’s Impreet Singh Bakshi.

AAP’s Prakash Jarwal won the Deoli seat, defeating Arvind Kumar of the BJP, while the party’s candidate Naresh Balyan retained the Uttam Nagar seat after defeating BJP’s Krishan Gahlot.

In Shakur Basti, AAP’s senior leader Satyendar Jain won after defeating Dr SC Vats after trailing him in the initial trends.

Rajesh Gupta of the AAP emerged victorious from the Wazirpur seat while BJP’s Dr Mahender Nagpal stood second.

Surendra Kumar of the AAP defeated Ranjeet Singh of the BJP to win the Gokalpur seat.

AAP’s Raghuvinder Shokeen won the Nangloi Jat seat against BJP’s Suman Lata while AAP’s Ajay Dutt won the Ambedkar Nagar seat after defeating BJP’s Khushiram Chunar. BJP’s Ajay Mahawar won the Ghonda seat by a margin of 27,000 votes, defeating AAP’s Shridutt Sharma.

BJP’s Abhay Verma managed to wrest Laxmi Nagar seat from AAP’ sitting MLA Nitin Tyagi by 800 votes while OP Sharma won from Vishwas Nagar seat by 16,457 votes. Anil Kumar Vajpayee, who had won on AAP ticket from Gandhi Nagar seat by 6047 votes defeating Naveen Chaudhary of AAP. Mohan Singh Bight of BJP defeated AAP’s Durgesh Pathak by 8223 votes. Jitender Mahajn won from Rohtas Nagar seat by defeating AAP’s Sarita Singh by 13241 votes. Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta won from Rohini seat by defeating Rajesh Nama Bansiwala by 12648 votes. BJP’s Ajay Mahawar won the Gonda seat by a margin of 27,000 votes, defeating AAP’s Shridutt Sharma.

The elections to the Delhi Legislative Assembly were held on February 8. With results being declared on Tuesday, the Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal dissolved the assembly and new assembly will be constituted once the Election Commssion notified the election results. “The new government will be sworn in on February 16 ”, said Gopal Rai, a minister in the outgoing Delhi government and also the convenor of AAP Delhi. It would be pertinent to mention here that Kejriwal had taken oath as Chief Minister of Delhi on February 14, 2015 at Ramlila Maidan after his party had won a landslide victory against BJP.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-retains-supremacy-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kejriwal-retains-supremacy.html
234,12-2-20,Triumph is dawn of kaam ki rajneeti: CM,"Hailing party’s landslide win as a “Victory of India” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said a new kind of politics has emerged from the Delhi Assembly poll outcome, with people rewarding the party which built schools, hospitals and provided cheap electricity round-the-clock.

Kejriwal greeted supporters at party office by saying “I love you”. He chanted “Bharat mata ki jai, Inquilab zindaba and thereafter he addressed the supporters. “It is a victory of all and every family who considered me their son and gave us a huge mandate. In the country today, Delhiites have given birth to a new kind of politics, which is called “Kaam ki rajneeti” (politics of works),” he said.

“This is very auspicious message for the country as the politics of work can only take our country to the 21st century,” said Kejriwal, flanked by his wife, daughter and senior party leaders, from the stage erected at the party’s headquarters.

The AAP chief was accompanied by his family and senior party leaders Gopal Rai and Sanjay Singh.

Addressing the gathering, AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sushil Gupta said, “People of Delhi have showed the way to the country that only development works will take it forward and not Hindu-Muslim politics. All kind of divisive politics has been rejected by the people of Delhi.”

Party leader Gopal Rai also asked volunteers to get ready, saying “what happens in Delhi can expand to the whole country”. Rai, a Minister in the Kejriwal Government, retained Babarpur constituency by defeating BJP’s Naresh Gaur.

“The whole country needs change. I urge my volunteers to prepare themselves. Get ready. What happened in Delhi can expand to the whole country,” Rai said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/triumph-is-dawn-of--kaam-ki-rajneeti--cm-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/triumph-is-dawn-of--kaam-ki-rajneeti--cm.html
235,12-2-20,Will heads roll in BJP?,"When the exit polls predicted a BJP rout in the Delhi Assembly polls, both Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari were quick to rubbish the prediction and make emphatic claims that the saffron party will win 45-48 seats.

In a wedding reception on Monday here, Shah repeated his claim to reporters in an informal chat. Tiwari did the same during the last two days.

It is one thing to make such “moral boosting” claims before the voting day, but to stick to the same assessment even after the exit polls prediction — and that too by top leadership of the party — was something that came as a big surprise. As it turned out, both Shah and Tiwari were proven utterly wrong, living one wonder whether they failed to read the voters’ pulse.

This raises another question: Did the BJP leadership planned an erroneous campaign by not understanding the mindset of the Delhi voters? The aggressive campaign where tongues were used as weapons may have helped the BJP raise its vote share to 39 per cent, but it failed miserably in making any dent in Kejriwal’s support base.

Now that the dust has settled and the BJP is talking about “introspection” and “reviews”, the question doing the round is “who will be held responsible for the debacle?”

While Tiwari has come forward to place his head on the chopping block by owning responsibility for the defeat, it is well known that he had limited say in deciding the nature of the campaign.

Obviously, someone like Manoj Tiwari could not have brought nearly 250 MPs, a dozen CMs and hundreds of MLAs from all part of the country to contribute to the “war cry” against Kejriwal.

However, it is unlikely that anyone from the Central leadership will pay the price for the debacle. It is equally unlikely that any State unit leader could be made the fall guy, because public is not going to be

convinced that State leaders had any say in the whole proceedings. Given the situation, it will be interesting to see how the BJP tries to fix responsibility for a disastrous performance in Delhi.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/will-heads-roll-in-bjp-.html
236,12-2-20,Cong ‘happy’ in drubbing!,"The Congress received the worst-ever drubbing in its history as its all 66 candidates in the Delhi Assembly elections were completely routed and if that was not enough, 63 of them lost their deposits.

The Congress repeated its score of zero in two successive Delhi Assembly elections and its vote share came down to paltry 4.26 per cent. However, Congress leadership was upbeat as its bête noire BJP was vanquished in the Delhi Assembly election. The party leaders gave indications that the Congress supported the AAP to ensure BJP’s defeat and managed to transfer its votes to the AAP.

However, the Congress vowed to rebuild and revive itself at the grassroots level in the national Capital. It said the poll results also had a message for the BJP that the “most toxic campaign” unleashed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah has been defeated.

The Congress’ ally RJD contested on remaining four seats and and it too lost deposits. The three constituencies where Congress candidates were able to save their deposits are Badli, Gandhi Nagar and Kasturba Nagar. Security deposit of a candidate is forfeited if s/he fails to secure one-sixth of the total valid votes cast in a constituency.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram hailed AAP’s performance in the Delhi Assembly polls and said the people of the national Capital have defeated the “polarising, divisive and dangerous” agenda of the BJP.

AICC Delhi in-charge PC Chacko said the message of the Delhi polls is that the “most toxic campaign” unleashed by Modi and Shah has been defeated by the people of the national Capital. “We lost very badly. We accept our defeat with humility. The Congress will work hard and come back,” he said.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said, “Attempts to polarise were made by both parties (BJP and AAP) and they were successful to an extent.” However, he added, the results also showed that the people of Delhi were not with the communal forces.

Former All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Rahul Gandhi congratulated Kejriwal. He tweeted “My best wishes & congratulations to Mr Kejriwal and the AAP on winning the Delhi Assembly elections.”

In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, the Congress had a vote share of 9.7 per cent against the BJP’s 32.7 per cent and the AAP’s 54.34 per cent.

Party president Sonia Gandhi tweeted “Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal and @AamAadmiParty for an emphatic win in Delhi elections. Best wishes for a better Delhi ahead.”

“People’s mandate is against us, we accept it. We have resolved to revive and rebuild the party,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a Press conference.

Congress’s performance touched a record low in the Delhi Assembly election as the party bagged less than 5 per cent of the total votes polled. The party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot under former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, failed to open its account for the second consecutive Assembly election in Delhi.

Most of Congress candidates got less than 5 per cent of the total votes polled in their respective constituencies. Delhi Congress chief Shubhash Chopra’s daughter Shivani Chopra, who was the party candidate from Kalkaji, also could not save her deposit.

Former Delhi Assembly Speaker Yoganand Shastri’s daughter Priyanka Singh also forfeited her deposit.

The party’s campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad’s wife, Poonam Azad, lost badly and stood fourth, polling only 2,604 (2.23) votes.

“We are again decimated in Delhi. Enough of introspection, time for action now. Inordinate delay in decision making at the top, lack of strategy and unity at State level, demotivated workers, no grassroots connect -- all are factors. Being part of the system, I too take my share of responsibility,” Delhi Mahila Congress chief and party spokesperson Sharmishtha Mukherjee said in a tweet.

Her colleague Jaiveer Shergill suggested the Congress should avoid things like justifying defeat, finding happiness in the BJP’s defeat and telling itself that wins and losses are cyclic in elections.

Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa said those against the BJP’s divisive politics had the option of either the AAP or the Congress, and they chose the former.

“One thing is for sure all parties that are winning State elections; it is because of a leader. If people have faith in the leader, that party wins. The BJP never had a face in Delhi. The Congress has to bring in an educated, young face (in Delhi) for the future and keep working hard,” he said.

The Congress was in power in Delhi for three straight terms. The AAP’s rise has been a major factor in the Congress’ decline, from being a dominant force in the national Capital to being a marginal player. The AAP’s capture of the anti-BJP vote has been complete in this election with the Kejriwal-led party taking a large chunk of the Congress vote share.

Senior party leaders were conspicuous by their absence as the trends showed party humiliating defeat. Some Congress workers who gathered outside the party office blamed senior party leaders for the crushing defeat.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cong----happy-----in-drubbing-.html
237,12-2-20,Victory of jan ki baat: Opp,"The Opposition on Tuesday hailed Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP’s massive victory in the Delhi Assembly polls and a virtual rout of the BJP and termed the poll outcome as a defeat of the politics of “polarisation” and “hate” and a victory of inclusive politics.

While Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray termed the Delhi poll outcome as “jan ki baat” won over “mann ki baat”, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the BJP paid the price for unleashing a hate campaign and torturing women and students.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi congratulated Kejriwal tweeting, “My best wishes and congratulations to Mr Kejriwal and the AAP on winning the Delhi Assembly elections.”

NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the BJP “tried to polarise” voters, but people of the national Capital rejected it.

The Opposition also said “winds of change” are blowing and it feels that the Kejriwal model of campaign where he avoided all controversial issues and focused just on development while countering BJP’s slogan of Jai Sri Ram by chanting “Jai Bajrang Bali” can be a blueprint to take on the BJP at the national level.

There was also a call by the Opposition for all regional parties to come together to keep the BJP out of power.

Key BJP ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar side-stepped queries on the drubbing received by his party JD(U), the BJP and the LJP with a terse comment that “Janta malik hai” (will of the people is supreme).

Mamata, who was among the first leaders to congratulate Kejriwal, said the Delhi polls have proven that only development will work.

“I have congratulated Arvind Kejriwal. People have rejected BJP. Only development will work, CAA, NRC and NPR will be rejected.” Mamata told reporters in Kolkata, amid the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens(NRC) and National Population Register(NPR).

Pawar utilised the AAP’s landslide win to stress that regional parties need to come together to keep the BJP out of power. “The Delhi poll results indicate ‘winds of change’ are blowing in the country. The results are not surprising to me,” he told reporters in Pune.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray congratulated the AAP and said, “People have shown that the country will be run by ‘Jan Ki Baat’, not ‘Mann Ki Baat’. The BJP called Kejriwal a terrorist but couldn’t defeat him,” Thackeray said.

“Development agenda has won, I congratulate Arvind Kejriwal. The Delhi polls have become bipolar, there was nothing for the Congress in these polls,” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.

Samajwadi Party(SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav said the poll outcome showed that Indians were both “socially liberal and politically intelligent”.

“Most Indians are still socially liberal and politically intelligent and are against those that drag religion, which is such a personal issue into politics, for political gains. It is also an auspicious sign and healthy message for the peace and development of the country,” Yadav tweeted.

CPI(M) veteran and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan hailed Kejriwal’s win as a victory for inclusive politics.

“Congratulations to @ArvindKejriwal and @AamAadmiParty on a resounding victory in Delhi elections. Let this victory be a harbinger for pro-people and inclusive politics in our country,” Vijayan said in a tweet.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said Delhi has given a befitting reply to the BJP’s “politics of hate and violence.”

“Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty and the people of Delhi who have given a befitting reply to BJP’s politics of hate and violence. Union ministers called for ‘gaalis’ and ‘golis’. People have given their answer,” reads Yechury’s tweet.

CPI general secretary D Raja congratulated Kejriwal on phone.

DMK chief MK Stalin said the victory is an indication that “development trumps communal politics. “Federal rights and regional aspirations must be strengthened in the interest of our country,” Stalin said.

RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said the victory marks the defeat of politics of polarisation.

“Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal ji & Delhi! You have defeated negative & blatant hate politics decisively. Your verdict marks the defeat of politics of polarisation and division. I sincerely hope BJP takes a cue from this result and shuns communalism & bigotry once for all,” Yadav said.

Calling Kejriwal as a leader who heralded development, former Karnataka Chief Minister and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy said people have taught a lesson for labelling him a “terrorist” and also upheld the necessity of a regional party.

“Heartfelt congratulations to @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty. People of Delhi have showed that “fascist ideology” will never win their hearts.

“Congratulations to AAP and voters of Delhi for testifying that successful politics with development as criteria (to win polls), amidst money and muscle power,” Kumaraswamy tweeted.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/victory-of-jan-ki-baat--opp.html
238,12-2-20,Nepal shuts resort where 8 Indian tourists died,"Nepal has suspended the licence of a mountainous resort for three months due to poor security management and managerial weakness at the hotel where eight Indian tourists, including four minors, died of possible asphyxiation, according to media reports.

Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala when eight of them died on January 21 due to possible asphyxiation after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Makwanpur district.

The tourists were airlifted to HAMS hospital here where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Makwanpur police said the victims might have fallen unconscious due to asphyxiation.

The Department of Tourism on Sunday imposed a ban on the operation of Daman-based Everest Panorama Resort for three months based on the report submitted by a probe committee formed to investigate the death of the Indian tourists from Kerala, the Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday.

The department decided to shut down the resort as the report submitted by a probe committee pointed out poor security management and managerial weakness at the resort for the incident, it said.

The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had formed the probe committee under Surendra Thapa, the director of the Department of Tourism. After a field inspection, the committee had submitted its report a few days ago, pointing to the shortcomings of the resort.

During the investigation, the committee found the resort had not been following the recommended safety measures and was providing substandard services to its guests, The Himalayan Times reported.

Moreover, the committee discovered that the resort had not fulfilled the criteria set by DoT to be categorised a 'resort', it said.

Mira Acharya, director of DoT was quoted as saying by the report that the resort's operations have been halted as per Section 15 of Tourism Act-1979.

""If the resort owner wishes to resume services after three months of suspension, the resort should be upgraded as per the Hotel, Lodge, Restaurant, Bar and Tourist Guide Rules-1981 and also meet the criteria mentioned in a notice published in the Nepal Gazette under the title 'Hotel Classification and Criteria',"" Acharya said.

She added that the resort would also have to undergo the Environment Impact Assessment to get the permission from DoT to resume operation.

Meanwhile, the resort management has said that they will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently.

""We will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently. We are saddened by the tragic incident. We will ensure that such incidents don't occur in the future,” said Sudesh Gautam, the operator of the resort was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post.

The group, after travelling to Pokhara -- a popular mountainous tourist destination -- was on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman.

Those who were killed were Praveen Krishnan Nair, his wife Saranya Sasi and their three children and Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, his wife Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and their son.

239,12-2-20,Prolonged sitting linked to depression risk in adolescents,"Young people who spend too much time sitting still are at an increased risk of depression, researchers have warned.

The study, published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, found that an additional 60 minutes of light activity (such as walking or doing chores) daily at age 12 was associated with a 10 per cent reduction in depressive symptoms at age 18.

""Our findings show that young people who are inactive for large proportions of the day throughout adolescence face a greater risk of depression by age 18,"" said study lead author Aaron Kandola from University College London in the UK.

""We found that any degree of physical activity that can reduce the time we spend sitting down is likely to be beneficial,"" Kandola added.

For the findings, the research team used data from 4,257 adolescents, who have been participating in longitudinal research from birth as part of the University of Bristol's Children of the 90s cohort study.

The children wore accelerometers to track their movement for at least 10 hours over at least three days, at ages 12, 14 and 16.

The accelerometers reported whether the child was engaging in light activity (which could include walking or hobbies such as playing an instrument or painting), engaging in moderate-to-physical activity (such as running or cycling), or if they were sedentary.

Depressive symptoms, such as low mood, loss of pleasure and poor concentration, were measured with a clinical questionnaire.

The questionnaire measures depressive symptoms and their severity on a spectrum, rather than providing a clinical diagnosis.

Between the ages of 12 and 16, total physical activity declined across the cohort, which was mainly due to a decrease in light activity and an increase in sedentary behaviour.

The researchers found that every additional 60 minutes of sedentary behaviour per day at age 12, 14 and 16 was associated with an increase in depression score of 11.1 per cent, eight per cent or 10.5 per cent, respectively, by age 18.

Those with consistently high amounts of time spent sedentary at all three ages had 28.2 per cent higher depression scores by age 18, the study said.

Every additional hour of light physical activity per day at age 12, 14 and 16 was associated with depression scores at age 18 that were 9.6 per cent, 7.8 per cent and 11.1 per cent lower, respectively.

""Light activity could be particularly useful because it doesn't require much effort and it's easy to fit into the daily routines of most young people,"" said study senior author Joseph Hayes.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prolonged-sitting-linked-to-depression-risk-in-adolescents-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/prolonged-sitting-linked-to-depression-risk-in-adolescents.html

250,12-2-20,Trump wants Pentagon to review impeachment witness' conduct,"President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that the Pentagon should review the conduct of a former White House national security aide who played a central role in the Democrats' impeachment case and potentially consider disciplinary action against him.

Army Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, who until last week was detailed by the Pentagon to the White House, testified before the House impeachment panel that Trump inappropriately pushed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Vindman was ousted from his job on the White House National Security Council on Friday, just two days after the Senate acquitted Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges.

He is to be reassigned by the Pentagon. His twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, who worked as an ethics lawyer at the NSC, also was ousted from his job and was re-assigned to the Army General Counsel's Office.

Trump has already been sharply criticized for pushing out Alexander Vindman and others who crossed him in the impeachment hearings.

Asked whether he wanted to see Vindman face discipline, Trump said military officials “can handle him any way they want” but also suggested that he expected commanders to review the decorated, 20-year officer's conduct.

“That's going to be up the military,” Trump said. “We'll have to see. They are certainly, I imagine, going to take a look at that."" Robert O'Brien, Trump's national security adviser, said later Tuesday that Alexander Vindman was not asked to leave his White House job in retaliation for his testimony in the Democrats' impeachment case.

“There 's absolutely no retaliation with respect to the Vindmans as far as impeachment goes,” O'Brien said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council.

“But the president is entitled to a staff that he has confidence in and that he believes will execute his policy.” O'Brien said it was his decision and that the president did not ask him to remove them. “They were not retaliated against,"" O'Brien said.

“Their services were no longer needed. ... The hiring and the decisions on personnel are made by the National Security Council. Ultimately the buck stops with me, but there is a chief of staff, we have a deputy and we have lawyers who are involved in every one of those decisions,” he said. “So those were my decisions and I stand by them.” Noting that both are lieutenant colonels in the Army, O'Brien suggested that the Vindman twins were not acting to implement the president's policy decisions.

“The policy of the United States is formed and decided by the president of the United States,” he said.

“We're not some banana republic where lieutenant colonels get together and decide what the policy is.” Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked earlier what the Pentagon would do to ensure that the former NSC staffers face no retribution.

""We protect all of our service members from retribution or anything like that,"" Esper said. ""We've already addressed that in policy and other means."" Alexander Vindman's attorney, David Pressman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier, Pressman said that telling the truth cost his client his ""job, his career, and his privacy.”",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-wants-pentagon-to-review-impeachment-witness--conduct-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-wants-pentagon-to-review-impeachment-witness--conduct.html
251,12-2-20,Space explorers wanted: NASA seeks next generation of astronauts,"Wanted: The next generation of astronauts to walk on the Moon and journey to Mars. You'll need a relevant Master's degree, be prepared to live and work 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth on the International Space Station, and be a US citizen.

NASA announced on Tuesday that it was seeking to boost its astronaut corps, which currently stands at 48 active personnel, as part of plans to dramatically expand its crewed space missions in the coming years.

""We're celebrating our 20th year of continuous presence aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit this year, and we're on the verge of sending the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024,"" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.

""For the handful of highly talented women and men we will hire to join our diverse astronaut corps, it's an incredible time in human spaceflight to be an astronaut. We're asking all eligible Americans if they have what it takes to apply beginning March 2.""

The requirements for a Master's degree in science, engineering or mathematics (STEM) can also be met by being two years into a STEM PhD, or by being a test pilot, one of the most well-worn paths to the astronaut corps.

A medical degree -- or one in osteopathic medicine -- also works. The candidates will need at least two years' professional experience, or, in the case of pilots, 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command time.

And, for the first time ever, candidates will be asked to complete a two-hour online test. The process is competitive. The last class of 11 NASA astronauts, which graduated in January, were picked from a record-breaking 18,000 applicants.

Their resumes are stellar: One of them, Jonny Kim, is an emergency physician and a veteran of 100 combat operations with the Navy SEALs, where he earned a Silver Star. He also has a mathematics degree and doctorate in medicine from Harvard.

NASA expects to select the next class by mid-2021, and the candidates will then embark on a two-year training program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

It will include classes in spacewalking at NASA's underwater Neutral Buoyancy Lab, robotics, the systems of the International Space Station and piloting the T-38 training jet, Russian language lessons, and the building blocks of the Artemis program to return to the Moon by 2024.

The privileged few will join the 500 or so people who have ventured into space, as NASA looks to resume sending US astronauts to the ISS on private US rockets, go back to the Moon and head onward to Mars in the 2030s.

Traditionally, about half of new recruits have come from the military, especially test pilots who fly dangerous experimental aircraft, including the likes of Alan Shepard, the first American in space and Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon.

And the pay? For civilian candidates, it starts at the 11th grade for federal workers at USD 53,800 to USD 70,000.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/space-explorers-wanted--nasa-seeks-next-generation-of-astronauts-2020-02-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/space-explorers-wanted--nasa-seeks-next-generation-of-astronauts.html

He is likely to visit Ahmedabad on February 24, they said.

During his visit to Modi's home state Gujarat, Trump along with the Indian prime minister would participate in a grand roadshow, planned along a 10-km decked-up stretch from the Ahmedabad airport to the Sabarmati Ashram, they said.

The US president would then visit the Sabarmati Ashram, which served as epicentre of the country's freedom struggle during Mahatma Gandhi stay there.

Trump and Modi would later inaugurate the newly- constructed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in the city's Motera area and address a gathering, likely to be attended by over one lakh people, the sources said.

The mega event at the stadium will be similar to the ""Howdy, Modi!"" event held in the US last year, they said.

Modi and Trump shared the stage at the ""Howdy Modi!"" gala event in Houston in September last year and addressed a record crowd of 50,000 Indian-Americans.

Citizens here have dubbed the upcoming visit of the US president at the Sardar Patel Stadium as ""Kem Chho, Trump!"" (Howdy Trump) event, the sources said.

The stadium at Motera has a seating capacity of 1.10 lakh higher than the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia, an official earlier said.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has issued an order assigning duties to its officers for the roadshow preparations, the sources said.

The civic officials have been asked to arrange transportation and parking for those invited for the Motera stadium inauguration, they said.

The White House on Monday announced that Trump will visit India from February 24 to 25.

Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu were accorded a grand welcome in Ahmedabad during their visits between 2014 and 2018.

The three leaders had also visited the Sabarmati Ashram with Modi and paid respects to Mahatma Gandhi.
