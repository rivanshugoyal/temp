0,24-4-20,Some hiccups still,"All industrial units do not have the requisite capacity to meet the new standards for resuming production yet

India followed its own definitive path to tackle the menace of COVID-19, ordering the strictest 21-day nationwide lockdown first and then extending it further. In its first phase, the Government chose to save people’s lives over the economy. Yet, when it became distinctly clearer that the fight against the virus would be long-drawn, it became impossible for it to ignore livelihood issues and look for ways to get the economy started. So it allowed industrial units to run in non-hotspot areas but with a new set of caveats that is now causing more confusion than clarity. While these are early days yet and the Government has to work out sectoral codes to ensure low risk, social distancing and safety parameters, the first set of compliances seems to have put more pressure on unit owners, who have to now factor in a new overhead like safety costs. In the absence of substantial working capital from the Government, some of them are wary about opening their units because of low consumer demand, labour shortage and a poor chain of logistics. Now they are further spooked by media reports of the stringent norms that call for punitive action, to the extent of registration of an FIR, against owners found non-compliant by the slightest degree or even if one staffer was diagnosed with COVID-19, something that even a routine health check-up would not reveal at the time of re-employment. Though the Government sought to allay fears by making it clear that the provisions would be applicable only for offences “with consent, cognisance or negligence” on the part of the employers, uncertainty looms large. This is why the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the Home Ministry following the partial lifting of the lockdown in several areas have drawn flak from several quarters.

Major worries are over the broad norms prescribed under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) that have been invoked for the first time on account of a force majeure event. First, the implementation of the Act itself will be problematic because the onus now lies with respective States to ensure adherence. As expected, without any clarification, various States have offered different interpretations on whether they should risk people’s lives by opening up the factories or keep them shut longer. Even when some have agreed, unanticipated gaps during implementation mean there has to be another review. Further, given the varied capacities of each State, it is only fair to expect a less-than-equal response from all. Other guidelines, too, appear illogical and are hard to implement at the ground level. New rules demand that workers be accommodated in the factory premises or be lodged in nearby areas so that they can be transported with ease while strictly maintaining social distancing norms. Given the previous set-up of industries, it will be impossible for them to lodge even a small group of workers. Further, the guidelines call upon the respective units to get their workers, who have fled to their hometowns, back to work. With trust deficit everywhere and in the absence of a Central assurance, employees may choose to remain in their villages. Assuming they come back, the resumption of work is dependent largely on the behavioural shift of workers — all of whom need to get accustomed to all sanitary guidelines. One lapse by them and the owner would get harassed. This is why we will need far more long-term and sustainable solutions going forward. At the moment, smaller units cannot get rolling without Government support. Half-baked rush can only spoil the gains made till now.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/some-hiccups-still-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/some-hiccups-still.html

Bharatiya Janata Party’s Uttar Pradesh unit president Swatantra Dev Singh issued shows cause notice to its Sitapur Sadar legislator Rakesh Rathore for his comments against the party brass and asked him to submit his reply within a week.

In his letter to Rathore, BJP general secretary Vidyasagar Sonkar said that there were reports of anti-party activities which he should explain within a week’s time.

Sonkar further said, “We have asked for an explanation from the MLA and will wait for his reply before taking action.”

Recently, an audio had gone viral in which the Sitapur MLA was heard ridiculing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to people to clap and motivate corona warriors.

“Can clapping or banging vessels drive corona away? This was a stupid act. China, which is a global power, is working hard to control the disease and here we are making people do stupid things,” Rathore was heard telling a BJP leader, who called on him for a favour.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-notice-to-sitapur-sadar-legislator.html
2,24-4-20,Body of madarsa manager found in gunny bag,"



|

Hours before a joint team of Crime Branch of Delhi Police and Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Muhammad Saad Kandhlawi’s Shamli farmhouse, the local police recovered the body of a missing madarsa manager near the farmhouse on Yamuna banks early Thursday morning.

The half-charred, mutilated body was recovered in a gunny bag.

The police sent the body for autopsy and detained two suspects for questioning.

Saad is wanted by Delhi Police for holding a congregation in Nizamuddin markaz and later harbouring thousands of Jamaatis there for days, despite lockdown being imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus and not informing the authorities.

Maulana Saad has since gone underground and has been posting clippings claiming to be in isolation.

As per reports, a team of Shamli police recovered a gunny bag on Yamuna river banks containing the body of Mufti Sufiyan, manager of Madarsa Jamiya Hudlalil Aalmin in Mawi Kakaur in Kairana.

The mufti was missing since last Thursday and a report of his disappearance was lodged last Monday.

After preliminary inquiry, the police said that the body was half-burnt and mutilated which indicated that the killer eliminated the manager the same day he disappeared and tried to burn the body to conceal crime. The killers later dumped the body in a gunny bag.

Two suspects were detained and the police were waiting for the autopsy report to start a probe.

Mufti Sufiyan took charge as manager of the madarsa in 2017 and all angles are being probed to close in on the killers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/body-of-madarsa-manager-found-in-gunny-bag.html
3,24-4-20,UP govt sets up 34 temp jails to lodge Jamaatis,"



|

With more and more Tablighi Jamaat members being arrested after completing their quarantine period across the state, the government has set up 34 temporary jails, including two for women. The security agencies have so far lodged 350 odd Tablighi Jamaat members, including 156 foreigners and eight women, in these jails.

The foreigners have been charged with violation of Epidemic Diseases Law and Foreigners Act.

Acting tough on missing Tablighi Jamaat members who played major role in the sudden spurt in coronavirus positive cases in UP, the state government has so far arrested 156 foreigners who attended the Nizamuddin markaz congregation and completed their 14-day quarantine. Another 200 Jamaatis have been jailed for violation of Epidemic Diseases Act and lockdown norms.

On Thursday, the government set up eight more temporary jails, taking the total number of such facilities to 34, for lodging Tablighi Jamaatis.

Two special jails to lodge women have been set up in Lucknow and Bulandshahr, and four Jamaat members each are lodged there at present.

The foreign Tablighi Jamaat delegates are natives of Indonesia, Kazakhstan, France, Morocco, Malaysia, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Palestine, Syria, Mali etc.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi has said that the government would not spare anyone violating the law and threatening lives of the people.

“Hitherto quarantined Jamaatis will now be sent to jail. So far 45 FIRs have been lodged against 259 foreigners who attended Nizamuddin markaz and later hid across the state. Of them, 325 foreigners, including 66 Nepalese citizens, have been identified across UP. The police have seized their passports for violating Foreigners Act by attending religious gathering on tourist visa,” Awasthi said.

Besides, around 3,000 Indian were identified in UP and 2,800 were quarantined.

Meanwhile, the Fire department personnel have so far sanitised 12518 places, including hotspots. Sanitisation exercise was carried out in 635 areas identified as hotspots, 1,277 sensitive places, 1,465 markets, 3,411 residential areas and 5,439 other places and establishments.

DG (Fire Services) RK Vishwakarma said that 784 spots were sanitised in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), 724 in Lucknow, 377 in Agra, 216 in Moradabad, 470 in Meerut, 450 in Firozabad, 460 in Ghaziabad, 256 in Mainpuri, 338 in Aligarh, 756 in Bareilly, 576 in Kaushambi, 974 in Varanasi, 346 in Azamgarh, and 318 in Gorakhpur.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-sets-up-34-temp-jails-to-lodge-jamaatis.html
4,24-4-20,Dists having 20+ corona cases to have nodal officers,"



|

Taking a serious note of rising number of coronavirus positive cases across the state, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed that a senior IAS officer and a Health department official be deputed as nodal officers and sent to districts reporting 20 or more COVID-19 cases so that medicare to patients could be monitored and the spread of the virus to other areas be prevented.

Additional Chief Secretary (Information), Awanish Awasthi told media persons in Lucknow on Thursday that a senior IAS officer and a health official would be rushed to those districts on Friday that had reported 20 or more COVID-19 cases.

“There are 15 such districts but Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) already has a senior IAS officer monitoring the situation and hence officials would visit the remaining 14 districts and camp there for a week,” he said.

These officials would check facilities and medical care available to the patients and take stock of preparation of the district got countering the pandemic.

Awasthi said that in districts where there were no senior police officials of Inspector General (IG) rank, there too a senior police official would be sent along with administrative and health official. “They would review lockdown, medical and administration, sanitation, quarantine centres, community kitchens and shelter homes,” he said.

“The government’s focus is on ensuring that there is no spread of coronavirus out of hotspots and testing has also been intensified there,” he said.

Awasthi further said that the state had increased its testing capacity and on Wednesday 3,955 tests were conducted against sample collection of 3,737. “This shows that we have started clearing backlog. Besides, UP has become the third state in the number of cumulative tests being done in the country,” he said.

“Pool tests have stated in four labs in UP and on Wednesday, 812 samples were tested. Notwithstanding its huge population and limited resources, UP is ranked 7th in COVID Case Index in India,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dists-having-20--corona-cases-to-have-nodal-officers.html
5,24-4-20,Seize vehicles ferrying passengers: CM Yogi,"



|

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday ordered that no vehicle be allowed to ferry passengers during lockdown and in case of violation, such vehicles be seized and action be taken against the drivers and the owners.

“The police should be more strict on highways, and inter-state and inter-district borders. A vehicle permitted to ply will only have a driver and a cleaner. All other occupants will be illegal and they should be quarantined and the vehicle seized immediately,” Yogi said during a meeting with Team 11 in Lucknow on Thursday.

The chief minister directed officials to provide better facilities to doctors, paramedics and even to people who were quarantined in different places in the state.

Additional Chief Secretary (Information) Awanish Awasthi told media persons in Lucknow that the chief minister was annoyed at reports of people trying to cross borders by hiding in vehicles.

“The chief minister said that district officials, including district magistrates and chief medical officers, should regularly check facilities at all quarantine centres and ensure quality food and hygiene. Pool testing should be done at shelter homes. Covid Care Fund should be used for strengthening medical facilities at COVID hospitals and for providing PPE (personal protective equipment) kits and other gears for doctors and paramedics. Besides, more doctors be engaged to help the patients through telemedicine,” Awasthi said.

The senior official said that the chief minister also asked Food Supply department to provide food grains to new ration card holders from May and that Antyodaya card holders should get 35 kg of food grains and others 5 kg per unit.

In April, 88 per cent of 3.56 crore ration card holders were given over 6.55 lakh metric tonnes of food grains in the second phase.

Awasthi further said that wheat purchase was underway and over 4,000 procurement centres were functional across the state. He said 53,000 fertilisers, 37,000 pesticides and 35,000 seed outlets were working for zaid crop and mentha sowing .

The official also claimed that construction work had started and work at three expressways — Purvanchal, Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur Link — had picked up pace with 2,122 machines in operation in Purvanchal Expressway project. He said over 4,835 labourers were also employed there.

“The PWD has started 161 projects worth Rs 2,858 crore, Irrigation department has started 49 projects and Panchayati Raj department has undertaken 43,393 projects in rural areas covering 15,120 panchayats, in which 3.36 lakh rural workers, including MGNREGA workers, have been engaged,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/seize-vehicles-ferrying-passengers--cm-yogi.html
6,24-4-20,Chouhan holds talks on corona,"Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held discussion with the Cabinet members at Mantrlaya on Thursday in context to controlling coronavirus in the State. He said that the work to control the virus in the State is being carried out very fast in the State.

The quantity of testing kits has been constantly increasing. 27 districts of the State are affected by Corona. More than 15 positive cases have been found in 14 districts of the State and not a single Corona patient has been found in other 24 districts.

The number of those districts is 14 where less than 10 corona patients have been found. A total of 487 containment areas have been created in the State. This has led to success in controlling the disease. Minister Narottam Mishra, Shri Kamal Patel, Govind Singh Rajput and Meena Singh were present on the occasion.Chouhan informed that it was decided to deposit an amount of Rs. one thousand each in the bank accounts of 8.85 lakh labourers and the amount has already been deposited. An amount of Rs 1,000 is being given to meet the immediate needs of about 7,000 labourers of other states who are stranded due to lockdown in Madhya Pradesh. He further informed that the landlords have been requested not to take rent from the tenants now, nor to get their houses vacated. Chouhan said that Sambal Yojana has been started anew in the State. Chouhan said that works have been started under MNREGA to provide employment to the needy persons as per the guideline of Government of India in the districts not affected by Corona infection. About 25 thousand students from different states have returned to their homes.

Following social distancing with full awareness and vigilance, the wheat procurement work is also being carried out smoothly in the state. Necessary economic activities are also being conducted following the prescribed guidelines.

The Cabinet Members briefed Chief Minister about the disease control efforts and about the public services being rendered by the social organisations in various districts.

8,24-4-20,Spread the good cheer,"Balcony concerts, synchronised meetings and Samaritan acts, the lockdown has spurred humanity at all levels

The virus still has us in its vice-like grip, sucking life through its tentacles but it surely hasn’t been able to defeat humanity. Rather has it come upon us to test our humanity and add the spark back in our lives? As the world goes through unprecedented lockdowns brought on by COVID-19, confining heaving populations to their homes, behind shut doors, there’s a window of hope. Those that have more than a window, a balcony, consider themselves even more blessed. For the window sill and the balcony have become the new social space for connecting not just with your neighbour but the community in general. Balcony performances, be it as concerts, songs or dance, have become the latest spectator delight, beginning with the Italians, who first started singing from their balconies to cheer each other up amid the doom and gloom. Now it is a worldwide phenomenon, with bands in Delhi and Gurgaon asking their members to get out on their balconies for impromptu performances. Even aspiring musicians and dancers are getting out their boom boxes on rooftops and balconies to give some relief to the community. In West Delhi, residents organised a balcony antakshari while in Paris, a neighbourhood organised a balcony quiz. An adorable video of two young children from Ohio, US, won the internet recently after they put up a cello performance for a 78-year-old neighbour in quarantine. Ideas keep multiplying as a fitness instructor in Sevilla, Spain, decided to give classes from his rooftop for his neighbours to follow from inside their homes. And a photographer has put together an online gallery of faces of the lockdown by asking inmates to pose on their balconies or windows. Of course, there is a whole breed of Samaritans, particularly the young, who are volunteering to run errands for senior citizens. Shops, too, are working beyond normal hours to accommodate shoppers and have even set aside “senior citizens’” hours for their comfort. Quarantined Lebanese peeped out of their apartment windows recently to celebrate the birthday of a woman who couldn’t leave her home.

There have been umpteen studies on how disasters and crisis bring out the best version of ourselves. Perhaps the surge in solidarity is global this time because the threat of the virus is the same for all, without regard for geography, religion, politics, race and creed. And there’s acceptance that nobody can claim victory over this mysterious virus unless everybody joins hands. This was summed up beautifully by a woman from Wuhan, who came out of lockdown after 76 days, saying the city had now learnt to accept help from others. “Because of quarantine, we have bonded with and supported each other in ways that I’ve never experienced in nine years of living here,” she wrote. Millions of Chinese, normally inscrutable and not given to emotion, are encouraging each other to stand strong, using the expression “jiayou” or “don’t give up.” Just when globalisation had fuelled a consumerist greed and a materialistic acquisition of good fortune, the virus has perhaps challenged our satiety value and testing if we can evolve. But when life seems uncertain by the bend, we have realised that no asset remotely has any value than that of the human bond, our primal need to herd together in solidarity and dependence. Only this awareness can get us through. As Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “Let’s distance ourselves from each other today so that we can embrace each other more warmly tomorrow.” History will judge if we could indeed become our best or crash to our worst.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spread-the-good-cheer-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/spread-the-good-cheer.html
9,24-4-20,Adopt fiscal prudence,"The Govt must implement much-needed reforms to rein in unproductive spends and prevent revenue leakages to create a sustainable basis for balancing its budget

The economic crisis triggered by Covid–19 has forced the Government to take recourse to some extraordinary measures, which include among others 30 per cent cut in the salary of all Members of Parliament (MP) besides the President, Vice-President and the Prime Minister, suspension of the MPLAD (MP Local Area Development) fund and a steep cut in expenditure of Ministries/departments. Reportedly, barring 18 Ministries/departments connected with healthcare, medical infrastructure and other essential services, all others are facing expenditure cuts for the April-June quarter. While 33 Ministries/departments can spend only up to 20 per cent of the budget, for 50 others the expenditure limit is even lower at 15 per cent. This is expected to continue for the remaining quarters of the year.

Faced with the double whammy of mammoth expenditure commitment — mostly on account of having to protect the livelihood of tens of millions in the informal sector on the one hand and steep decline in tax collections on the other, the Government’s worries on account of the fiscal deficit going completely out of control have heightened. This and the dire need to show that our macro-economic fundamentals are strong may have prompted the Centre to cut spending.

Inevitably, this will affect India’s medium to long-term growth trajectory, as implementation of projects gets deferred. In these moments of grave crisis, when saving precious lives and livelihoods is top priority, our policymakers may dismiss it outright. But it can’t detract us from a basic question as to why the Centre and States indulged in fiscal profligacy all through. Why didn’t they ever work to create a buffer for a rainy day? To be precise, four areas need urgent attention.

First, despite lofty declarations of reining unproductive expenditure, including reduction and rationalisation of subsidies (for the poor) these expenses continue to rise. They are mostly due to populist promises such as free food, electricity, water, loan waivers and so on, made by parties to win polls.

No wonder, major subsidies continue to increase to unsustainable levels. Food subsidy increased from Rs 1,45,000 crore during 2017-18 to Rs 2,19,000 crore during 2019-20 and is projected to increase further to Rs 2,53,000 crore during 2020-21 (free food for three months in the wake of the Corona crisis will lead to a further spurt). Likewise, fertiliser subsidy continues to hover around Rs 80,000 crore notwithstanding several measures like neem coating of urea or changes in the pricing norms for urea manufacturers aimed at reducing costs.

There are a host of subsidies given by States such as power, irrigation, credit, bonus over and above the Minimum Support Price (MSP) notified by the Centre, payment of sugarcane arrears to farmers, farm loan waivers and so on, which cost them hundreds of thousands of crores. Studies have shown that a major slice of these subsidies is cornered by better-off farmers (those with land holding over two hectares) even as the majority of resource-poor farmers are left out.

Second, tax collection is not only far below other countries but also has been consistently lower than the target fixed by the Government itself. The tax-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio in India — the Centre and States’ tax revenue — was 17 per cent during 2018-19, which is almost half of the average tax-GDP ratio of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a club of rich/developed countries at 34.3 per cent during 2018. During 2019-20, the total tax revenue of the Centre — after devolution to the States — was Rs 2,00,000 crore less than even the revised estimate (RE) at Rs 14,00,000 crore and Rs 4,00,000 crore lower than the budget estimate (BE) at Rs 16,00,000 crore.

This has a lot to do with the inability of the tax administration to make industries, businesses and High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) pay their fair share of taxes. This is exacerbated by cumbersome tax laws and slow-moving judicial systems which tax evaders exploit to the hilt. The tax dues locked up in litigation run into thousands of crores. To get an idea, let us look at the following.

Under the Sabka Vishwas Scheme (SVS) that offered to settle disputes relating to excise and service tax prior to the Goods and Services Tax from July 1, 2017, a total of about Rs 2,50,000 crore indirect tax dues from 1,83,000 assessees were involved.

Fed up with protracted litigation and desperate to garner some revenue, the Government offered relief, varying from 40 per cent to 70 per cent of the tax dues depending on the amount involved in disputes other than those covered under “voluntary disclosure.” All that it got was a paltry Rs 38,000 crore or 15 per cent of the total dues.

The disputed amount of direct taxes — both corporate and personal — is much higher at Rs 9,96,000 crore involving close to 5,00,000 cases (according to the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance). In her Budget speech for 2020-21, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a scheme christened Vivaad se Vishwas (VSV) wherein the assessees need not pay interest and penalty if the disputed amount is paid before June 30, 2020. Being much less attractive than the SVS, the VSV may turn out to be a damp squib.

In a bid to look business-friendly, the Narendra Modi Government has gone to extreme limits to offer tax concessions that have led to huge revenue loss. For instance, under the presumptive tax scheme, for businesses having a turnover of up to Rs 2 crore per annum, their profit is presumed as eight per cent of the turnover (six per cent in case, the firm conducts all its transactions in digital mode).

For a firm having a Rs 1 crore turnover and doing it all digitally, its income is taken as Rs 6,00,000 on which the tax works out to a mere Rs 33,000 against much higher tax liability on actual profit (e.g. taking profit at 10 per cent or Rs 10,00,000, this would be Rs 1,16,000 with profit at 20 per cent, tax will come to Rs 4,25,000). Given the culture of tax evasion nurtured for generations in business communities, one won’t be surprised if several of them may not be paying even a paltry Rs 33,000 to cite the above example.

Third, the Government is banking too much on petroleum products (POL) for boosting its revenue. During 2018-19, the Centre mopped up Rs 2,58,000 crore from this sector (Rs 2,14,000 crore from excise duty alone), whereas States garnered Rs 2,27,000 crore of which Value Added Tax) alone contributed Rs 2,00,000 crore.

Both grab every available opportunity to hike taxes on POL. Effective March 14, the Union Government hiked Central Excise Duty (CED) on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each from an already high of Rs 20 per litre and Rs 16 per litre respectively. Further, in the wake of the Corona crisis, it has also taken Parliament’s nod for further increase in CED by up to Rs 8 per litre each, any time it wishes.

This has resulted in a situation wherein taxes (CED and VAT) alone account for over 50 per cent of the retail price of these products. High tax on fuels comes at a heavy cost to the economy. This contributes to increased inflation, higher subsidy payments on fertilisers, food, irrigation and so on, which takes away a good slice of the higher revenue from fuel tax. This is a classic case of “taking from one hand and giving back from the other.” Besides, a lot of revenue is also foregone due to stunted growth of industries which are rendered uncompetitive, courtesy high fuel and power cost.

Fourth, the Government continues to hold on to several Public Sector Undertakings like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, Fertiliser Corporation of India Limited, Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Limited and so on, which have been making losses year-after-year.

These are neither closed nor restructured to restore viability of their operations; even as they are kept on the ventilator perennially draining out thousands of crores from the public exchequer.

Add to this the money the Government has been losing in recapitalising Public Sector Banks (PSBs) facing capital erosion due to ballooning non-performing assets (NPAs). During the last five years or so, it has pumped in over Rs 3,50,000 crore and more capital infusion is not ruled out given the unfolding NPA scenario.

The Government needs to implement much-needed reforms to rein in unproductive spends, including subsidies, and prevent revenue leakages to create a sustainable basis for balancing its budget. It must create revenue surplus so that it can deal with crisis situations without jeopardising development. The private firms should also change their mindset of leaving it entirely to the State to take care of workers in the informal sector. They need to ponder over funding “income support” to them during a crisis, like the one we are facing right now.

10,24-4-20,Do we have the real picture?,"The reliability of statistics and numerical data is crucial in order to ensure accurate information, particularly during a pandemic

While numbers don’t lie, they can definitely mislead people with half-truths. The reliability of statistics and numerical data is crucial to ensure accurate information. Unreliable numerals are arrived at by modifying the figures/values with a motive to portray an improved status or may result from subjective interpretation of data, negligence/ignorance of existing bias in the data collection process or when mathematical amateurs handle important data. Inside locked doors, 1.3 billion Indians have been looking at numbers on screens and newspapers to fathom the country’s Corona status. Over 18 per cent of the Indian population is vulnerable to infectious diseases. Hence, we have reason to fear an exponential spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths. With a testing rate as low as about five lakh (total tests done) in a population of 1.3 billion, we can only hope that the available numbers of the confirmed and cured cases and deaths give the real picture and not lull us into a false sense of having the “pandemic under control.”

The first line of defence against any pandemic is surveillance: Monitoring humans/animals to spot outbreaks and contain them and in the process, collect meaningful data. A laboratory test is the window to the pandemic without which we have no way of understanding the disease load. While we must prioritise testing of the critically ill, by leaving out patients with respiratory disorders/flu symptoms in a hospital, we are missing the chance of testing potential cases. People from marginalised sections of society may not have the same access to testing as someone from the middle/upper class. This may lead to fear/distrust in hospitals/healthcare centres and be a deterrent in their seeking further care or testing. This is a recipe for undercounting and keeping the disease burden invisible in the country.

In Mumbai, about 80 per cent of the Corona deaths happened within a few hours to a day, following hospital admissions. In contrast, the observed median time from admission-to-death in China is 16 days and in the US for non-ICU and ICU patients the averages are 9.7 and seven days respectively. Thus Mumbai’s figures prove delayed testing, just before or after death. They also throw light on how quality data can underscore important points to enable good strategy decisions and crisis response, without which individuals/authorities cannot learn whether measures adopted against the pandemic are working or not. Laboratory tests detect active infections, past infections, immunity status of people and herd immunity in communities. Quality data of the epidemic would be — if the published number is of tests performed or individuals tested (considering one individual may need more than one test), whether negative results are included, whether pending results are included and so on. All these put together will clarify whether the growth of cases is real or only reflects the expanding degree of surveillance/number of tests conducted or if the parameters for data collection are not well sorted. To date, with liberal testing yet to pick up, all eyes are on the rapid serology tests. These tests can decipher results in minutes, are cheaper (than the molecular test — RT-PCR) and can effectively screen blood for public health management purpose though they are not confirmatory in nature and hence not used for clinical practice. Rapid tests will help screen a large percentage of people and if we know that a good chunk of our population has developed antibodies to the virus, it may help authorities allow for less-restrictive measures or staggered lifting of social distancing measures. These tests can be added to routine blood draws that all phlebotomists do regularly with no additional trouble to the patient.

Hospitals are keen on serology tests which could help them identify which healthcare workers have developed a level of immunity already. If there is a batch of say 10 technicians extracting samples and five were immune, the hospital administration could assign them duties and keep the laboratory running. The Coronavirus is here and will surely spread as there is no vaccine or proven cure. At 1.28 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), India’s public expenditure on healthcare is the lowest globally (against 17 per cent in the US, 9.8 per cent in the UK and 1.68 per cent in Sri Lanka). Our healthcare system is patchy and we are in no position to cope with this new crisis if it hits us head-on in the coming months.

India has not been able to deal with common infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB), leprosy, HIV/AIDS, let alone a novel virus of a highly contagious nature. The yearly death toll of TB is 1.5 million, HIV/AIDS is 69,000 besides an ever-increasing number of non-infectious disease morbidities ranging from cancer to cardiac diseases. With a reproductive number or RO of over 2.5, Covid-19, if left to sweep through our population of 1.3 billion, will infect 84.5 million and kill 1.17 million people. With a string of Covid-19 hotspots staring at us, surveillance combined with mass screening must now exist along with quality data collection. There are genuine capacity issues but the Government needs to build it with dedicated funding, perhaps as part of the next stimulus package.

11,24-4-20,Consumers must not chicken out,"The poultry sector has incurred heavy losses of around Rs 1,750 crore in a month due to panic triggered by the spread of misinformation among meat eaters that the Coronavirus can be contracted by consuming chicken and eggs

The Coronavirus outbreak has brought nearly the whole world to a standstill with multiple countries going into lockdowns in an effort to minimise infection spread and casualties. These shutdowns are having a cascading effect on the economies of nations and many industries are going under.

However, one industry that is not just bearing the brunt of the shutdowns but is also reeling from the impact of false news and rumours surrounding the COVID-19 virus is the poultry sector.

The prices of poultry have plunged to Rs 10-30 per kg at the farm gate level due to a slump in chicken demand while the average cost of production is Rs 80 per kg.

Consequently, poultry breeders have demanded a relief package from the Government claiming that the sector has incurred heavy losses of around Rs 1,750 crore in a month due to panic triggered by the spread of misinformation among meat eaters that the Coronavirus can be contracted by consuming chicken and eggs. This massive drop in sales of chicken and eggs has impacted the livelihoods of a large number of poultry farmers.

Although, the Coronavirus is a deadly disease, which has claimed countless lives around the globe, it certainly is not spread through the consumption of poultry and poultry products and this has been confirmed by scientific reports and studies. However, many irresponsible news agencies and websites are spreading misinformation.

Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another Coronavirus — the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak — moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans. Now, the Coronavirus is spreading globally primarily through people-to-people contact.

Taking note of the myths and misconceptions clouding the poultry industry, even the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s (FSSAI’s) chief GSG Ayyangar came forward to issue a clarification. He stated clearly that the belief that the Coronavirus will spread through eating chicken, mutton and seafood is nothing but a misconception.

Not the first time poultry sector has been hit: Unfortunately, this is not the first time that a virus that emanated from an animal has scared people and they have stopped eating chicken and meat due to it. In the 1980s, the mad cow disease spread in the UK, which was a result of farmers giving non-vegetarian feed to cows that affected their nervous system and triggered health concerns in humans as well.

Later it was established that eating chicken and eggs cannot cause mad cow disease. Similarly, zoonotic viruses such as Swine flu, which started in the pig farms of Mexico, and Ebola virus that was a result of consuming and handling uncooked bush meat had also caused a similar and unwarranted backlash against the poultry industry.

The most recent Nipah virus outbreak, which was found in people living closer to the habitat of bats, had also scared people off chicken and eggs. But the fact remains that except for the first outbreak in Malaysia-Singapore, which was related to contact with pigs and the outbreak in Philippines associated with horse slaughter, most other outbreaks in the Indo-Bangladesh region were associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats. It had a very high secondary attack rate but was most certainly not spread through poultry consumption.

Chicken is safe and a crucial source of nutrients: Chicken is an essential choice for many healthy diets as it is high in protein and low in calories and carbohydrates. It is also a well-established source of B vitamins and selenium.

The nutritional elements of chicken aid in the metabolism of fats and sugars in the body that is necessary for our daily energy needs. Consuming chicken strengthens the bones as well and is responsible for maintaining healthy cells.

Due to the Coronavirus rumours, many people are looking for vegetarian alternatives like spinach and jackfruit but they cannot provide the same amount of nutrients as chicken. It is imperative, therefore, that the industry as well as the administration rise to the occasion and effectively counter the false narratives with facts.

In fact, the Union Health Ministry must step in to address all such miscommunications through regular advisories and press releases.

Poultry farmers must step up hygiene measures: The onus also lies on the poultry industry to initiate a series of measures towards raising safe and healthy poultry birds. Unhygienic breeding of birds in several farms and backyards has often been a cause for concern for consumers. The poultry industry must do its bit to boost consumer confidence. They must also adopt the use of safe and healthy solutions and alternatives to antibiotics such as bacteriophage-based poultry feeds to raise healthier antibiotic-free chicken. Poultry farms which take proper hygiene and preventive measures while raising their chicken can prevent any bacterial infections and virus in their stock. Government regulatory bodies must also keep a thorough check on poultry farm operations and issue media releases that squash unfounded rumors, which are affecting poor farmers as well as the industry. This will help in reviving the demand for chicken and eggs and help people get their required amount of nutrition that is necessary for good health.

12,24-4-20,Remembering Rudy,"Rudratej ‘Rudy’ Singh, president, BMW Group India, who passed away earlier this week, will be missed by one and all

Late morning on Monday, when I received a call from a friend at another car company asking whether the rumour that Rudy had passed away, I dismissed it as a hoax but I did tell that person that I’d check. A quick phone call to a former colleague of Rudy was unfortunately one where the news was confirmed. Rudratej was 46 and had taken over as BMW India Group President just eight months ago, the first Indian in the top position of the Bavarian car and bikemaker. His career began at Dabur but he made a name for himself at Hindustan Lever and its parent Unilever, where he was known as ‘Mr Pepsodent’ thanks to his success with the toothpaste brand. His stint, running the international business operations at Royal Enfield, culminated with the launch of the Indian motorcycle manufacturer’s 650cc V-twin interceptors. However, things may not have gone completely as per Rudy’s plans at RE.

Well, he landed on his feet becoming the first Indian boss at BMW and when I met him for lunch a week or so after he took over, we had a great chat about the luxury market in India. While Rudy had made his name selling toothpaste, he was a luxury connoisseur, especially of watches. Rudy could talk for hours about watches, telling people which one to buy. The last time I spent a considerable amount of time with him was at the Indian Car Of The Year (ICOTY) awards at the JW Marriott, Delhi Aerocity. He was wearing a Panerai. But I know he was angling for a Uylsse Nardin, the only watch he said that ever really appreciates in value.

It was from the luxury watch market, which he said, had become symptomatic of the state of the luxury market in India, which is dominated by discounts. He wanted to change that as part of his brief to transform the fortunes of BMW in India, which had seen a few rough years. But now, armed with a new line-up, especially the fantastic new 3-series, Rudy wanted the premium and luxury car market in India to pivot from being discount-driven to becoming experience-driven.

He wanted to highlight that buying a BMW was buying into an experience, a family, and not just a badge, through which it competed with Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Volvo with discounts. “The competition should be about the different experiences that different brands offer,” said he. We were supposed to have met in Chennai, on March 9, when BMW India introduced the facelifted X1. The event was later cancelled due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. In a text, I’d mentioned to him that we’d meet again soon. But that never happened.

I feel really gutted that Rudy died not just because he was so young or just a few years older than me but also because it came just two weeks after BMW India lost their sales head Mihir Dayal after a battle with cancer. Ironically, one of Rudy’s last tweets was him mourning Mihir’s death and he presciently, it seems in retrospect, said that he would join Mihir soon.

My deepest condolences to Rudy’s family, his friends as well as his colleagues both at BMW India and his previous workplaces. It is truly painful to lose someone at a time like this where we cannot even go to a funeral or remember someone at a prayer meeting. But Rudy did leave his mark on the Indian premium car industry and he will be remembered fondly.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/remembering-rudy-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/remembering-rudy.html
13,24-4-20,FPOs allowed to directly procure agri produce,"



|

In a major move to liberalise agri-markets, the Yogi Adityanath government has allowed the farmers producer’s organisations (FPOs), food processing industries, cold storages and silos owners to directly procure agricultural produce from farmers outside the Mandi Samiti.

The UP government has liberalised the rules enabling the purchase of agricultural produce outside the Mandi Samiti. The reform will directly benefit millions of farmers, enabling them to get a better price of their produce as the new system will eliminate the long chain of middleman in agri trade.

Though the government has said the decision has been taken in view of the COVID-19 pandemic to end the crowding in the agriculture mandis, the UP assembly in April 2018 had passed an amendment to the UP Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act, 1964, allowing the operation of private ‘mandis’.

The amendment had allowed companies to set up procurement centres outside the periphery of existing mandis for direct purchase of produce from farmers. This was aimed at widening the procurement basket and providing more remunerative prices to farmers.

The rules of the amended Act were notified last year and will now be implemented.

With these reforms, all the cold storage/silo owners with storage capacity of 4,000 MT will be eligible to get sub-mandi licence. There are a total of 1,911 cold storages in the state.

All the flour mills, dal mills and oil mills with installed capacity of processing 10 MT per day will also get the sub-mandi licence and will be able to directly purchase the agri produce from farmers without going to the Mandi Samiti.

The government has also exempted the sub-mandi licences from the annual licence fee of Rs 2,000 for the current fiscal 2020-21 while the fee has been waived for the government controlled organisations, cooperative bodies, public sector undertakings.

The government, for promoting the FPOs in agri trade, has waived the annual licence fee of Rs 1,000 and bank guarantee of Rs i lakh.

The NITI Aayog in 2016 and the Union Agriculture Ministry had set up a panel to draft a model act that would look at agri-marketing in a more holistic manner and suggest a legal template for states to adopt. Since agriculture is a state subject, only states can implement laws related to the farm sector.

At present, the bulk of the agro marketing is done through 251 government-operated mandis across the state’s 75 districts. These notified ‘mandis’ had clocked total transactions worth nearly Rs 67,000 crore in 2018-19.

UP Krishi Utpadan Mandi Parishad had earned Rs 1,823 crore by way of taxes and levies in 2018-19, compared to Rs 1,211 crore in 2017-18, an increase of over 50 per cent, despite foregoing about Rs 50 crore in taxes on desi ghee. In the 2019-20 its earnings were over Rs 2,100 crore.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fpos-allowed-to-directly-procure-agri-produce.html
14,24-4-20,Islamic Centre urges people to follow lockdown norms To live stream Quran recitation,"



|

In view of the nation-wide lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus and the social distancing protocol in place, Islamic Centre of India announced that it would live stream recitation of Quran during Ramzan from April 25.

The live stream will be done every day on social media site Facebook from 8 pm to 10 pm and can be accessed across the globe.

Clerics and religious leaders have issued appeals to people to stay indoors and pray in their houses to follow lockdown during Ramzan.

Chief of All India Islamic Centre, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, said on Thursday, “As lockdown is on and social distancing norms are also in force, All India Islamic Centre will be live streaming recitation of Quran and every day, two paras (chapters) will be recited from 8 pm to 10 pm.”

“People should perform wazu and listen to it with their family and later perform 20 ratkaats of Namaaz-e-Tarweeh. It is important for Muslims to pray to Allah during Ramzan, but this is the best way to pray and keep everyone safe in the present situation,” he said.

“There should be no roza iftar parties at all, instead that money should be utilised for food and ration for the poor. Also, people should avoid sending loads of iftari to mosques and only send for four or five people in the mosque. People should pray especially to end this pandemic,” the maulana said.

A similar appeal was issued by Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas who asked people to abide by lockdown norms during the crisis.

“The coronavirus pandemic has affected more than 200 countries till now. Ramzan is coming but one should abide by lockdown norms and we should abide by what is suggested by doctors and authorities,” he said.

Earlier Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had urged religious leaders to ensure that social distancing was maintained during festivals.

“I know there are events like Baisakhi and Ramzan. I would request all religious leaders to urge people not to gather for any public function as social distancing must be practised,” he had said.

Make plan to generate 15L

jobs within next 6 mths: CM



PNS | Lucknow

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked officials to prepare a plan to generate 15 lakh employment opportunities within next three to six months so that economy of the state could be strengthened.

The officials have been asked to give the proposal within a week.

This directive was given after a presentation on generating employment opportunities in the state.

“It will be a great challenge to strengthen the economy once the lockdown is lifted. We need to prepare ourselves for this challenging task. Therefore, prepare a plan which can generate employment for 15 lakh people within next three to six months,” Yogi said during the meeting.

He said MSME, Horticulture and Food Processing, Khadi Gramodyog, One District, One Product (ODOP), National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swarozgar Yojana, Skill Development Mission should work together and come up with a strategy.

“Even MGNREGA could prove a game changer in giving employment to the youth,” he said.

The chief minister said that under Chief Minister Apprenticeship Scheme, Rs 2,500 was given to trainees. “Prepare a plan to link two lakh youth with this scheme. This will give the youth a foothold to tide over financial crisis,” he said and added that youth should be provided employment under Youth Hub programme.

Yogi also suggested that MSME and ODOP could also help in generating large-scale employment. It could start with stitching school dress or weaving sweaters for students of the state-run schools. The women self0help groups could be provided machines so that they could get employment at their doorsteps, he added.

“Similarly, the Food Processing department can train women in making papad, pickle and pattal. In fact, the women in SHGs can also generate employment by making masks,” the chief minister suggested.

“Teach the youth the virtue of branding like itra, dhoop and incense sticks. Provide them market and allow them to sell their products in competitive market. Same can be done with dairy products and flower,” he said.

“Then there are opportunities in technical field like repairing mobile phones. We can use ITI and polytechnic institutes to do this,” Yogi said.

Rural Development Minister Rajendra Singh ‘Moti’, MSME Minister Sidharth Nath Singh, Panchayati Raj Minister Bhupendra Chaudhry, and principal secretaries of these departments attended the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/islamic-centre-urges-people-to-follow-lockdown-norms-to-live-stream-quran-recitation.html

17,24-4-20,Health insurers now cover treatment for corona under insurance policy,"With each passing day, more and more people are testing positive for COVID-19-popularly known as Coronavirus - globally.

Taking cue from the increasing panic amongst the people and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, all health insurers in India have started covering treatment for coronavirus under the regular health insurance policy.

However, as per the directions of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the insurers have even introduced Coronavirus specific health insurance products that provide dedicated coverage against the deadly virus. Amit Chhabra, Health- Business Head, policybazaar.com said such plans are an excellent way to compensate for loss of income during the treatment of the illness as the policyholder is paid the entire sum insured as a lump sum in case of testing positive for coronavirus.

However, one must only buy these plans as a rider along with the regular indemnity based health plans that provide comprehensive coverage against all illnesses and ailments up to the total sum insured.

The offered fixed-benefit plans for coronavirus are available for a limited period-1 year-only and cannot be renewed or used for treatment of any other illness, also these policies are only applicable to Indian residents. While other eligibility criteria like age, sum insured, individual or group are specific to each policy.

While fixed-benefit plans provide dedicated coverage for a specific ailment, it is always advised that apart from covering yourself under a fixed-benefit plan you must also protect yourself with an indemnity based health insurance plan.

Such plans can be renewed every year and provide you overall protection irrespective of the illness for which you are seeking treatment.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/health-insurers-now-cover-treatment-for-corona-under-insurance-policy.html

44,24-4-20,6-month-old loses battle to Covid-19 in Chandigarh,"A six-month old baby, with congenital heart disease lost the battle of life due to coronavirus in the city on Thursday.

The baby girl named Ritika, from Phagwara Punjab was admitted in PGIMER on April 9 with congenital malformations and had to undergo a surgery. The cause of death is reported to be refractory shock, pulmonary artery hypertension and Covid-19.

Her parents, grandparents and all the 54 doctors and health workers, who were treating the baby patient have been tested negative and found free from any infection. The family members and healthcare workers have been quarantined, as a precautionary measure.

“After being admitted to the PGIMER, the baby girl was very sick and not fit for surgical interventions for reported pathologies. She was kept on ventilator and required medication. Her health status deteriorated over the days. She was tested for Covid-19 on April 21 and was tested positive,” said an official spokesman of PGIMER on Thursday.

“The baby’s health condition continued to deteriorate further and she expired at 12:47 pm on April 23. The cause of death was reported to be refractory shock, pulmonary artery hypertension and Covid-19,” the spokesman said.

“We are investigating how the baby acquired Covid-19 infection. Given that the incubation period of Covid-19 infection is generally up to two weeks (but can be variable), it is possible that the baby may have been incubating the infection at the time of admission to PGIMER,” the spokesman added.

The baby was cremated at the crematorium in Sector 25 here.

45,24-4-20,Odisha outsmarts Spain in curbing Covid-19,"In terms of coronavirus spread management and providing healthcare facilities to the patients, Odisha whose population is around the same as Spain is far ahead of the advanced European country.

The issue is being discussed in international level after an American CEO redesigned Indian map where he marked the Indian states population which is almost equal to population of some of the countries.

An US company has brought similarities between Odisha and Spain. While Odisha has a population of 4.5 crore, as many as 4.7 crore people live in Spain. The difference is that Odisha has a high population density than Spain.

The possibility of COVID-19 spread is more in place where there is high population density. While Odisha is spread over only 155.707 square kilometre of area, Spain’s geographical area is 505.909 square kilometre.

When it comes to the management of COVID-19, Odisha is far ahead of Spain.

Odisha had by April 14 reported 60 COVID-19 positive cases while Spain reported 1,77,633 positive cases by April 15.

When Odisha reported one death of COVID, the casualty in Spain is as high as 18,579 persons. There is also no respite for Spain which has as many as 88,201 patients in mild condition and 7,371 people in serious or crical condition.

On the contrary, Odisha has only 41 active COVID positive cases of which only two patients require hospital care while 39 others just remain in hospital isolation in order to save themselves and check spread of the virus to other persons or to the community, said National Health Mission Director Shalini Pandit.

Odisha has only 41 patients while the State has already kept above 3, 600 beds for the COVID positive or suspected persons. While 18 patients (30 per cent) in Odisha have been discharged from hospital, 70,853 patients have been cured in Spain.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odisha-outsmarts-spain-in-curbing-covid-19.html
46,24-4-20,WB fund: State to rejuvenate watershed projects,"The World Bank has agreed to extend financial support to Odisha to undertake projects under Rejuvenating Watersheds for Agricultural Resilience through Innovative Development (REWARD).

Following negotiations for the project, Odisha will go ahead with the 70 million Dollar World Bank project to improve land and water conservation and climate resilience in watershed areas.

While Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Land Resources, Government of India Satyabrata Sahu is happy with such a development, not only Odisha, Karnatatka and Andhra Pradesh will be benefitted with similar REWARD Projects.

World Bank India Director Junaid Kamal Ahmed has informed the Union Government in this regard and has complimented efforts of Odisha Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy in this regard, said sources.

While Additional Secretary Sahu played a key role in roping in World Bank for REWARD initiative in Odisha, Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC) Pradipta Kumar Mahapatra took leadership in this regard.

Principal Secretary Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment Saurabh Garg held productive discussions with World Bank team for REWARD project and the international banker was convinced about the proactive approach of the Odisha Government, said sources.

Now Odisha will go ahead with the project to rejuvenate its watershed sector in a big way, said a senior official in Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment.

The project is a Program for Results (P4R) instrument and will be implemented in next six years. The proposed IBRD loan and the State Government will jointly fund the project in 70:30 proportions.

The REWARD will be different from “business as usual” watershed programmes because the State is expected to adopt modern technologies and data-focused land resource inventorization for watershed planning and implementation, work with technical partners, and expand the application of data bases and DSS tools to help farmers improve productivity and climate resiliency.

“With proven capacities and experience of DFID assisted Western Odisha Rural Livelihood Project (WORLP) and other watershed programmes, the State will effectively adopt these transformative technologies,” said Director of Soil Conservation and Watershed Development HK Panda.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wb-fund--state-to-rejuvenate-watershed-projects.html

In case of non-payment of penalty, Ekka will have to undergo a further jail term of one year.

Former MLA from Kolebira constituency Ekka is accused of money laundering of Rs 20 crore 31 lakh and 77 thousand. The Court convicted him in March. The sentence was delayed due to the lockdown, so the court on Thursday pronounced the sentence through video conferencing. The case of money laundering was registered in 2009 against Ekka.

Notably, Ekka was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Simdega court on July 3, 2018 in the case of murder of a Para Teacher Manoj Kumar, but he was granted bail later by the High Court.

During the hearing of the case, the ED recorded the statements of a total of 56 witnesses in the court. Enosh recorded the statements of 71 witnesses in his defense. During the hearing of the case in the court, the ED team had identified 116 sale deeds related to the immovable property purchased by the accused Enos in the court.

The special public prosecutor of the ED, while arguing in the court, said these documents were the main evidence. A total of Rs 22.38 crore worth of assets were seized by ED as residential property, land, bank account, national savings certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, vehicle, rifle, pistol etc.

62,24-4-20,"FIRs against four for ‘spreading infection’, flouting curfew in Punjab","Punjab police has registered a case against two corona positive patients in Patiala for flouting curfew norms, and “spreading infection”. On the same charges, two persons were booked in another case in Rajpura town of Patiala district for organizing hookah parties.

With 49 cases, Patiala district is a Covid-19 hotspot, of which 30 cases are from Rajpura alone.

Patiala Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu said that a letter was received from Patiala Civil Surgeon with copy to Patiala Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday, and a preliminary inquiry was conducted.

“On the basis of that, an FIR was registered under sections 188, 269, 271 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and 51 of Disaster Management Act at Kotwali police station in Patiala against Krishan Kumar Gaba and Krishan Kumar Bansal along with some unknown persons,” said the SSP.

The district police chief said that even after the imposition of curfew and lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, they “violated the directions and orders issued by administration and kept on doing their businesses. It is learnt that they had travelled at many places in Patiala and even outside. Further, they became positive with Covid-19 and because of their irresponsible act, many others came in the grip of this epidemic”.

Notably, Gaba runs a shop at a congested books’ market in Patiala, and he had already sold books to many parents in the city disregarding the lockdown — putting all of them at the risk of virus infection.

What is worrisome that the source of infection of the book trader is not known. And to top it all! The bookseller sold books to over 100 parents, in several cities, including Rajpura, Zirakpur. Tracing his contacts is a herculean task for the state health department.

Patiala Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit had to issue an appeal to the people, who had come in contact with the infected trader, to come forward. He had also asked the parents, who purchased books from the infected trader, to come forward on their own.

The Deputy Commissioner, taking strong note of the “misuse” of curfew pass for carrying out business, has made it clear that any laxity on the part of authorities while issuing curfew pass would be dealt with strictly.

In another case, an FIR was lodged against two in Rajpura for spreading corona virus and flouting curfew norms.

“Rajpura Senior Medical Officer (SMO) today intimated Rajpura DSP through a letter regarding irresponsible movement of individuals (who were found to be Covid-19 positive) in Rajpura city. A preliminary inquiry was thus also conducted by Police Station City Rajpura. On the basis of that, FIR has been registered on Thursday under sections 188, 269, 271, 336 of the IPC and 51 of Disaster Management Act at Police Station City Rajpura, against Krishan alias Kallu and Balraj alias Ballu along with some unknown persons,” said SSP Sidhu.

He said that even after imposition of curfew and lockdown, they violated the directions and orders issued by administration and met many people in Rajpura.

“It is learnt that they had travelled outside Rajpura also. Further, they became positive with covid 19 and because of their irresponsible act, many others including their family came in the grip of this epidemic,” he added.

Senior officials confirmed that more than 20 of the active cases are directly or primary links of the hookah parties organized by them which continues almost every day ever since the lockdown started, last month.

Sources confirmed that the hookah gatherings, attended by businessmen, satta operators, local leaders and even medical professionals, were the primary reason in majority of the 15 cases cropping up from Rajpura block in the past week.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/firs-against-four-for----spreading-infection-----flouting-curfew-in-punjab.html

64,24-4-20,Punjab to conduct detailed audit of Covid deaths,"Among states witnessing high mortality rate, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has ordered a detailed audit of every Covid death in the State by experts to understand and check the high rate in the State.

At the same time, the Government was also strengthening its pandemic containment measures, under the guidance of an expert team.

The State Government was being guided by a Group of Experts in handling the Covid crisis which comprises former PGI Director Dr KK Talwar, State Health University Vice-Chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur; PGIMER’s School of Public Health’s former head Dr Rajesh Kumar, as well as experts from PGI, John Hopkins University, among others, said the Chief Minister while sharing the information with the Congress national president Sonia Gandhi during a video conferencing on Thursday.

The Chief Minister said that the mortality numbers in the State were high largely due to co-morbidity and lack of health-seeking behaviour (patients come late to hospital).

“Despite the high mortality rate of 6.2 percent, the rate of growth of Covid-19 in Punjab was lower than India, with the cases doubling in 16 days against the national average of nine days. In percentage terms, cases in Punjab had steadily declined from 2.57 percent of the total cases in India (as of March 31) to 1.22 percent in three weeks (till April 22), revealing effective containment of Covid-19 in the State,” he said.

Citing the example of Nawanshahr as a “case of effective containment” that had been appreciated by the Central Government as well as the media, Capt Amarinder said that in Nawanshahar, which was one of the first hotspots in the country, all 18 treated cases (besides one initial death of granthi Baldev Singh) had recovered and been discharged, and no case had been reported since March 2, 2020.

The Chief Minister said that Punjab had to be compared with Kerala and Gujarat, which were also states with high NRI population. Punjab was doing significantly better than Gujarat, and in terms of cases per million population, even lower than Kerala (nine per million in Punjab versus 12 per million in Kerala), he pointed out.

Punjab currently has 257 positive cases, with 16 dead and two critical patients (one on ventilator and one on HDU), while 53 had been cured or discharged. The state has three containment zones (where there are more than 15 cases — Jawaharpur, Safabadi Gate-Patiala, Budhlada), while three districts (Ferozepur, Fazilka, Bathinda) are ‘green zones’ with no cases.

With respect to testing, the Chief Minister said that 7,887 tests have been done so far. At present, the testing rate in the State, at 248 per million, is slightly lower than national average of 309 per million (excluding Rapid Testing).

Regarding the Rapid Testing, the Chief Minister said that 3,502 cases were tested before ICMR suspended such tests. The state currently has 10,500 rapid testing kits supplied by ICMR, while 10,000 had been ordered by the State Government, with deliveries in progress.

The Government has also floated tender inquiry for another 50,000 kits.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-conduct-detailed-audit-of-covid-deaths.html
65,24-4-20,‘10% small industrial units resume work amid lockdown’,"As country undergoing conditional relaxation from lockdown so as to give life to economic activities, many small scale units have started operation in State. According to Jharkhand Small Industries Association (JSIA), after Centre and State gave nod to restart industries lifting lockdown partially, around 10 per cent industries have become functional.

Jharkhand Small Industries Association (JSIA) honorary secretary, Anjay Pacheriwala said, “Around 10 per cent industrial units have become functional while 30 to 40 per cent will become functional by Monday.”

As per Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Jharkhand government, JSIA has made it mandatory for companies to enforce social distancing at work, provide adequate supply of sanitizers and temporary accommodation facilities to its workforce so that units can become functional.

Sources said that as per MHA and state government guidelines, the other units are working in direction to meet the criteria. Sources said that the biggest obstruction in industrial units starting their operation is providing accommodation facilities for its workforce as many units have problems in arranging temporary accommodation facilities. As per guidelines the accommodation facilities should not be far from factories, many units are taking time to start their operations.

Apart from accommodation facilities, the other hurdles in starting industrial units, is supply of raw material and markets for finished products. In Jharkhand there are around 50,000 small industrial units with around 5000 to 5500 operating in State Capital. The industrial units operating in Jharkhand are in food processing, garments and apparels, plastic industries and fabrication.

Anjay Pacheriwala says as there is complete lockdown since March 25 there is severe shortage of raw materials as most the raw materials is supplied from other states.

The Industries body is also considering that only production will not solve the problem unless there is market for their products.

As there is that indication that Government will go for lifting the lockdown in phase wise, getting suitable markets for their products will not be an easy task for JSIA.

Moreover, JSIA believes that even if centre lifts the lockdown it will take another six months to become business activities normal. The JSIA for survival of industrial units is looking to state and centre with an eyes seeking some relief.

The JSIA wants the state government to give relief on fixed electricity charges for the month of March and April as in these two months industrial activities were stopped due to lockdown.

The JSIA is also looking for financial assistance as despite no industrial activities there was no salary cuts of employees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---10--small-industrial-units-resume-work-amid-lockdown---.html
66,24-4-20,Cyber criminals become active during lockdown,"There has been a spurt in cases of cybercrime amid the lockdown restrictions, police said on Thursday. Unregistered websites offering home delivery of items –right from liquor to essential services– have become hunting grounds for cybercriminals here, they added.

Since the lockdown was imposed, cyber frauds in Jamtara –infamous as the cybercrime capital of India– have been active. In fact, some of them even succeeded in duping people in West Bengal on the pretext of delivering liquor to their doorsteps, news reports have said. The incidents occured soon after West Bengal Chief Minister announced home delivery of liquor and later retracted.

The cyber frauds, however, did not stop there. Police said that similar incidents were reported from Jamshedpur too. ""Yesterday (Wednesday) we got a report from Jamshedpur that someone was offering home delivery of alcohol. They asked for a registration charge of Rs. 400 and a one-time-payment of Rs.500 to begin the services. They were frauds, of course,"" said Deputy Superintendent of Police (Cyber Cell), Shivendra, who goes by one name.

The liquor delivery scam has grabbed headlines lately. Sharing the modus operandi of the fraudsters, sources from the Cyber Cell of the police department here said that most of them used phishing to dupe people. Some of them shared their contact numbers online to draw the attention of tipplers as the entire country has gone dry, they added. Once a potential customer dialled the numbers, the fraudsters asked them to make online payments beforehand. Some victims even fell for the promise of discounts if they shared their One Time Password (OTP) and ended up losing a handsome amount of money from their account.

""Since all liquor shops are closed and the sale of liquor is prohibited during the lockdown, people should realise that any person offering home delivery of alcohol is a potential cyber fraud,"" said Shivendra. It is worth mentioning here that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in its guidelines for lockdown, has strictly prohibited sale of liquor and tobacco products.

Cybercriminals have also been active on platforms like OLX lately, police said. Recently, a Ranchi man was duped by a cyber-fraud who had put up and advertisement for selling a car, they added. However, exact figures on the number of such incidents were not available with the police.

Jharkhand has been home to many gangs of cyber criminals. Jamtara, which has gained the infamy of being the Indian equivalent of Ramnicu Valcea, dubbed as Scamville, initially started breeding cyber criminals and later they spread in other districts neighbouring Jamtara. Around 200 Kilometers north of Ranchi, Jamtara is a largely backward district.

Young cyber criminals from villages in this district have duped rich businessmen, bureaucrats, and even policemen from across the country through phishing, police said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cyber-criminals-become-active-during-lockdown.html

""Seven suspects tested positive for Covid-19 today (Thursday). Three of them are from Hindpiri and one from Bero in suburban Ranchi,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. The development also takes the number of coronavirus patients in Bero to two, he added.

Out of the 56 cases reported in State so far, 33 are from Hindpiri alone – a locality that has emerged as the hotspot of coronavirus in Jharkhand. A total of 35 cases have been reported in Ranchi, which means that more than 60 per cent of Covid-19 cases in the tribal state are from the State capital.

By now, at least three Covid-19 patients in Jharkhand have died. Two of them were from Hindpiri in Ranchi and one from Bokaro. However, the second death in Ranchi has not been counted as a Covid-19 death as the woman, who died of cardiac ailments on Tuesday, tested negative for Coronavirus earlier that day, health officials said.

According to the National Health Mission (NHM), at least eight people have recovered completely from their ailments in Jharkhand so far. The report on Thursday said that most of the Covid-19 patients in Jharkhand fell in the age bracket of 31 to 50 years.

Figures show that there has been a 21 percent increase, from 3,287 to 3,993, in the cases of domestic violence against women between February and April 20.

That was not all! A similar percentage increase was also recorded in total cases of crime against women (CAW), from 4709 to 5695, during the same period.

To deal with the same, the Punjab Police has formulated a detailed strategy to tackle such cases, with daily action taken reports to be submitted by the Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSP) for crime against women (CAW).

The State has been under a curfew since March 23, two days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed.

“There has been a substantial decrease in the number of complaints registered for dowry harassment, rape and eve-teasing (sexual harassment of women). This is probably because people are not stepping out of their homes and there is increased police presence around the state,” said the state Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta.

RISE IN NUMBER OF CALLS ON HELPLINES

As per the data, the average number of calls received on ‘Dial 112’, the emergency response helpline, had increased to 133 per day — a whopping 34 percent — between March 21 and April 20, up from an average of 99.33 in the preceding three months. As many as 34 percent of these calls pertained to domestic violence cases, the police said, adding that per day increase in total crime against women cases in this period is 30 percent.

DSPs TO SEND DAILY ACTION TAKEN REPORT

Later, a video conferencing was also held on Thursday between the DGP and the Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs) associated with the Crimes-Against-Women Cell and Women Help Desk Officials to take stock of the situation and discuss measures to tackle this increase.

As per the detailed strategy, presented during the meeting by ADGP Community Affairs Division (CAD) Gurpreet Deo, the standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been put in place to devise the police’s response mechanism.

The meeting decided that DSP CAW will send a daily report in a defined format to track all such complaints and monitor the action taken.

Authorities and leaders are using the app to combat fake news and rumours that are being spread around COVID19 and to hear grievances of people to ensure everyone’s safety. Additionally, major political parties and associations at national and regional level such as BJP, National Students Union of India, Janata Dal united, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, Madhya Pradesh Youth Congress, among others, have also been using this app to connect with communities.

Authorities and leaders are using the app to educate people around COVID-19, various government policies and listening to grievances of people to solve their problems. Since each district faces different types of problems, authorities are using the app to share specific instructions with people.

Some of the politicians who are actively using the app to communicate and engage with their communities are Hema Malini, Varun Gandhi, Kamal Nath, C.P. Joshi, Chandrabhan Singh, Bhopinder S Hooda, Deepender Singh Hooda, Om Prakash Dhankar, and Dr Alok Ranjan.

Speaking on the trend, Azhar Iqubal, Co-founder and CEO, Public, ‘’The world is grappling with the pandemic of COVID-19 and it has sent people in panic mode like never before, with misinformation only adding to the chaos. Everyone needs credible sources of information and ways to stay connected with their communities. Through the Public app, we are helping leaders and authorities to reach out to people to communicate the right and relevant information and combat misinformation around the virus. The app, unlike other social media platforms, provides updates to users as per their location, and has become a helpful tool for politicians to communicate and create awareness among people which is very critical at this juncture.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/public-app-becomes-most-used-apps-by-govt-authorities.html

89,24-4-20,Think positive during lockdown: experts,"In the current COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing lockdown in the State, many people are feeling anxious, depressed and worried. Arguments, especially between husband and wife have also increased in the last few weeks, according to the experts. Talking about anxiety and depression among the people during the lockdown, Dehradun based neuro psychologist Dr Sona Kaushal Gupta said, ""These days almost every person is going through a little bit of anxiety due to a number of personal and professional reasons. However, it is important to identify those people who feel completely hopeless and talk about negativity in their life during the current crisis. It is important for that person to get support from friends and families even if it is just through phone calls or text messages."" She said that it is important to understand that the current situation is temporary and will pass. Everyone needs to think positively -- the situation will get better in a few weeks-- instead of feeling helpless and unworthy, added Dr Gupta. She also added that people should also stay away from negative news on the television and social media and focus on positive information.

Lately, some people have attempted suicide in the State during the lockdown. Recently, a gardener in Sitarganj committed suicide as he reportedly did not have enough money to pay for the treatment of his ailing mother due to the lockdown. Talking about such issues, Dr Gupta said that though the government is trying to help those in need, the others should also be aware and help if they find anyone who needs assistance. People are getting stressed because they are not getting the right information and support, therefore every person should look out for such people who need any kind of assistance.

Clinical psychologist at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital, Dr Pratibha Sharma said that during the lockdown the cases of couple counselling has also increased in the city. According to her, the spouses do not have the habit of staying with each other the whole day in a confined area, therefore, the couples start having disagreements especially regarding the household chores that lead to a fight. She stated that she advises such couples to avoid conflicts by not interfering in each other's work. Dr Sharma stated that anyone who feels stressed out can seek help through online counselling or just by talking to the friends and family.

The experts insisted on concentrating on the positive aspects like the number of COVID-19 patients getting better with treatment is way more than the patients who have died across the country, so nobody needs to panic but just be aware.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/think-positive-during-lockdown--experts.html

91,24-4-20,Challenging times an opportunity to adapt for the better: Jitender Joshi,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the nation-wide lockdown enforced to contain the pandemic has created challenging times. However, with the right attitude, proper management and actions, this challenging time has become a positive learning experience for the students, faculty and management of Uttaranchal University, said its chancellor Jitender Joshi. Talking to The Pioneer, he elaborated on how the university is using this opportunity to adapt and further enhance its academic functioning in a manner which will benefit the students in the future too.

With about 400 faculty members and 7,000 students, the task of ensuring continuity in academics was taken up online. “We began regular online classes from March 24. Initially about 20 per cent of the students were not attending the online classes so we talked to their parents and made sure that they do not miss the classes. Now there are routine online classes and periodic tests to ensure the students are prepared for exams when they are conducted in the future. I myself conduct follow-ups with the vice chancellor and 11 directors of our various institutes regularly to check if any issues are being faced. The situation is challenging but it is also a learning experience for us. We have enhanced our online activity considerably and now I am thinking that even after the lockdown is lifted, the students might benefit in their studies if a small laptop is provided to each of them,” said Joshi.

Though most of the university’s students are at home, there are some who are staying in the hostel as they were unable to return home due to the lockdown and other factors. The university is taking good care of the students in the hostel. Apart from providing their basic needs, hostel staff is also looking after them while Joshi too often checks on them. “The campus appears deserted. Whereas it was bustling with thousands of students before the lockdown, now there are a few students and staff. In such a situation I make sure that I too routinely meet the students to check on them and boost their morale. We have been doing our bit to assist the needy persons too during the lockdown. Since March 26, we have been preparing cooked food packets for 500 persons daily. These are handed over to the district administration,” he said.

About the operational and financial challenges being faced by the university, the chancellor said that the admissions had been affected. However, here too the online mode is being used for registration and prospectus. If an applicant is unable to secure admission for some reason, barring the prospectus cost, the rest of the fee will be refunded. On how the situation will affect placement of students, Joshi said that the university had started placements from November last year. Earlier this year, online placement was facilitated through 45 companies with which the university has a tie-up. A considerable number of students secured employment through online placements. Regarding financial challenges facing the university, he said that currently there is no such problem. “We manage our finances properly. Since I expect all the faculty and employees to believe that the university is theirs too, we also ensure they are paid their salaries on time. On the question of seeking government support, we do not need it. The government already has its hands full with more important concerns tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. In such times, it helps to be self reliant,” said the university chancellor.

It is pertinent to mention here that Uttaranchal University was established in 2013 with the merger of professional institutes of Sushila Devi Centre for Professional Studies and Research Society, namely Law College Dehradun established in 2002, Uttaranchal Institute of Technology and Uttaranchal Institute of Management established in 2006. Currently, the university comprises nine interdisciplinary institutes offering courses in a range of subjects.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/challenging-times-an-opportunity-to-adapt-for-the-better--jitender-joshi.html

97,24-4-20,CM seeks foodgrains as wages under MGNREGA,"Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday requested Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar seeking his consent to provide food grains as wages to labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA).

In a letter, the chief minister said that the payment of wages under the MNREGA gets credited to the labourers' bank account directly through the national electronic fund management system (NEFMS).

The livelihoods of 62, 52,000 people from more than 31, 50,000 families in the state is dependent on the MNREGA, he said.

In such a situation, the implementation of the scheme using all means of effective lockdown norms is mandatory, the CM in his letter said.

The chief minister said more than 5 lakh workers every day are engaged in the work under the MNREGA scheme in the state.

Baghel added that after the wage is credited, the labourers have to withdraw money from their bank accounts to buy food and other every-day use goods, which will be difficult as they have to follow social distancing.

He further said that bank branches in Chhattisgarh are less in number, as well as problems of internet connectivity in the Maoist-hit districts.

127,24-4-20,Maha mounts pressure on Centre for spl trains for migrants,"Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with Chief Ministers of all States scheduled for April 27, the Maharashtra Government on Thursday mounted pressure on the Centre to run special trains from Mumbai and Pune to take back 6.5 lakh migrant workers staying at various labour camps, to their respective States after lockdown.

Two days after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reiterated his demand for the Centre running special trains “to ensure that migrant labour from other States can return home”, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar upped the ante by urging Railway Minister Piyush Goytal to make necessary arrangements in advance to run special trains to accommodate “all such restless labourers” so that “there is no law & order problem at railway stations in Maharashtra”.

In his letter to Goyal, Pawar wrote: “As Maharashtra is a leading industrial State and having highest construction activities, a large number of informal labourers particularly migrated from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other northern States are working in these sectors”.

“Due Covid-19 lockdown, about 6.5 lakh migrants are staying in respective labour camps in Maharashtra and the State Government is providing daily food and health services to them. In addition to this, almost equal number of labourers are being provided with food by various NGOs and social organisations,” Pawar said,.

“All these informal labourers are now jobless and eagerly awaiting to go to their respective States. The incident of Bandra Railway station gathering, which happened in Mumbai, is an example of restlessness of such labourers.

The deputy chief minister said that after the lockdown is lifted on May 3 or any other date decided by the Centre, there would once again be a huge rush of these labourers at all railway stations.

In view of this, he urged Goyal to “make necessary arrangements in advance, including running special trains from Mumbai and Pune to all major destinations of the country to accommodate all such restless labourers, so that there will not be any no law and order problems at any railway station in Maharashtra”.

Pawar’s missive to Goyal came just 48 hours after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray flagged the issue of migrant labourers staying in Maharashtra.

On Tuesday night, the chief minister’s office (CMO) Maharashtra had tweeted: “CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has reiterated his demand for special trains to ensure that migrant labour from other States can return home. He has demanded to the Hon’ble Prime Minister & the Railway Ministry that guidelines about this to be issued by April-end”

“Approximately 6 lakh migrant labours are being provided with food, shelter & medical assistance in relief camps setup across Maharashtra by the Government. However, in such times staying away from their homes & families is taking a toll on them,” the CMO tweeted.

“If the Central Government is anticipating a rise in the transmission of the virus between April 30 and May 15, then it must consider if it can utilise the time at hand to arrange for special trains to send them back home and issue guidelines about this by April-end,” the CMO added. It may be recalled that on April 18, the chief minister had assured the migrant labourers settled in the state that he was in touch with the Centre and he was confident that “in the next few days, some solution would be found for their problems”.

As part of the address to the people in the state through social media, Uddhav had said: “The migrants living in the state are in a mood to co-operate with the state government. They have quietened down now. I would like to tell them once again that we are holding talks with the Union government. I am confident that in the next few days, we will find a way out of the current situation”

“Please don’t worry at all. In Maharashtra, we are slowly starting the activities. If possible, I request you to come back to work. You can continue to earn living. The day the situation returns to normal, I assure that the Maharashtra government will ensure that you will return to your native places. What we want is that whenever you go, you go back happily to your home. Don’t go back in fear,” the Chief Minister told the migrant labourers.

The chief minister’s words to the migrants should be seen in the light of the unrest seen among the migrant workers across the state in recent weeks and the assembly of huge crowds witnessed in front of the Bandra railway station in north-west Mumbai on the evening April 14, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of lockdown till May 3.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha-mounts-pressure-on-centre-for-spl-trains-for-migrants.html

135,24-4-20,Didi accuses Guv of transgressing constitutional dharma,"The slanging match between the Raj Bhavan and Nabanna (State secretariat) hit a new low with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday shooting off a strongly worded letter to Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar reminding him of his constitutional limitations as a “nominated” functionary and advising him to be careful with selection of words while dealing with a constitutional office as high as the one she occupies.

With the Governor repeatedly pulling the Government up for its alleged lackadaisical handling of the deteriorating corona situation in the State the Chief Minister wrote a five-page letter to the Governor wondering whether he had forgotten his constitutional limitations as a nominated entity.

In an exceptionally harsh letter she wrote, “You appear to have forgotten that I am an elected Chief Minister of a proud Indian state. You also seem to have forgotten that you are a nominated Governor.”

In the letter she reminded him of how he had “humiliated” her office by using un-parliamentary words. She said that though Governor might ignore the advice of the Chief Minister, her Cabinet and high officials but he should, as a minimum, honor the recommendations of Sarkaria Commission and look up to the sayings of Dr BR Ambedkar.

The Chief Minister’s harsh letter comes a day after the State Government had to digest a strongly worded communiqué from the Union Home Ministry directing it to cooperate with the Inter Ministerial Central Team visiting Bengal to inspect the corona situation.

After initially being blockaded by the State government the team was finally allowed to move around and inspect the alleged dilution of lockdown protocols.

Earlier when the Chief Minister was asked to comment on the tweets of the Governor she said “He is a tall man. We are small people. The less said about him the better.”

The Chief Minister also referred to how the Governor sent an objectionable text message transgressing the “constitutional dharma and even basic norms of decency.”

With no love lost between the two sides the new wave of conflict started after the Governor took to the twitter alleging how the lockdown protocols were being violated and diluted in the State and accusing the government of not briefing him about the current situation.

The flow of his tweets increased after the BJP leadership lodged a complaint with him against the State administration saying how the saffron MPs like Arjun Singh, Raju Bishta and Subhas Sarkar had been stopped from taking relief materials to the starving people of their constituencies.

On one occasion he wrote, “sent communication to Mamata Banerjee official to abide by constitution. Such continued disregard of constitution cannot be countenanced. There can be no situation of law unto oneself. Her stance is weakening the fight against covid-19. There is no rationale for such undemocratic attitude (sic)’.”""

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister continued to personally drive down parts of Kolkata for the third consecutive day on Thursday asking people over loudspeakers to remain indoors and follow the lockdown protocols. She visited Park Circus, Moulali, Behala and other areas telling people to maintain social distance and remain indoors.

The visiting IMCT too went about inspecting several of Kolkata on Thursday.

Dr Guleria explained, ""Patients who have recovered from Covid-19 are facing stigma, this is creating panic and causing hardship for the patients and their family members. Many patients who might have symptoms of Covid-19 are not coming forward owing to this stigma.”

But we should know that 90 to 95 per cent patients of Covid-19 recover, thus, we have to remember that this is a disease which is not that serious, he said here at a routine press briefing on Thursday. His comments come amid reports of Covid-19 patients and their relatives being hounded by their neighbours and public across the States.

""The infected patients are approaching healthcare officials at a later stage which is leading to increased mortality. As many as 95 per cent of these patients can simply be cured with oxygen treatment and close to 5 per cent need ventilators, however, this delay in approaching local healthcare officials is leading to delayed detection and higher mortality,"" added Dr Guleria.

He stressed on sympathising with Covid-19 patients and their families instead of stagmatising them and look at how we can support Covid-19 patients and their families. More and more people need to come out for testing.""

""This (Covid-19) is not a very deadly disease because 90-95 per cent of those infected can recover but the delayed treatment caused by stigma could lead to higher mortality among patients,"" Dr Guleria reiterated.

""If we have that stigma and we don't come forward we may land up in a situation where because of our delay in treatment we have higher mortality,"" he said.

According to the UNICEF, stigma can undermine social cohesion and prompt possible social isolation of groups, which might contribute to a situation where the virus is more, not less, likely to spread. This can result in more severe health problems and difficulties controlling a disease outbreak.

Stigma can drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination, prevent people from seeking health care immediately as well as discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours.

Guleria also said that the hospitals in India are trying various drugs and new vaccines and medicines are being tracked. He also said that India has also started trying convalescent plasma as a treatment plan for Covid-19 patients.

Convalescent plasma is being used to cure more and more patients and those who have recovered from Covid-19 are the same people volunteering in large numbers to donate their plasma, he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/95---ve-curable-by-simple-oxygen-treatment--govt.html
137,24-4-20,Researchers at BHU to hold clinical trial on Fifatrol,"Researchers at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh have plans to conduct clinical trials on immunity-booster herbal drug Fifatrol to check its efficacy to manage the deadly Covid-19 infection that is currently sweeping the entire world.

The drug, which is produced from immunity-boosting herbs like sudarshan vati, sanjeevani vati, godanti bhasma, tribhuvan kirti ras and mrityunjay ras, tulsi, kutki, is used to treat bacterial infections, flu and viral infections of upper respiratory tract.

This is for the first time the researchers have decided to determine if Fifatrol, produced by AIMIL Pharmaceuticals can be helpful in combating the novel coronavirus, a cure for which is yet to be found.

Sources in the Union Ayush Ministry said that the task force for scientific validation of ayurveda and traditional medicine formulas through research institutions, which was set up at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s clarion call explore allopathy and Ayurveda therapies for treatment of the Covid-19, is vetting a proposal in this regard.

BHU professor and principal investigator of the proposal Dr KN Diwedi said that Fifatrol is given to patients who have similar symptoms as that of patients suffering from the contagion disease. “Hence, we are now trying to evaluate this drug in critically ill Covid-19 patients to reduce mortality,” he said.

“During a trial on dengue patients, the drug was found to have doubled the platelets. The study also established that it can strengthen the liver with no systemic side effects,” said the scientist.

In fact, researchers at AIIMS, Bhopal, who have been working on Fifatrol have in their preliminary results found that the herbal drug can be a suitable alternative to allopathic antibiotics without causing any side effects.

“Fifatrol is an anti-microbial solution prepared from 13 key herbs including, chirayata, motha and giloy,” said Dr Dwivedi.

The Interdisciplinary AYUSH Research and Development Task Force has members from the department of biotechnology (DBT), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as also ayush practitioners and others to identify potential preventive therapy and therapeutic approaches from Ayush systems to different stages in the treatment of Covid-19.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/researchers-at-bhu-to-hold-clinical-trial-on-fifatrol.html
138,24-4-20,Entire Muslim community cannot be held responsible for one group's crime: Naqvi,"Union Minister for Minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday urged that the entire Muslim community should not be painted with the same brush for the fault of some who did not obey the lockdown guidelines in the wake of Coronavirus pandemic in the country.

The entire Muslim community cannot be held responsible for one group's ""crime"", the Minister said while reacting to instances of Muslims being blamed for the spurt in Covid-19 cases after the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi, and affirmed that most of the minority community members have condemned the group's action.

He said the community cannot be blamed for a few isolated cases of violation of the lockdown norms or the rule of law. “ By and large all are following rules,” he said. The Minister, though, agreed that ‘Jaamat’ did flout rules by allowing large number of people, including foreigners, to gather at one place.

The Minister said across India, Imams, Ulema and Muslim organizations have unanimously decided that during ‘Ramzan’ , Muslims will not congregate in mosques, religious places and perform all rituals like 'Iftaar' (breaking of fast) and 'taraweeh' (special prayers) at home keeping in mind social distancing norms.

Naqvi said he has spoken with state waqf board officials, social and religious leaders, imams on adherence to the lockdown and social distancing guidelines during the Ramzan month starting Friday or Saturday evening and they have begun creating awareness among the people.

Naqvi’s comments in support of Muslim community have come in the backdrop of charges of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) that Muslims were being “discriminated” in the wake of Coronavirus pandemic in India. The OIC had asked India Government to protect Muslims and contain an alleged surge of “Islamophobia”.

Soon after the OIC statement, the Minister had said that Minorities’ rights in India were protected by the Constitution and secularism and social harmony was “a passion” in India and not “a political fashion” in the country.

In a message to Indian Muslims, Naqvi had this week cited guidelines issued by all the Muslim countries for Coronavirus lockdown, particularly the “social distancing” norms, which would prevail throughout the holy month of ‘Ramzan’, beginning Friday.

Several bodies representing the Muslim community including the Islamic Centre of India and the Delhi Waqf Board have also appealed for daily prayers during

Ramazan to be held at home and asked mosques to create awareness about official guidelines to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

According to an advisory by Waqf Boards, people should stay at their homes to offer Namaz during Ramzan, however, Imams, Muazzins and Mutawallis can offer the prayers at mosques.

Mosques will announce the guidelines after each ‘Azaan’ and also at other times through loudspeakers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/entire-muslim-community-cannot-be-held-responsible-for-one-group-s-crime--naqvi.html

141,24-4-20,ICAR recognises eight new hybrid maize varieties to bolster production,"The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has recognised eight new hybrid maize varieties to bolster production. These maize varieties have been identified after discussion with farm scientists through a digital workshop of the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) attended by 150 participants from across the country. The digital workshop was organized due to the nationwide lockdown amid coronavirus pandemic.

Addressing the workshop, the ICAR Director General Trilochan Mohapatra appreciated the efforts of maize scientists for continuing with the research work amid the crisis of the coronavirus pandemic. He asked the Ludhiana-based ICAR-Indian Institute of Maize Research (ICAR-IIMR) to carry out basic, strategic and applied research for enhancing production, productivity and sustainability of the crop. AICRP on maize needs to play a leadership role to make maize as the future crop of the country, he said.

""In this workshop, eight new maize hybrids have been identified as promising for the release in different seasons and agro-ecologies of the country,"" ICAR said in a statement. The standard operating protocols (SOPs) for conducting various research projects in AICRP on maize were also discussed and finalised during the workshop, it said. On this occasion, a bilingual mobile app called 'Makka' was launched for the benefit of farmers, industries and other stakeholders in maize.

This app (English and Hindi) has video, static and dynamic features on the crop varietal selection, pest and fertiliser solution, fertiliser/pesticide calculation, crop cultivation practices, mechanisation, news/updates and advisories to the farmers, ICAR added. That apart, the workshop recommended zero-tilled maize after rice, sensor-based nitrogen management, post emergence herbicide for weed control -- for increasing the farm profitability, input use efficiency and reducing drudgery in maize production.

The outbreak of pest attack Fall Armyworm (FAW) that had threatened maize crop last year was also discussed in the workshop. Maize or corn is a very important crop used as poultry and animal feed and raw material in starch industries besides use as food. The crop also has potential for green fuel (ethanol) production and cultivated in all states of the country. Specialty maize such as sweet corn, baby corn and popcorn are also gaining much popularity and being developed by the ICAR.

India is one of the top 10 maize producers in the world; it contributes around 2-3% of the total maize produced globally and is one of the top-5 maize exporters in the world contributing almost 14% of the total maize exported to different countries around the world. South-East Asia is the biggest market for Indian maize with almost 80% of the exported Indian maize going to Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia.

The total cultivated area of maize in India is over 9.0 million ha (2013-14), with most of the Indian states growing it. Ten states in India represent around 80% of the total area of maize grown. Karnataka (15%) is the largest state for maize cultivation followed by Rajasthan (13%) and Madhya Pradesh (10%).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icar-recognises-eight-new-hybrid-maize-varieties-to-bolster-production.html

The missive came after a Deputy Commandant who came back from leave did not undergo quarantine and called friends from his Unit to his residence.

“It has been brought to my notice that officers are not obeying the guidelines/instructions issued from time to time regarding Covid-19 protocol. Recently, one Dy Commandant rank officer has joined his duty from leave and refused to undergo quarantine in isolation ward. Further, he called several unit personnel to his house. This is clear violation of orders of Govt and Force HQ (Headquarters). Every personnel, irrespective of rank, on return from leave should be put in quarantine facility so created, under supervision of doctors. No home quarantine is permitted,” acting BSF Director General SS Deswal said in a circular issued on Wednesday.

The BSF chief further said, “Strict disciplinary action will be taken against such defaulters as well as the supervisory officers. It is again directed to comply with Covid-19 protocol in letter and spirit.”

The circular has been sent to all the formations of the 2.5 lakh strong border guarding forces across the country.

Last month, a second-in-command officer of the BSF posted at the paramilitary academy had tested positive for Covid-19 following which over 50 other officers who were traced to be in his contact were put under 14 day quarantine to check any possible spread of the disease.

As a preventive measure, the paramilitary has extended the leave of those availing the facility in order to avoid any transmission of the viral pandemic.

143,24-4-20,Company owner claims she has formula to defeat corona,"Closely on the heels of the observation made by Prof BM Hegde and Dr CV Krishnaswamy, two medical scientists from South India that the Centre is ignoring the potential of Ayurveda in the treatment of Covid-19 disease, a pharma company owner based in Pune has come out with the claim that she has the technical know-how to take on the dreaded coronavirus.

Sujatha Vaidya, a scientist and integrated holistic healthcare specialist engaged in developing nutraceutical products says she has a natural medicine Reimmugen Colostrum, if taken with Ayurvedic proprietary formulation Suved, could make the patient protected against viral attacks like the Covid-19. Dr Krishnaswamy described the formulation developed by Sujatha Vaidya as wonderful.

Dr Krishnaswamy said that the prescription of Reimmugen Colostrum has helped in bringing relief to persons suffering from diseases ranging from cardio vascular ailments to cancer to diabetes. “I have been prescribing this medicine for nearly a decade and the results were wonderful. It is the medicine which the Government should give top priority at this juncture because we all know that nobody is going to invent a vaccine to fight covid in the near future,” said Dr Krishnaswamy who was a personal physician to former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

Vaidya pointed out that Covid-19 was caused by the weakening of the immunity power of the human body. “When one’s immunity power is lost, it becomes easy for the virus to weaken the body and soul and the victim succumbs to the virus attack,” explained Vaidya, based in Pune. It was based on the scientific studies conducted by Prof Hedge and Dr Krishnaswamy that she focussed her attention on increasing the immunity power of the body.

The World Health Organisation and National Health Mission has declared that there was no treatment or vaccine for coronavirus. “People who were saved from the disease escaped from the clutch of jaws only because of their inherent immunity,” she said.

It was based on a tradition of knowledge passed through generations that Vaidya could come out with a medicine to increase the immunity power to defeat the virus. “ We all know that the first milk secreted by all mammals is thicker than normal milk and is called Colostrum . It has an element by name IMMUNOGLOBULIN or IgG Colostrum in it. The pre-milk, or first milk secreted by mammals including human beings have strong content of Immuno Globulin (IgG) in it and this helps strengthening the tissues and cells of the body against viral attack,” explained Vaidya.

This formed the basis of her formulation Reimmugen Colostrum which when administered orally with Ayurvedic proprietary formulation Suved helped protection against coronavirus, said Vaidya. She also said that a number of patients who have been suffering from cardio vascular issues, diabetes and immune compromised persons were better protected due to higher susceptibility to infections with the Reimmugen Colostrum and Suved.

Colostrum, whether it is from cows, buffaloes or human beings have ingredients in it that help empower the body to become stronger.

“The advantage with this medicine is that it is fully natural. One important thing to be noted is that the death rate due to coronavirus in western countries is more compared to other places. This is because the westerners have moved away from nature which led to a decrease in their immunity power,” said Vaidya.

Dr Krishnaswamy added in a lighter vein that Colostrum could be one more reasons for the gau-rakshaks (cow vigilantes) to demand a legislation against slaughter of the animal!",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/company-owner-claims-she-has-formula-to-defeat-corona.html

147,24-4-20,Allow liquor to flow freely in Maha: Raj Thackeray to CM,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday asked the MVA Government “not to get caught up in moral issues” and open liquor shops across States so as to generate revenue for its near-empty coffers at a time when the State is passing through coronavirus-triggered crisis.

Making a strong case for the opening of liquor shops in the State, Raj said: “ The police and health care staff are not getting PPE kits, free meal service for the people and other necessary requirements are not being met with. The State Government is struggling against all odds and with very limited resources”.

“Keeping this dismal scenario in mind, it is imperative that the revenue generated from the sale of liquor will begin the required inflow process, Our State is in a crisis and this is very much needed,” the MNS chief said.

Stressing on the quantum and importance of excise duty, Raj said: “ “The excise duty generated for the State via liquor amounts to Rs 41.66 crore daily, or Rs 1,250 crores monthly and Rs 14,000 crore yearly”.

The MNS chief said that keeping in mind the lockdown phase of 35 days till now and the extensions that might happen, the loss of revenue from this sector could be calculated till now and also the future losses that might happen in future.

“It’s not that there was a liquor ban in our State and we are asking to remove that. Prior to lockdown, the wine shops were open. The state government should not try to get caught up in some moral issues at such a crucial time and take the necessary decision” Raj said.

Raj’s statement came a couple days after State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that there should be no problems in permitting liquor shops provided they follow social distancing norms

“Apart from opening wine shops, the other essential commodity services like vegetables, fruits, milk, bakery, general stores need to start functioning,” Raj said.

Raj said that the issue that he had flagged did not pertain just to Maharashtra but also all other states should also take note of this fact too, given the uncertainty about the financial assistance that they get from the Centre.

“The need of the hour is to be economically self-reliant and this solution provided needs to be taken seriously,” Raj said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/allow-liquor-to-flow-freely-in-maha--raj-thackeray-to-cm.html

The bridge is on river Ravi in border region of Gurdaspur connecting Kasowal enclave in Punjab to the rest of the country and it was built ahead of its schedule. The enclave of around 35 square kilometres had hither to been connected via pontoon bridge of limited load capacity.

The pontoon bridge used to be dismantled every year prior to the monsoon or else it would have got washed away in the strong currents of the river. This meant thousands of acres of fertile land across the river could not be tilled by farmers during the monsoon. The local population and the Army (by virtue of the sensitivity of the enclave) required a permanent bridge to give all weather connectivity to the enclave.

The BRO planned for a 484-meter bridge and it finally cost Rs 17.89 crores. The BRO had planned to open the Kasowal bridge in time for Vaisakhi so that the farmers could transport their harvest to the market comfortably. The 16th and last Cell Division was completed on the March 15 and construction of protective works was under progress when the work came to a halt on March 23 due to the lockdown.

To ensure locals do not suffer during the harvest season and also to ensure the bridge does not get damaged because of the heavy discharge of water and the tendency of the river to change course in the monsoons, the BRO approached the Punjab Government and Gurdaspur administration and obtained necessary approvals to continue the work.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bro-builds-bridge-to-connect-remote-punjab-enclave-with-country.html
149,24-4-20,DRDO unveils mobile lab that will enhance fight against Covid-19,"In order to hasten the process of testing patients for coronavirus, the Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO) has successfully manufactured mobile virology research and diagnostics laboratory(MVRDL). It can process more than 1,000 samples thereby enhancing the overall capability of the national effort to fight the pandemic. The DRDO is already manufacturing and supplying sanitisers and masks to various agencies engaged in tackling the disease.

Unveiling the mobile laboratory through video-conference here on Thursday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh while lauding the efforts of the DRDO said the setting up of this bio-safety level two and level three laboratory came about in 15 to 20 days as against the normal time of six months.

The first of such Mobile Viral Research Lab (MVRL), that will speed up COVID-19 screening and related R&D activities, was developed by Research Centre Imarat (RCI), the Hyderabad based laboratory of DRDO in consultation with ESIC Hospital, Hyderabad and private firms, officials said here.

The Mobile Viral Research Laboratory is the combination of a level three and level two laboratory essential to carry out the activities. The laboratories are built as per World Health Organisation(WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR)bio-safety standards to meet international guidelines. The system has built in electrical controls, LAN, Telephone cabling, and CCTV.

The KVIC’s Chennai office in coordination with six KIs has facilitated the purchase of around 9,500 kg of the cocoon, worth over Rs 40 lakh, directly from the farmers. Six more KIs are likely to get permission soon to purchase 8,000 kg cocoon directly from farmers with the main objective of the KVIC being to help the cocoon farmers struggling to sell their crop due to the ongoing lockdown and to ensure the continuous supply of cocoons to the khadi institutions involved in silk production.

Chairman, KVIC, Vinai Saxena said, “These purchases were not as easy as it looks. As per the procedure in vogue, silk-producing KIs have to purchase silk cocoons from the State Government-regulated sericulture markets only. Hence, permission was required from the district administration as well as from sericulture department for the direct purchase from the farmers”.

“As a result of constant efforts and ability to narrate the cocoon farmers’ hardships in front of district administration and before the sericulture department effectively by the KVIC officials in Chennai, the district administration finally granted the permission. Had we not made these purchases now, then the damage to the farmers would have been unbearable,” Saxena further said.

The necessity of this deal can be gauged by the fact that reared cocoon must be steamed within five days, or else the larvae would come out of it after cutting the cocoon shell, making the entire crop a complete waist. Cut cocoons cannot be used for reeling the silk yarn. In this sense, these purchases are blessing for the cocoon farmers, the KVIC said.

The KVIC has also successfully developed a double layered Khadi mask and has procured orders for supplying it in large quantities.

To add to its success, KVIC has recently bagged an order to supply 7.5 lakh pieces of Khadi Masks to Jammu & Kashmir Government alone.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kvic-comes-to-rescue-of-cocoon-farmers.html

152,24-4-20,"FB’s investment in Jio Platforms to cut RIL’s net leverage, credit positive: Moody’s","Facebook’s Rs 43,600 crore investment in Reliance Industries’ digital services business will help the Mukesh Ambani-led firm reduce borrowing and reinforce the company’s commitment to cut its net debt to zero by March 31, Moody’s Investors Service said on Thursday.

Stating that the investment is credit positive, Moody’s in an issuer comment said it expects the transaction to reduce RIL’s consolidated net debt/EBITDA by 0.4x to well below 3.0x, the tolerance level for its Baa2 rating. As part of the transaction, Facebook will acquire 9.99 per cent of Jio Platforms Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of RIL that houses the company’s digital services business including its mobile telecom services business — Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL).

The transaction also solidifies Jio’s leading market position in India’s growing digital ecosystem. “The investment by Facebook establishes a valuation for RIL’s digital services business and can be used as a base for further divestment by the company,” it said.

153,24-4-20,Mobile devices firms urge Govt to lift sale curb,"Urging the Government to include mobile devices under the essential services category, handset firms on Thursday said many frontline workers, patients and other vulnerable groups are facing a tough time during the coronavirus lockdown due to non-availability of the devices.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), whose members include firms like Apple, Foxconn, Wistron, Flextronics, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Lava, said mobile phones are at the heart of the digital ecosystem and their non-availability can be life threatening.

“Senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions are most susceptible to Covid-19. In such cases, the fatality rate is upwards of 10 per cent. The disease is such that all times, the patients need to fend for themselves from the time they communicate with municipal authorities regarding symptoms to testing and treatment,” ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said in a letter to IT Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney.

154,24-4-20,CII forecasts GDP declining by 0.9% if lockdown prolonged,"India’s GDP, in the best-case scenario, may grow by 1.5 per cent in 2020-21 given a faster pick-up post the lockdown but could see a 0.9 per cent decline in the fiscal if the curbs imposed to contain coronavirus infection are prolonged, a report has said.

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in a paper — A plan for economic recovery — has laid out its growth expectation under three scenarios and suggested “urgent” fiscal interventions.

In the baseline scenario, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to grow at just 0.6 per cent on an annual basis as economic activity is expected to remain constrained due to continuing restrictions on the free movement of goods and people beyond the lockdown period, the paper stated.

This will lead to disruption in supply chains, slow pick-up in investment activity, labour shortages in the short-run and muted consumption demand on account of reduced household incomes, the industry body said.

In the optimistic scenario, which envisages a faster pick-up post the lockdown period, the GDP is forecast to register a growth of 1.5 per cent in the best case.

In case of a more prolonged outbreak, where the restrictions in existing hot-spot regions get extended, while new regions are identified as ‘hot-spots’ leading to intermittent stop and start in economic activity, the GDP is likely to decline by 0.9 per cent.

The urgent fiscal interventions, as suggested by the CII should include cash transfers amounting to Rs 2 lakh crore to JAM account holders, in addition to the Rs 1.7 lakh stimulus already announced.

The CII has also suggested additional working capital limits be provided by banks, equivalent to April-June wage bill of the borrowers, backed by a Government guarantee, at 4-5 per cent interest rate.

In addition, the CII paper has suggested the creation of a fund or SPV with a corpus of Rs 1.5 lakh crore which will subscribe to NCDs/Bonds of corporates rated A and above.

The fund can be seeded by the government contributing a corpus of Rs 10,000-20,000 crore, with further investments from banks and financial institutions such as LIC, PFC, EPF, NIIF, IIFCL et al. This will limit government exposure while providing adequate liquidity to industry.

For MSMEs, the CII has suggested a credit protection scheme whereby 75-80 per cent of the loan should be guaranteed by RBI, i.e. if the borrower defaults, RBI should buy the loan and repay the bank up to 75-80 per cent of the loan, so the risk to the lender is limited. SIDBI could provide the guarantee for loans to industry and trade while NABARD could provide the guarantee for loans to agro-processing sectors.

“There is no doubt that the economy is going through turbulent times, and India will have to spend, for navigating its way out of the current crisis. At this stage, the government must do whatever it takes to tide over the crisis,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.

“Given the extent of the damage to the economy from the disruption to business, the GDP growth in FY21 will likely be the lowest in many decades,” he added.

According to him, without an increase in government spending in the near-term to drive an economic recovery, government revenue will dwindle, and high deficits will continue to be a problem in future.

Any significant revival in investment activity is unlikely as capacity utilization levels may remain suboptimal. Consumption demand is likely to remain lacklustre as people’s incomes have been impacted, CII said.

On the external front, as economies across the globe continue to struggle with the pandemic, global trade may decline by 13 to 32 per cent in 2020, as estimated by the World Trade Organisation.

“Given the situation, government intervention becomes critical not only to sustain the economy but also to prevent any humanitarian crisis,” observed Banerjee.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cii-forecasts-gdp-declining-by-0-9--if-lockdown-prolonged-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/cii-forecasts-gdp-declining-by-0-9--if-lockdown-prolonged.html

Similarly, the NSE Nifty declined 129.35 points, or 1.39 per cent, to 9,184.55.

Bajaj Finance was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, shedding up to 5 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC twins, SBI, Infosys and TCS.

On the other hand, Hero MotoCorp, Sun Pharma, L&T, ONGC and HCL Tech were among the gainers.

In the previous session, the BSE barometer surged 483.53 points or 1.54 per cent to close at 31,863.08, and the broader Nifty advanced 126.60 points, or 1.38 per cent, to settle at 9,313.90.

Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers in the capital market on Thursday, as they offloaded equity shares worth Rs 114.58 crore, according to provisional exchange data.

Domestic market opened on a negative note as global stocks slumped amid projections of severe coronavirus-led blow to the global economy, traders said.

Fitch Ratings has slashed India's economic growth projection to 0.8 per cent in the current 2020-21 fiscal, saying an unparalleled global recession was underway due to the COVID-19 crisis.

The agency has further made large cuts to global GDP forecasts. Global economic growth is now expected to fall by 3.9 per cent in 2020, a recession of unprecedented depth in the post-war period.

This would be twice as severe as the 2009 recession, it noted.

156,24-4-20,"COVID-19 crisis likely to hit 29 lakh jobs in Indian aviation, dependent sectors: IATA","The coronavirus pandemic is expected to impact more than 29 lakh jobs in the Indian aviation and dependent industries, global airlines' grouping IATA said on Friday.

Commercial flight services in the country remain suspended till May 3 amid the nationwide lockdown to curb spreading of coronavirus infections.

Besides, the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have significantly impacted economic activities, with aviation and tourism among the worst affected segments.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said its latest estimates indicate a worsening of the country impact from the COVID-19 crisis in the Asia-Pacific region.

About India, IATA said the pandemic is expected to potentially impact 29,32,900 jobs in the country's aviation and its dependent industries. The passenger traffic has declined 47 per cent.

Besides, the grouping noted that the revenue impact for airlines operating to and from the Indian market would be USD 11.221 billion (over Rs 85,000 crore)

This refers to the fall in passenger revenue compared to 2019.

The ""passenger demand impact (origin destination volumes)"" is a fall of more than 8.97 crore.

All the figures are for the period of 2020 so far compared to the whole of 2019.

IATA is a grouping of nearly 290 airlines, including Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet.

On April 14, IATA said COVID-19 crisis would see global airline passenger revenues drop by USD 314 billion this year, a fall of 55 per cent compared to 2019.

Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region would record the largest revenue drop of USD 113 billion in 2020 compared to last year.

These estimates are based on a scenario of severe travel restrictions lasting for three months, with a gradual lifting of restrictions in domestic markets, followed by regional and intercontinental, as per IATA.

""The situation is deteriorating. Airlines are in survival mode. They face a liquidity crisis with a USD 61 billion cash burn in the second quarter, Conrad Clifford, IATA's Regional Vice President (Asia-Pacific) said.

According to him, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand are priority countries that need to take action.

Further, the grouping called for a combination of direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees and support for the corporate bond market, and tax relief for the airlines industry.

""Providing support for airlines has a broader economic implication. Jobs across many sectors will be impacted if airlines do not survive the COVID-19 crisis. Every airline job supports another 24 in the travel and tourism value chain.

""In Asia-Pacific, 11.2 million jobs are at risk, including those that are dependent on the aviation industry, such as travel and tourism,"" Clifford said.

157,24-4-20,Sensex slumps 536 pts; financial stocks lead fall,"Mumbai, Apr 24 (PTI) Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled 536 points on Friday, led by a selloff in financial and IT stocks as global markets slumped on mounting economic pressure of coronavirus-led lockdowns with no respite in sight.

Further, in a blow to domestic market sentiment, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund announced winding up of six debt schemes due to redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in bond markets amid the COVID-19 crisis.

Many retail investors and high net worth individuals (HNIs) who invested in these schemes as part of their fixed-income asset allocation will be hit as the money will be blocked with no clear timeline for recoveries, experts said.

The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 535.86 points or 1.68 per cent down at 31,327.22, while the NSE Nifty declined 159.50 points, or 1.71 per cent, to 9,154.40.

Bajaj Finance was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, dropping over 9 per cent, followed by Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank and M&M.

Reliance Industries, however, capped the losses by rallying over 3 per cent.

Sun Pharma, Hero MotoCorp, L&T, PowerGrid and Bajaj Auto were also among the gainers.

Market went into selloff mode as winding up of a few debt schemes by Franklin Templeton added to the selling pressure witnessed in banks and NBFC stocks, said experts.

According to Sanjeev Zarbade, VP PCG Research, Kotak Securities, markets across the globe remained volatile as the wait for a credible breakthrough in medicine to remedy the COVID-19 pandemic remained elusive.

Weak macroeconomic data in most countries and rout in oil prices also hit investor sentiment, he noted.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended with heavy losses, while those in Europe were also trading significantly lower in early deals.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures slipped 0.38 per cent to USD 21.25 per barrel.

On the currency front, the rupee depreciated 40 paise to provisionally settle at 76.46 against the US dollar.

Once implemented, the Government’s plans towards framing a mechanism for clearance of huge pending dues owed to MSMEs by central and state PSUs as well as corporate players are expected to provide a major relief to the sector battling distress, as millions of units struggle to survive amid mounting losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interaction via video conferencing with the representatives of Bharat Chamber of Commerce, the minister for MSME and transport said the default on pending payments is one of the “big problems” faced by MSMEs. Gadkari said he has asked the MSME ministry officials to work on formulating a scheme of Rs 1 to 2 lakh crore.

“Where there is a pending bill we can reimburse that amount with the interest cost. We will find out some solution, some of the cost will be borne by the government, some of the cost will be borne by the industry, some of the cost will be borne by the supplier and we will take the guarantee for that and MSMEs will get their payment. We are working on it. So that can be a good relief to MSMEs,” said the minister.

During the interaction, Gadkari said while the government has allowed certain industry sectors to start functioning, it is also needed to be ensured that necessary preventive measures are taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

He emphasised on the usage of masks, sanitisers, gloves, etc and advised maintaining a safe social distancing while resuming the offices/business operations.

162,24-4-20,Data unavailability main reason behind inability to announce stimulus for businesses: Garg,"Former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has said the unavailability of data is the main reason why the Government has not been able to announce a stimulus package for coronavirus-stricken businesses, including MSMEs.

Garg, in a blog post, said there is an urgent need to assign a unique ID to each business as it would help in collecting vital economic performance data and facilitate linking of all bank accounts of a business to that ID.

“Principal reason for inability of the Government to announce any survival and revival package, even for MSMEs, is the unavailability of business, value-added, number of labours employed, loss of output and profit data. There is an urgent need to establish the system of unique business ID and link significant business data with this,” he said.

The Government on March 26 had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus that included free foodgrain and cooking gas to poor for three months.

It also had cash doles to vulnerable class including women and poor.

The finance ministry is working on a second relief package for the Indian economy hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak and the 40-day nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the contagion.

The former finance secretary added the economic lockdown ordered by the government to save lives has jolted the business loans portfolio of banks. “Many businesses in travel, tourism, hospitality, construction, transportation, retail, entertainment, sports will fail. This can double their non-performing loans as a number of shuttered businesses and disrupted businesses will fail and suffer profitability shocks,” he noted.

Garg suggested that it is time for the RBI to think of providing credit to investment grade businesses directly.

“RBI can start buying investment grade corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities,”he said adding that much of the Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations (TLTRO) can be much better done directly by RBI, instead of doing it in a roundabout way of going through the banks.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/data-unavailability-main-reason-behind-inability-to-announce-stimulus-for-businesses--garg.html
163,24-4-20,26 mn have sought US jobless aid since virus hit,"More than 4.4 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as job cuts escalated across an economy that remains all but shut down, the government said Thursday.

Roughly 26 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the five weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors. About one in six American workers have now lost their jobs since mid-March, by far the worst string of layoffs on record. Economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%.

The enormous magnitude of job cuts has plunged the U.S. economy into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some economists say the nation’s output could shrink by twice the amount that it did during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009.

The painful economic consequences of the virus-related shutdowns have sparked angry protests in several state capitals from crowds demanding that businesses reopen. Some governors have begun easing restrictions despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking new infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.

Yet those scattered re-openings won’t lead to much rehiring, especially if Americans are too wary to leave their homes. Most people say they favor stay-at-home orders and believe it won’t be safe to lift social distancing guidelines anytime soon. And there are likely more layoffs to come from many small businesses that have tried but failed to receive loans from a federal aid program.

The total number of people who are receiving unemployment benefits has reached a record 16 million, surpassing a previous high of 12 million set in 2010, just after the 2008-2009 recession ended.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/26-mn-have-sought-us-jobless-aid-since-virus-hit.html

“We were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn’’t just the flu by the way. Nobody has ever seen anything like this, 1917 was the last time,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on Wednesday.

He was responding to a question about the growing US national debt as a result of the multi-trillion dollars stimulus packages that his administration has come up with to help people and businesses in distress as a direct fallout of the pandemic.

“We have no choice. Do we have a choice? I’’m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem,” he said. “We had the greatest econ omy in the history of the world... Better than China, better than any place,” he said.

Spain records 440 new deaths

Spain has recorded 440 new deaths overnight for the new coronavirus, bringing the total confirmed fatalities to 22,157, according to an official data on Thursday. With more than 4,600 new positive infections tested, the reported cases are now over 200,000, although the real number is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest that people can be infected without feeling sick.

On Thursday, a new genetic study published by the Carlos III Institute, Spain’s main epidemiology research centre, suggested that the new coronavirus was spreading in the country since mid-February, weeks before the first local contagion clusters were identified.

The country was celebrating an atypical World Book Day on Thursday, which is marked in the United Kingdom and Spain on the date in 1,616 of the death of William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes, but this year away from outdoor bookstands.

China reports 27 new asymptomatic cases

China has reported 27 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, taking their total to 984, while a high-level committee headed by Premier Li Keqiang asked health officials to remain focussed on the targeted containment of the deadly virus.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested Covid-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.

Besides the 27 asymptomatic patients, 10 new confirmed COVID cases, including six from Chinese returning from abroad, were reported in the country on Wednesday. The four other patients -- three from Heilongjiang province bordering Russia and one in Guangdong province -- were domestically transmitted, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Thursday.

No death was reported on Wednesday, the NHC said.

616 more deaths in UK

The British Government said another 616 more people with the coronavirus have died in UK hospitals, taking the total to nearly 19,000.

The daily increase reported was lower than the 759 in the previous 24-hour period.

The UK’s death toll is the fourth highest in Europe, behind Italy, Spain and France, all of whom have reported more than 20,000 deaths.

There has been increasing scrutiny of the UK figures in recent days for understating the actual number of people having died of Covid-19. They don’t include those who have died in care homes or elsewhere in the community.

The Government also said the number of daily tests increased slightly to more than 23,000. The number remains well shy of the government’s target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month, an ambition that has met with widespread skepticism.

Italy’s daily death toll edges up, but new cases fall

Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 464 on Thursday, against 437 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, but the daily tally of new infections declined to 2,646 from 3,370 on Wednesday.

The total official death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 25,549, the agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States.

The number of confirmed cases was 189,973, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain. People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 106,848 from 107,699 on Wednesday, a fourth consecutive daily decline.

There were 2,267 people in intensive care on Thursday against 2,384 on Wednesday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 57,576 were declared recovered against 54,543 a day earlier.

Singapore records more than 1,000 cases

Singapore has recorded more than 1,000 new cases on Thursday to bring its total past 11,000. It has now overtaken South Korea to be the fourth worst-hit nation in Asia after China, India and Japan.

Fatality is low at 12. The numbers have consistently breached 1,000 daily since Monday because of aggressive testing of foreign workers locked down in crowded dormitories across the city-state.

The upsurge has forced Singapore to extend its partial lockdown by another four weeks until June 1.

Russia’s caseload surpasses 60,000

Russia’s reported coronavirus caseload has surpassed 60,000.

The Government registered 4,774 confirmed cases on Thursday, which brought the country’s total to 62,773. The official death toll rose to 555, with 42 people dying since the Wednesday.

Russia has been in lockdown since the first week of April, with the vast majority of regions ordering residents to stay home and not go out unless it’s to buy groceries and medicines or to take out the trash.

As the outbreak picked up speed, President Vladimir Putin indefinitely postponed a nationwide vote on the constitutional reform that would allow him to stay in power until 2036, as well as the traditional military parade on Red Square marking the 75th anniversary of World War II victory.

With the new bill coming into effect, leaders of political parties can split their party if they have 40 per cent support either in the central committee or in the parliamentary party.

Samajwadi Party and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN) on Thursday handed over a joint application to the Election Commission to notify about the unification of the two parties to form the new party. The new party has a combined strength of 34 members in the House of Representatives, making it the third largest force in the 275-member Parliament.

Major political parties, including Nepali Congress, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and the Madhesi parties have voiced strong opposition to the new bill and asked the government to withdraw it, saying it will bring political instability at a time when the country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

169,24-4-20,Next in fashion,"As the pandemic hits the world, virtual fitting rooms, garment hygiene, integrated online and offline sales might be the norm forward, says Sakshi Sharma

Not too long back, stepping into a store, trying out several outfits and purchasing the one with the best fit and style was a routine. But that will not be the case anymore. In the Coronavirus-hit world, fashion companies have been forced to halt their operations as all the stores are shut and the supply chains are left hanging mid-way.

The major question here is — What will happen to the industry when the pandemic is over? Fashion designer Payal Jain says that the fashion world has been moving towards change for the last decade, as fashion weeks have been logistically and monetarily strained. This global shift will certainly bring change to the formats we have been used to and force us to rethink the entire model. A lot of the interaction that happens during fashion weeks can easily move online but sadly, the experience of watching a show cannot. Like everything else around us, we will need to be creative and build platforms that don’t endanger anyone’s life and health. Large gatherings will be a thing of the past and new platforms will evolve. Life and fashion after COVID-19 will certainly not be the same!

What next?

Right from consumer choices, pricing to upcycling and sustainability, the fashion industry might undergo massive changes. It may, at the same time, give rise to new themes and trends as cash flow is less. Ayushi Gudwani, founder and CEO, FableStreet, says, “No matter what, the industry is here to stay undoubtedly. However, the consciousness of the customer, both about the costing and the products, is going to evolve. There will be new trends. The functionality of the garment will take precedence over style. Things like anti-microbial, multiple-use wear or easy to wash and quick-dry would become much more important over stylish garments. You would want to ensure that your outfits are regularly sanitised.” She goes on to add that the boundaries between office wear and evening wear would start blurring as people would want to use multi-purpose garments from morning to evening. They wouldn’t want to buy 10 outfits but prefer one. This mindset is here to stay.

In terms of pricing, the focus will be more on value for money products so high and luxury fashion might take a back seat. Ayushi agrees and says, “Yes, this is because the consumers are becoming fairly conscious about where to spend. We will go through a difficult time for more than one-and-a-half years. And likely to go through recession and job losses too. So people would like to save money, especially in men’s fashion. Overall, the mindset of conserving cash and focussing on value will prevail.”

While the pandemic has put brakes on the fashion industry, Sana Jhamb, director, PR and business development, Epistle Communications, believes that this is short-term and expects a gradual pick up. Focus on upcycling and sustainability will become a norm instead of just being a short-term trend. “The industry is likely to develop more transparent, sustainable, localised, and self-sufficient supply chains,” adds she.

While agreeing with Ayushi over drop in purchase of fast fashion and a shift towards comfort and sustainability, there are a few emerging trends which Sarika Grover, co-founder, Green Giraffes Consulting, shares. “An inclination towards athleisure brands is being predicted as most of the people would want to be active at home. Athleisure was already a growing trend and category and is now expected to do better than any other segment in the sector.” She adds that we will also see smaller collections and less number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) per season for a few years as expenditure on clothing will reduce.

Will trials and stores be the same again?

Nothing can quite replicate the experience of trying out clothes for the perfect fit and flattering silhouettes before buying. That was the reason brands like Myntra started the “Try and Buy” offer to cut through customer apprehension about how a particular garment would look. As a result, online fashion was increasingly becoming comfortable for customers to shop but this too, along with offline stores, will suffer setbacks. In a situation, where maintaining distance is the main solution, how can one ensure that the outfit one is trying out is safe?

Payal says that new and creative ways of accessing sizes and deciding fits will probably evolve so that people feel more comfortable buying online or at retail outlets without being apprehensive. Designer Purvi Doshi feels that the fashion business will gradually evolve as an online business as people will start preferring it more. However, contrary to this belief, Ayushi makes an important point. “People assume that trial will become riskier in a retail setup. However, they miss that in an online setup, returned products are re-sent. This will become risky because one will not have control over these garments as to how many people wore it and if that is safe,” she says.

She goes on to add that trials are important but these will reduce in due course of time. The consumer will become smarter. For example, if the style of a particular brand fits you well, you would just want to pick up a fresh piece rather than trying it out. From the brand perspective, she says, that they will have to be extremely conscious to ensure that the outfits are safe and sanitised. “We can reduce the overall trial to 40-50 pieces and the remaining will be kept fresh. Then those tried pieces will have to be sent back to the manufacturing unit to be sanitised. Meanwhile, the fresh stock can be used for trials,” adds she.

Focus and trust on the brand you’re purchasing from will become very important. She also raises her concern about the unorganised market as it will become risky and organised players and trustworthy brands will take precedence.

Well, fashion stores will never be the same again for one more reason — we will now be more cautious of gatherings. People will be really conscious and would want to maintain social distancing. “Stores will need to put a lot of safeguards in place. For instance, not allowing entry of more than a particular number of visitors at a particular time. Ensuring that people maintain a reasonable distance from each other. We are also coming up with ideas such as creating a “by appointment only” section where the access will be given to only a limited number of people during a given time period,” says Ayushi.

Maintaining hygiene in the stores is must. The pandemic has made people hyper-aware of these issues and hygiene standards will have to increase. “The clothes should be steam-ironed and sanitised. The trial rooms will have to be equipped with face mask, sanitisers and hand gloves,” says Purvi.

Sana expects a slow pick-up in brick-and-mortar shops. Online sales are likely to increase while physical retail will see a return to normalcy only after a safe time has passed.

Agreeing with Purvi, Grover adds, “AI Virtual trial rooms would become important. There are a few companies who have built these softwares. I can walk into a store and based on my measurements and other attributes, shortlist garments. So this will help me to buy garments based on the virtual fitting or at the very least, try a lesser number of garments.”

Can rentals trend now?

Rental fashion market will become very risky as people will be hesitant to rent clothes. They won’t be sure about the number of people who have worn or rented a certain dress before them. Naturally, this would make them apprehensive about safety. The market will have to ramp up its hygiene standards to assure customers that they are safe. “People’s hesitation is likely to drive down sales, initially, but as new processes and systems are put into place, a new normal will emerge,” says Grover.

Earlier, price was an important factor for the success of rental companies. Going forward, now it would be a combination of price and hygiene. “Communication around care and hygiene would drive the business. Packaging would need to be re-looked. Conversations have already begun on materials and how long the virus can stay on a cardboard box,” adds she. Ayushi adds, “The price value equation will undergo changes. Consumers would not be ready to pay more and want that the rentals are sanitised in the same cost.”

Another trend that may see an upward spiral is that people would be comfortable with repeating the outfits and upcycling existing ones rather than renting. Ayushi says, “People would prefer buying one quality garment.”

Sana holds out a sliver of hope, “Once the threat is over, we will fall back into the same routine, perhaps with some added precautions.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/next-in-fashion-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/next-in-fashion.html
170,24-4-20,Trend Blazer,"Just embrace yourself: Taapsee

Actor Taapsee Pannu has opened up about the time that made her accept her flaws, and helped her acquire a new identity.

She took to her social media to share a picture in which she is wearing a blue saree.

“This is like a BTS from a shoot I did. I remember how I was concerned that my short hair won’t suit the saree because they are so traditional. But Gaurang was nonchalant and wanted to use my original hair length, colour, texture, and keep everything natural. That really made me think sometimes you just have to embrace yourself the way you are and only then the world will embrace you, too. The day I accepted my flaws was the day I came into my true self.”

‘Due to the scarcity of funds, particularly among the daily wage earners, most would be looking to spend their money on just food and women’s sanitation might not be a top priority for many. We need to focus on how those women can get pads free of cost. I also urge government to distribute sanitary pads with daily ration.’

171,24-4-20,‘Feels great to break stereotypes’,"Randeep Hooda is glad to be the first Indian male actor doing a Hollywood action film, and the Bollywood star says it feels great to be able to break stereotypical references of Indian characters in the West.

Randeep will be entering Hollywood as Saju in Netflix’s Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth and David Harbour. Randeep has stepped out of his comfort zone to make an action-packed entry in the West.

“I was glad to get the film on two to three levels. I got to feature as the first Indian male actor doing action in a Hollywood film. Breaking the stereotypes of IT professionals, millionaires or comic relief in a film. It was great that I was able to break that barrier,” Randeep said.

He added, “I haven’t done hand to hand action much. I have an action image but haven’t done much of it (on screen). So, this was a new thing. It was a new territory for me as an actor, to be able to use other factors and not just drama, and to be able to use my body and learn new things. I really enjoyed it. And even felt safe while doing it because they were so well prepared. I was elated and grateful that I got to do this part.”

In the film, Saju is the one who brings Hemsworth’s Tyler Rake on board to the extraction of his boss’ child. The character is layered, with an emotional vein adding a touch of sensitivity in the action-packed story.

“The layers in the part are a result of discussions, and Sam Hargrave’s vision from discussions, ranging from mutually favourite films and writers. And then (it was a result of) adding a universal emotional angle, which is the family. It deals a lot with that, and wanting to create a difference from the point you first see this guy to the last time you see this guy. His journey was a very gratifying experience,” Randeep said while explaining his role.

Originally titled Dhaka, the film revolves around Tyler Rake (essayed by Hemsworth), a fearless, black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he is enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. It has been shot extensively in India, along with other places around the world.

172,24-4-20,Dial for fine dining,"As eating out becomes a no-go zone, hotels tap into food delivery to reach their patrons while ensuring their safety, says Saimi Sattar

For all of us who are experiencing this moment, it is certainly a watershed time. From now on, we would always talk about life before and after the pandemic as nothing will ever be the same. Eating out was one of those things that we did without giving it a second thought as we took it for granted. Birthdays, anniversaries, catching up with friends, not in a mood to cook — all were good enough reasons to eat out. But with the lockdown and social distancing in place, dining out is certainly not an option, at least for sometime. But that does not have to mean that you miss out on dishes that you savour. Most of the five star hotels in the city have tapped the delivery route to dish out the favourites of their patrons. Many have seen a spike in delivery which earlier formed almost a negligible part of the services that they offered.

Executive Chef Vikram Ganpule at Andaz, Delhi says that a definite rise can be seen, “On a daily basis, at Annamaya restaurant there were three-four deliveries earlier. The number has now jumped to 10-12 orders per day.” But what has really surprised him is the rise in the demand for artisanal breads which, he says, they are making in larger quantities than was done during pre-lockdown.

According to Vivek Shukla, general manager, The LaLiT New Delhi and corporate affairs, deliveries have climbed up by 50 per cent at the hotel.

When it is about food, there are bound to be some dishes which are preferred more than the others. Biryani, in its multifarious variations, certainly makes the cut for most hotels and restaurants. Rohit Arora, area general manager, THE Park New Delhi says that it is this rice dish along with pizzas and pastries from Flurys that diners want to dig into most. The hotel can send it directly to its and has also enrolled the services of different delivery platforms for the same.

Ganpule lists something more specific. With the outbreak of the virus, there is certainly an increased focus on health and eating more wholesome food. “Our millet biryani, both with chicken and vegetables, has been ordered quite a few times. Then there are the good old favourites like butter chicken, kebabs and tikkas that have found favour. Our regular customers also specially request for our Lamb chops and Homestyle chicken curry which were popular on our regular menu but weren’t included on the delivery one. Even though people are a little wary of salads, Nutrition bomb which we make with in-house grown microgreens is also popular,” says Ganpule. The hotel has tied up with delivery services for the transport of the 30 odd selected items which is done in two slots, one at lunchtime and the other for dinner.

At LaLit too, it is the signature dishes that rule the menu. “Biryani, Dal Baluchi and chicken are the ones that are the ordered the most. There is a definite spike in bakery products — cakes, breads and other desserts also,” says Shukla. The Lalit Suri Hospitality Group’s outdoor catering vertical, The Lalit Food Truck Company looks after larger orders and more elaborate customised and bulk menu for families. This operates from eight in the morning to six in the evening while a special midnight menu can be delivered from 11 at night to four in the morning. Smaller orders are delivered through Swiggy and Zomato from 11 in the morning to 11 at night. The menu for this has snacks, grills, sandwiches biryani, main course dishes and desserts.

A new player on the delivery scene, Roseate Hotels & Resorts which started the service as recently as April 10, has seen the maximum interest in its bakery products like cakes, breads and more. These are delivered from seven in the morning to 10 at night. Interestingly, the delivery menu has a spread which includes macaroons for those with a sweet tooth as well as snacks like sandwiches, burgers and more. There are Indian restaurant specialities like Tandoori paneer tikka, Silbatte ki shammi, Murgh Kolhapuri, Chukundar chilgoze ki tikki, Malabar fish and more.

The selections are done and the idea that it can land on your table any moment does not necessarily mean that we can eat it without any apprehensions in the new world that has established its hold on our minds and hearts. Food delivery needs to be safe as became apparent when a pizza delivery boy infected with COVID-19 visited 72 households before being detected with the virus. So even though it can lead to a little more time, safety is paramount in days of the Coronavirus.

The checks at Andaz are at two levels — in the kitchen and also for the delivery service boys. Ganpule says, “We ensure in-house hygiene, temperature checks, social distancing and mask wearing without a single deviation. Since the lockdown, the team is staying in the hotel and when they come from their rooms, there is a specific path that they follow. Their temperatures are checked thrice everyday while entering, exiting the kitchen and once in between. There is a hygiene manager, who ensures that all the protocols are followed and that everyone is wearing gloves, masks while working.” Moreover, the hygiene standards are extended to the delivery services too as the temperatures of people who come to collect the food are checked as is the fact that they wear gloves and masks.

The LaLit is ensuring safety on its part by following all suggested sanitisation processes by WHO. The teams have been given intensive training, the property is regularly fumigated and kitchen surfaces cleaned. “All staff working in the kitchens and hotel premises are wearing face masks and hand gloves. All products — groceries and vegetables — are first collected at the landing bay, where they are washed and sanitised, before going to the kitchens for use. Our delivery channels ensure that the delivery men have gone through proper hygiene training. The food also has double layer of packing, so guests can easily discard the outside layer to avoid surface contact,” says Shukla.

Roseate too is doing its bit. Dr Ankur Bhatia, executive director, Roseate Hotels & Resorts points out, “We have contact less delivery and ensure safe packaging (double outer layer), multiple frequent sanitation of our kitchen utensils, regular temperature checks of all involved personnel to ensure safe food delivery.”

Neeraj Tyagi, Director of Culinary, Pullman & Novotel New Delhi Aerocity says that they are adhering to international standards as the food is prepared with the best in class safety measures and hygiene standards. “The delivery organisations too are using strict safety and hygiene protocols,” he says. The hotel does not deliver on its own but has tapped into the two food delivery services like the others.

Shukla says that the reason for the spike in delivery is because people are looking for a change. Arora points out the reason why hotels score when it comes to deliveries. He says, “Guests are slightly more comfortable to order directly from the hotel considering hygiene factors as compared to their neighbourhood restaurants. Moreover, the team is in constant touch with regular guests and at times goes out of its way to deliver favourites even if they are not a part of our customised menu.”

Beijing’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea conflict with those of ASEAN members Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, and are contested by Washington, which has an active naval presence in the Pacific.

“We estimated that there were at least 2,32,000 infections in the first epidemic wave of coronavirus in mainland China,” said University of Hong Kong researchers, who conducted a study on the criteria applied by China in counting number of virus cases.

According to China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in China stood at 82,798 with 4,632 fatalities as of Wednesday.

China has faced severe criticism from the US and other European countries over under-reporting of coronavirus cases and an alleged cover-up.

On April 17, China revised the death toll in virus epicentre Wuhan by 50 per cent to 1,290 additional fatalities, taking the city’s total toll to 3,869.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was revised to 50,333 an increase of 325, according to an official announcement on April 16.

The Wuhan Municipal Headquarters explained the revision, saying they were in accordance to laws and regulations as well as the principle of being responsible to history, the people and the deceased.

In the study published in medical journal The Lancet, researchers said China might have had 2,32,000 confirmed cases rather than the official count of about 55,000 by February 20, if a revised definition adopted earlier in the month had been applied throughout.

“The true number of infections could still be higher than what is currently (being) estimated considering the possibility of under-detection of some infections, particularly those that were mild and asymptomatic even under the broadest case definitions,” a news report on the study by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said on Thursday.

176,24-4-20,Trump temporarily suspends immigration into US for 60 days to protect American workers,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to suspend certain types of immigration into the US for 60 days to protect the jobs of Americans laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has ravaged the country’s economy.

The temporary suspension of immigration will affect those who are legally seeking entry into the US for employment purposes but not the ones who are already living in the country, the order said.

Describing it as “a very powerful order” Trump told reporters during his daily news briefing at the White House on Wednesday that he signed the order to protect American workers’ jobs in an economy pummelled by the Covid-19 pandemic.

“By pausing immigration, we’ll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad,” he said.

The executive order, which contains a number of exemptions, released by the White House, said the new provisions apply to foreign nationals outside the US who do not have an immigrant visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation.

It also applies to those foreign nationals who do not have an official travel document other than a visa that is valid on the effective date of proclamation or issued on any date thereafter that permits him or her to travel to the US and seek entry or admission.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-temporarily-suspends-immigration-into-us-for-60-days-to-protect-american-workers.html

The vaccine being trialled is made from a harmless chimpanzee virus that has been genetically engineered to carry part of the coronavirus to be tested on volunteers aged between 18 and 55 who are in good health.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/human-trials-of-vaccine-developed-by-oxford-university-begin-in-uk.html
179,24-4-20,Africa’s 43% jump in Covid-19 cases in week worries experts,"Africa has registered a 43 per cent jump in reported Covid-19 cases in the last week, highlighting a warning from the World Health Organization that the continent of 1.3 billion could become the next epicentre of the global outbreak.

Africa also has a “very, very limited” and “very, very strained” testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in his weekly briefing on Thursday.

It means that the surge in infections on the continent is likely to be even higher in reality, he said. WHO’s recent report painted a grim picture for Africa. It warned the virus could kill more than 3,00,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty.

Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical, said Nkengasong.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/africa---s-43--jump-in-covid-19-cases-in-week-worries-experts.html

“Cricket Australia is working closely with the ICC, the Local Organising Committee and the Australian government so we have a comprehensive understanding of exactly what it will take to be able to play the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2020 in October in Australia as planned,” Roberts said.

He attended the chief executives’ committee meeting with the apex body via a conference call. “We are also jointly exploring all other options in relation to staging the event and will take the right decisions at the right time so we can host a wonderful celebration of the sport and keep everyone involved safe and well,” Roberts added in an ICC statement.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ca-exploring----all-other-options----to-stage-t20-wc.html
181,24-4-20,German football targets May 9 restart,"German league football is prepared to resume without spectators on May 9, making it the first major European league back in action, but the final go-ahead rests with political leaders, its chief executive said Thursday.

Following a meeting with Germany’s top clubs, Christian Seifert said the league, suspended since March 13 because of the coronavorus pandemic, is “ready” to return next month.

Seifert stressed though that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and state leaders will make the final decision. They are due to meet next Thursday.

“It is solely down to what the political leaders decide,” Seifert said in a video press conference.

“The Bundesliga is ready — regardless of whether it can continue on 9 May or at a later date.”

Germany has been less affected by the pandemic than other European countries, partly due to mass testing.

But the move to allow players to resume competition is being treated with caution and Seifert stressed that hygiene precautions would have to be strictly observed.

The players must be tested regularly, given an 11-point code of conduct and hygiene officers would be appointed to each team to ensure the guidelines are adhered to.

“Games without spectators are not what we want, but they seem to be the only feasible way,” said Seifert.

“We try to take the best possible precautions through certain measures.”

The Bundesliga CEO said only around 200 people will be allowed in the stadium for each game, including players, coaches, officials and media. Social distancing will be observed off the pitch.

“When 200 people are in the stadium, where 70,000 people are normally expected, it’s easy to keep your distance,” said Seifert.

The leaders of the powerful states of Bavaria — home to Bayern Munich — and the football hotbed state of North-Rhine Westphalia have backed football’s resuming.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/german-football-targets-may-9-restart.html
182,24-4-20,Murray ‘would play’ Sept French Open,"Andy Murray has said that he would “definitely” play in the rescheduled French Open in September, if it is able to take place as planned.

The tennis season has been shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic since last month and will not resume until mid-July at the earliest.

Wimbledon has been cancelled and Roland Garros organisers controversially moved the French Open until September 20-October 4, starting just a week after the end of the US Open, from its usual start date in May.

“I’d definitely play on the clay, if it goes ahead,” former world number one Murray told CNN.

“I’m a bit sceptical whether it will. I would imagine tennis would be one of the last sports to get back to normality because you’ve obviously got players, coaches and teams coming from all over the world into one area.

183,24-4-20,CL qualification should be ‘on sporting merit’: UEFA,"Qualification for the next Champions League should be “on sporting merit” if domestic leagues cannot be completed but countries should “explore all possible options” to finish seasons suspended because of the coronavirus crisis, UEFA said on Thursday.

“If a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons...UEFA would require (leagues) to select clubs for the UEFA club competitions 2020/21 based on sporting merit” in the current season, European football’s governing body said.

That means that, while it remains hopeful that suspended seasons can still somehow be completed, UEFA is now willing to consider “legitimate reasons” to terminate leagues now, with current standings considered final and used as a basis for teams to qualify for the next Champions League and Europa League.

184,24-4-20,FTP set for complete overhaul,"The ICC Chief Executives Committee on Thursday unanimously agreed to revamp the Future Tour Programs (FTP) till 2023, conceding that the “scale and complexity” of getting cricket started again “cannot be underestimated” in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The CEC meeting, held via tele-conference, decided that a decision on the World Test Championship (WTC) and the proposed ODI league, scheduled in June, can be taken at a later date. However, it is a given that the WTC final is unlikely to be held in June, 2021 as per the current FTP cycle and a four-month lag is expected.

But the T20 World Cup is on course even though Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said that his board is ready for any eventuality.

“There was agreement that the disrupted FTP programme would need to be collectively reviewed through to 2023 with a view to rescheduling as much of the cricket that has been postponed due to COVID-19 as possible,” the ICC said in a statement.

Already, England’s tour of Sri Lanka stands postponed along with Australia’s tour of New Zealand.

Pakistan and the West Indies’ tours during the English summer also look to be in serious doubt. In fact, the West Indies’ tour is all but postponed.

It was also learnt that contingency plans are being made for the T20 World Cup in Australia, scheduled for October and November.

“The CEC was updated on the continuing contingency planning for all ICC global events, including the ICC men’s T20 World Cup 2020 and the ICC women’s Cricket World Cup 2021.

“Planning for both events as currently scheduled is ongoing.”

When asked about the contingency plans, a CEC member told PTI, “The complete FTP has gone for a toss. So, the remaining part of next three years will be revamped.

“Although all these Test series are part of the WTC, but bilateral series is an agreement between two countries. So, all the rescheduled series will take time.

“So, while all the league phase of WTC was set to be completed by March 2021, it is simply not possible now as there will be a few more Test series that will be disrupted.

The CEC member said that New Zealand might not travel to Bangladesh.

“So expect at least a four-month lag in WTC cycle,” he said.

ICC’s official line is that “discussions and decisions on this and the future of both the World Test Championship and the ICC men’s cricket World Cup Super League will be held at a later date when there is a greater understanding of the impact of the cricket that has been lost on the competitions.”

Chair of the ICC Medical Committee, Dr Peter Harcourt provided a general medical update to the meeting and the challenge that the governing body is facing.

“The situation is rapidly evolving and full of significant risk as there is still a lot to learn about COVID-19 which can make decision making difficult.

“The ICC Medical Committee is working with Member medical representatives to build a comprehensive picture of the issues cricket is facing,” he said.

Harcourt made it clear that the roadmap for resumption will be different for different countries depending on the medical situation.

“This will consider everything from player preparation to government restrictions and advisories and bio-bubbles.”

He admitted that it is indeed a complex situation caused by the pandemic which has resulted in lakhs of deaths.

“The scale and complexity of getting cricket started again cannot be underestimated particularly with respect to a global event.

“The more teams, venues and cities involved in an event, the greater the risk which has to be assessed and managed.”

ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said said there were several complexities involved in being able to stage ICC global events.

“...They will be carefully considered before any decisions are arrived at in the best interests of the game,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ftp-set-for-complete-overhaul-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ftp-set-for-complete-overhaul.html
185,24-4-20,WADA wants answers after banned Sun's 'Olympic training call-up',"The World Anti-Doping Agency demanded answers Friday after reports that Chinese swimming star Sun Yang was called up for national training for the Tokyo Olympics in an apparent breach of his doping ban.

The latest incident in the colourful career of the three-time Olympic champion comes two months after he was given an eight-year ban for refusing to provide a doping sample.

Unless he is successful with an appeal, the 28-year-old will not be eligible for the Tokyo Games in 2021 and his career is effectively over.

However, Chinese media said on Thursday that Sun had been included on a list of swimmers called up for national training between April 1 and June 30.

Media published a notice purporting to show Sun's name on the list for preparations for the Olympics, which have been moved to the summer of 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) subsequently said that the 1500m freestyle world record-holder is ""still serving (his) suspension.

""The previous notice is invalid,"" CSA said in a short statement.

But that may not satisfy WADA, who said in a short statement to AFP on Friday: ""We are following up with the relevant authorities to establish the facts in this matter.""

Sun has kept a low profile since he was banned. It was his second doping violation, having been suspended for three months in 2014 for taking a banned substance.

Sun said in the immediate aftermath of February's Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling that he would appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.

He is accused of refusing to provide blood and urine samples when drug testers visited his home in China in September 2018.

A vial of his blood was smashed with a hammer during the tempestuous testing session.

Britain's James Guy, a two-time Olympic silver medallist, said he was ""shocked"" and ""speechless"" over the reports that Sun was named in the training squad.

""They've been to CAS, he's been given a ban and that's it. It's over,"" he said, according to Swimming World.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wada-wants-answers-after-banned-sun-s--olympic-training-call-up--2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wada-wants-answers-after-banned-sun-s--olympic-training-call-up-.html
186,24-4-20,SRH has the best death bowling in IPL: Warner,"Sunrisers Hyderbad captain David Warner believes his side's death bowling is ""probably the best"" in the Indian Premier League.

The 2016 champions boast of a fine combination of pacers and spinners with India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan being the prominent names.

""We've got a very good squad. One of the best things about our squad is we have great depths in our bowling,"" Warner said in an Instagram live session with Sunrisers teammate Jonny Bairstow.

""We have got got good upfront swing bowling and our death bowling is probably the best in the competition,"" he added.

While Warner has been in the side since 2014, Bairstow joined the Sunrisers last season. They shared some brilliant opening partnerships including a 185 stand against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Asked about what they liked most about batting with each other, both said running between the wickets was a major contributing factor in their successful partnership.

""I love running between wickets and I think our energy running between the wickets is outstanding,"" Warner said.

""I know how fast your ability and game awareness is. It's one of my favourite things to do and a strong point for us,"" he added.

While Warner scored 692 runs from 12 games, Bairstow notched up 445 runs from 10 matches last season.

""Yes definitely there is an understanding between us. We can both gauge if it's 2 runs we don't have to look, it's just touch and go,"" Bairstow said.

""And that started really early on, we were getting twos when we had no right to get them.

188,24-4-20,We should win at least two out of next three World Cups: Rohit,"Rohit Sharma’s target is to help the Indian team win two of the three World Cups they are slated to be part of in the near future, the limited overs vice-captain and ace batsman said on Thursday.

India are scheduled to take part in the 2020 T20 World Cup later this year in Australia followed by another T20 World Cup in India next year. Then there is the 2023 50-over World Cup. India, led by Virat Kohli, lost in the semi-finals of the 2019 World Cup to New Zealand.

“We know we have three World Cups coming up. Among the three World Cups, we should win atleast two. That is my goal,” Rohit said during an Instagram chat with ace off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.

Rohit also said the Indian team is working on giving players a longer rope and backing them to express themselves over a period of time.

“We do talk about backing players and giving them a longer run. We are trying to give players batting at No 5,6,7 a longer rope,” he said.

“I understand the captain (Virat Kohli) and head coach (Ravi Shastri) are under pressure to pick team while others are sitting out,” he added.

The Indian team has drawn flak for sometime for not giving players enough time to settle in the team. They were heavily criticised for not finding a stable No 4 batsman for the World Cup with first KL Rahul and then Vijay Shankar slotting in that role.

“When I came in the team, I was also in and out. It is on the individual how he makes most of the opportunity and take it forward. We need to back players. He should get his chance otherwise he will always be in two minds,” stressed the 32-year old who leads Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Rohit also heaped praise on teammate Rahul, saying he loves watching him bat from the other end. Rahul has been in good form and did well during India’s tour of New Zealand.

“I love watching KL bat from the other end. He is a very good looking batsman. He is very pleasing to the eye.”

Rohit also spoke highly of young batsman Shubman Gill, saying the 20-year old is India’s future.

“Gill is also a fluent batsman. He is India’s future. When he will get his chance and score consistently, he will get that confidence.”

Asked to name five Indian batsmen he is fond of, Rohit said: “Sachin (Tendulkar), Rahul (Dravid), Virender (Sehwag), VVS Laxman, and Sourav Ganguly.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-should-win-at-least-two-out-of-next-three-world-cups--rohit.html

“In 2008, I was in Australia and the auction was happening. In the lead up to that, I was convinced that the biggest name from Tamil Nadu who is also playing for the country...I’m sure they (Chennai Super Kings) are going to pick me.

And the first name they picked as Dhoni, for 1.5 million and he was sitting right around the corner with me. And he didn’t even tell me that they are going to pick him,” Karthik told Cricbuzz.

“Probably he didn’t know. But that was the biggest dagger to my heart. So I thought that they would pick me later. It’s been 13 years and I am still waiting for that elusive call from CSK.”

Following an Executive Committee meeting of European football’s governing body by videoconference, UEFA said maintaining the same name would be a way of remembering the coronavirus pandemic and the difficult times faced by the continent this year as a result.

In addition, and most importantly, UEFA had already produced huge amounts of branded merchandising before the tournament was put back by a year.

“This choice is in line with UEFA’s commitment to make Euro 2020 sustainable and not to generate additional amounts of waste,” it said in a statement.

“A change to the name of the event would have meant the destruction and reproduction of such items.”

Women’s Euro in 2022

The next women’s European Championship in England has been put back a year to 2022, UEFA confirmed on Thursday, after initially being postponed as a knock-on effect of the coronavirus crisis.

European football’s governing body confirmed that the competition will be staged from July 6-31, 2022.

“When we had to take an urgent decision on the postponement of UEFA Euro 2020, we always had the impact on UEFA women’s Euro 2021 in mind,” said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.

“We have carefully considered all options, with our commitment to the growth of women’s football at the forefront of our thinking.”

Dismissing concerns that the women’s game might be considered an afterthought, Ceferin added that the move to 2022 ensured that the women’s Euro would be given “the spotlight it deserves”.

Moving the Euros to 2022 also avoids any clash with the Tokyo Olympics, which have been pushed back a year to 2021.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/euro-2020-to-keep-original-name.html
193,24-4-20,"Anderson, Broad set Ashes target","England pace bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad have set their sights on a final Ashes series in Australia before they consider retirement.

Anderson and Broad are first and second respectively in England’s list of all-time Test wicket-takers, but both are entering the twilight of their careers.

Anderson is 37 and has endured a series of injury problems over the last 12 months. Although Broad is four years younger than Anderson, he believes his career will not last as long as his fellow paceman.

With the end in sight, both are eager to keep their England places long enough for a memorable farewell Ashes series in Australia in 2021/22.

When asked by Anderson for his retirement plans during an Instagram Live Q&A, Broad said: “I don’t think I could go until your age. Your action’s so smooth, it looks a lot calmer on your body whereas mine is a little more forceful through my body I think.

“I’d never want to get to that place where I’m bowling against a 19-year-old and they’re going, ‘I thought someone said he used to be a good bowler’. I’d hate that. I’d prefer to go that little bit earlier than that little bit later.

“But I’m loving the environment at the minute. I love playing for England.

“I still have huge motivation to keep playing and you just assess that year by year. And we’ve got that carrot dangling over us of Australia in Australia which looks like an achievable carrot to grab.”

Anderson sees no reason why he should not feature when England next meet their old rivals, as long as he maintains his high standards.

“The big thing is standards. If your standards feel like they’re dropping then yeah you might consider finishing,” he said.

“But as long as my standards stay high, my fitness levels stay good and my skills stay where I want them to be and my speed stays pretty good which they have been (I’ll keep playing).

194,24-4-20,Impossible to delay Olympics again: Tokyo chief,"The Tokyo 2020 Olympics cannot be delayed beyond the year-long postponement already forced by the coronavirus outbreak, the organising committee’s president has warned in comments published on Thursday.

Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori said there is “absolutely no” chance of postponing the Games beyond their rescheduled July 23, 2021 opening, according to Kyodo News agency.

“Also thinking about athletes and issues over Games management, it is technically difficult to delay it by two years,” Mori was quoted as saying.

Mori said he had earlier asked Prime Minister Shinzo Abe whether Japan should consider a two-year postponement but “the prime minister decided that one year is the way to go”. Organisers and Japanese officials have said the delayed Olympics will be a chance to showcase the world’s triumph over the coronavirus, but questions have arisen about whether even a year's postponement is sufficient.

Earlier this week, a Japanese expert who has criticised the country’s response to the coronavirus warned he is “very pessimistic” that the postponed Olympics can be held in 2021.

With no cricket being played due to coronavirus pandemic, former and current players are engaging with fans on social media to keep themselves entertained.

Raina joined Ashwin for a live video chat session on popular social media platform Instagram and the duo spoke about various things during their time together at CSK.

Ashwin put on the anchor's hat and asked Raina about his 25-ball 87 which he hit in a losing cause against KXIP at the inconic Wankhede Stadium in Qualifier 2 in 2014.

""Do you remember that video game-like match against Kings XI Punjab in Mumbai? We were chasing somewhere around 230 in the match. You hit everything for either four or six in the first few overs.

Raina's innings included 12 boundaries and six maximums and his strike rate at the end of the innings read 348. The southpaw's innings gave CSK a fighting chance in the huge chase but couple of run outs meant they crashed out of the tournament.

Sehwag was named the Man of the Match for his blistering century. He took apart the likes of Ashish Nehra, Mohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin as he struck 122 off just 58 deliveries, including 12 fours and eight sixes.

""I think when I saw Viru bhai hitting I thought the wicket is definitely very good to bat on. After KXIP innings when we were going back into the dressing room, I kept telling myself to be calm,"" Raina told Ashwin.

""I was in a different zone in that match because I saw Viru bhai hitting from all the angles.. from slip, from point, from the covers. After I saw him hitting with the straight bat, I told myself I will also the use the same approach.

In an interim order on a plea seeking to quash of the state government's contract with Sprinklr, a division bench, comprising Justices Devan Ramachandran and T R Ravi, also directed the state government to anonymize all data of COVID- 19 patients collected by it and allow the IT firm to access data only after completing the anonymization process.

Restraining Sprinklr from any act of breaching the confidentiality of data provided by the Kerala government, the Court directed it not to deal with the data directly or indirectly in conflict with the deal signed between the state government and the IT firm.

The Court also restrained Sprinklr from using the name or logo of the state government for its promotional purposes.

It also directed the state government to take informed consent from individuals before allowing a third party foreign company to process their data.

Earlier, the Kerala government had filed a statement in the High Court, rejecting charges of illegality in its IT contract with the firm for processing data related to COVID-19 patients and contended that initiation of penal action for breach would fall within the ambit of Indian IT Act.

The Centre had also filed a preliminary statement in connection with the case, saying sharing of sensitive data, especially of health related information of large number of people, is to be resorted to in a very careful manner.

In his plea, petitioner Balu Gopalakrishnan had said the only concern is whether the data stored in the web server of company is safe and whether it can be used by the company for monetary gains.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hc-restrains-u-s--based-it-firm-from-analysing-processing-data-of-covid-19-patients-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hc-restrains-u-s--based-it-firm-from-analysing-processing-data-of-covid-19-patients.html

198,24-4-20,"Spike huge, but not ‘exponential’","Coronavirus cases saw a huge spike (1,670) on Thursday even as the Centre asserted the rise in cases has been linear, not exponential.

The day saw Maharashtra recording the biggest ever a single day gain of 778 cases, followed by Gujarat which added 217 cases. With 40 new deaths, countrywide toll stood at 721.

Despite claims by the Government that rise was linear the picture emerging from Maharashtra is worrisome. The State has now overall 6,427 cases and 283 deaths. Gujarat has also seen a manifold surge during the last one week with total count of positive cases reaching 2,624 and a death count of 112.

Delhi continued to be placed on the third rank with a total of 2,376 cases and 50 deaths. The day saw the national Capital adding 128 new cases. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh added 49 and 100 cases to be among the worst affected States with total of 1,937 and 1,687 respectively.

Uttar Pradesh tally of cororna positive reached 1,510 with 8 patients found in Bahraich and 13 in Kanpur on Thursday. Andhra Pradesh also saw a rising trend with addition of 80 cases for a total count of 895 cases and 237 deaths.

However, the Government pointed out that the country is experiencing 4.5 per cent positive cases among the tested people, which is similar to the situation a month ago before the lockdown was imposed.

CK Mishra, who is chairman of Empowered Group 2, said, “On March 23, we had done 14,915 tests across the country and on April 22, we did more than 5 lakh tests, and as per a rough calculation, we have scaled up nearly 33 times in 30 days. This is not enough and we need to consistently ramp up testing.”

Talking to reporters here, Mishra said, “Our focus is on the districts now. The way positive cases moved in India, the growth is more or less linear and not exponential. Certain strategies are in work to contain it to a particular level. Beyond this, looking at the story of positive cases in these 30 days, we are more or less in the same position where we were one month ago. India’s positivity rate has remained 4.5 per cent, despite a 24-fold increase in testing.”

He insisted that through the lockdown, the Government has been able to minimise the spread of the viral infection, cut the transmission rate and increase the number of days in doubling of the cases.

Mishra said India has done better than majority of the developing countries, except South Korea, with respect to the percentage of tested cases yielding positive results.

“During the 30 days of lockdown, we have been able to cut transmission, minimise spread and increase the doubling time of Covid-19, consistently ramp up our testing and utilise our time to prepare for the future,” added Mishra.

“No new case of Covid-19 was reported from 78 districts in the last 14 days. A total of 388 patients were cured in one day, the recovery rate is 19.89 per cent. There are 33 new districts in nine states from where no new case was reported in the last 14 days,” said Luv Agarwal, Joint Secretary at the Union Health Ministry.

“The lockdown period has been used gainfully to review, assess and expand our hospital infrastructure and preparedness; our effort has been to use resources and be over-prepared,” said Mishra.

He added that the country’s first goal with regard to hospitalisation has been to ensure that the minimum number of people needs to go to the hospital. The second goal is to ensure enough infrastructure so that every person who needs to go to the hospital is treated well, cured and sent back. Every district in the country is now working towards that, he added.

He said the number of dedicated hospitals increased 3.5 times since last month and the number of isolation beds increased 3.6 times since March.

As on today, 12 districts have not reported any fresh case for the past 28 days and 78 districts have not reported any new case in the last 14 days. In last 24 hours 1,409 positive cases have been reported, which takes our total confirmed cases to 21,393, said Agarwal.

A total of 500,542 samples from 485,172 individuals have been tested as on April 23, said ICMR. Globally, 2,657,611 people have so far been infected, of whom 185,318 have died, according to Worldometer.

At 5,652, Maharashtra has the highest number of cases among Indian states. It is followed by Gujarat (2,407), Delhi (2,248), Rajasthan (1,935), Madhya Pradesh (1,592), Tamil Nadu (1,629), and Uttar Pradesh (1,449).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spike-huge--but-not----exponential----2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/spike-huge--but-not----exponential---.html

While India’s growth forecast, Fitch cited fall in consumer spending and fixed investment due to extension of coronavirus lockdown and disruption in economic activities.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and representatives of industry associations on Thursday discussed ways to boost the economic and industrial activities during lockdown period. The representatives of Industry Associations urged the MHA to allow more industries to operate with reasonable safeguards.

Sources said the Government has been considering providing relaxation to some more industries to restart economic activities. State Governments are working to operationalise industrial units in non-hotspot zones as the Central Government has given permission for exempting many essential services post April 20.

Certain quarters of the industry and exporters have raised concerns over the revised guidelines issued by the MHA on April 15, stating that it is difficult for them to implement those for partial resumption of their factory operations.

MHA’s Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and Department of Promotion Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra discussed with the industry associations ways to facilitate industrial and economic activities across the country amid the lockdown.

“Feedback is being taken from industrial units and their problems are being addressed, she said during a daily Press briefing on measures related to the lockdown clamped in the country to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Srivastava said progress in economic activities, especially in rural areas, is being witnessed, and added that road construction, brick kilns and cement manufacturing related works have also started. Till April 22, more than 1.5 crore work days have been achieved under the MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) scheme, she said.

The DPIIT, which is a department under the Commerce Ministry, in a tweet said the conference with industry associations was “to facilitate permits for industrial activities in order to boost economic activities.”

The DPIIT is holding consultations with State Governments to discuss the extent to which retail trade and manufacturing can be eased further in the extended lockdown period. In March, industry bodies had sent a list of essential items to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs which recommended that work from home enablers such as mobile phones, laptops, power banks, cable, mouse and repair services, infant products, small kitchen appliances, essential lighting items, innerwear, etc, be included in the list.

Meanwhile, the durable industry also believes that besides fans, air conditioning products should be allowed to be sold.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-plans-to-rev-up-eco-as-fitch-forecasts-slump.html
203,24-4-20,"Don't know what's happening with Dhoni, haven't heard since World Cup: Rohit","India's limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma says he has no idea ""what's happening"" with elusive former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, about whom he hasn't heard anything since India's semifinal exit from the World Cup last year.

With the IPL postponed indefinitely, the chances of an improbable India comeback look even more bleak for Dhoni, who has not played cricket for months now.

During an instagram chat with former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, Rohit said that he has ""no news about Dhoni"".

""We don't know what's happening with him. We haven't heard any news about him. The last match of the World Cup was in July. From there, till now we haven't heard anything, I have no idea,"" Rohit said during the live chat.

In his typical tongue-in-cheek manner, Rohit said that anyone who wants to know about Dhoni should personally contact him.

""When MS Dhoni is not playing cricket, he goes out of radar. He goes underground. Whoever wants to know, you can directly go to him, you know he stays in Ranchi.

""You can't go now but after the lockdown, you take a car, bike or flight go to his place and ask him 'What are you going to do? Will you play or not?"" he quipped.

Earlier India coach Ravi Shastri had said that IPL would have decided Dhoni's fate while legends like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev feel that it is difficult for him to make a comeback after such a long self-imposed exile.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-know-what-s-happening-with-dhoni--haven-t-heard-since-world-cup--rohit-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don-t-know-what-s-happening-with-dhoni--haven-t-heard-since-world-cup--rohit.html
204,24-4-20,Not leaving RCB till the time I am playing IPL: Kohli,"The love and loyalty of the fans will never let him leave Royal Challengers Bangalore till the time he is playing IPL, skipper Virat Kohli said on Friday.

RCB have reached the IPL final thrice but have not gone on to win the trophy.

During a live session on Instagram with former South African captain and RCB teammate AB de Villiers, Kohli said winning the tournament remains the goal but he would not leave the team irrespective of the results.

""It has been such an amazing journey. It is always going to be our dream, winning the IPL together. There is no scenario where I could think of leaving the team ever.

""You can feel emotional about the season not going well but till the time I am playing IPL, I am never leaving this team. The fans, their loyalty has been amazing,"" said the India skipper.

Responding to Kohli's feelings towards RCB, De Villiers too acknowledged the support of fans over the past nine years. Kohli, on the other hand, has been with RCB since 2008.

""Same for me. I never want to leave RCB but to do that I got to keep scoring runs. I am not the captain you see,"" said the South African in jest.

Both recalled their early days in international cricket and their growth as cricketers and friends.

Kohli said at times, the youngsters coming in have too much regard for the ""system"" and he wants to see them break the norm.

""I want to see youngsters coming in scoring 500-600 runs. I want people to break the norm. Sometimes I feel people have too much regard for the system in sport. When you break the shackles, you do something special.""

Kohli also acknowledged contribution of Mark Boucher, Gary Kirsten and Duncan Fletcher early on in his international career.

""Gary always gave me positive feedback. Boucher told me in 2008 to improve my game against the short ball. He had the vision. Then Fletcher, he had a keen eye for the game. So many people who have contributed (to my growth),"" said Kohli.

De Villiers picked the 119 at Wankhede in the 2015 series decider as his best knock against India. Kohli picked the 119 he scored in Johannesburg Test in 2013.

""I was always really motivated to win the series after 2-2 . I was incredibly motivated to do something special,"" de Villiers said.

They also picked their combined South Africa and India ODI team. It included Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ab de Villiers, Jacques Kallis, M S Dhoni (captain), Yuvraj Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Dale Steyn, Jasprit Bumrah and Kagiso Rabada.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-leaving-rcb-till-the-time-i-am-playing-ipl--kohli-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-leaving-rcb-till-the-time-i-am-playing-ipl--kohli.html

210,24-4-20,Eyes on Sweden to gauge ‘herd immunity’ efficacy,"While much of Europe has remained in coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has bucked the global trend by imposing minimum restriction on public activities in order to generate herd immunity to take on the pandemic.

Though for the past month, outdoor activities have not been unbridled — people having been advised to avoid non-essential travel — restaurants, bars, cafes and nightclubs have remained open, albeit with limiting gatherings of over 50 people. Educational institutions, including school for under 16-year-olds, have remained open.

Sweden’s chief epidemiologist has claimed that “herd immunity” could be reached in its capital Stockholm in a few weeks.

The strategy — aimed at allowing some exposure to the virus in order to build immunity among the general population while protecting high-risk groups like the elderly — has been controversial. Some health experts argued it is a risky move. Sweden has seen 16,755 Covid-19 cases and 2,021 deaths so far.

Herd immunity is also called community immunity and herd or group protection. It occurs when a 60 per cent of the community is deemed immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely. This can happen when many people contract the disease and in time build up an immune response to it (natural immunity). It may also occur many people are vaccinated against the disease to achieve immunity.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/eyes-on-sweden-to-gauge----herd-immunity----efficacy.html
211,24-4-20,US still trying to get actual sample of coronavirus from China: Pompeo,"The US is still trying to get an ""actual sample"" of the novel coronavirus from China as several questions related to the infection remains unanswered, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said.

The US has been the worst affected country by the deadly coronavirus, which broke out in China's Wuhan city last year. As of Thursday, the US witnessed at least 842,376 coronavirus cases, including over 49,800 deaths, Johns Hopkins University has said.

""Frankly we are still trying to get an actual sample of the virus (from China). They have given us the breakdown of it,"" Pompeo said during the Larry O'Connor show on Thursday.

Pompeo's comments came as last week President Donald Trump said the US is looking into reports that the novel coronavirus, ""escaped"" from a virology laboratory in Wuhan city, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China.

Pompeo said there still were many questions about the coronavirus that remain unanswered.

""There are still many unanswered questions about how this came to be. This issue of transparency is important not only as a historical matter to understand what happened back in November and December and January, but it's important even today,"" he said.

""As you know, this is still impacting lots of lives here in the United States and, frankly, around the world,"" Pompeo added.

China last week added 1,290 more fatalities in Wuhan to its COVID-19 national death toll of 4,632.

Pompeo also said the US needs every country to be transparent, to share their data, to share all of this information so the world's best epidemiologists and scientists and laboratory experts can begin to develop therapeutics and a vaccine that ultimately gets us to a place where people are less at risk.

""The President is very focused on getting this economy back going, and it is important that we have transparency about the virus to enable us to do that,"" he said.

Responding to a question, Pompeo said the first cases of this were known by the Chinese government maybe as early as November, but certainly by mid-December.

He said the Chinese government was slow to identify this for anyone in the world, including the World Health Organisation.

""Once the United States came to understand what was potentially taking place there, we immediately turned both to the World Health Organisation and to the Chinese Government directly, not just through the State Department but through our health and technical experts as well, and asked for access, for understanding, for transparency, Pompeo said.

The government registered 4,774 confirmed cases on Thursday, which brought the country's total to 62,773. The official death toll rose to 555, with 42 people dying since the Wednesday.

Russia has been in lockdown since the first week of April, with the vast majority of regions ordering residents to stay home and not go out unless it's to buy groceries and medicines or to take out the trash.

As the outbreak picked up speed, President Vladimir Putin indefinitely postponed a nationwide vote on the constitutional reform that would allow him to stay in power until 2036, as well as the traditional military parade on Red Square marking the 75th anniversary of World War II victory.

The events had been scheduled for late April and early May and had dominated the Kremlin's political agenda for months.

The results of a just concluded scientific study conducted by the Science and Technology Directorate of the US Department of Homeland Security, announced during a White House news conference on coronavirus, could be good news for India in its fight against COVID-19.

""Coronavirus dies at a much more rapid pace when exposed to sunlight and humidity. The virus dies the quickest in direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds,"" Bill Bryan, the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology told White House reporters in the presence of President Donald Trump.

Our most striking observation to date is the powerful affect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus both surfaces and in the air. We have seen in a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus, Bryan said.

215,24-4-20,China's coronavirus cases drop to single-digit; pvt firms launch COVID-19 test services,", Apr 24 (PTI) China's confirmed coronavirus cases dropped to single-digit, while technology giants like Alibaba and Tencent have launched booking services for COVID-19 tests.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Friday said six new confirmed coronavirus cases -- two imported and four domestically transmitted -- were reported in the country on Thursday.

As of Thursday, China reported a total of 1,618 imported cases, including 32 in critical condition, and 34 new asymptomatic cases, including one from abroad.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.

The overall death toll in the country remained at 4,632, with no death reported on Thursday.

As of Thursday, the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China reached 82,804, the NHC said.

Hubei province and its capital Wuhan -- the epicentre of the coronavirus -- reported no new COVID-19 case or death in the last few days.

China lifted the lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, allowing people to travel both inside and outside the city.

Meanwhile, Chinese Internet and e-commerce giants Alibaba Group, JD.com and Tencent have launched booking services for COVID-19.

The services have been launched as China accelerates COVID-19 nucleic acid testing to promote epidemic prevention and control and speed up the resumption of production, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Ali Health, Alibaba's health care subsidiary, has offered testing appointments in 10 cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, starting from April 21. It will extend the service to 28 more cities this week, it said.

JD Health, JD.com's health care subsidiary, and WeChat, Tencent's social media platform, also launched similar booking platforms for COVID-19 tests in Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities.

Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province, has started novel coronavirus tests on 208,000 teachers, staff and students in their final year of junior and senior high schools ahead of their reopening.

As of Thursday noon, the city has completed nucleic acid tests on 193,000 teachers and students in graduating classes in high schools. As many as 38,000 people have received the results, all of which were negative.

Grade three students in Guangzhou will return to school on April 27.

As of Thursday, Hong Kong reported 1,035 coronavirus cases, including four deaths, Macao registered 45 cases and Taiwan 427, including six fatalities.

A total of 699 patients in Hong Kong, 27 in Macao and 253 in Taiwan have recovered.

216,24-4-20,"Pak's coronavirus cases rise to 11,155; 79% cases locally transmitted","About 79 per cent of the total coronavirus cases in Pakistan are now locally transmitted, health authorities said on Friday as the number of people affected by the deadly virus rose to over 11,000.

According to the Ministry of National Health Services, 13 more patients died due to the novel coronavirus, taking the toll to 237 and another 2,527 recovered.

In the last 24 hours, 642 new cases were reported, taking the tally to 11,155 in the country, health officials said on Friday.

Punjab reported 4,767 patients, Sindh 3,671, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,541, Balochistan 607, Gilgit-Baltistan 300, Islamabad 214 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 55 patients.

So far, 13,365 tests have been done in the country, including 6,839, during the last 24 hours.

The confirmed cases are steadily increasing and the officials have warned that the peak would reach by the end of May or beginning of June.

The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Friday said that 79 per cent of these cases have been caused by local transmission of the novel coronavirus.

The government has decided to introduce a track and trace system under which random testing of people will start in a few days.

The whole situation has changed due to local transmission, it had been decided to change the policy to tackle the issue, Executive Director of the National Institute of Health Professor Aamer Ikram was quoted as saying by the Dawn.

""Earlier most of the cases were being reported in those people who were coming from abroad and even cases of local transmission were being reported among those who had come into contact with foreign travellers. However now a majority of cases are being attributed to local transmission of the virus,"" he said.

Meanwhile, authorities also urged people to offer prayers at home on Friday when big congregations are held in mosques.

Pakistan has allowed conditional congregational prayers in mosques during Ramzan, endangering the drive to curb the spread of coronavirus.

217,24-4-20,Developing nations' repayments on public external debt to soar $2.6-$3.4 trillion in 2020-21: UN,"Developing countries' repayments on their public external debt alone will soar between USD 2.6 trillion and USD 3.4 trillion in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN trade and development body has said.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in a new report has stressed that the pandemic has hit developing countries at a time when they have already been struggling with unsustainable debt burdens for many years as well as with rising health and economic needs.

Developing countries now face a wall of debt service repayments throughout the 2020s, it said.

In 2020 and 2021 alone, repayments on their public external debt are estimated at nearly USD 3.4 trillion -- between USD 2 trillion and USD 2.3 trillion in high-income developing countries and between USD 666 billion and USD 1.06 trillion in middle- and low-income countries, the report said.

The UNCTAD report called for a global debt deal for the developing world and underlines the vital need for decisive action to provide substantive debt relief to developing countries to free up sorely needed resources to respond to the raging pandemic.

""The international community should urgently take more steps to relieve the mounting financial pressure that debt payments are exerting on developing countries as they get to grips with the economic shock of COVID-19,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.

Last month, the UNCTAD called for a USD 2.5 trillion coronavirus crisis package for developing countries. Even prior to the COVID-19 crisis, many of these countries faced high and rising shares of their government revenues going to debt repayments, squeezing health and social expenditures.

The financial turmoil from the crisis has triggered record portfolio capital outflows from emerging economies and sharp currency devaluations in developing countries, making servicing their debts more onerous, it said.

""Recent calls for international solidarity point in the right direction,"" said Richard Kozul-Wright director of UNCTAD's globalisation division that produced the report, ""but have so far delivered little tangible support for developing countries as they tackle the immediate impacts of the pandemic and its economic repercussions"".

Outlining the key steps to translate the calls into action, the UNCTAD said standstills would provide macroeconomic ""breathing space"" for all crisis-stricken developing countries requesting forbearance to free up resources, normally dedicated to servicing external sovereign debt.

The standstills, if long and comprehensive enough, would facilitate an effective response to the COVID-19 shock through increased health and social expenditure in the immediate future and allow for post-crisis economic recovery along sustainable growth, fiscal and trade balance trajectories.

The programmes would ensure the ""breathing space"" gained under the first step to reassess longer-term developing country debt sustainability, on a case-by-case basis, it said.

Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cancelled debt repayments due to it by the 25 poorest developing economies for the next six months.

This debt cancellation is estimated at around USD 215 million. Leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies (G20) announced the suspension of debt service payments for 73 of the poorest countries from May to the end of this year.

However, more systematic, transparent and coordinated measures towards writing off developing country debt across the board are urgently needed, the report said.

It suggested that a trillion dollar write-off would be closer to the figure needed to prevent economic disaster across the developing world.

To take the first two steps forward, the UNCTAD report proposed the establishment of an International Developing Country Debt Authority (IDCDA) to oversee their implementation and lay the institutional and regulatory foundations for a more permanent international framework to guide sovereign debt restructuring in future.

""This could follow the path of setting up an autonomous international organisation by way of an international treaty between concerned states. Essential to any such international agreement would be the swift establishment of an advisory body of experts with entire independence of any creditor or debtor interests,"" it said.

218,24-4-20,Govt puts on hold DA hike till July 2021,"The Central Government has put on hold till July 2021 the increase in dearness allowance (DA) for its about 49.26 lakh employees and 61.17 lakh pensioners because of the strain on finances due to the coronavirus lockdown.

The Centre also put on hold other allowances like LTC, etc, except for children education allowances till June 2020. The allowances include departmental canteen, office supplies expenses and the kind of wages as scheduled in the Cash Management System in Central Government. It also tweaked norms for advance payment in medical treatment and said only in emergency cases such grants may be processed.

In March, the Union Cabinet had approved an increase of 4 per cent in DA to 21 per cent.

“The Central Government employees and pensioners will now continue to receive DA at current rates, i.e., 17 per cent as part of their salary/pension,” according to the office memorandum.

The memorandum further stated that no arrears will be paid from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. However, any hike in DA due to revision on July 1, 2021 will take into account the previous hikes as well.

The Government’s tax revenues have plummeted because of the Covid-19 lockdown while expenses have shot up because of the support provided to the vulnerable groups.

The Government revises dearness allowance twice a year to compensate for the rise in prices.

This is the first coronavirus impact on Central Government employees. The Government had earlier cut salaries of Ministers, Prime Minister, President and Members of Parliament by 30 per cent.

The Government earlier urged its employees to contribute one day’s salary of April 2020, which is payable in May. The pay deducted from the salary of employees will be contributed to the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund).

The Department of Revenue said in a circular that it has decided to appeal to the officers and staff of the Department to contribute their one day’s salary every month till March 2021 to the PM CARES Fund.

However, the circular also said, “Any officer or staff having objection to it may intimate Drawing & Disbursing Officer, Department of Revenue in writing mentioning his/her employee code latest by 20.04.2020.”

The employees of other departments, except those involved actively in the fight against Covid-19, may also have to contribute one day’s pay from their monthly salary to the fund. However, this may be voluntary, it noted.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-puts-on-hold-da-hike-till-july-2021-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-puts-on-hold-da-hike-till-july-2021.html
219,24-4-20,"BJP spreading virus of communal prejudice and hatred, says Sonia","Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday accused the BJP of spreading the virus of communal prejudice and hatred in the country, asserting that “grave damage” is being done to social harmony in the country.

Addressing a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, Sonia said it should worry every Indian and her party will have to work hard to repair this damage.

“Let me also share with you something that should worry each and every one as Indians. When we should be tackling coronavirus together, the BJP continues to spread the virus of communal prejudice and hatred,” Sonia said at the CWC meet through video-conferencing. This is the second CWC meet this month while she has been taking stock of the situation through various party meetings.

“Grave damage is being done to our social harmony. Our party, we will have to work hard to repair that damage,” she added.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and top Congress leaders attended the meeting through video-conference.

Manmohan said the success of the lockdown will be judged later on how the Covid-19 pandemic is handled by the Government. He also said the cooperation between the Centre and States was key to success of the country’s fight against coronavirus.

The top leaders of Congress repeated their earlier complaints that the Centre was not doing enough testing to detect coronavirus cases. Sonia also slammed the Government on the poor quality of PPE kits and their shortage.

The Congress president said coronavirus pandemic has increased disturbingly in the past three weeks and called upon the Government to increase testing for it.

Sonia said she has written several times to the Prime Minister since the lockdown was enforced and suggested several measures and constructive cooperation. “Unfortunately, they have been acted upon only partially and in a miserly way. The compassion, large-heartedness and alacrity that should be forthcoming from the Central Government is conspicuous by its absence,” she said.

The Congress chief said the focus of the party must continue to be on successfully engaging with health, food security and livelihood issues.

She claimed that around 12 crore people have lost jobs in the first phase of the lockdown and urged the Government to provide a relief package for the MSME sector, which accounts for one-third of the GDP.

Sonia called upon the Government to provide food and financial security to migrants and jobless stranded at various places and were desperate to reach back home.

“We have repeatedly urged the PM there is no alternative to testing, tracing and quarantine. Unfortunately, testing still remains low, testing kits still in short supply,” she noted.

220,24-4-20,"Sonia doing cheap politics, stoking communal fire, must tender apology: BJP","In a sharp riposte to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who charged the ruling party with “spreading communal prejudice and hatred,” the BJP on Thursday described her comment as “cheap politics”. The BJP demanded that she immediately tender an apology for her “irresponsible comments” which would “encourage communal feeling and hatred”.

Senior BJP leaders and Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said it was unbecoming of the Congress leader to make such comments when the entire country is fighting coronavirus pandemic unitedly.

“We are not creating communal divisions. We are unitedly fighting Covid-19. We request them not to do cheap politics. They must not indulge in small politics,” Javadekar said, shortly after Sonia took on the ruling party.

BJP’s national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain demanded that Sonia should immediately take back her statement which is aimed at “encouraging communalism” and an attempt to distract attention from violent incidents in the Congress-ruled States like Maharashtra. He was obviously referring to the killing of religious men in Maharashtra’s Palghar region.

Shahnawaz alleged that the Congress was “sowing seeds of communal poison” and asked why the Congress was not demanding its Government to come clean on the killings in Maharashtra. Why Sonia did not condemn the incident?” the BJP leader asked.

The BJP spokesperson sought an immediate apology from the Congress leader for making “irresponsible” charges. He said the Congress did not condemn an attack on a senior mediaperson by alleged Congress attackers.

Naqvi also dismissed Congress president’s charges as those made without giving much thought to the issue. Talking about Sonia raising questions over lesser tests being conducted Naqvi said, “Few people have a habit of asking questions all the time whereas everybody is working hard to keep Indians healthy”.

He said the country is successfully battling out the pandemic under the spirited leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sonia-doing-cheap-politics--stoking-communal-fire---must-tender-apology--bjp.html
221,24-4-20,"Two arrested for attacking Arnab, Cong seeks FIR against anchor","The Mumbai Police on Thursday arrested two persons in connection with the alleged attack on Republic TV co-founder Arnab Goswami, even as the Indian National Congress demanded FIR against Goswami for allegedly spreading “racial and social hatred” in the society.

Acting on a complaint lodged by Goswami with the NM Joshi Marg police station, the police arrested two persons — identified as Prateek Mishra and Raju Borade — in connection with the incident that took place in the small hours of Thursday. Both the arrested persons are in their early 30s.

The police said they were trying to ascertain the antecedents and political affiliations, if any, of the two arrested persons.

Several FIRs have also been filed across States against Arnab Goswami for his controversial comments on a recently aired programme on Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the backdrop of the Palghar lynching incident.

Goswami alleged the two persons, whom the Mumbai Police personnel had apprehended, had “confessed’ that they were from the Youth Congress. To substantiate his point, he said that “just three hours after the attack, Congress party leader Alka Lamba had tweeted “Youth Congress Zindabad”.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), which met on Thursday under the chairmanship of party’s AICC general secretary in-charge of State Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the Palghar lynching incident and termed it inhumane act.

“It is clear that a section of media is continuously trying to spread racial and religious hatred in society. Arnab Goswami of Republic TV, has tried to create misogyny against women in the society. He made an outrageous remark against Congress president Sonia Gandhi on a live TV programme. This is completely unethical journalism and we publicly protest it,” the MPCC statement said.

“We believe in brotherhood and cannot accept such animosity. This will be dangerous for the unity and integrity of the country. Therefore, we are jointly requesting Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to take action against Arnab Goswami and the Republic India news channel for disturbing the social environment,” the statement added.

Among the FIRs lodged included: the one registered in Sadar police station in Nagpur city of Maharashtra based on the complaint of Maharashtra’s Energy Minister and Congress leader Nitin Raut, while a second FIR was registered in Chhattisgarh’s capital city Raipur on the complaint of State Health Minister TS Singh Deo.

In Maharashtra, State Youth Congress president Satyajeet Tambe has filed a complaint against Goswami in Sangamner.

Several Congress leaders have slammed Goswami for his comments against Sonia Gandhi. “He has gone insane and crossed all limits, he should be ashamed of himself. I must ask the Editors Guild - isn’t this (an) all time low for journalism? Rajeev Chandrasekhar must sack him immediately (sic),” Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted.

In a related development, BJP president JP Nadda and his party’s other leaders on Thursday condemned the alleged attack on Goswami and slammed the Congress over the incident.

Senior BJP leader and Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar also condemned the incident.

222,24-4-20,14 new charter flights to bring COVID-19 stranded Brits back from India,"The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on Friday announced 14 new charter flights from India -- eight from Amritsar, five from Ahmedabad and one from Delhi -- to repatriate British residents stranded in the COVID-19 lockdown back to the UK.

The FCO said 3,600 more stranded travellers will be able to return home from India as a result of the new charters scheduled between April 28 and May 4.

Once completed, these additional flights will bring the total number of people flown to the UK from India on 52 UK government charter flights to over 13,000.

""Travel to and from India is severely restricted and so we have organised a series of charter flights. Through these 52 UK charter flights, we will have brought back 13,000 people and our staff in India will continue to support all those UK nationals who need our help,"" said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, the minister who finalised the GBP 75-million repatriation scheme for stranded Britons around the world.

FCO Minister of State for South Asia and the Commonwealth Lord Tariq Ahmad has been coordinating the exercise with his Indian counterparts and respective state chief ministers to help put the logistics in place for the flights.

""We have already helped over 6,500 people return from India since we began our charter flight programme, with a further 7,000 due to return in the coming weeks. The 14 new flights announced today bring the total number of UK government charter flights from India to 52,"" said Ahmad.

""We are continuing to work around the clock to ensure all British travellers in India are supported to come back to the UK if they wish,"" he said.

Jan Thompson, Acting High Commissioner to India, added: ""We are extremely grateful for the close and continuing support of the Indian government and airport authorities in facilitating this unprecedented repatriation exercise.

""We are continuing to work around the clock to get as many British nationals home as possible.""

Since the coronavirus outbreak began, the FCO says it has worked consistently with governments, air carriers and travel companies to minimise disruption and help British travellers return home safely -- supported with GBP 75 million for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable people.

More than 13,200 people have already returned to the UK on 63 flights organised by the FCO from 18 different countries and territories, including over 700 from Pakistan, over 1,700 from South Africa and over 1,200 from Peru.

The charter flights are for British nationals who normally reside in the UK and their direct dependents.

Details regarding flights, luggage allowance and costs are available on the FCO's India Travel Advice page.

Seats on the flights are only available to those already registered and on a waitlist.

Those who are eligible to fly will be sent information on how to get to airports and flight itineraries directly when their seat is confirmed.

224,24-4-20,"India may see second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in monsoon, say scientists","The trajectory of COVID-19 cases could have plateaued and might even fall for some weeks after the lockdown is lifted but India is likely to see a second wave in late July or August with a surge in the number of cases during the monsoon, say scientists.

The timing of the peak will depend on how India is able to control physical distancing and on the level of infection spreads after restrictions are relaxed, they said.

It looks apparent that the trajectory of daily new cases has reached a plateau and eventually it will take a downward fall, maybe for some weeks or even months, Samit Bhattacharya, associate professor at the Department of Mathematics, Shiv Nadar University, told PTI.

Still, we may get a surge of new cases of the same coronavirus and this will be considered a second wave, Bhattacharya explained.

The second epidemic may come back in late July or August in the monsoon, although the peak timing will depend on how we control social distancing during that time, he said.

Rajesh Sundaresan, professor at Bengaluru's Indian Institute of Science (IISc), agreed.

Once we return to normal activity levels, there is a chance that infection may begin to rise again. China is seeing this to some extent post easing of some restrictions on travel, Sundaresan, corresponding author of a working paper by researchers at IISc and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, told PTI.

On March 25, when the number of coronavirus cases was 618 with 13 deaths, the government announced a nationwide lockdown that was later extended to May 3.

On Friday, the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 718 and the number of cases to 23,077, according to the Union Health Ministry.

In good news, officials said this week that the doubling rate of cases has slowed down in the period, going from 3.4 days before lockdown to 7.5 days, with 18 states doing better than the national average. The recovery rate has also almost doubled in the last 10 days.

""Looking at the new cases in the past few days, it seems the growth of new daily infection is much slower than earlier. This apparently indicates that we might have reached at the plateau of the growth curve, Bhattacharya said.

He noted that recent studies in China and Europe observed that the infection might relapse in those people who have already recovered from earlier phases.

So, there is no evidence that the earlier infection may help acquire immunity against the second infection. And in that way, the entire population may be vulnerable to the second wave to some extent, said the scientist.

In their study unveiled this week, IISc and TIFR researchers analysed the impact of strategies such as case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing and various post-lockdown restrictions on COVID-19 that might remain in force for some time.

The study modelled on Bengaluru and Mumbai suggests the infection is likely to have a second wave and the public health threat will remain, unless steps are taken to aggressively trace, localise, isolate the cases, and prevent influx of new infections.

The new levels and the peaking times for healthcare demand depend on the levels of infection spreads in each city at the time of relaxation of restrictions, they said.

The lockdown is currently upon us. It has given us valuable time. Let us test, trace, quarantine, isolate, practice better hygiene, search for a vaccine, etc. We should do these anyway, and these are being done. When and how to lift the lockdown is going to be a difficult decision to make, said Sundaresan.

It's clear that it's going to be phased. What our team is focusing on is to come up with tools to help the decision makers assess the public health impact of various choices, he said.

According to the experts, infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is more than one.

Once enough people are immune there will be fewer people susceptible to the infection and the outbreak will die.

However, when an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other interventions, it is possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity, they said.

This means enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.

Until the vaccine comes on the market, we have to remain alert Once sporadic cases occur here and there in the country, we immediately need to implement quarantine or social distancing locally for the people in that region, and also need to perform tests to identify positive cases irrespective of showing symptoms, Bhattacharya explained.

Note that these monsoon months are also flu season in many places of India. So, we should not ignore the early signs of the flu symptoms. Irrespective of symptoms, we need to increase tests in the hotspots to identify people and contain the surge, he said.

Sundaresan added that the timeline for a second wave will depend on a lot of circumstances which may change as the time passes.

Significant testing may have been underway, there may be behavioural changes with people becoming more careful about their hygiene, wearing masks may become more common, etc. All these responses may help restrict the second wave, he said.

A study published in The Lancet journal earlier this month modelled the potential adverse consequences of premature relaxation of interventions, and found it might lead to a second wave of infections.

The finding is critical to governments globally, because it warns against premature relaxation of strict interventions, the researchers said.

While interventions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are in place, countries will need to work toward returning to normalcy; thus, knowledge of the effect of each intervention is urgently required, they said in the study.

According to a recent analysis by the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, the best strategy to ease the critical care burden and loss of life from COVID-19 might be on-again, off-again social distancing.

In the absence of such interventions, surveillance and intermittent distancing may need to be maintained into 2022, which would present a substantial social and economic burden, the researchers wrote.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-may-see-second-wave-of-covid-19-outbreak-in-monsoon--say-scientists-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/india-may-see-second-wave-of-covid-19-outbreak-in-monsoon--say-scientists.html

The video meeting platform has seen a spike in users since the Covid-19 pandemic as millions have been forced to work from home.

""Clearly the Zoom platform is providing an incredibly valuable service to our beloved users during this challenging time,"" Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a statement.

""We are thrilled and honoured to continue to earn the trust of so many enterprises, hospitals, teachers and customers throughout the world,"" he added.

Zoom hit the headlines recently for a growing number of security and privacy concerns, but that has not stopped people from using the video conferencing app.

Set to release this weekend, Zoom 5.0 includes two new features to help Zoom users host secure meetings and protect their data.

One is support for ‘AES 256-Bit GCM' encryption, which provides more protection for meeting data and greater resistance to tampering.

""Organizations will have access to GCM encryption with the release of Zoom 5.0, and a system-wide account enablement will occur May 30, when all Zoom customers will switch to the new cryptographic mode,"" said the company.

Hosts and co-hosts can now report users to Zoom's Trust & Safety team, who will review any potential misuse of the platform and take appropriate action. This feature will be within the Security icon in the meeting controls.

Earlier, Yuan apologized for the privacy and security issues or ""Zoom-bombing"" being reported in his app that has seen a surge in usage globally as people work from home during lockdowns.

Earlier this month, the company put a 90-day hold on new features to dedicate all of its resources to identifying and fixing security issues.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zoom-s-user-base-hits-300-million-despite-privacy-issues-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/zoom-s-user-base-hits-300-million-despite-privacy-issues.html

236,24-4-20,War on respiratory virus detoxifies Delhi’s lungs,"With very few vehicles on roads, only essential commercial units functioning due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown and a weather favourable for dispersion of pollutants, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels and 50 per cent depletion in PM10 concentrations in the national Capital.

The apex pollution control body has analysed data from continuous ambient air quality monitoring network of 38 stations in the national Capital between March 16 and April 15. Air quality trends have been studied in two phases — pre-lockdown phase of March 16 to March 21 and the lockdown phase from March 25 to April 15.

In its report, the CPCB said, “Significant reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels observed. Overall, 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and 50 per cent reduction in PM10 concentration observed during the lockdown period.”

PM2.5 refers to particulate matter having diameter less than 2.5 micrometers which can enter the lungs and even the bloodstream.

The CPCB said reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 levels primarily indicate depletion in combustion and industrial sources of pollution which are common to both fractions of particulate matter.

Since 81 per cent of Delhi’s nitrogen oxide comes from the transport sector, according to TERI Emission Inventory, 2018, restrictions on vehicular activity led to 56 per cent reduction in NO2 levels and over 37 per cent cut in carbon monoxide (CO) concentration during the lockdown period, compared to the pre-lockdown period, it said.

Due to restrictions on the transport sector and industrial operations, the two major sources of benzene emissions, a 47 per cent reduction in benzene level has been observed, the CPCB report stated. “However, only 19 per cent reduction was seen in sulphur dioxide levels which may be due to the fact that over 70 per cent of Delhi’s SO2 originates from power plants located around the national Capital (as per TERI Emission Inventory, 2018) and power plants were operational during the lockdown period,” it added.

Since most of the eateries and industries in Delhi have shifted from coal to other less polluting energy sources, power plants appear to be the most likely source of sulphur dioxide.

The CPCB also analysed data from 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi.

Anand Vihar recorded 62 per cent, 69 per cent and 72 per cent reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels respectively during the lockdown period, the report said, adding Vivek Vihar, which is near major traffic corridor GT Road, saw a 60 per cent reduction in NO2 levels.

In Dwarka Sector-8, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels depleted by 48 per cent, 61 per cent and 68 per cent respectively, while Okhla recorded a 72 per cent reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels, the CPCB said.

The apex pollution control body recorded 24 hourly average PM2.5 and PM10 levels within National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 20 and 15 days respectively in 22 days of the lockdown period. NO2 levels were 75 per cent less than their 24 hourly standard.

Twenty-four-hour averages of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels dropped as low as 24 microgrammes per cubic meter, 39 µg/m3, 15 µg/m3 and 10 µg/m3 respectively during the lockdown period, the report said.

A 27 per cent increase in PM2.5 level and a 65 per cent increase in PM10 concentration was observed in between April 7 to April 15 compared to the first two weeks of the lockdown -- March 25 to April 6.

However, the CPCB said, PM2.5 and PM10 levels were still lower by 39 per cent and 35 per cent respectively than pre-lockdown concentrations. This may primarily be attributed to change in meteorological conditions.

The onset of summers has led to dry and dusty conditions. A mild dust storm from the western part of the country and the gulf region hit Delhi on April 14-15 rapidly increasing PM10 levels in Delhi and NCR, the pollution control body said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/war-on-respiratory-virus-detoxifies-delhi---s-lungs-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/war-on-respiratory-virus-detoxifies-delhi---s-lungs.html

239,24-4-20,Shameless greed: Taylor Swift on former label's unapproved live album,"Pop star Taylor Swift has blasted her former record label, Big Machine Records, for trying to release an unapproved live album containing music she recorded in 2008.

In a statement posted on her Instagram Story on Thursday, Swift said the album, titled 'Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008' is a recording of a radio show performance she did when she was 18 years old.

""Big Machine has listed the date as a 2017 release but they're actually releasing it at midnight tonight. I'm always honest with you guys about this stuff so I just wanted to tell you that this release is not approved by me,"" the 30-year-old singer said.

""It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros and the Soros family and The Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realised that paying $330 MILLION for my music wasn't exactly a wise choice and they need money,"" she added.

Swift said the album is a classic example of ""shameless greed in the time of Coronavirus. So tasteless, but very transparent"".

The pop star's feud with Scooter Braun goes back a year when he acquired Big Machine Records, the label with which Taylor made her first six studio albums. She has been fighting to get back the rights to her master recordings since then.

We should not turn them away on any kind of flimsy pretexts as these critical procedures can't wait,” the Union health minister said.

He also stressed upon the states and UTs about the need to promote voluntary blood donation and urged them to keep themselves prepared for other vector-borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue and TB which should not be ignored in the present circumstances.

He also urged all to download and use the ArogyaSetu App as it will enable people to assess the risk of their catching the coronavirus infection.

“Once installed in a smart phone, the app can assess the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters,” he said.

“We should follow the Lockdown 2.0 in letter and spirit as was done earlier,"" he stressed while warning states not be too relaxed in their approach during lockdown and maintain the standards.

He gave the example of Uttar Pradesh which is efficiently implementing the Lockdown and advised other states to emulate it.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-mortality-rate-3---recovery-above-20----situation-in-control--harsh-vardhan-2020-04-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/covid-19-mortality-rate-3---recovery-above-20----situation-in-control--harsh-vardhan.html
