0,22-1-20,Preventable reality,"The comprehensive listing of threats that can emerge this year, published by the Astana Club, is specific to Eurasian countries but has lessons for the entire world

The Astana Club based in Kazakhstan has brought out a useful document which assesses the top 10 risks for Eurasia in 2020. There are contributions from researchers and thinkers from all over the world, which have been incorporated while carrying out this assessment. Although the risks identified are specific to Eurasia, in effect, one could identify these as being applicable to almost any other part of the world.

The foreword of this document identifies China emerging as a new potential superpower. It also draws attention to China’s economic strength as signified through the Belt and Road mega initiative. Eurasia being in the vicinity of China sees the changes in the balance of power that are now developing. It also expresses the fact that Russia has finally recovered from the chaos and devastation of the 1990s despite several sanctions and restrictions. As a result of this phase of recovery, it is expanding its influence far beyond post-Soviet borders. Concurrently, leaders such as India, Japan, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia have been identified as showing bold intentions to influence the international order. The document observes that no geo-political game can now play out without the participation of these new players.

The first of the 10 risks, which is identified, deals with the aftershock of the US presidential campaign. It looks at developments within the US and the efforts of the current administration to move in the direction of nationalism with possible isolation from global affairs and developments. The prediction made is that in the coming year, there will be more apparent manifestations of the unilateral approach to foreign policy, which obviously will have erratic consequences in a negative sense. In effect, the assessment of this first risk can be seen as not entirely related to aftershocks of the US presidential campaign but possibly more in terms of leading up to the presidential election, which implies several risks during the campaign itself.

It is obvious that the current process of impeachment, which the US Senate will be pursuing, will have major implications for the presidential election in November, 2020, as well as some risks for candidates running for the US Senate. It is also obvious that global developments initiated by the White House would be targetted, keeping in view the 2020 elections. While this Astana Club assessment was produced before the killing of Iranian Major General Soleimani, it can be concluded that to some extent, this attack on a very popular and respected general in Iran was clearly a “macho” act, which was perhaps designed to blunt the impacts of the current impeachment process against US President Donald Trump.

This document also highlights the fact that as far as Iran is concerned, Trump will increase sanctions and the pressure that would be imposed on Tehran. On the other hand, the likelihood of a US-Iran military conflict, which posed certain danger in the summer of 2019, will decline this year. The opinion is also expressed that Trump is unlikely to initiate a military campaign against Iran, which could have uncontrollable consequences. There are other possible developments related to the Middle East, which could also constitute a risk politically to Eurasia. But, of course, there will be serious implications for other parts of the world, particularly for South Asia, with its proximity to both Eurasia and the countries of the Middle East.

The other risks identified in the study include the effects of global economic recession, escalation of the US-China confrontation, a new stage of the nuclear missile race, exacerbation of the battle for technological dominance, military escalation of the conflict around Iran, nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, a new wave of terrorism, aggressive nationalism and populism as well as large-scale climate change problems.

The prospect of a global economic recession is very real and this, combined with an inward looking policy of nationalism such as in the case of the US, could cause economic complications worldwide. Also, in the case of the US, there is the real prospect of a further division between the Democrats and the Republicans, those who are supporters of Trump and those who are strongly opposed to his continuation as President. In the case of the Middle East, it seems unfortunate that Iran and the US have been at loggerheads for over 40 years now, which is affecting all developments in the wake of the Iranian revolution. Developments in 2020 will continue to be affected by an obvious bias on the part of the US openly favouring some Middle Eastern nations.

The issue of terrorism is also alive. While the backbone of the Islamic State (IS) has generally been decimated, it is entirely possible that re-grouping by this terrorist organisation could lead to several dangers in different parts of the world. India is confronted by State-sponsored terrorism in its vicinity and this is a subject that the entire global community and it would need to deal with. The extent of this threat is likely to increase as a result of frustration within a country which is our neighbour. We have to be alive to this as well as other terrorist threats across the globe.

With respect to climate change, we need to come up with scenarios on how we may be able to bring about a transition from fossil fuels to low carbon sources of energy. Far more immediate is the issue of impacts of climate change, which would pose increasing risks across the globe. Projections of extreme events, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had clearly brought out 11 years ago, is the increase in intensity and frequency of disasters and extreme events. A typical but unfortunate example of this is provided by the raging forest fires, which recently affected several parts of Australia, followed immediately by extreme precipitation events which led to flooding and excessive damage.

All in all, it is important that the Astana Club has come up with a comprehensive listing of threats, which can emerge during 2020 and, therefore, extending into this decade as a whole.

Kazakhstan and several Eurasian countries may lie beyond the Himalayan range but in terms of proximity, they are in some cases very close to us in terms of geographical distance. India should, perhaps, engage far more closely with countries of the region and exercise its soft power, including the flow of knowledge, education and research on issues that have a bearing on the region. The threats for Eurasia apply equally to India as well.

The deceased was identified as Tulasi Bari, daughter of Braja Kishore Das of Baruhan village in the district.

Tulasi had married one Rama, son of Bhikari Mallick, in April 2018. Though Braja had given dowry during the time of Tulasi’s marriage, her in-laws had allegedly been demanding more dowries and torturing her mentally and physically since then. It is also alleged that Tulasi’s sister-in-laws used to exploit her in the absence of her husband.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/woman-dies-as-in-laws-throw-rice-gruel.html
2,22-1-20,State's consumer welfare system goes haywire,"The system of consumer welfare in Odisha has been totally paralyzed due to sheer negligence and undermining of the essence of ‘consumer welfare’ by the Department of Food Supplies and Consumer Wefare, alleged senior lawyer of Consumer Court, Brahmapur, Kailash Chandra Mishra.

Though the lawyers of Brahmapur have brought to the notice of the Governor about the deplorable state of functioning of the department, but no action seems to have been taken in the matter so far, Panigrahi said.

Expressing concern that a crucial system has been grossly neglected in the State, Panigrahi said that there are a number of posts of president and members of different consumer forums as well as in the office of State Commission which are lying vacant for last two years to which the State Government have paid deaf ears.

Though there was an advertisement for filling the posts of president and members during January 2018, the Department of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare has not taken any action yet. As a result, the consumers of the State are suffering from getting due justice from harassments, Panigrahi alleged.

Paniggrahi also alleged that, the State Government though had notified in the Odisha Gazette for holding of Circuit Bench of State Consumer Commission at Brahmapur and Sambalpur on 26.9.2016 basing on which the State Commission notified its cause list on 17.11.2016 and 18.11.2016 for taking up the cases at Brahmapur, but the same has not yet been done which is quite unfortunate.

In this regard, a petition has been filed in the National Human Rights Commission, which was duly registered as NHRC Case No.3770/2019.

The commission on perusal of the matters as available on records, recently directed to the Principal Secretary, Department of Consumer Welfare to take appropriate action within eight weeks.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-s-consumer-welfare-system-goes-haywire.html
3,22-1-20,"Use Odia in Assembly, Secretariat: LoP to CM","Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the State Assembly Pradipta Kumar Naik has written a letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik urging him to take necessary steps to ensure use of Odia language in all proceedings of the legislature.

In the letter, the BJP legislator has alleged that the Government’s decision to use Odia in all Government works has remained only in pen and papers. But due to step-motherly attitude towards the mother tongue, almost all letters in Assembly and Lok Seva Bhawan (Secretariat) are being written in English. Besides, several judicial reports, departmental expenditure reports, commission reports and various notices are also being released in English, he has pointed out.

“On November 4, 2011, the name of the State was changed from Orissa to Odisha and the language from Oriya to Odia. However, the State’s name has not been changed in the signage of the High Court. This can be changed if the Government remains determined to do the same” Naik has stated in his letter.

He has opined that besides judicial works, court judgements can also be pronounced in Odia. “While several other States have taken such initiative to promote their mother tongue, why can’t Odish replicate the same,” he has questioned.

Naik has stated in his letter, “I request you take immediate steps for usage of Odia in all Government works, Assembly and judicial proceedings for the larger interest of the people of the State.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/use-odia-in-assembly--secretariat--lop-to-cm.html

5,22-1-20,Woman Maoist gives up arms in M’giri,"A woman Maoist, carrying a bounty of Rs 2 lakh on her head, surrendered before police on Tuesday, expressing her desire to return to the social mainstream. Adme Madkami (22), who had joined the outlawed CPI(Maoist) organisation around five years ago, surrendered before Malkangiri SP Rishikesh D Khilari.

Once an active member of the Maoists Darva Divison, Madkami was wanted by the police in six cases in the district, including three involving murder of civilians.

According to the SP, Madkami claimed to have realised the futility of violence, and wanted to quit the banned organisation. She was also disappointed with the treatment meted out to the women cadres by the Maoist leaders.

Madkami, a resident of Malkangiri’s Mathili area, also said the Maoist leaders do nothing for the development and wellbeing of the downtrodden sections, the SP told mediapersons.

6,22-1-20,Man-jumbo conflict: 100 humans killed in 9 mths,"The Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO) has urged the IGF and Director (Project Elephant), Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to form an expert committee to assess the escalating human-elephant conflicts and human tolls and recommend solutions.

WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty said Odisha has topped in human casualties out of man-elephant conflicts in 2019.

The number of humans killed since April,2019 reached 100 while 102 others were injured, some of them critically in the 177 encounter incidents recorded in the State in 2019. This year till date, on an average, in less than 2 days, a human-elephant encounter is witnessed and in every 3 days a human is killed. Such a high number of human casualties had never been recorded in the past, said Mohanty.

The situation in Odisha is extremely worrying as the situation is now out of control. When we compare this with other States like Karnataka, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu where the elephant populations are 2-3 times that of Odisha, one can see that Odisha’s human-elephant-casualty (HEC) management and mitigation is dismal, he added.

Though an amount of Rs 3.67 crore was spent on consultancy fees for wildlife and conflict management by the State wildlife wing, nobody knows the outcome of the huge expenditure, Mohanty told further.

""We have been raising concerns for the last eight years before the Chief Wildlife Warden and your office about the unhindered mining and quarrying in elephant habitats, the lack of notification of identified 14 elephant corridors, the lack of underpass on roads and train lines, the barbed wire fencing of thick elephant forests all of which are signficant contributors to the raging HEC,"" Mohanty told, urging to take experienced elephant experts and conservationists in the committee to assess the situation, identify the reasons behind human kills and suggest both short term and long term solutions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/man-jumbo-conflict--100-humans-killed-in-9-mths.html

8,22-1-20,Capital gain or loss?,"Jagan Mohan Reddy may want to develop Andhra uniformly with 3 capitals but the human cost might impact his politics

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy should remember his father YSR Reddy’s overarching nature of politics, one that was about social welfarism and uplifting backwards and one that gave him a bankable legacy. So he should stop over-obsessing about setting up three capitals in a now truncated State, focus on its cash-strapped economy and optimise its resources rather than engaging in a competitive one-upmanship with his predecessor and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief Chandrababu Naidu. True, the latter had built his persona by creating futuristic cities as a measure of good governance, be it by redeveloping Hyderabad and giving it a new moniker called Cyberabad or, after losing that to Telangana, attempting a Singapore-style new capital at Amaravati. But considering that much work had progressed on the new capital and was largely acceptable to the gentry for whom it wasn’t too far out of Hyderabad, Reddy might have to pay a political price for stalling the project. For there is a constituency he cannot ignore, that of farmers. The Naidu Government had cracked a land deal with them, whereby they pooled 34,000 acres of farmland in return for stakeholdership of developed land. Now with global investors out of the city, its status reduced to just a legislative capital and unfinished towers turning it into a ghost town, the human cost would bear heavy on Reddy. As it is the crashing prices have meant that farmers have lost out on the land value. They can’t reclaim their old land which has become fallow ever since they were acquired in 2016. Promised doles like annuity for crop loss, they feel cheated although the Reddy Government has increased the pension amount from the existing `2,500 to `5,000. With protesters at his doorstep and his intransigence, Reddy has a man-made crisis that he can ill-afford. His plan of devolving power across the State by developing Amaravati as the legislative, Visakhapatnam as the executive and Kurnool as the judicial capitals may be well-intentioned and help him assuage all his constituencies, particularly catapulting the cosmopolitan Visakhapatnam as a top-tier city, but is ridden with challenges. With the functions of the executive, legislature and judiciary being interconnected, requiring swift approvals and quick transfer of files, governance is bound to suffer a time lag while efficiencies will be compromised. The exchequer, too, will be under additional fiscal stress owing to logistical expenses. The infrastructural costs of building new spaces will make a further dent in the State Budget, though Reddy insists that firming up Amaravati would have been much more expensive. Most importantly, the movement of staff for allied or overlapping issues could end up disturbing the bureaucracy. Then there is the larger issue of a loss of face among investors, both global and domestic. Allegations of malpractices that the Reddy regime has been levelling against Naidu’s contracts have scared prospective investors. The repudiation of past contracts has raised doubts about their sanctity in the State, which would henceforth be dependent on regime change and new governance priorities. This has already spooked most business houses. At the moment, Andhra Pradesh has topped the official ease of doing business index, relegating Telangana to the second spot. But given the decentralisation move, it may not be able to hold on to this advantage for long.

Decentralising capitals, though new to India, has been experimented in 15 countries across the world. In South Africa, for example, Pretoria is the administrative capital, Cape Town is the legislative capital and Bloemfontein is the judicial capital. In Sri Lanka, too, while Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its official capital and seat of national legislature, Colombo is the de facto seat of national executive and judicial bodies. Moreover, India, too, is not alien to having twin capitals because of seasonal reasons in Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and the former State of Jammu & Kashmir. The constitutionality of having diversity of governance within the States through just distribution of powers, thus, stands the test. So long as it is kept within the realm of pragmatism than political sabre-rattling. Reddy’s test will now be in the Upper House where his party does not have absolute majority and where the TDP is a thorn in the flesh. All the more reason for him to act in a prudent manner, so that his moniker of Bhramaravati (illusionary city) for Amaravati doesn’t end up being used against him. The BJP, with Pawan Kalyan, is waiting for him to make a mistake.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/capital-gain-or-loss--2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/capital-gain-or-loss-.html
9,22-1-20,Inequality rules,"The way to grasp the current political climate is by understanding how inequity has grown over the decades

The British charity Oxfam has come out with another annual report at a time when the World Economic Forum (WEF) held at the Swiss resort town of Davos is under way. The report gains eyeballs, loaded as it is with some stunning statistics to highlight “inequality” across the world. This year’s report has some stunning numbers — the top one per cent of India’s billionaires owns four times as much wealth as the poorest 70 per cent. On the global front, the top 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa. The details are quite shocking. While the calculations of the report have been questioned in the past, make no mistakes about the message it sends out: The world is a deeply iniquitous place. The extremely rich are the ones who are exponentially richer than those at the bottom of the human pyramid. With or without a report, evidence is there that the world is becoming more unequal, the rich are getting richer and the poor, well, poorer.

And when someone needs to decipher why there has been such a rise in a nativist Right-wing polity across the world, particularly in democracies, it would be wise to understand that people feel like they have been left behind by globalisation. But they blame other social constructs, too, multi-culturalism for example. Ergo, the leaders they vote for are the ones “who say it like it is.” Of course, many of these elected men, and they are almost always men, do not have the necessary talent to do much about it. They, thus, blame previous administrations and on that front, their point must be accepted. For years, peace dividend allowed sycophancy, nepotism and corruption to bloom and far from making the world a better place, inequality accelerated. The technology revolution has propped up many billionaires but it has also started treating human beings as mere data points — their information being bought and sold without their knowledge. But what can be done about this? The breakdown in trust is massive but other than motivated philanthropy schemes, it would be prudent for the very rich to actually start contributing more to society. Governments have to realise that unmitigated development is not always a good thing, even if some people can become very rich. The poor will be hurt due to the impacts of climate change much more; they will suffer from societal breakdowns far more. While clinking their champagne glasses at Davos later this week, leaders need to realise that they might soon lose control of the narrative.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/inequality-rules-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/inequality-rules.html
10,22-1-20,"Act, before it is too late","Taking a ‘fair’ and ‘realistic’ view of all receipts and expenditure of the Govt, its fiscal deficit is turning out to be almost double the three per cent target sought by the NK Singh panel

Having achieved the fiscal deficit (FD) target for three years in a row, the Narendra Modi Government missed it in 2017-18 and 2018-19. During 2017-18, the actual FD expressed as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 3.5 per cent against the target of 3.2 per cent. For 2018-19, the then Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley had set a target of 3.3 per cent as against three per cent sought by a committee under NK Singh, former Expenditure Secretary and current Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission.

The committee was set up in 2016 to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, with a mandate to revamp it and recommend a path for the next six years. It advocated a FD target of 2.5 per cent, revenue deficit 0.8 per cent, combined Centre-State debt ceiling of 60 per cent and a Central debt ceiling of 40 per cent for 2022-23. It recommended three per cent FD for 2018-19. It also allowed the Government to breach the target in case of “far-reaching structural reforms with unanticipated fiscal implications.”

Vide the Finance Bill, 2018-19 the Government amended the FRBM Act to allow it to achieve three per cent FD by 2020-21 instead of 2018-19 recommended by the committee. Further, it sought the debt limit of 40 per cent by the Centre (60 per cent for Centre and States) to be reached by 2024-25 instead of 2022-23 mandated by the committee.

During 2018-19, the Government posted 3.4 per cent (against the target of 3.3 per cent), that too by taking recourse to what is termed as “financial engineering.” It paid Rs 60,000 crore less to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) towards food subsidy as reimbursement of the excess of the cost of procurement, handling and distribution over the sale price to the beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). It paid Rs 32,000 crore less to State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) viz. Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and so on, for selling LPG and kerosene at subsidised prices. Likewise, short payments to manufacturers for fertiliser subsidy were about Rs 40,000 crore.

The above three so-called “deferred payments” add up to Rs 1,32,000 crore. In addition, public undertakings like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), National Housing Bank (NHB), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) borrowed on behalf of the Government to fund welfare schemes such as rural and urban affordable housing, sanitation and irrigation projects, rural electrification schemes (including free electricity connections to households) highways and railway projects. Termed Extra-Budgetary Resources (EBRs), these totalled Rs 280,000 crore.

All put together, the money, a whopping Rs 412,000 crore, should have been paid by the Government from its Budget. But it decided to make other entities pay for it or borrow on its behalf. This translates to about 2.3 per cent of the GDP.

Including this, the FD for 2018-19 would have been 5.7 per cent instead of 3.4 per cent reported in the Budget. During 2017-18 also, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the FD was suppressed by 2.4 per cent, courtesy EBRs.

The current year for which the FD target is kept at 3.3 per cent (same as the target for 2018-19), will also end up with a repeat of the scenario in the previous two years.

Let us look at how slippage from the target is likely to pan out. First, at the time of the Budget presentation, the FD projection at 3.3 per cent or about Rs 700,000 crore in value term was based on a nominal GDP growth of 12 per cent — from Rs 188,00,000 crore during 2018-19 to Rs 211,00,000 crore during 2019-20. Against this, the actual growth is estimated to be 7.5 per cent implying a GDP of about Rs 202,00,000 crore during 2019-20. Even if the deficit were to be kept at Rs 700,000 crore, as percentage of the lower than initially projected GDP or Rs 202,00,000 crore (or “denominator” effect), this will be 3.46 per cent.

That apart, even in absolute terms, the deficit is expected to be much higher than Rs 700,000 crore. First, given the slow pace of tax collection so far till November 2019 — both direct and indirect — and little prospect of any major recovery in the remaining four months, the collection during the year is expected to fall short of the Budget estimate by about Rs 200,000 crore. Second, the proceeds of disinvestment are expected to miss the target by a whopping Rs 80,000 crore (the Budget estimate of Rs 1,05,000 crore was based largely on strategic sale of BPCL, Air India and so on which is unlikely to materialise before March 31, 2020).

So, the total shortfall in collection — on both these counts — adds up to Rs 2,80,000 crore. Add to this, fertiliser subsidy arrears of about Rs 60,000 crore (according to the industry body Fertiliser Association of India); unpaid food subsidy bills of the FCI at Rs 60,000 crore and about Rs 30,000 crore as unpaid fuel subsidy bills to OMCs. That takes the grand total to Rs 430,000 crore. This will push the actual deficit to Rs 1130,000 crore which translates to 5.6 per cent. This does not capture the EBRs used to fund the Government’s welfare schemes. If, that is included then, the deficit would be even higher.

Taking a “fair” and “realistic” view of all receipts and expenditure of the Union Government, its fiscal deficit is thus turning out to be almost double the three per cent target handed out by the NK Singh Committee. Though, in the balance sheet, it may still show a figure close to the target and brandish that it is sticking to the fiscal consolidation glide path, that is made possible through an act of skullduggery. But, this is not a sustainable situation.

Apart from the spillover effect on PSUs, other agencies of the Government such as the FCI and others, through whom subsidy is administered (e.g. fertiliser manufacturers) who are made to bear the brunt by way of liquidity problems, interest cost, recurring losses and so on, the most serious damage is done due to the “complacency” this breeds with regard to fiscal management. When, the target is achieved without actually bringing about reduction in expenditure or boosting revenue or a combination of both, why would our planners and policymakers take credible measures in that direction?

For instance, a major reason for the ballooning subsidy on urea is its ridiculously low MRP (the current price is just 10 per cent higher than it was in 2002). This is despite the recommendation of the Expenditure Reforms Commission (ERC) in 2000 to increase steps to eliminate the gap between the cost and price over five years. No action on this front implies increasing subsidy in the face of ever-increasing cost. But, by rolling over payments year-after-year and showing less in the Budget, the mandarins in the Finance Ministry skirt the real issue.

Likewise, by not releasing food subsidy dues to FCI and showing less expenditure in the Budget, they run away from dealing with the real factors viz. ridiculously low selling price of food grain, high inefficiency in handling operations by agencies and giving millions of non-deserving access to the food security system.

The same holds for oil subsidy (mainly LPG and kerosene).

In the backdrop of the slowdown in growth, even as commentators are advocating some leniency in the fiscal consolidation drive, the reality is that already, there is substantial relaxation though it is going unrecognised. Under the “business as usual” scenario, the economy may face catastrophic consequences. The Government should act before it is too late. For that, it should recognise that the problem exists and stop fudging its accounts. But, this by itself won’t help.

This has to be followed up by some hardcore reforms such as removal of controls in key areas such as fertilisers, food, fuel and power, giving subsidy through direct benefit transfer (DBT), substantial pruning of the number of beneficiaries under welfare schemes and removing inefficiencies at various levels in the supply chain. This will require shedding populism and cracking down on vested interest (especially corrupt politicians and bureaucrats who are gaining a lot from the existing dispensation) with alacrity.

Modi should show the gumption to crack the whip. Having an absolute majority in the Parliament and four-and-a-half years to go, he can afford to do. Even so, time and again, he has reiterated his commitment to do things in the overall national interest even if it leads to a political backlash. Hence, he should go ahead.

11,22-1-20,The enigma named Putin,"What the Russian Premier needs is a position that gives him the final say when big changes loom but lets him abjure from daily exercise of power

Five years ago somebody posted photographs on the internet showing a man who looked a lot like Vladimir Putin in photographs from 1920 and 1941. In both shots he was in military uniform, defending the interests of the Russian people then as he still does today. But how can this be? He wasn’t even born until 1952. So the wave of faux speculation starts that Putin is an immortal hero who returns at intervals to save Russia. Or maybe just that he’s an immortal vampire. At any rate, he’ll be around forever. It was nonsense then and it’s nonsense now.

Last week the Russian President announced a wave of constitutional reforms and the vast majority of foreign observers, especially in the West, immediately jumped to the conclusion that Putin is changing the system so that he can stay in power forever. Twenty-five years in power (his current term as President expires in 2024) is not enough for Putin, the foreign pundits insist. He can’t risk leaving power, they explain, or Russians would start asking where his vast illicit wealth came from. And then the pundits spin off into lengthy tirades about how he is Evil Incarnate, even comparing him to Joseph Stalin, who ruled the old Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. Stalin was a mass murderer without a conscience. Nobody was safe from his paranoia: He even killed most of the other heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution. He was probably responsible for the deaths of ten million Russians.

And Vladimir Putin? Here’s the opinion of Simon Tisdall, columnist and former foreign editor of The Guardian: “Like Stalin, (Putin) has made many enemies and caused untold misery....cronyism and corruption on a vast scale...military aggression and disruption abroad.....Again like Stalin, retirement is not a safe option for the ex-KGB spy who normalised assassination as a modern-day tool of state policy.”

Where to start? Perhaps with the obvious point that Stalin killed tens of thousands for every death that can be attributed to Putin. Moreover, corruption in Putin’s Russia is far less than it was in the 1990s under the first post-Communist President, the Western-backed Boris Yeltsin, a drunken puppet who made ordinary Russians cringe.

“Military aggression and disruption abroad?” Guilty as charged, in the illegal restoration of Crimea to Russian control (though most people in Crimea welcomed it) and in backing anti-Government rebels in two provinces of eastern Ukraine. But there is a litany of Western invasions and military interventions (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Serbia, Syria, Yemen) that didn’t meet the highest legal standards either and had equally messy outcomes. Nor do Western Governments lag behind on the assassination front.

More importantly, Russia’s western border is a 1,000 km east of where it was in 1914. It is a minimum of 300 km east of where it was as recently as 1991. Putin has not challenged that new frontier once (with the partial exception of Ukraine) in 21 years in office. You could have a much more frightening and disruptive person than Putin in the Kremlin.

The old KGB was a ruthless organisation but also a rational and realistic one. Putin is a man steeped in that tradition, not an adventurer or a fantasist, and we should probably be grateful for that. So what are the odds that he will still be running things after 2024? He will be 72 years old in 2024: Definitely time to start thinking about what happens after he’s gone. And I’m going to make a bold assumption here: That he is a Russian patriot. Being Russian means that he fears disorder above all else: Russians sometimes call themselves “Italians of the North” and they don’t mean it in a good way. So he wants a strong state, run with a firm hand, even after he has retired, which means that a clear and orderly succession is very important. However, living on under somebody else’s firm hand is not an attractive prospect for Putin. He may or may not have fabulous sums of stolen money tucked away — the evidence for that is unclear — but you make a lot of enemies in a quarter-century in power and they could hurt you badly after you have relinquished it. So what Putin needs is a position that gives him the final constitutional say when big changes loom but lets him withdraw from the daily exercise of power. Something like the chairmanship of a strengthened State Council that can overrule both President and Prime Minister when necessary (but does so very rarely). And lo! That appears to be exactly what he has in mind. The details of his proposed reforms are not yet clear but a weaker President, a stronger Prime Minister and a State Council presiding serenely from afar are all part of the package. I’m not saying that’s what will actually happen, but I think it’s what he’d like to happen.

12,22-1-20,Unlock the Capital’s economic potential,"Regularising unauthorised colonies is a long-standing issue that needs to be resolved soon because not only will it benefit the people living in these areas but will also add to the Government’s coffers and provide an entry point for residents into the formal financial markets

Delhi’s urban planning policies have been characterised by the inability of the agencies concerned to facilitate adequate supply of affordable, formal housing stock for its residents. As a result, informal housing has crept up across large parts of the national Capital. Unauthorised Colonies (UACs) are one form of such informal housing categories and have grown at an unprecedented rate — from 110 in 1961, to nearly 1,800 colonies today. These UACs cater largely to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low Income Groups (LIG) that reside in the city.

While numerous efforts have been made to regularise these colonies to address problems emanating from their informality, the situation has barely improved. This has been a result of institutional multiplicity coupled with the political motives of elected representatives at various levels.

Political establishments target the UAC population for garnering votes and make promises about regularisation and development. However, once elected, they fail to deliver on them.

In 2008, just before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the then Central Government issued a notification to regularise UACs and invited applications from these colonies. However, the process went nowhere post applications.

This time, the Narendra Modi-led BJP Government at the Centre, close to the Delhi Assembly elections in February 8, has passed a Bill in the Parliament to confer ownership rights on 40 lakh people living in unauthorised colonies. In this regard, Prime Minister Modi addressed a rally in New Delhi and said, “We took the initiative to do the work which many previous Governments did not do.”

As per the Bill, these rights will be conferred for built-up plots as well as vacant plots on payment of nominal charges.

Subsequently, any owner of a 100 sq mt residential plot in an unauthorised colony will have to pay at least `19,980 (depending on the zone in which the colony falls) to acquire the ownership certificate. This addresses the affordability concern in case of the UAC population while attempting to recover the land cost from the residents of these colonies.

This measure can have positive benefits for the city’s economy. Implementing this notification can provide an entry point for the residents into the formal financial markets. This affirmed ownership can enable property owners to seek collateral against their houses. Such a move is expected to add around 800,000 potential customers to the housing loans market, providing the necessary push to the national Capital’s economy.

With the registration of UAC households, the decision is likely to boost further formal transactions, hence adding to the Government’s stamp duty revenue.

However, the Bill does not offer any clarity on the status of transaction of a plot/house/property in the existing colony. This clarity is important to solve the issue of creating a formal and affordable housing market in these colonies. In the absence of clear information, it may be assumed that with the conferment of the ownership rights to a UAC plot owner, the subsequent registration of sale deed will take place at the conventional circle rates of the colony.

In this case, the resident living in an UAC household acquires the ownership rights of a 100 sq mt plot for at least `19,980; however he/she would be selling the same property for `1.6 crore, based on conventional circle rates.

This begs the question — do properties in these localities really merit this price, given the inadequate infrastructure? In this regard, to maintain a balanced buyer-seller dynamics, policymakers should reconsider the transaction prices for these households. Without this necessary revision, it is possible that these prices create an excess supply condition and consequently distort the market.

Another route through which this Bill is likely to inflate the Government’s revenue is through Property Tax obligation for the registered UAC households. Although the notification is silent on the issue of Property Tax collection from these colonies, the forthcoming Bill is likely to offer clarity in this regard. With legal ownership, the UAC residents will be obliged to pay the annual property tax, which will be a significant contributor to its maintenance services.

To reap these possible economic gains from the Bill, it is vital that the implementation of the entire process is not complex. From the perspective of the applicants, the suggested process involves certain tools and techniques that are likely to be beyond their understanding, given their socio-economic profile. Thus, training and awareness would be required to make the programme successful and the Delhi Government must take the lead on it by substantiating the need for institutional coordination.

Discussions with a few residents of UACs in Delhi have brought out that given their past experience, residents are still apprehensive about the actual implementation of the Bill and have not gone ahead with the application process on the online portal. In some cases, people are not even aware of the procedural requirement.

This is reflected by the fact that there are only a handful of applications on the DDA’s portal —166 out of around 800,000 households in the city. Against this pessimistic situation, it is imperative that for the desired success rate of this policy, volunteers are appointed to assist the UAC residents in the process. As of now, there are only 25 help desks and they are very unlikely to serve the purpose of efficiently facilitating the process.

Effective implementation of this proposed policy can unlock the substantial economic potential of the city’s land and housing markets.

The issue of UACs in Delhi has gone on for far too long and it is high time that it gets resolved for better economic outcomes. Whether the vicious circle around policy implementation for unauthorised colonies — with vote bank politics being the central point — will be broken this time around is likely to get clear after the Delhi Assembly elections.

13,22-1-20,Chicago varsity roped in to develop data centre,"In another step towards actualisation of Mo Sarakar and 5-T approaches, the State Government has envisioned developing a Data Policy Innovation Centre (DPIC) in technical collaboration with the University of Chicago.

It was revealed at a meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy at the Lok Seva Bhawan here on Tuesday. Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment Principal Secretary Saurabh Garg outlined utility of a DPIC. The theme expert from the University of Chicago presented different contours of DPIC with its technical and application possibilities.

The Chief Secretary directed to lay out the proposal in convergence with existing systems. The meeting gave in-principle approval for use of ‘big data’ in formation of innovative policies and service delivery.

A DPIC can serve as a center of excellence for accumulation of ‘big data’ from different sources through cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence, analyse such data using modern econometrics and statistical models and come out with required innovative policy guides.

It can create a framework for collaborative work between Government departments and faculty of the Chicago University on select policy areas to design new solutions and evaluate its field outcome.

There is a wide scope for use of ‘big data’ in various sectors of governance. The principal potential areas outlined in the meeting include improving water and energy use policies, encouraging crop diversification through information on potential yield and farming technique, reducing pollution through predictive targeting models, improving learning outcomes, reducing distributive loss of power through strategic enforcement and behavioral changes.

Development Commissioner Suresh Chandra Mohapatra, APC and ACS Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, Finance Principal Ashok Kumar Meena, School and Mass Education Minister Chitra Arumgam, Electronics and IT Secretary Manoj Mishra and Dr Anant Sudarshan from University of Chicago participated in the discussion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chicago-varsity-roped-in-to-develop-data-centre.html
14,22-1-20,"N’rangpur rape, murder: NHRC seeks ATR from DM, SP","The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought an action-taken report (ATR) from the Nabarangpur district Collector and Superintendent of Police (SP) over the kidnapping, gangrape and murder of a minor tribal girl on December 14, 2019 in the district.

The NHRC has asked the report to be submitted within four weeks by February 21.

The 16-year-old tribal girl, who had gone missing from home, was found murdered after being gangraped in Gumundoli village under the Kosagumuda police station in Nabarangpur district on December 14. The incident showed that law and order situation has collapsed in the State with an alarming spurt in cases of rape and murder of women, alleged Tripathy.

On December 13 night, at around 8 pm, the girl had gone out of her house to attend nature’s call since the family does not have a toilet. When she did not return till late night, the girl’s parents searched for her but in vain. On December 14 morning, some villagers while going towards paddy fields, about 500 metre away, found the girl’s body and informed her family members and police.

Her body bore multiple injury marks and police found two jeans trousers from the spot. The girl was studying in Kotpad school but dropped out in Class X. Her father and sister are working as daily labourers in the area.

The Nirbhaya Guidelines have not been followed by the State, the petition pointed out.

This is a classic case of failure of entire State machinery and the State police. Negligence and failure of the Government authorities in acting over the issue of implementing Nirbhaya Guidelines, ensuring mental health and ensuring toilets and benefits of social welfare schemes and strict adherence thereof pose serious question of human rights, Tripathy alleged.

He also demanded a compensation of Rs 1 crore to be paid to the victim’s family.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/n---rangpur-rape--murder--nhrc-seeks-atr-from-dm--sp.html

16,22-1-20,"Now, dolphins sighted in new areas of Chilika","A large number of endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have been sighted in new areas of the Chilika lake, according to officials. The total number dolphins counted in the annual census on Sunday was 146, said Chilika Development Authority Chief Executive Officer Susant Nanda.

He said the good news is that dolphins are now sighted in new areas like the central and southern sectors of the lake, which is spread over 1,165 sqkm in three districts of Khordha, Puri and Ganjam.

“The areas near Kalijai Island and Rambha are the new places where dolphins have been sighted for the first time. Earlier, they were mostly confined to the Satpada area near Brahmagiri,” Nanda said, adding that the dolphin population in the lake is now stabilising above 150 as expected. Last year’s census showed that there were 151 dolphins.

“We are also optimistic about an increase in dolphin population in the lake in next couple of years,” Nanda said, adding that there is enough sign of dolphins migrating from the Satpada side to other areas within the lagoon.

Apart from Satpada, dolphins have this time been spotted in five other places, three around Kalijai Island within the lake and two close to Samal, he said. Wildlife experts opine that the dolphin sighting in new areas is possible due to clearing of prawn gheries from within the lake.

Apart from the annual census, the CDA also undertakes dolphin counting by using hydrophones. In the hydrophone method, a microphone is used to record or listen to underwater sound. This method of counting has indicated that the highest 20 to 25 number of dolphins are found near Rajhans Island followed by Magarmukh and Malatikuda, 17 to 20 each.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/now--dolphins-sighted-in-new-areas-of-chilika.html
17,22-1-20,Many Jharsuguda farmers yet to get tokens,"Over 1,000 farmers under four cooperative societies of Kolabira block in Jharsuguda district have not got tokens for last two months to sell their paddy, triggering resentment among them.

Now, tokens are given online from Bhubaneswar. But due to non-supply of tokens from Bhubaneswar, farmers are not able to sell their paddy. The farmers are showing displeasure against the cooperative secretaries who are helpless in the matter.

Sources revealed that four cooperative societies were functioning at Kolabira, Samasingha, Jhillipali and Paramanpur in Kolabira block. A total 64,768 quintsl paddy was purchased till January 15 from 1,274 farmers through the societies. In Kolabira samiti 14,912 quintal paddy has been purchased from 296 farmers against target of 17,900 quintal given to the society. Now, 326 farmers are in waiting list for token. Likewise against a target of 13,500 quintal to Paramanpur samiti, 11,151 quintal paddy has been purchased from 256 farmers till January 15. Still more than 200 farmers are waiting to get tokens. In Samasingha samiti, 21,710 quintal paddy has been purchased from 396 farmers against a target of 23,100 quintal for the samiti. Till now, more than 200 farmers are in the waiting list to receive tokens.

Ironically, though 90 per cent target is said to have been fulfilled in the cooperative societies, yet many farmers are not having of tokens to sell their paddy.

Against a target of 72,400 quintal paddy, 64,768 quintal paddy has already been purchased. The farmers are passing through many financial crisis. They are also preparing for staging protests in front of cooperative societies in near future , said executive member of State BJP farmers forum Arun Behera.

Besides, Kolabira Samiti secretary Debraj Kumura said that secretaries had no role in the supply of tokens to the farmers.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had visited the Panchayat to take stock of the situation and had sanctioned crores of rupees for relief and restoration works. However, it’s really shocking to know about the living condition of Manikapatna villagers of Gangabada Panchayat, where minimum amenities are a far cry.

The Gangabada Panchayat is on border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The villagers are staying in darkness as power is yet to be restored to the area. As the village is situated in a mountain top, it gets dark very soon and it has been more than a year the villagers have been staying without electricity.

Nearly 45 families comprising about 150 members are residing in Manikapatna village. Some area of the village is under the Odisha Government and some part under Andhra Government. The houses constructed under Andhra Government area have electricity but the houses under Odisha do not have electricity, During Titli, the Andhra Pradesh Government provided electricity and all kinds of facilities to the people of the same village within a short frame of time. The Odisha Government also provided electricity to the people of the same village in March 2019 but within a few days the electrical transformer got burnt.

Both Christians and Hindus are residing in the village. When the whole world celebrated Christmas with lights, ironically darkness had not lifted from Manikapatna village.

The Hindu families of the village celebrated Bhogi and Pongal festivals recently on January 14 and 15 under same situation.

Though the villagers have ventilated their grievances to the district administration but have got no relief yet. On September 16 last, a Grievance Cell was held at Gangabada Panchayat Office in the presence of the Gajapati district Collector, The villagers demanded immediate steps to restore electricity by installation of a new transformer.

SouthCo Executive Engineer Gangagouri Prasad Patnaik had assured that very soon a new transformer would be installed. However, it’s been more than four months and the promise is not fulfilled.

Notably, it’s seen that in an Odisha Government electric pole, an AP Government streetlight has been fitted providing light for the Manikapatna villagers. The children are dependent on the street light for their exam preparations.

The villagers meanwhile have warned of taking to streets if electricity was not resumed in the locality soon.

23,22-1-20,"Stop, if your words, acts, thoughts offend others","There is always a line, everywhere, suggesting ‘do not cross’. It is individually, culturally, socially, legally defined. And it is not fixed. It differs for all those definitions, depending upon where, when and who has set it.

Lines have been described for centuries as borders, boundaries, limits, the tipping point, ‘that’s it and no more’; all have meanings far greater than one thinks.

The Ramayana, great Hindu epic, has it as a key feature, Lakshmana’s three lines for Sita. Did interwoven stories of Mahabharata have a line or many lines? What about other scriptures, religious, social and legal texts? There are so many examples. And new lines are formed each day, limits are being set.

But then people cross it, for various reasons, sometimes just to enjoy the thrill. Many experience the consequences; many people escape and get away with it. Some cross it as an urge to do the opposite of what has been asked, suggested, advised. As a revolt or foolishly, some attempt to cross without any meaning and reason. But some do it deliberately, knowingly, as bravado that they can do it, they can do something that others dare not. They do not take ‘no’ as ‘no’. They do not stop at lines. What do you do with them, the ones who cross the line, knowing that they should not?

Crossing the line offends, irritates, disturbs people. It tests the patience; even the tolerance has a limit. Sometime tolerance gives away to explosion, more destruction, to many unintended consequences.

Often it seems, people tolerate, they do not react or respond. But it does not mean they allow or find it acceptable. Silences do not mean affirmation or ‘yes’. Sometime they do not want to be the first to point out, or lose their polite demeanour, or be rude, or simply they do not know how to respond. Some do become just spectators and recede more troubled, even traumatised.

Lines have meanings. They are there for a reason. They may be appropriate or inappropriate based on whichever side you are looking it from. Lines are crossed and violated. They are attempted to be crossed with reason or without it. And it may or may not be possible to do anything about it, based on who, what and where you are. Lines are moved, redefined, but they are not erased. Protest, if you must, but be within the line, because beyond this, you are affecting others.

Where do you stop? Where to draw the line for yourself? How to know what’s the real line you should not cross. There is just one golden rule, to clear away all the confusions. Remember to stop before your words,acts, and even thoughts affect another person negatively. That’s your line. Stop there.

26,22-1-20,"Centre wants to enhance financing to OBCs, SHGs","While the Odisha Government has approached the Union Government to conduct socioeconomic caste enumeration along with the general census, the Centre has decided to enhance financing of Other Backward Class (OBC) beneficiaries.

The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) has informed the State Government about its decision to enhance financing of SC and OBC beneficiaries and Self Help Groups.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has recently approached the Centre to go for socio economic caste census either by inserting suitable columns in the Census format or by prescribing separate format for a simultaneous enumeration of SEBCs/OBCs.

Union Secretary, Social Justice and Empowerment R Subrahmanyam has informed the decision of the Government of India for enhancing financing of SC and OBC beneficiaries and SHGs to ensure speedier economic improvement of these people who face multiple deprivation.

While SHG model with proper implementation has shown highest potential of poverty reduction, the Union Government is now showing interest in strengthening SHGs with enhancing finance to them.

Odisha has been in the forefront of promoting SHGs, especially women SHGs, which has made significant impact on the economical up-gradation of the people living in poverty.

In fact, the Odisha Government has decided to extend Government business worth Rs 5,000 crore through SHGs, which will improve the fiscal status of the members of these groups.

Now, the Government of India following the Odisha Government's footsteps is harping on scaling up of financing these organisations along with the other beneficiaries of SC and OBC.

The SHGs will be provided credit with 4-5 per cent interest, while beneficiaries will be given loan at 6-8 per cent interest, said a senior official of the

MoSJE.

Financing will be provided through National Scheduled Caste Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC) and National Backward Classes Finance Development Corporation (NBCFDC).

The Government of India has decided to expand the operations of both NSFDC and NBCFDC significantly to bring more beneficiaries under coverage. More people will be able to take up economic activities so that within next five years they will be out of poverty, said the officer.

Now the State Government will have to identify the beneficiaries and SHGs who will reap the benefits of the Union Government decision. Systematic identification is needed to be carried out by both Urban Development and Panahcyati Raj Department to enable beneficiaries from both urban and rural areas, said sources.

The State Government will have to look at the market demand while finding out the projects that will be sustainable and beneficial for the beneficiaries.

Concessional financing to be routed through NSFDC and NBCFDC will be channelised through SC and OBC Finance Corporations of the State Government or Regional Rural Bank (RRB) as identified by the State administration, said sources.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/centre-wants-to-enhance-financing-to-obcs--shgs.html

He said that institution of Lokayukt is very necessary for fighting corruption in the State which is immersed in the corruption.

Dhasmana said that institution of Lokayukt is necessary to investigate this case where son of the BJP MLA has gobbled up scholarships worth Rs five Crores.

In the audio, Bhandari while talking to a woman is ostensibly saying that both BJP and Brahmins should be prevented from coming to the power. The audio evoked strong reaction from various quarters with BJP going on an attacking mode on the Congress party on the issue.

Talking to The Pioneer, Bhandari said that the audio is doctored and is being circulated with an objective to malign his image. “In my political and social life I have worked for all sections of the society and have never discriminated on the basis of caste and religion. It is a ploy by the BJP to tarnish my image,’’ he said.

it. Criticising the BJP for making an issue of the audio, she said that the party has no moral authority to talk on the matter.

Dasauni said that the BJP should first take cognizance of plethora of objectionable audios and videos against its leaders.

“BJP should comment on the viral video of OSD of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, highly objectionable comments made by BJP leader Vinay Goyal against SCs, the audio clip in which BJP MLA Surendra Singh Jeena is offering favour to a person in lieu of support and the clips of Rajkumar Thukral,’’ she said.

39,22-1-20,CAPT DARES SAD TO QUIT ALLIANCE AT CENTRE ON CAA,"Rejecting the Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) claims linking Delhi poll decision with Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as “ludicrous”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday challenged the Akalis to walk the talk and quit alliance at the Centre to prove their sincerity with regard to the “unconstitutional legislation”, which they were party to passing in both Houses of Parliament.

Capt Amarinder ridiculed SAD’s claim that it had chosen not to contest the Delhi Assembly polls due to differences with BJP over the CAA asking “why don’t you (Akalis) walk the talk and show the people of India that you really stand against the divisive and destructive CAA?”

He urged the SAD Ministers in the Union Cabinet to immediately resign in support of their stated stand on the controversial legislation, that had evoked widespread nationwide protests from all sections of the society.

“If you found the CAA to be anti-Muslim, why did you support and pass the legislation in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha?” Capt Amarinder asked the Akalis, adding that the vociferous support extended by SAD to the legislation in the Parliament was a matter of record.

Pointing out that Delhi was the second state, after Haryana, where the SAD had decided not to go with their ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Chief Minister said that their claim that they had decided against contesting the Delhi polls on account of differences on CAA was preposterous and unacceptable.

“The decision to opt out of the Delhi elections is clearly motivated by political compulsions as the SAD had evidently realized that it had no ground support and could not win even a single seat in the national capital,” he said adding that perhaps, the BJP was not ready to give them what they wanted in terms of seats, prompting them to look for a graceful way out of the situation.

Taking a dig at the SAD leadership, including party chief Sukhbir Badal and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, over their spate of contradictory and conflicting statements on CAA, the Chief Minister said that the Akalis did not have a principled stand on this major issue of national importance.

“Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s claim that the party had been under pressure to review its stand on CAA is ludicrous, to say the least, considering the discordant notes the Akalis had been striking on the issue for the past several days,” he added.

No wonder the SAD was in a shambles, having lost all ground support in Punjab (purportedly their stronghold), and also facing severe internal discord that threatened to split the party down the centre, Capt Amarinder remarked.

The Chief Minister advised the Akalis to stop trying to befool the people with their bogus claims and contrarian stand on such a sensitive and critical issue, on which the nation’s future depended. “You cannot expect people to believe that you are serious when you continue to stand with the BJP in Parliament and in the government at the Centre,” he added.

SUKHBIR ASKS CM TO CLARIFY IF HE OPPOSES CAA TO GIVE RELIEF TO PERSECUTED SIKHS

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Tuesday asked Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to clarify if he was opposed to giving relief to persecuted Sikhs under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and whether he was fighting to get the entire Act rejected to end the relief given to Sikhs under CAA.

“By opposing CAA, the Chief Minister is opposing the relief given to Sikhs under the Act. This does nothing except fulfill the anti-Sikh agenda of the Congress party,” he said.

Sukhbir said that if Capt Amarinder is really serious about giving relief to persecuted Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan with recent figures of the Pak human rights themselves stating that 1000 Hindu or Sikh girls were abducted and forcibly married off to Muslim men, he should join SAD in seeking inclusion of Muslims in the CAA.

Sukhbir said that SAD voted in favour of the Citizen Amendment Bill to save the Sikhs. “We, however, recorded our dissent with me demanding that Muslims also be included in the new Act. We have stuck to our stand and have preferred to forsake contesting the Delhi assembly elections rather than give up our principled stand on this issue,” he said.

Stating that the SAD did not need any lessons on how to react to a situation from a “failed” Chief Minister, the SAD president said that Akali Dal, on its part, would continue its struggle to get Muslims included in the ambit of CAA and would continue to use the good offices of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal also for this purpose.

He said that the party had, simultaneously, made it clear that it was against National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Sukhbir said that it was understandable that Capt Amarinder could not comprehend what it meant to stand by principles.

“It is a fact that the Sikh community of Delhi has put forward a demand to contest from eight seats in the forthcoming assembly elections. The party considered the demand but decided that it must champion the cause of all minorities and not only members of its own community,” he said.

AAP SAYS SAD OPTED OUT OF DELHI POLLS FOR HARSIMRAT'S MINISTERIAL BERTH

A day after the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) decided against contesting the Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday asserted that the Akali Dal opted out of Delhi polls to ‘protect’ Badal bahu’s ministerial berth.

Senior AAP leader and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema described the clarification being given by the Badals on the visible rift between the SAD (Badal) and the BJP long standing alliance as the height of double standards of the Badals.

“Even though it is an internal matter of the BJP and the SAD (Badal), the plausible reason cited by the Badal and party invoking the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), is far from the ground reality,” said Cheema adding that the SAD’s stand on the CAA, NCR or NPR was categorically clear when it came for discussion on the floor of the Parliament.

Cheema said that both Sukhbir and his wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal (both MPs) had voted in favor of the CAA. He accused the Badal couple of maintaining double standards, saying that they favored the CAA in the Parliament and back home in Punjab, were shedding crocodile tears to exhibit their abiding love for the Muslim community.

Cheema alleged that SAD’s “public announcement” was nothing but a mere political gambit to save Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal's ministerial berth.

“The dubious role of the Badals on the controversial Act in the Parliament as also in Punjab Assembly has brought forth their dual face,” he said.

Speaking in the inaugural session of 2-day orientation programme for the training of MLAs organized by Haryana Vidhan Sabha in association with Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE), Lok Sabha Secretariat, Khattar also asked them to work with the Statesman’s spirit and works towards the betterment of future generations and not limiting themselves to just five years.

The Chief Minister also suggested that to motivate elected representatives to work better, best MLA award should be given every year on the pattern of best parliamentarian awards being conferred on the Members of Parliament for their outstanding contributions. He said this award should be given to those MLAs who exhibit good conduct in the house and also maintain dignity while raising issues of public interest.

Khattar also suggested that as on several occasions Bill of various departments are not properly discussed in the Vidhan Sabha, the draft of these Bill should be sent to the MLAs 5-7 days earlier so that they could thoroughly study the same. He urged the MLAs to give constructive suggestions in the House and assured that while bringing any amendment, adequate time would be given to them for debate.

Khattar said elected representatives should keep themselves abreast with any changes and amendments in the law and acts so as to keep themselves updated, adding that they should study the procedures and Rules of Vidhan Sabha and come to the House with full preparation.

Earlier, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said each MLA should understand their responsibility and work towards the welfare of people of the State. He said that the Haryana Vidhan Sabha should enact such Act and Rules which could become a role model in the country.

Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the aim of this training programme is to train the MLAs to discharge their services to the society more efficiently and also ensure their skill development. He urged the elected representatives to study the issues before raising them in the House as it would significantly help in saving the precious time of Vidhan Sabha.

Out of the 90 MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha, nine are women, 44 are those who have been elected for the first time and 46 are those who have been elected more than once.

41,22-1-20,SAD-BJP alliance in jeopardy,"Decades old alliance between the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is in jeopardy with the Akalis virtually severing their ties with the saffron brigade in the national capital on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The echo of SAD’s action may eventually be heard in Punjab with the second breakup between the two parties — first being in Haryana after the BJP joined hands with the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) while dropping the Akali Dal ahead 2019 polls.

The reason for the Delhi break up being cited by the SAD is ideological differences between the two over the CAA-National Register of Citizens (NRC). But the political observers believed that there is much more to it.

SAD has been contesting on four Sikh-dominated assembly seats in Delhi since 2013, when the Akali Dal entered the electoral fray in the national capital. In 2015 elections, SAD fielded its two candidates on BJP election symbol — lotus, and two on its own party symbol — weighing scales.

However, this time, the party was adamant on fielding its candidates on its own party symbol, besides demanding more seats — a demand not agreed upon by the BJP, which eventually announced to contest Delhi polls in alliance with Janta Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) with no mention of the SAD.

The development appears to being sync with the BJP’s nationwide policy of not giving too much weightage to its allies after emerging powerful during the past few years — parting ways with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, joining hands with JJP in Haryana despite holding talks with the Akali Dal, are major instances.

This comes close on the heels of Punjab BJP leaders’ demand of giving the saffron party a larger share in the state politics.

What was a whisper in the BJP corridors since long was heard loud and clear during Ashwani Sharma’s taking-over ceremony as the state unit president on Friday at Jalandhar.

Party’s senior leaders, including former Minister Master Mohan Lal, Madan Mohan Mittal, former state unit president Rajinder Bhandari, had minced no words to say that the BJP should contest on more number of seats than SAD and play the role of “big brother” which is currently being played by the Akali Dal.

Mittal, BJP veteran, had proposed that the party should contest on 59 seats out of the total 117, leaving 58 for the SAD.

Still holding the same view, Mittal said that the party leaders have conveyed to the high command that workers were not satisfied with contesting just 23 seats in Punjab.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-bjp-alliance-in-jeopardy.html
42,22-1-20,Punjab Congress committees dissolved,"Congress central leadership, it seems, is keen on consolidating the party’s position in the states ruled by it, Punjab included. The interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s direct intervention in the state affairs became apparent with the dissolution of the Punjab Pradesh and District Congress Committees, besides setting up an 11-member coordination panel and a five-member manifesto implementation committee.

The action came a day after Sonia Gandhi held a detailed meeting with Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder, state unit president Sunil Jakhar and state party affairs in-charge Asha Kumari, questing the Government over high power tariff and growing dissidence within the party.

A day after, the party high command dissolved the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee with immediate effect, including the district committees, but retaining Jakhar as the state Congress chief.

“The Congress president has dissolved the state executive committee of Punjab and district Congress committee in the state,” party general secretary KC Venugopal said in a statement.

At the same time, Sonia Gandhi constituted a Coordination Committee, to ensure better coordination between the Congress party and the State Government, headed by All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Punjab Asha Kumari.

“Congress president has constituted a coordination committee for Punjab for better coordination with the party and the government,” an official communication said.

The coordination committee will have Chief Minister Capt Amarinder and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar as its members, besides AICC general secretary Ambika Soni.

Besides them, the panel would also have Punjab Cabinet Ministers Charanjit Singh Channi, Sunder Sham Arora, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Vijay Inder Singla, as its members along with PPCC general secretary Capt Sandeep Singh Sandhu and AICC secretaries Kuljit Nagra and Gurkirat Kotli as its members.

The committee was announced after the Congress interim chief had cleared the names after holding deliberations with Capt Amarinder and senior party leaders a day before.

The party high command had, on Monday, announced similar committees for Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry which are all under Congress rule.

Besides, the high command has also set up a Manifesto Implementation Committee in Punjab, to be headed by the former Union Minister P Chidambaram.

Congress-led Punjab Government, which is set to complete its three years in March, is being targeted by the opposition for its failure to fulfill its pre-promises including eliminating drug menace, fame loan waiver, employment, unemployment allowance and mobile phones, cancelling power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private players, punishing culprits of sacrilege, among others.

Congress high command had, a day before, expressed its concern over the growing voices on the issue of costly electricity in Punjab. It has been learnt that the first question Sonia Gandhi had asked the Chief Minister in the meeting was on why the power is so expensive in Punjab for which Capt Amarinder blamed the previous SAD-BJP regime.

Chief Minister assured the party chief that the Government was working on resolving the issue, and soon its positive results will come out. During the meeting, Jakhar also described the power tariff issue as “big”.

It has been learnt that Monday’s meeting was held in two phases — one with the entire sate leadership, and another with Capt Amarinder alone. It was in one-to-one meeting between the two when Capt Amarinder raised the issue of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s “outburst” against him and the State Government.

Although it was not clear what assurances Sonia Gandhi gave to Capt Amarinder, it is believed that he was satisfied with the “favourable” meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-congress-committees-dissolved.html

Shahdeo claimed that the selection of ministers and allocation of portfolios is the prerogative of Chief Minister, but the way in which

Congress is exerting pressure on Chief Minister for getting plum portfolios is condemnable.

Shahdeo said that the BJP is making members going to houses asking people to become party members by giving missed call, but Congress Government is operating from virtual world.

Chief Minister is giving orders on Twitter as he is busy attending Delhi Durbar.

The Cabinet has not been formed till date despite government enjoying full mandate as there is pressure tactics from Congress.

The BJP leader claimed that two members of Congress took oath during Kharmas, but on the issue of Cabinet expansion the Congress leaders say that it will take place after Kharmas.

47,22-1-20,JVM (P) expels Tirkey for ‘anti-party’ activities,"Amid reports of merger of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) with BJP, the party on Tuesday expelled its Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey for anti-party activities. Tirkey, is one the party leaders, who has openly criticised party’s unconfirmed merger plan with BJP.

Announcing the expulsion of Bandhu Tirkey from JVM, party’s principal general secretary, Abhay Kumar said, “Bandhu Tirkey has been accused of indulging in anti-party activities, due to which he has been expelled from party. Tirkey, in last Assembly election, had worked for Congress candidate Ajay Nath Shahdeo contesting from Hatia, when party’s official candidate Shobha Yadav too was contesting the election from same constituency.”

Singh said Tirkey was issued show cause notice on January 17 and was given 48 hours for giving reply, but even after passing of more than 72 hours the Mandar MLA failed to give explanation.

However, Bandhu Tirkey termed his expulsion as undemocratic and unconstitutional claiming that after receiving show-cause notice his representative had gone to JVM office for submitting the reply, but in the office there was no one to receive his reply.

Tirkey further said, “The JVM had expelled me from party without any substance. The party had not checked the facts before expulsion.” According to Tirkey, the picture on which his expulsion was plotted is of month of May when he had gone to campaign for Congress candidate Subodh Kant Sahay during Lok Sabha election. In the picture he is shown with Congress leader Ajay Nath Shahdeo.

Tirkey said, “The Assembly election was held in December, when the State was witnessing severe cold, but in the pictures it is clearly seen that none of them attending the meet wearing winter clothes.” Sources said that with expelling Tirkey from party, the JVM had given pace to talks of merger of party with BJP. Tirkey along with another party legislator Pradeep Yadav had opposed the merger of JVM with Saffron party.

On January 17 Babulal Marandi constituted new working committee leaving Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey without any important posts. Both Yadav and Tirkey had found place in 151 member working committee, without any important posts.

Meanwhile, Tirkey after his expulsion reached Pradeep Yadav’s residence. Yadav too termed Tirkey expulsion as unconstitutional saying that he should have been given time. Sources said that as JVM is preparing the plot for merger of party with BJP it doesn’t want any technical hitches in merger.

Meanwhile, Congress offered both Tirkey and Yadav to join the party. Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu said, “If the two leaders decide to join Congress party than they are welcome but the final decision on their induction will be taken by party central high command.” A senior JVM leader on condition of anonymity said, “JVM merger with BJP is certain.

The delay is mainly due to process and formalities, which has to be taken ahead of merger. As Marandi is not single person who has join BJP but entire party is to be merged a lot of process is to be taken ahead of merger.” Sources said that it is win-win situation both for Marandi and BJP if both parties decide to join hands.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm--p--expels-tirkey-for----anti-party----activities.html

The RJD protest was also attended by Satyanand Bhokta the lone RJD minister in Hemant Soren Cabinet. Bhokta said, “The Modi government has failed on all sectors especially on economic sector. The government to divert the attention of people from real issue such as unemployment and inflation is misleading people on CAA, NRC.”

Sources said that RJD is taking out protest against CAA, NRC to gain its lost ground in Jharkhand especially among minority community.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has made food safety training and certification mandatory for all food traders in the City.

As per a directive issued by Sub Divisional Officer Lokesh Mishra, street food vendors caught selling any food items without undergoing the training programme will have their license cancelled. The training programme started on December 24 and is being imparted at IACT near Guru Nanak School.

However, street vendors in popular market areas are not aware of any such programme. While some are keen to receive training others don’t want to lose out on business because of it.

Santosh, a food truck owner in Morabadi was unaware of any such notice being issued. “I don’t have any information about the training programme and no notice has been given by the authorities till now. However, there is a lot of competition so if I do go for the training, I will lose out on the day’s business.”

Savan, a momo stall owner is not too keen to be a part of the training. “I have not heard of any such training programme. I am already trained in my work and have worked in a hotel earlier before opening this stall, so I don’t need any more training whatever it is.

The progamme will be of around four hours with about 40 food vendors in one batch. Under the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) there are about 500 food vans and more than 10,000 food carts set up. The food department has set of target of training about 9,000 such vendors in the first phase.

“The main objective of this project is to ensure that healthy and hygienic food is what reaches the customers. The FOSTAC- Food Safety Training Certification trainers will impart training to manufacturers, whole sellers, retailers, meat shop owners and street food vendors.

Under this an annual health check up is also included to ensure that they do not have any communicable diseases,” said Food Safety Officer (FSO) Dr SS Kullu.

The training will include information about packaging, serving clean food, and storing perishables in a proper way. Trainers will also impart information about the proper use of organic food colour, ways to reuse and recycle cooking oil.

The district administration and the department in an attempt to reach out to food vendors and suppliers is conducting a mobilization drive and localities covered include Chutiya, Kanke and Hinoo.

The programme is divided in three categories.

The basic and advanced courses are charged at Rs 600 and Rs 800 respectively while for the street food vendors it is for free.

Dr Kullu further added that registrations for the course can be done online and offline.

It is, however, unclear whether Roy will seek registration of the organization as a political party under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, or stick to his current stand of running it as an independent, non-political, welfare organization.

“It will be too early to comment on whether the organization will have any influence on politics,” said Roy, adding that anything was possible in active politics – possibly a hint that the organization may get involved in politics later.

Roy told media persons in Jamshedpur that the organization will work at booth level in four Assembly constituencies – Jamshedpur East, Jamshedpur West, Jugsalai and Potka. The organization, he said, will appoint conveners, co-conveners and booth level workers for bringing the problems of the grass root to the concerned authorities.

Known for his upright image and the ability to spot lacunae in the system, Roy had severed ties with the BJP after the party did not give him a ticket from Jamshedpur West before the elections last year. He decided to challenge then CM Raghubar Das in the latter’s stronghold, Jamshedpur East and ended up defeating him against all odds with an unexpectedly high margin of over 16,000 votes. After winning the election, Roy had told The Pioneer that he will wage war against all corrupt forces and unravel the corrupt practices of the former Governments here.

The organisation, sources said, could be helpful in identifying the loopholes in the former Government here.

Roy is not the first BJP veteran to have left the party and formed a fresh organization. Jharkhand’s first Chief Minister Babulal Marandi too had left the BJP and formed Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) after conflict of interest with the then BJP leadership. “The purpose of this organization is to serve the people. It will spot micro issues from Jamshedpur and address them,” said Roy.

Former BJP leader Ram Narayan Sharma was made the district convener of BJM while Mukul Mishra and Ajay Kumar Sinha were made convener for Jamshedpur West and Jamshedpur East, respectively. Roy said that he has spoken to officials of local urban bodies, drinking water and sanitation department and the administration to spot the irregularities and address them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/saryu-roy-forms-bjm--an-independent-organisation.html
53,22-1-20,Triple murder shocks steel city,"nA woman, her infant daughter and an unidentified man were found dead under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday morning at her rented home in posh Talpuri locality of Bhilai police said.

Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Lakhan Patle informed the mouths of the deceased woman, identified as Manju Suryavanshi, aged around 25, and the man were sealed with tapes used for packaging and their bodies were partially charred.

The police rounded up the woman's husband, Ravi Sharma, from Rourkela railway station in neighbouring Odisha for questioning on suspicion of his involvement in the offence, they said.

Early this morning, an unidentified person told Suryavanshi's mother over the phone that her daughter and son- in-law were engulfed in flames in their rented flat following which she alerted the police, a senior official said.

The caller had used the mobile phone of the deceased woman to make the call, he said.

Initially, it was thought the man found killed in the flat was Suryavanshi's husband, but later it turned out that he was someone else, the official said, adding efforts were on to ascertain his identity.

“The woman's hands and legs were tied with a rope, while her mouth was sealed with packaging tape. The man’s mouth was also sealed with tape”, he said.

“Their bodies were partially charred, while Suryavanshi's two-month-old daughter seems to have died of suffocation due to smoke that emitted from the blaze in the house”, the official said.

As per preliminary investigation, Suryavanshi, after separating from her first husband a few years ago, married Sharma. She gave birth to her daughter two months ago, the official said.

When the police did not find Sharma in the house, they launched a search for him. The Government Railway Police (GRP) later zeroed on him at a train at Rourkela station, from where he was taken into custody, he said.

A police team has been sent to Rourkela to bring him back to Durg and his interrogation is likely to throw light on the gruesome incident, the official said.

A case of triple murder has been registered and further probe was underway, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/triple-murder-shocks-steel-city.html

Attacking opposition parties for ‘misleading’ people on the CAA, Shah said the new law would not be scrapped despite protests, at a Lucknow rally on Tuesday.

“Shah’s statement only reflected intolerance as the BJP wants to crush people with a road-roller due to its brute majority in Parliament. Playing with basic principles of democracy, the ruling party is making intolerance its identity,” Akhilesh said in a statement issued in Lucknow on Tuesday.

“Protests are going on across the country against the CAA and NRC due to which the BJP had to plan ‘Jan Jagran’ rallies and such programmes,” he said.

The SP chief said that Shah’s address in Lucknow showed his frustration over the growing dissent and his party would not let the BJP-RSS agenda run in the country. He alleged that BJP leaders ignored people’s interest and aspirations due to their “false ego and pride”.

“In both categories, 26,085 people lost their lives. In the country, 1.34 lakh persons ended their lives, including 10,346 from farming sector,” he claimed.

In the incident, two minor girls who are the daughters of the couple have sustained grievous injuries on being attacked by the killer father.

The injured children, Anita (5) and Sunita (3), were rushed to the MGM Medical College Hospital by the kin of the murdered couple identified as Rajiv Tiu (42) and wife Budhni (37).

The incident has taken place in the room of Rajiv Tiu's house and all the injured were taken to MGM Medical College Hospital, while the couple, Rajiv and Budhni were declared brought dead.

71,22-1-20,Tribal culture takes centrestage at Tusu Mela,"The participation at the annual Tusu mela organised at Gopal Maidan is growing in leaps and bounds every year. Organised by Jharkhandwasi Ekta Manch, the footfall crossed over thousand people this year.

Leaders on Tuesday called for tribal unity at the annual Tusu mela organised at Gopal Maidan. They said that the tribal needs to unite to work for their welfare.

The former Jamshedpur MP, late Sunil Mahto, started this mela to promote tribal culture. The annual Tusu mela turned out to be a jamboree of tribal artistes and performers not only from Jharkhand but also from neighbouring states like Odisha and Bengal. People started flocking in groups from the morning carrying their Tusu idols and the choudal.

While one side of the field was lined up with dozen-odd giant Tusu idols, it were the towering choudals that adorned the other side of the field. Made out of hay and bamboo sticks, the choudal is an elongated structure like a temple with figures of tribal deities on it. The two main choudals brought today were, however, 70ft and 80ft, respectively.

'Tusu' is similar to harvest festivals, which take place in other parts of the country, and is celebrated by preparing food from newly harvested crops. 'Tusu' is stated to be symbolic emblem of goddess 'Tusu Devi', made of cardboard and decorated with colourful paper and female dolls, some reaching a height of even ten feet. This is prepared by group of chaste unmarried teenage girls a week before the actual festival and kept at the village for everyone to admire.

People from different places came to the Tusu mela in large numbers. “Ours group comprises 40 Chhau dancers, over 30 drummers and many more performers,” said Mohan Mahto, the secretary of a group.

One of the major attractions of this group was a huge traditional drum, which needs at least six people to play it.

“Traditionally, groups of artistes and performers from rural areas visit different Tusu melas and participate in competitions for the best idol or best decorated choudals,” said Sudhir Mahto, a member of the group from Chandil.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tribal-culture-takes-centrestage-at-tusu-mela.html
72,22-1-20,CAA will not be rolled back: Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah challenged opposition leaders for a debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on any public platform, stating categorically that the new citizenship law would not be rolled back.

Addressing a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow on Tuesday, Shah said: “Mein danke ki chot par kehta hoon ki CAA wapas nahi hoga. Modiji CAA lekar aaye, aur CAA ke khilaf, yeh Rahul Baba and company, Mamata, Akhileshji, Behen Mayawati, saari ki saari brigade kau-kau-kau karne lage.” (I declare that the CAA will never be rolled back. When Modiji brought CAA, Rahul and company, Mamata, Akhilesh, Mayawati, the entire brigade started making noise without ascertaining facts).

“I piloted the Citizenship Bill in Parliament. I challenge anyone who wants to debate with me on the CAA but this law will not be withdrawn at any cost,” Shah said.

The Home Minister added: “Narendra Modi was voted back to office only eight months back. There is no reason for us to go to the people again as there is no election round the corner. We were forced to launch the awareness campaign to counter the malicious campaign by opposition parties over CAA aimed at breaking India.”

“The opposition parties are trying to confuse Muslims in the name of CAA even when the new act is only to provide citizenship and not divest them of it,’’ Shah said.

Referring to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Shah said: “He is only making statements by readings others, and has no independent understanding of the issue. He should first study and then speak.”

Speaking on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Shah said: “The TMC leader raised the issue of giving citizenship to Dalit Hindu refugees from Bangladesh staying in West Bengal. But now she is opposing it just for political reasons.”

“During Rajasthan Assembly polls, Congress had also stressed on providing citizenship to only Hindu refugees from Pakistan, but now they are opposing it,” he said.

“Congress was responsible for country’s partition on religion lines in 1947. Now when we are trying to rectify their mistakes, they are opposing it. Even Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had said that minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh should be given Indian citizenship. But now, this party is opposing the CAA which is unfortunate and it shows their double standard,” Shah said.

Listing the series of Congress, TMC and other opposition leaders’ statements, Shah exclaimed: “How come Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan and Rahul Gandhi speak the same language and idioms about Kashmir and the CAA.’’

“Opposition leaders are questioning us on the abrogation of Article 370 from Kashmir which gives equal rights to people. These leaders never feel anything about Kashmiri Pandits who are now refugees in their own country. They never uttered a word when Taliban destroyed ancient Buddha statue at Bamiyan Valley in Afghanistan,” he alleged.

“I want to ask people protesting the CAA as to where are minorities disappearing in Pakistan? Why the population of minorities dwindled to three per cent now from 25 per cent in 1947. Thousands of Hindus and Sikhs were kidnapped, converted and so many women were raped. Hundreds of temples and gurudwaras were destroyed, who will help the persecuted minorities?,” Shah asked.

Targeting Congress and other parties for supporting “anti-national” slogans in JNU and other institutions, Shah asserted: “We will not tolerate this. We are ready to be abused but will not spare anyone who insults Bharat Mata.”

On the occasion, Shah asked people to dial a pro-CAA toll free number 8866288662 to support the act.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa-will-not-be--rolled-back--shah.html
73,22-1-20,Congress derailed Ram temple’s construction: Shah,"Blaming the Congress for derailing the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on Tuesday that it would commence within three months.

“Till the time there was a Congress government at the Centre, it did everything to delay the construction of the temple. Congress MP and senior Supreme Court advocate Kapil Sibal opposed the hearing on Ayodhya issue in apex court and did his best to stall the issue. Apart from Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party also opposed Ram temple’s construction at Ayodhya,’’ Shah alleged.

“Despite the obstruction by Congress, the Supreme Court gave its ruling and now a grand Ram temple will be constructed there,” he said. During the rally, Shah chanted the slogan ‘Jai Shree Ram’, which was repeated by the huge crowd.

On November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court gave its verdict in favour of Ram temple’s construction at Ayodhya and asked the government to set up a Trust for the purpose. But even after over two months, the government has yet to notify the Trust.

Referring to violence in JNU, Shah blamed the ‘so-called’ secular parties like Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party for being behind the unrest.

“Raising anti-India slogans was the order of the day in the university and the ‘tukde-tukde’ gang indulged in anti-national activities with impunity. Our government acted and several people were booked and sent to jail. When we took action, these three opposition parties opposed the move, crying that the government was putting curbs on freedom of expression,” Shah said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-derailed-ram--temple---s-construction--shah.html
74,22-1-20,Opposition parties speaking in Pak language: Yogi,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused the Congress, Samajwadi Party and other opposition parties of speaking in the language and idiom of Pakistan.

“Opposition parties were behind the violence and protest demonstrations to disturb peace aimed at destroying the social fabric of the nation. The government cannot remain mute spectator of attempts by opposition parties to create anarchy,” Yogi asserted.

Addressing a gathering in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow on Tuesday, Yogi drew analogy from the epic Mahabharata and said: “When Draupadi was disrobed, she had asked Bhishm Pitamah as to who was responsible for the sin. Then Vidur had said all those who were silent on the ghastly act were responsible. Congress is committing the same crime as Dushashan in Mahabharata. But we cannot remain silent to crimes committed in the name of opposing CAA. We cannot be silent to the disrobing of Bharat Mata. We will go meet people everywhere and expose the nefarious games of Congress and other parties,” Yogi said.

“The CAA should have been brought 70 years ago soon after Independence, but the Congress had no such ideas as its sole intention was to use the issue for narrow political ends and votebank politics. But our PM and Home Minister had the courage to bring this law to give citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” he said.

Yogi further alleged that opposition parties were distributing money to organise dharnas against CAA in the state but people of the country were supporting the PM on this issue and any conspiracy against ‘Ek Bharat-Shresht Bharat’ would be dealt with sternly.

The CM also appealed to the people to be aware of the opposition’s conspiracy in misleading a particular community by making them feel that the CAA was against them.

“The CAA is only to give citizenship to minority refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and not to snatch anyone’s citizenship,” he clarified. Large number of refugees, including Kashmiri Pandits, were present at the rally as were UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, and Deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya & Dinesh Sharma.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opposition-parties--speaking-in-pak--language--yogi.html

79,22-1-20,"After meeting BJP prez, Vij again seeks action against Haryana CID chief","Amid a tug-of-war with Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar over the charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Haryana, Home Minister Anil Vij on Tuesday again sought disciplinary action against the state chief of the agency.

On Monday, Vij reached New Delhi and went directly to BJP headquarters from Haryana Bhavan at around 11 pm and met party president JP Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

The Home Minister on Monday ordered a chagesheet “for major penalty” against incumbent CID chief Anil Rao for not being able to gather enough intelligence inputs in the absence of which the social fabric of the state was endangered. In another order, Vij asked Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Vijai Vardan to transfer ADGP Shrikant Jadhav as the new CID chief. Both orders come amid Vij’s ongoing tussle with Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar over control of the state CID.

Vij says that as the Home Minister, he has the right to seek intelligence input from the CID. Sources say his reaction over this issue came after CID chief Anil Rao did not report to him even after his CID report was sought repeatedly.

Vij made it clear that he has no dispute with the Chief Minister, but the arbitrariness of government officials will not be tolerated.

Asked what action will be taken if the CID chief is not removed, Vij told reporters, “I have given orders for action on my behalf, see what happens next.”

Talking to reporters, Vij said, “As a Home Minister, I repeatedly sought the intelligence input of the state from the CID chief, but it was not made available to me. This can cause great harm to the peace of the state at any time. I will not have input then how do I take steps and take action. When they (officials) do not agree, then it is our right to take action against a government official.”

He reiterated: “There is no dispute over this issue with the Chief Minister. He is the supreme of the government. I have no dispute over CID or any department with him. CM can take a minister's department and give it to anyone whenever he wants. But, as long as I am the Home Minister, I will have CID reporting because I have to prepare myself.

I have to be prepared if any accident or incident happens in the state.”

This was not the first time when Vij had shown his displeasure over the working of the state intelligence department. Earlier too he had raised serious questions over its functioning. Recently, he had announced to set up a three-member panel headed by state Home Secretary Vijai Vardhan to suggest ways to improve the working of the department. The minister had also expressed his dismay when he was not kept in the loop while the chief minister's flying squad undertook surprise checks at offices of the Regional Transport Authority offices. The rising tensions between the minister and the state CID chief had triggered a tug-of-war between Vij and the chief minister over the control of the department.

The home portfolio, along with ministries like health and urban local bodies, was allotted to six time MLA Vij after BJP-JJP alliance came to power in the state last year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after-meeting-bjp-prez--vij-again-seeks-action-against-haryana-cid-chief.html

Congress too did not fare better as the grand old party fielded Romesh Sabharwal, a low key functionary of the party against Kejriwal.

New Delhi Assembly constituency that had sent two Chief Ministers, is again in the news as the AAP national convener has been pitted against lesser opponents. The moment BJP announced Sunil Yadav, the former Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM)'s Delhi president, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP leaders went to the town for BJP giving a 'walk over' to Kejriwal.

Interestingly, the fight in the constituency will be based on the nature of its voters including, the Central Government employees who are against the free water and electricity.

On the one hand, Kejriwal is a hugely popular face and claims to have contributed the upliftment of middle and lower middle class people. However, scenario in New Delhi Assembly constituency does not have a single Mohalla clinic and faulty streetlights. The grouse of the voters is borne out of the fact that Kejriwal has been doling out freebies to the people all over Delhi and they pay taxes. Central Government employees residing in Pandara Road, Khan Market, Mandir Marg and few other areas of New Delhi Municipal Council are miffed with Kejriwal over the issue.

Yadav who is new face in BJP but may give a tough fight to Kejriwal because he is a youth leader and having history with Delhi University Student Union (DUSU) while Sabharwal, the congress leader is gaining popularity by terming Kejriwal a 'British' and an outsider in Delhi politics.

The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), which is popular among the traders of Khan Market and other aligned markets in New Delhi areas, may turn the AAP's episode as BJP leader and President of Delhi unit of the party had taken a firm stand for the trader by breaking a seal of Supreme Court committee - Environment Protection Control Authority (EPCA) for the right of traders.

While CGHS hospitals in Delhi's central government colonies are becoming dull with low footfall, Central government employees seek other alternatives with coining the idea of Mohalla Clinic however disappointed because they feel isolated and deprived of developments of AAP.

""Where are free water and electricity, where are clinics and job assurances for the employees of central government.. Why they feel left out in their own state,"" said Romesh, congress candidate assuring more tickets to congress and hoping this election will be a rise for the Indian National Congress (INC) which has become flaccid after Dixit government.

Pitching for the rights of Central government employees, the congress leader said Kejriwal always accuse the employees and termed them corrupt.

""Kejriwal is far away from the reality as these employees work day and night, sitting in the council office and doing nothing for the employees and distributing tax payers' money for the image building of his party.. how he can expect this people vote for him,"" he said.

New Delhi constituency was formed in 2008 and has given many Chief Ministers to the national Capital of India while the major part of constituency fell under the Gole Market from where former Chief Minister Shiela Dixit contested the election.

Interestingly, in previous assembly elections - 2015, AAP leader Kejriwal won with won with 57, 213 votes while BJP's Nupur Sharma managed to get nearly half with voting percentage 28.81 percent with 25,630 votes while Congress's Kiran Walia was on third number in triangular fight with vote share percentage only 16.86 percent only in 2008 when AAP was not in fight Congress and BJP witnessed a straight fight while former Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit gained 39,778 votes with 52.20 vote shares however BJP was also good in number with its candidate Vijay Jolly and voting percentage 33.85 per cent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp--cong-pit-greenhorns-against-kejriwal.html

His twin brother, Nitish Tushir, is his cover candidate. A cover candidate is fielded to ensure that a political party has a person to contest election in case its official candidate's papers are rejected during scrutiny. It is an established practice.

He joins the ranks of former DUSU presidents from the National Students' Union of India, like Ajay Maken and Alka Lamba, to make a shift to party politics.

Maken has twice been elected as an MP and has been an MLA in Delhi for three terms.

Lamba, who had unsuccessfully contested from Moti Nagar for the Vidhan Sabha elections on her poll debut from the Congress in 2003, had then joined the AAP and won from the Chandni Chowk constituency in 2015.

However, in September last year, she quit the AAP and announced that she has returned to the Congress, which has fielded her from the Chandni Chowk constituency.

The saffron party has also had many former DUSU presidents from the ABVP as its members, some of whom have held key portfolios.

Jaitley was the president of DUSU in the 1970s and subsequently graduated to the BJP and went on to become a key member of the party.

Vijay Goel, who was the DUSU president in 1977, is a member of the BJP, and has been thrice elected to the Lok Sabha from the saffron party.

In 2015, the saffron party had fielded former DUSU president Nupur Sharma against AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal from the New Delhi constituency, but she lost by over 31,000 votes.

In the lead up to the Delhi Assembly elections, Shakti Singh, another former DUSU president, had joined the BJP, triggering speculations that he might be fielded from Timarpur or Burari, but his name did not figure in the final list of candidates released by the party.

Congress candidate for the Kalkaji Assembly seat Shivani Chopra, Delhi Congress Chief Spokesperson Mukesh Sharma from the Vikas Puri also filed their nomination papers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/at-25--cong---s-rocky-youngest-candidate-in-capital-poll-fray-with-rs-55-000-assets.html
93,22-1-20,‘Twitter troll’ Tajinder files papers from Hari Nagar,"From slapping former AAP leader Prashant Bhushan and disrupting Arundhati Roy's book event to selling tea outside Congress headquarters as a protest against Mani Shankar Aiyar's remarks, Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, who is BJP candidate from Hari Nagar, has never failed to hog limelight, including for his numerous Twitter spats.

Within two hours of being named as the BJP's candidate for the Delhi Assembly polls on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, Twitter-savvy Bagga had a rap song — ""bagga bagga har jagah""— ready for his campaign.

Tweeted at 3.29 am by Bagga, the song video had over 30,000 views by Tuesday night and talks about how he is ready to take on the opponents in the upcoming Assembly polls in the national capital. ""How is the josh? #Baggabagga har jagah,"" he captioned the rap song on Twitter.

Garlanded by his supporters, Bagga filed his nomination on Tuesday. In the affidavit filed by him, Bagga has declared movable assets worth Rs 18.90 lakh including a car and has nil immovable assets.

Bagga, who has over 6.4 lakh followers on Twitter, was made the BJP spokesperson in 2017. The BJP's rivals often accuse him of being a ""Twitter troll"".

He started his career with Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena (BSKS), which calls itself a ""nationalist task force against traitors, anti-nationals and corrupts"".

Bagga grabbed headlines in October 2011 when he slapped lawyer-activist and the then AAP leader Prashant Bhushan for his remarks on Kashmir. He had openly taken credit for the assault and called it ""Operation Prashant Bhushan"".

""He try to break my Nation, I try to break his head. Hisab chukta. Congrats to all. Operation Prashant Bhushan successful (sic),"" he had tweeted.

Reacting to Bagga being given ticket by the BJP, Prashat Bhushan tweeted: ""From promoting lynch mobs & fake news purveyors on the social media & media to giving tickets to goons being prosecuted for terror, rape & other crimes, BJP has come a long way"". Bagga was quick to respond saying, ""abusing Army to Demanding Referendum in Kashmir to Throwing from AAP (sic), Prashant Bhushan has come a long way"". However, slapping Bhushan wasn't the only ""operation"" Bagga undertook.

In 2011, he disrupted a launch event of author Arundhati Roy's book at the India Habitat Centre. ""Old Memories with Arundhati Roy, whn she was Barking on Kashmir (sic),"" says a tweet by him showing how he disrupted the book launch.

He had in 2014 set up a tea stall outside the Congress headquarters as a protest against party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's 'chaiwala' remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---twitter-troll----tajinder-files-papers-from-hari-nagar.html
94,22-1-20,Present proposal in Budget session: Rekha Negi,"The protesting Anganwadi workers have stated that if the State Government is unable to meet their demands now, the issue should at least be raised in the Budget session of the Vidhan Sabha.

According to State president of Anganwadi workers association, Rekha Negi said, “We are asked to click selfies when we feed children and have to show our work record of 21 days. If coincidentally any worker is on leave on the 21st day, our allowance of 20 days is deducted by the Government. From elections to population census, every work is done through us and our Government could not even take the pain to explain its side to us. We are not forcing them to increase our allowances if they can’t, all we want is that our proposal be presented in the upcoming Budget session but they couldn’t care less to communicate with us.”

Anganwadi workers are furious over the attitude of the Government towards their work. One of the reasons, according to the protestors, is that the Government itself is not aware of the work they do in multiple fields.

According to Anganwadi worker Seema Rawat, “I have heard that it is being said about Anganwadi workers that we just watch children for three hours and that’s it. People who think like this are in fact not aware of the diversity of our work. We have to keep the record from the time of pregnancy of a woman till her child is six years old. We contribute in pulse polio campaign, Women and child development population census, child malnutrition survey and especially during the election.”

“The time of the election, whether it is State or Central, is the busiest for all the workers. Sometimes we do not get to go our home before nine in the evening. The Government gives us deadlines and even make us work overtime but they are saying what do we do to deserve the raise in our allowance? We may or may not get things according to our demands, but at least some authorities will know the extent of our work through this protest. If they think Anganwadi employs do nothing then just shut the Anganwadi projects”, added another Angnwadi worker Sangeeta Nautiyal.

One of the protesters, Priyanka Prajapati said, “I am a widow and I have two kids. Does the government realise how hard it is for a single mother to raise kids with the mere sum of Rs 7000? I don’t even expect the Government to increase the allowance substantially, at least make our wages Rs . 400 per day. I work all day for Anganwadi and I do not know anyone who hires people to do work in the evening so that I can do something else for additional payment. At least the Government should think about widows who have families to support.”

On the support of the former Chief Minister and senior congress leader Harish Rawat, Rekha Negi said, “It doesn’t make any difference to our situation as people from different parties are coming to speak here and we also understand that they have their own motives.

Ex CM came among us on his own and we could not insult him by forbidding him to express his thoughts”

Even after the protest of around two months, the State Government has not initiated any sort of communication with anganwadi worker.

Till now six women- Savita Sharma, Shashi Thapa, Manorama Nautiyal, Neelam Paliwal, Bhagyashree Uniyal and Pinky Negi have been hospitalised by police while Anju Chand and Vidya Devi are carrying on the fast unto death at the protest site.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/present-proposal-in-budget-session--rekha-negi.html

99,22-1-20,Jharia is India’s most polluted city: Report,"When Manoj Bajpayee in year 2012’s cult movie ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ said, “Itna Bum Marenge Ki Ilaka Dhuan Dhuan Hojayega (Our bomb explosions will cover this place with smoke)”, it only came across as a dramatic way of presenting the bad blood between gangs in Wasseypur – a neighbourhood in Jharia Assembly constituency.

Cut to 2020, it is an interesting coincidence that Jharia town is indeed covered in smoke, albeit from coal dust and not gunpowder.

The fourth version of Airpocalypse report by Greenpeace India, released on Tuesday, has highlighted that Jharia is the most polluted city in India in terms of Particulate Matter (PM) 10 – extremely small particles in the air that contribute to pollution. Jharia’s PM10 levels are five times higher than National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the report has revealed. Greenpeace India identified 231 of 287 cities for monitoring under National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) – an initiative of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climatic Change.

Under the programme, the cities are expected to reduce air pollution levels by 20 per cent to 30 per cent by 2024 from 2017 levels. However, Airpocalypse - IV report highlights that Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified only 122 non-attainment cities and 102 of them are included under NCAP till now. These 122 cities are spread across 28 states and nine union territories. There are 116 more cities exceeding 60 µg/m3 limit prescribed by NAAQS, according to 2018 annual data, and should be included in the non-attainment category, the report said.

Dhanbad, known for its rich coal reserves and industries, is the second-most polluted city in India, according to the report.

During the survey, cities were monitored for more than 50 days in 2018. Besides Jharia, Dhanbad, Sindri, Jamshedpur, Saraikela Kharsawan, Ranchi and Barajmada have made to the list of non-attainment cities. Greenpeace India’s Senior Campaigner Avinash Chanchal said, “It is worrying to see that more than 80 per cent cities had PM10 levels exceeding the 60 µg/m3 limit prescribed under National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

If we want to make NCAP truly a national programme, then we have to include all polluted cities into it and implement it with the addition of specific pollution and emission reduction targets in a time-bound manner.”

Geographically, Jharia lies in the heart of the coal belt in Jharkhand. Coal dust emission is one of the major environment concerns in the area. Jharia’s neighbouring city, Dhanbad, was adjudged the dirtiest city in India in the first ever ‘Swacchata’ survey conducted by the first Narendra Modi-led Government at the Centre.

The survey was conducted in 2014 and got Jharkhand the infamy of having the dirtiest city of the country within its borders.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jharia-is-india---s-most-polluted-city--report.html

Nath has also taken special initiative in the field of investment along with efforts to convert this thinking into the work culture of the State Government.

The draft of the Time bound Clearance Act 2020 is being prepared under the guidance of the Chief Minister along with his long-term and farsighted developmental, administrative and political experiences. This will facilitate investors in saving time from delay in getting permissions and approvals in setting up their industries. The draft proposes to make Madhya Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation a nodal agency. There will be time limit to complete all the procedures in setting up the industry.

122,22-1-20,Pavan confronts Nitish on JD(U)-BJP alliance in Delhi,"Ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, senior Janata Dal(United) leader Pavan K Verma has confronted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the party’s alliance with the BJP in two seats-Burari and Sangam Vihar- for the February 8 election despite having expressed apprehensions ‘in private’ about the BJP-RSS leading the nation into a ‘dangerous space’. This is for the first time that the JD(U) headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is having a tie-up with the BJP outside Bihar.

In a strongly worded two page letter to Nitish, Varma said he is ‘deeply perplexed’ by the development amid the citizenship law protests and is looking to him for “ideological clarity”. Varma, who shared screenshots of the missive on his official twitter handle and Facebook profile, said he was ‘perplexed’ by the partys tie-up with the BJP for the Delhi Assembly polls, accusing the saffron party of having “embarked on a massive, socially divisive agenda.” “On more than one occasion, you have expressed your grave apprehensions about the BJP-RSS combine,” Pavan Varma said in the letter on Tuesday.

The BJP had announced on Monday that it will spare two seats for the JD(U) in Delhi and one for another NDA partner— the LJP headed by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Both the JD(U) and the LJP had ploughed the lonely furrow in the recent assembly polls in Jharkhand, where the saffron party lost power to the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance.

“If these are your real views, I fail to understand how the JDU is now extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar, when even long standing allies of the BJP, like the Akali Dal, have refused to do so,” he wrote. “This is especially so at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive social divisive agenda aimed at mutilating the peace, harmony and stability of the country,” Varma said.

“In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012, even before I had resigned from the IFS, you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country,” Varma, one of the most articulate spokespersons of a political party, said.

“When you were leading the Mahagathbandhan (a grand alliance which also had the RJD and the Congress as partners), you had openly made a call for RSS-Mukt Bharat. These views, articulated for a sustained period, are a matter of public record,” Varma wrote.

In comments that may embarrass Kumar, Varma claimed that the JD(U) leader, even after aligning with the BJP again in 2017, had confessed to him ‘in private’ how the current saffron party leadership had ‘humiliated’ him. “You mentioned on more than one occasion that the BJP was leading India into a dangerous space. It was your personal view, as conveyed to me, that the BJP is destroying institutions and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official,” Varma added, without disclosing who the JD(U) leader was.

JD(U) national vice president Prashant Kishor also had come out strongly against the party’s support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill when it was tabled in Parliament last year.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pavan-confronts-nitish-on-jd-u--bjp-alliance-in-delhi.html

124,22-1-20,Rajinikanth opens new political narrative in TN,"Rajinikanth, Tamil filmdom’s super star, has put both the AIADMK and the DMK in a fix with his statement about EV Ramasamy Naiker, founder of the Dravida movement in Tamil Nadu.

While addressing the Golden Jubilee meeting of Tamil magazine Tuglaq launched by late Cho Ramaswamy, Rajinikanth who is certain to launch his political outfit anytime from now, had said that Naicker with his followers had taken out a procession in Salem in 1971 with nude pictures of Lord Rama and his consort Sita ‘decorated’ with footwears. The rallyists had raised derogatory slogans against the revered couple, Rajinikanth had said,

“While all newspapers and magazines had blacked out the incident, it was Tuglaq which carried the report in detail with the picture of the rallyists. The then Karunanidhi Government had tried its best to prevent the magazine copies from reaching the hands of the readers. But Cho printed additional copies and saw to it that the magazine copies reached its readers,” Rajinikanth said in his reminiscences.

Rajinikanth’s declaration from the venue of Thuglaq’s function that it was the intelligentsia who read Thuglaq while DMK activists carry Murasoli (mouthpiece of the DMK) has upset the DMK leadership.

The DMK came out with a front page article stating that the readers of Murasoli were Dravida youths with self respect and courage. “Our readers are people who care about the suppressed and depressed people in the society and they are not slaves to any ideology,” the Murasoli stated in an indirect reply to Rajinikanth’s declaration that those who read Thuglaq were intelligentsia while the readers of Murasoli were cadre of Dravisian party.

“Rajinikanth has succeeded in opening a new battlefront as well as political narrative in the State politics,” said Kolahala Srenivaas, political commentator.

Nehrudoss, a DK leader , has approached Coimbatore Police with a plea to file a complaint against the actor for spreading hatred against people. Nehrudoss alleged that Rajinikanth was peddling lies.

But Thuglaq Ramesh, lead writer of the magazine who has worked with Cho Ramaswamy from the day the Thuglaq was launched said there was no lies in the speech by Rajnikanth though there was a factual error. “Naicker and his associates had carried nude pictures of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu to denigrate the birth of Lord Ayyappa. The big size photograph was adored with footwears and we have preserved the copies in our office. What Rajinikanth told is correct though the characters differed,” Ramesh told The Pioneer.

He said the action of Naicker and his associates were nothing surprising as they had hatred for Hindu gods whom they disgraced and insulted at all available opportunities.

Though he was present during the 75th anniversary of Murasoli in 2018, the superstar did not make any speeches despite the pleads by Stalin.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajinikanth-opens-new-political-narrative-in-tn.html

127,22-1-20,IMF lowering of growth: Cong targets Govt,"Following the IMF’s lowering of India’s economic growth estimate, the Congress on Tuesday targeted the BJP Government with its senior leaders and former Union Ministers P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal taking a dig saying the IMF and its chief should be ready for being attacked by the BJP.

While Sibal launched a personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah saying they were a “drag on Indian democracy”, Chidambaram who servedas Finance Minister in Manmohan Singh Government, said that the NDA regime will now prove the IMF wrong and entire team NDA will foul mouth the world body and its chief economist, Gita Gopinath.

“IMF lowers India’s GDP for 2019 to 4.8%. Calls it a drag on the world economy,” Sibal said at AICC Press conference. “Protests of people, young and old, across India (who can’t be recognised by the clothes they wear) Reflect that the duo Modiji and Amit Shah are a drag on Indian Democracy,” the Congress leader added.

Sibal said the nationwide protests against the amended citizenship law reflected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were a “drag on Indian democracy”.

Ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, Gopinath had said growth in the country slowed sharply owing to stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth. Chidambaram claimed an attack on the world body and its chief economist Gita Gopinath by government ministers was imminent. He also alleged that the growth figure of 4.8 per cent given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is after some “window dressing” and he won’t be surprised if it goes even lower.

“Reality check from IMF. Growth in 2019-20 will be BELOW 5 per cent at 4.8 per cent,” Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.

129,22-1-20,AICC forms coordination committee to decide name for new PCC chief,"To deal with factionalism in Madhya Pradesh, All India Congress Committee (AICC) has formed a coordination committee, including Chief Minister and PCC chief Kamal Nath, to decide the name for new PCC chief.

Similar coordination committees have been formed in three other States — Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and Union Territory of Puducherry. Separate committees have been formed in these States to have better co-ordination between the party and State Governments in these States.

The committee formed for ‘proper implementation of election manifesto’ in MP comprises AICC general secretary of the State Deepak Babria, Chief Minister Kamal Nath, senior leader Arjun Modhwadia and former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan.

Besides the former two leaders, the committee for better co-ordination in party and State Government includes — former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, Meenakshi Natrajan, a close aide of Rahul Gandhi and sulking leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia and former PCC Chief Arun Yadav and Cabinet Minister Jitu Patwari.

Yadav had been away from party affairs soon after he was shown the door as party State head in May 2018 when Kamal Nath was drafted into Madhya Pradesh politics by the party high command. A loss in Lok Sabha polls also did not help his cause either.

Though the faction ridden Congress party in Madhya Pradesh had took on the mighty BJP in Assembly polls 2018, soon after the party assumed power, the things were back to square one.

Soon after the party handpicked veteran Kamal Nath as Chief Minister, ignoring claims from Jyotiraditya Scindia, the scion of Gwalior royal family was quick to disconnect himself from party affairs making public his disappointment and dissent on so many occasions.

Besides, speaking against his Government, Scindia had written open letters to Kamal Nath Government on public issues and was highly critical of farm loan waiver scheme over fulfillment issues.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aicc-forms-coordination-committee-to-decide-name-for-new-pcc-chief.html
130,22-1-20,Focus on boosting farmer’s economic condition,"The State Government in its Vision to Delivery Roadmap 2020-25 has taken a decision to strengthen the economic condition of the farmers through cooperatives.

Cooperative Banks and Primary Agriculture Credit Cooperative Societies have been made active to facilitate farmers in getting agriculture inputs, short-term agriculture loans and reasonable prices for their crops. At present, all facilities related to agriculture inputs through cooperative are being provided by these institutions to more than 73 lakh farmers.

The election process of cooperative institutions has been made fair and transparent by the State Government, so that election could be conducted in democratic manner. In rural areas, new cooperative institutions are being formed to create new jobs and for increase in productivity in employment oriented areas.

The State Government is providing the loan on zero per cent interest to the farmers for agriculture inputs. In the year 2019-20, agriculture loan of Rs 9,716 crore has already been distributed. After waiving the time barred loans of 4.95 lakh farmers, the crop loan of Rs 1,633 crore has been made available to them.

Under the Jai Kisan Fasal Wrin Maafi Yojana, an amount of Rs 4,262.68 crore has been released for 17.84 lakh farmers. The loan waiver process of the first phase has been completed and the process for the second phase has already been started. Under the time barred loans, an amount of Rs 2,275.27 crore for 9.42 lakh farmers and under the non-time barred loans of Rs 1,987.41 crore for 8.42 lakh farmers has been released by the Government.

131,22-1-20,"Rupee 45,000-cr submarine project goes to MDL, L&T","nThe Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, on Tuesday, approved private sector Larsen and Toubro and public sector Mazagon Docks Limited(MDL) for the Navy's project to manufacture six conventional submarines worth over Rs 45,000 crores within the country.

Approved last year, the project known as P-75 I will be under the Strategic Partnership model with the Indian partners tying up with a foreign manufacturer. The DAC also approved the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)s who are in the race for the project. They include Rosoboron Export(Russia), Daewoo(South Korea), Navantia(Spain), Thysenkrup Marine Systems(Germany) and French Naval Group, sources said. The Larsen and Toubro and MDL will forge the strategic partnership with one of the selected OEMs after due tender process, they added.

The first DAC meeting of this year and after the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)also cleared proposals worth over Rs 5,100 crores from local industry to promote indigenisation. General Bipin Rawat, the first CDS, attended the meeting along with other top functionaries of the defence ministry.

As regards the submarine project, sources said the DAC approved short-listing of the Larsen and Toubro and MDL as the Indian strategic partners(SP) and the potential Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that would collaborate with SPs to construct six conventional submarines in India. The MDL is already constructing Scorpene submarines in collaboration with the French.

The DAC nod to the short listing came days after the Congress last week claimed the NDA Government of ""favouring"" the Adani group in the submarine project alleging it was promoting its ""crony capitalists"".

Addressing a Press conference, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala and party spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill had charged the Government of violating the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) of 2016 as well as over-ruling the recommendations of the 'Empowered Committee' of the Indian Navy that had been set up for the project.

The Congress claimed that two key parameters set by the DPP were that the shortlisted company to manufacture the six submarines in the deal should be of Credit 'A' rating and the Ministry of Defence should approve the 'Special Purpose Vehicle' (SPV) set up for the project before applying for ""request for expression of interest"".

The Empowered Committee of the Navy, claimed the Congress, shortlisted the public sector unit, Mazagon Docks Shipbuilders Limited, and Larsen and Toubro from the private sector.

The main Opposition party alleged that the Government is all set to violate the Committee's recommendations by allowing the private entity which neither has any experience in submarine manufacturing nor the required credit rating.

Surjewala also said five companies — Larsen & Toubro Limited, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited, Hindustan Shipyard Limited, Adani Defence, and Hindustan Shipyard Limited Joint Venture — had applied for the project.

The Strategic Partnership Model was promulgated in 2017 to give a major boost to 'Make in India' in Defence Sector. The Strategic partner is expected to play a transformational role in building an eco-system in the country, comprising development entities, specialised vendors and suppliers; especially those from the medium and small scale sector.

The new model also aims at promoting India as a manufacturing hub for defence equipment, in addition to establishing an industrial and research and development eco-system capable of meeting the future requirements of the armed forces besides giving boost to exports.

Meanwhile, the Rs 5,100 crore proposals approved include sophisticated Electronic Warfare Systems for the Army designed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured locally by the Indian industry. These systems will be used in deserts and plains and will provide comprehensive Electronic Support and Counter Measure capabilities to the field formations in both communication and other aspects of Electronic Warfare.

The DAC also approved prototype testing of trawl assemblies designed by the DRDO for T-72 and T-90 tanks providing an important indigenous de-mining capability to the Army.

The DAC also accorded approval for inclusion of Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) in Defence Procurement Procedure.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rupee-45-000-cr-submarine-project-goes-to-mdl--l-t.html

139,22-1-20,"Delhi polls: Tanhaji video morphed with Modi, Shah goes viral","A spoof video made from the scenes of latest Bollywood blockbuster ‘Tanhaji — The Unsung Warrior’, in which the faces of Chhatrapati Shivaji and his trusted commander Tanaji Malusare have been morphed with those of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah went viral in the social media on Tuesday.

Fresh from the controversy over a Hindi book ‘Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Mod’, likening the current Prime Minister to Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the latest video — in which Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been projected as Udaybhan Singh Rathore — has turned the spotlight on the BJP once again, amid the ongoing campaigning the Delhi Assembly polls.

The spoof video, posted on the twitter handle named ‘political kida’ has drawn comparisons between the battle of Sinhagad Fort with the upcoming Delhi elections and the website has said: “Jo Dilli Jeet Gaya, Samjho Dil Jeet Gaya”. Interestingly, the twitter page containing the spoof video went missing later in the evening.

Reacting to the spoof video, BJP’s Rajya Sabha member and the 13th direct descendant of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji and great grandson of Chhatrapati Shahu of Kolhapur Sambhaji Chhatrapati tweeted: “After the book (likening Shivaji to Modi), we now have video that indecent, intolerable and condemnable. The parties concerned should expressed its stand over the video. The Centre should order an inquiry into the video and initiate action against those behind it”

“For us Shiv bakths Shivaji Maharaj is everything. The video has hurt the Shiva bakths. It is the responsibility of the Government to take cognisance of the sentiments of the Shiv bakths and take steps to ensure against recurrence of such things in future. My request to all political parties not to misuse the image of great Maratha warrior for their cheap politics,” Sambhaji Chhatrapati tweeted.

Responding to the objectionable video, Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut said: “ I have sent the video to controversial Hindutva leader Sambhaji Bhide and various BJP leaders. I am waiting for their response.”

Alluding to the recent demand by Sambaji Bhide that action be taken against him for his disparaging remarks against the descendents of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Raut said: “I want to see the reaction of those who have called for a bandh at Satara and Sangli against the Shiv Sena. Not even a single person whom I have sent the video to has replied so far”.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra BJP has disassociated itself from the spoof video put out on the twitter handle of “political kida’. “The BJP{ has nothing to do with this video. The BJP is not using the video in its campaign for the Delh9i Assembly polls. We condemn this video. It is wrong to elicit the BJP’s reaction on this video. Chhatrapati Shivaji cannot be compared with anyone,” Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said.

“There is no restriction on any one making anything of video, putting it on social media and letting it go viral. There is a clear cut attempt to defame the BJP by making such a controversial video,” Patil said.

Hitting out indirectly at Raut, Patil said: “The people who are demanding evidence from the descendents of Chhatrapati Shivaji have no mortal right left to talk about the Maratha warrior. The BJP’s stand is that there was only unique king (Shivaji) and we do not get to see such a king against. It was because of this king that Hindu Swaraj was established. No one can be compared chhatrapati shivaji”.

Last week, under severe flak from various political quarters, an embarrassed BJP had distanced itself from a controversial book “Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi”, penned by the party’s Jai Bhagwan Goyal, likening the current Prime Minister with Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

BJP’s National Media co-head Sanjay Mayukh had said through a video statement: “Whatever that been written in the book is the author’s personal point of view. It is neither our party publication nor are we connected with it in any manner”

“The writer has clarified that it is his personal writing. He has also said that if the book has hurt anybody’s emotions, he is withdrawing the book. We would like to clarify again that it is not a party publication,” Mayukh had said.

The book “Aajke Shivaji: Narendra Modi” has been criticised by the leaders of all the non-BJP parties – especially the ruling constituents of Shiv Sena-led Maha Vilas Aghadi (MVA) in the state, ever since it was released at an even held at the BJP’s headquarters in New Delhi amid fanfare in New Delhi two days earlier.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/delhi-polls--tanhaji-video-morphed-with-modi--shah-goes-viral.html
140,22-1-20,Want to get first-hand account of problems people face: Naqvi,"The purpose of the Centre’s outreach programme in Jammu & Kashmir is to get a firsthand account of the problems faced by the people and address their concerns, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Tuesday.

“The objective of this dialogue is to go close to people, listen to their problems and needs and also find solutions to their problems, “ Naqvi told reporters here.

Naqvi, who laid the foundation stone for a development project at Harwan on the outskirts of the city, was the first minister to visit Kashmir as part of the Centre’s outreach programme.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to ensure that benefits of the changes initiated by the Central government should reach all the people of the union territory.

“The aspirations and expectations of the people were not upheld (earlier) and corruption had eaten into Jammu and Kashmir... Some people had benefited themselves but we want prosperity for all people here, “ Naqvi said.

Asked why only five ministers were visiting Kashmir against 31 going to Jammu, he said the present outreach programme was just the beginning of the Centre’s efforts to reach out to the people of the Valley.

“This is not the last programme. This initiative will continue,” he said. Naqvi refused to comment on criticism from some quarters about the Ministers not including seven districts of Kashmir in their outreach programme.

Addressing a gathering earlier, Naqvi said the Central Government wants “a new dawn” of development and accountability in the functioning of the Government machinery in Jammu & Kashmir.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/want-to-get-first-hand-account-of-problems-people-face--naqvi.html
141,22-1-20,Mins’ visit only to highlight BJP agenda at expense of public exchequer: Cong,"The Jammu & Kashmir unit of the Congress on Tuesday attacked the BJP-led central Government over its ongoing public outreach programme in the Union Territory and alleged that the visit of the Ministers is only to highlight the agenda of the party at the expense of the public exchequer.

It also alleged that the visit is aimed at diverting the attention of the people from real issues of unemployment, price rise and “worst ever” economic slowdown besides the social and political upheavals being witnessed in the country, affecting the political prospects of the BJP in Delhi and West Bengal.

In the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two UTs in August last year, the Centre launched a major week-long public outreach programme on January 18 to aware people about the benefits of the move and to disseminate information about the implementation of its policies and programmes for the overall development of Jammu & Kashmir. So far about 24 ministers visited different parts of Jammu.

“The visit of Ministers’ brigade is only to highlight the agenda of the party at the expense of public exchequer by use of entire official machinery, after feedback to the BJP Government at the centre that people even in Jammu region are fed up with the neglect, especially the treatment meted out to the erstwhile state depriving it of the identity and rights of the locals,” Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said.

“The BJP should answer why only five ministers, out of 36, are going to Kashmir to attend eight programmes against 51 programmes in the Jammu region to explain the benefits of abrogation of special status under Article 370 and disbanding of the erstwhile state,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mins----visit-only-to-highlight-bjp-agenda-at-expense-of-public-exchequer--cong.html
142,22-1-20,Habitat encroachments put spiders’ life at risk,"Every time, a natural habitat is converted into a land for agricultural or residential purposes, it is the small predators, especially small invertebrates like spiders and ladybirds, which lose their homes as well as lives, as per a first of its kind global study on the impacts of human land-use on different groups of animals.

The findings published in the journal, Functional Ecology, also found that small ectotherms — cold blooded animals such as invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians, large endotherms like mammals and birds and fungivores ie animals that eat fungi were also disproportionally affected.

But, the loss of large herbivores will also likely to have important effects on ecosystem functioning, for example increasing the risk of rodent borne human disease, warn the researchers who had analysed over one million records of animal abundance at sites ranging from primary forest to intensively managed farmland and cities.

The data represented over 25,000 species across 80 countries. Species were grouped by size, whether they were warm or cold blooded and by what they eat. Species ranged from the oribatid mite weighing only 2x10-6g, to an African elephant weighing 3,825kg.

“Normally, when we think of predators, we think of big animals like lions or tigers. These large predators did not decline as much as we expected with habitat loss, which we think may be because they have already declined because of human actions in the past (such as hunting). We find small predators - such as spiders and ladybirds - to show the biggest declines,” said Dr Tim Newbold from University College London and lead author of the research.

The results indicate that the world's ecosystems are being restructured with disproportionate losses at the highest trophic levels (top of the food chain).

“We know that different types of animals play important roles within the environment - for example, predators control populations of other animals. If some types of animals decline a lot when we lose natural habitats, then they will no longer fulfil these important roles.” said Dr Tim Newbold.

The conversion of land to human use is associated with the removal of large amounts of natural plant biomass, usually to give space for livestock and crops. As you go up the trophic levels (food chain), resource limitations are compounded through a process known as bottom-up resource limitation, said the study which is part of the PREDICTS project exploring how biodiversity responds to human pressures.

The researchers analysed 1,184,543 records of animal abundance in the PREDICTS database, gathered from 460 published scientific studies. This database included all major terrestrial vertebrate taxa and many invertebrate taxa (25,166 species, 1.8% of described animals).

Species were sorted into functional groups defined by their size, trophic level (what they consumed) and thermal regulation strategy (warm or cold blooded). The type of land-use at each of the 13,676 sample sites was classified from the description of the habitat in the source publication. The six broad categories were primary vegetation, secondary vegetation, plantation forest, cropland, pasture and urban. Three levels of human use intensity were also recorded: minimal, light and intense.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/habitat-encroachments-put-spiders----life-at-risk.html

148,22-1-20,"Act not to be withdrawn, those protesting can continue: Shah","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday emphatically said the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) will not be withdrawn and those protesting can continue to do so even as he challenged Opposition leaders for a public debate on the contentious law.

Accusing the Opposition of “misleading” people on the amended citizenship law, Shah threw the challenge for the debate to Rahul Gandhi(Congress), Mamata Banerjee(Trinamool Congress), Akhilesh Yadav(Samajwadi Party) and Mayawati(Bahujan Samaj Party).

Addressing a rally in Lucknow in support of the CAA, Shah also declared that the construction of a Ram temple “touching the skies” in Ayodhya will begin within three months.

At the same meeting, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that the Congress is shelling out money for “arson” and protests over the CAA.

Shah accused the Congress of not implementing the suggestions that came from its own leaders in the past on granting citizenship to minority Hindus in Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and Afghanistan after Partition.

He also hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, saying she is now opposing Indian citizenship for Dalit Bengalis.

Shah said there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone’s citizenship away. “A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, SP, BSP, and Trinamool Congress.”

The CAA is a law to grant citizenship, he added. “I want to say that irrespective of the protests it will not be withdrawn,” he said, adding, “Whoever has to oppose can oppose the Act, it is not going to be revoked.”

Stating that a myth is being spread in the country about the CAA, Shah alleged that riots and arson are being induced and that the SP, BSP, Congress and the TMC are fomenting the protests.

“If any clause of the CAA takes away the citizenship of anyone, including Muslims, they can tell me. The agitations and sit-ins, which are being organised in the country against it, are wrong,” he said.

“The Congress has become blind due to vote bank politics,” he said, and also blamed the party for Partition.

Reacting to the assertions by Shah, Akhilesh Yadav said they reflected intolerance as the BJP “wants to crush people with the road roller of its majority”.

Lashing out at the BJP, the former Chief Minister alleged that the saffron party is making “intolerance” as its identity.

“Playing with basic principles of the democracy, the BJP is going ahead with making intolerance its identity. Shah’s statement that he would implement the CAA at any cost shows that the Government wants to crush people with the road roller of its majority,” Yadav said in a statement

The Uttar Pradesh unit of the Congress accused Shah of “speaking the language of a dictator”.

“Virtually soaked in pride of being in power, the country’s home minister is speaking the language of a dictator....” UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said in a statement.

Shah asked Opposition parties where they were when “crores of people were killed” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on the basis of religion.

He said five lakh Pandits were displaced from Kashmir, “but these parties did not utter a word”.

“Now, because of PM Modi, a new chapter has begun in the lives of these people,” he said. Shah referred to the recent Supreme Court verdict that allows the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/act-not-to-be-withdrawn--those-protesting-can-continue--shah.html
149,22-1-20,Bengal to table motion against CAA on Jan 27,"The Mamata Banerjee Government will call a special session of the State Assembly on January 27 to table a resolution rejecting the Citizenship Amendment Act. The date was given by State Parliamentary Affairs Minister and Trinamool Congress general secretary Partho Chatterjee.

The formal announcement came a day after Banerjee declared that she would soon get a resolution against CAA passed in the State Assembly.

The development also comes as an aftermath of members of the minority community openly questioning the TMC Ministers — Jyotipriya Mullick and Bratya Basu at various organisational forums as to why the Bengal Government was not following in the footsteps of Kerala and Punjab which had earlier passed resolutions against the controversial Act.

“I don’t have to say anything about who said what. But I can only say that our Chief Minister has decided to call a special session of the Assembly to pass a resolution against the CAA,” Chatterjee said adding the State Government’s credentials could not be questioned as it had already passed similar resolutions against National Register for Citizens and National Population Register.

“I have personally spoken to opposition leader Abdul Mannan (Congress) and would also speak to CPI(M) Legislator Party Leader Sujan Chakrabarty seeking their support for the resolution which will be tabled on January 27,” Chatterjee said.

The decision which the Government had taken on Tuesday should have been taken earlier Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury said reacting to the Tuesday’s announcement adding “the Congress and the Left had moved a similar resolution earlier in the Assembly but the TMC refused to take it up for discussion now for some unknown reasons they have agreed to pass the resolution only after Kerala and Punjab Governments have done it… it is better late than never.”

Chakrabarty wondered “why they rejected our move when we wanted to table a similar resolution a few days in the Assembly denouncing CAA. It seems that only after getting the green signal from her BJP friends in Delhi that the Chief Minister has now decided to table the resolution. In any case we have no problem in supporting it.”

He added how the TMC Government had grudgingly passed a resolution against NRC and NPR tabled by the opposition “but only after tabling it in their party’s name.”

Chatterjee would not dwell much on the issue but said “We have already submitted the resolution to the Speaker on January 20.”

He also would not comment on why the TMC was moving the Supreme Court challenging the CAA a la Kerala and Punjab. “I am in State politics and will not be in a position to take questions on things at national level. Please ask the questions to Derek O’ Brien who will be the appropriate person to take the question.”

On whether the Chief Minister would take up Home Minister Amit Shah’s challenge to debate the CAA at national forum, the senior Bengal Minister said “we will take it up for discussion in the party forum before coming back to you.”

However, another Minister and senior party leader Tapas Roy said there is no problem for any debate because it is Mamata Banerjee who had for the first time given an open challenge for a debate on NRC, and CAB (before it became an Act).

Meanwhile, after the lawyers, students and civil society it was the turn of the doctors to descend on the streets against the CAA with hundreds of medicos from NRS Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday taking out processions condemning the controversial Act.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bengal-to-table-motion-against-caa-on-jan-27.html

He said this after jointly inaugurating with his Nepalese counterpart K P Sharma Oli the second integrated check post at Jogbani-Biratnagar along the border.

Built with Indian assistance, the integrated check post is spread over 260 acres and is capable of handling 500 trucks on a daily basis.The Rs 140 crore project will improve trade and people-to-people contact.

The project was launched jointly by the two leaders via a video link. The first ICP was built in Raxaul-Birgunj in 2018.

After inaugurating the ICP, Modi said India is committed to simplifying and smoothening traffic with all friendly countries in the neighbourhood, and to “further facilitate contacts between us in areas such as business, culture and education”.

He also said India and Nepal are working on several cross-border connectivity projects such as road, rail and transmission lines.

“Integrated check posts at major places of border between our countries are greatly facilitating mutual trade and movement,” he said.

At the event, both prime ministers also witnessed the progress in Indian-assisted post-2015 earthquake housing reconstruction projects in Nepal.

Out of India's commitment to build 50,000 houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, 45,000 have already been completed.

“The 2015 earthquake was a painful accident. Natural calamities like earthquakes test man's tenacity and determination. Every Indian is proud that our Nepali brothers and sisters faced the sad consequences of this tragedy with courage,” Modi said.

It is a matter of great satisfaction that 45,000 out of 50,000 houses have been constructed under Indo-Nepal cooperation, he said.

“We hope that the construction of the remaining houses will also be completed soon. And these houses will soon be dedicated to Nepali brothers and sisters,” the prime minister noted.

151,22-1-20,Zomato acquires Uber Eats business in India,"Zomato on Tuesday said it has acquired the Indian business of Uber Eats in an all-stock deal that will give Uber 9.99 per cent stake in the Indian food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. Uber Eats app in India will discontinue operations and direct restaurants, delivery partners, and users of the Uber Eats apps to the Zomato platform, effective Tuesday, Zomato said in a statement.

The deal marks possible consolidation in the highly competitive and price-sensitive online food delivery market where most players are in the red. In a regulatory filing to the BSE, Info Edge (India) - a shareholder in Zomato - said its shareholding in Zomato will stand reduced to about 22.71 per cent on fully converted and diluted basis upon closing of the transaction. The deal comes days after Zomato had raised USD 150 million in funding from existing investor Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate, at a USD 3 billion valuation. Post money valuation of Zomato is USD 3.55 billion, sources in know of the matter told PTI, adding that this transaction will add to a total of over 50 million orders per month on its platform, giving it around 55 per cent market share. “We are proud to have pioneered restaurant discovery and to have created a leading food delivery business across more than 500 cities in India. This acquisition significantly strengthens our position in the category,” Zomato Founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said.

Uber Eats, which entered India in 2017, has about 26,000 restaurants listed on its platform from 41 cities. On accessing Uber Eats app, users were shown a message saying they can still use Uber Eats if they are travelling outside India. Discussions between Zomato and Uber have been on for months. Facing stiff competition from Zomato and Swiggy, Uber Eats had been making losses. Uber had projected an operating loss of Rs 2,197 crore in its food delivery business for the five months through December 2019, according to a valuation report prepared by KPMG affiliate BSR and was part of regulatory filings. According to sources, Uber Eats India business contributed three per cent of the global gross bookings but accounted for over 25 per cent of adjusted EBIDTA losses for the first three quarters of 2019. With sale of the food business in India, Uber can now focus on the rides business and driving it towards profitability, one of the sources said. They also said that 245 full time employees of Uber Eats will be affected and some of these people could be absorbed in other roles in Uber.

“India remains an exceptionally important market to Uber and we will continue to invest in growing our local rides business, which is already the clear category leader. We have been very impressed by Zomato’s ability to grow rapidly in a capital-efficient manner and we wish them continued success,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in the statement.

India at a meeting in November last year in Bangkok decided to withdraw from this mega free-trade agreement as its concerns were not addressed adequately by the RCEP.

“India has received the invitation for the meeting but it has not yet taken any decision on this,” the official said.

The meeting in Bali will be held at a chief negotiator level.

154,22-1-20,Airports may incur Rs 650cr/yr loss if duty-free liquor restricted: APAO,"Indian airports are likely to incur a revenue loss of Rs 650 crore per annum and could potentially turn defaulters if the commerce ministry’s proposals on the sale of liquor and cigarette at duty-free shops are accepted, an industry body warned on Tuesday.

The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) in a statement said that if non-aero revenues are restricted by an act of government, the new operators will find the airports unviable and may even renege on their contracts.

Flughafen Zurich AG, which is one of the largest European airport operators, has just re-entered the domestic airport space, bagging the contract for the greenfield Jewar Airport in UP while Adani group has been mandated to run six AAI-owned airports in the country.

The Commerce Ministry, as part of its proposals to the finance ministry ahead of the budget, has recommended restricting purchase of tax-free alcohol to one bottle against two at present and prohibiting completely the purchase of cigarette cartons, from one carton of 100 sticks now, at duty-free shops at the arrival area of the international airports in the country.

“Such a move will have disastrous effects on the Indian aviation industry across all stakeholders including airports, airlines, passengers and duty-free operators,” the APAO said.

Liquor accounts for majority of sales of duty-free operators. Vehemently opposing the proposal, the body said, “It will make their operations unviable due to firm commitments towards fixed fee and fixed expenses to be met out of lower revenue base.”

Share of import of liquor for sale to arrival passengers in total import is miniscule — 0.0213 per cent or $97 million of the total $460 billion imports, it said adding that “even doing away with entire imports will not serve any purpose.”

According to the association, the proposed restrictions will lead to an increase in passenger charges, hurt airport industry and may “encourage smuggling,” besides a revenue loss of about Rs 650 crore per annum at all airports.

The revenue loss at airports will impact the operators’ financial ratings and consequently hamper expansion plans, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/airports-may-incur-rs-650cr-yr-loss-if-duty-free-liquor-restricted--apao.html

Besides, heavy sell-offs in domestic equity market for a second session in a row and the outbreak of a deadly virus in China also impacted forex market sentiment.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened on a weak note at 71.17. During the day, it saw a high of 71.13 and a low of 71.24.

The Indian currency finally settled at 71.21, lower by 10 paise against its previous close.

However, weaker greenback overseas and easing crude oil prices helped the rupee restrict its losses to some extent.

157,22-1-20,"Need to have fairer, more equitable terms in trade relations: Goyal","Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said India is working on ways to have fairer and more equitable terms in its trade relationships with various countries. Speaking here at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020, the commerce and industry minister also called for greater cooperation among various nations to realise the huge growth prospects in the Indian Ocean region and also for tackling the important issue of climate change.

Goyal said the RCEP in its present form was clearly an unworkable agreement.

“Any pact needs to take into account several factors. India is grappling with a huge trade deficit, particularly with China and many other nations in the region,” he said.

For the first time, India demonstrated that trade cannot be dictated by diplomacy, Goyal said, referring to India’s decision to pull out of the RCEP. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has had to factor in several diversities among partners, but India has serious concerns about climate change and is seeking greater cooperation on fair terms, he asserted. Goyal was speaking at a Strategic Outlook session on ‘The Indian Ocean Rim’.

“We are like a pivot for the Indian Ocean and we believe this region has huge potential. At the same time, India is very much concerned about the issue of climate change.

“Going forward, the entire grouping around the Indian Ocean will play a very important role, while keeping in mind fair and equitable distribution. India also expects greater cooperation among various nations on climate change,” he said.

Goyal further said, “We in India are also working on how to put in place more equitable terms in our trade relations with various countries.”

On whether India can still join RCEP, Goyal said the country had said at that time too that it will not be able to join the trade deal in its current form. If nations provide adequate transparency safeguards and if non-tariff barriers are addressed, there is always scope for a fresh dialogue, he added.

The Indian Ocean Rim sees two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments pass through its waters and is home to half of the world’s container ships that support 2.7 billion people.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/need-to-have-fairer--more-equitable-terms-in-trade-relations--goyal.html

“The Prime Minister says there is no discussion on NRC while the home minister says he will implement NRC across the country. He said in and outside Parliament.

Three persons have been arrested in connection with the incident which occurred on Monday afternoon in Dona Paula area near the varsity campus, a police official said. The stabbing had prompted the opposition Congress to allege that youths are getting provoked due to the “poison” of “state-sponsored” actions.

The victim student, Mathihulla Aria, is pursuing M.Com at the varsity's Goa Business School.

He was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in Dona Paula for the stab injuries.

While Satish Nilkanthe, a resident of Maharashtra, was arrested on Monday, Desmond Fernandes and Suresh Nageri were picked up on Tuesday, said police inspector Sudesh Naik.

He said another accused, identified only as Jonty, is on the run. “The incident was purely a clash between two groups which have nothing to do with the Goa University,” the inspector said when asked about the motive behind the attack. Narrating the sequence of the events of Monday, Naik said Nilkanthe and three others had an argument with Aria near Dona Paula plateau after which he called up fellow Afghani students for help.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/afghan-student-stabbed-near-goa-varsity-after-brawl--3-held.html
160,22-1-20,"Saibaba birthplace row uncalled for, CM can’t be blamed: Sena","The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should not be blamed for the ‘uncalled for’ controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba as nobody can tell whether the 19th century saint was actually born in Shirdi.

Noting that the Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth over Rs 2,600 crore out of which social works are done, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said Shirdi became ‘rich’ because of the saint, and none can snatch away the richness of the town where he

died.

It also said that Thackeray did not refer to Pathri in Parbhani district as Saibaba’s birthplace ‘on his own’, but on the basis of versions of some historians.

During a State Cabinet meeting on January 9, Thackeray said Pathri, considered the birthplace of Saibaba, would be developed as a site of religious tourism, and announced a grant of Rs 100 crore for the place.The led to a row following which locals from Shirdi called for a bandh in the temple town on Sunday.

The bandh was, however, called off on Sunday midnight and Thackeray met some residents of Shirdi on Monday and the issue was resolved. “The Chief Minister did not stoke any controversy. Pathri and Shirdikars, too, should not create it. This will lessen the glow of saints,” the Shiv Sena said in ‘Saamana’.

The “uncalled for” controversy was put to rest after the Chief Minister promptly paid attention to the matter and cleared the Government’s stance on the issue, it said.

The Sena said Thackeray did not refer to Pathri during the January 9 meeting “on his own”, but on the grounds of versions of some historians. Saibaba “appeared” at Shirdi in Ahmednagar district, but none can tell whether he actually was born there. When Saibaba first showed up in Shirdi, nobody knew what his name was and from where had come, the Marathi daily said.

“From where Baba came to Shirdi, whether he came from Pathri, there is a mention about this in Parbhani’s Government gazette that ‘according to some, it (Pathri) could be the birthplace of Shirdi’s saint Saibaba’,” it said. “The Chief Minister has not written or published the gazette. Hence, he should not be blamed for the controversy,” the Shiv Sena said.

The party further said Shirdi became “rich” because of Saibaba and none can snatch away the richness from the town where the saint breathed his last. The Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth Rs 2,693 crore and the temple daily gets donations in lakhs out of which social works are carried out, it noted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/saibaba-birthplace-row-uncalled-for--cm-can---t-be-blamed--sena.html

Khan also claimed that at no point of time had he said that the State Government should have taken his permission before going ahead with the decisions.

To a question that the Governor is supposed to go by the “aid and advice of the council of Ministers” he said, “They (State Government) did not send any advice to me. Instead they concealed information from me. May be I would have given some inputs to them if they had kept me informed. This was nothing but a breach of propriety and courtesy.” Khan denied reports that he had summoned Kerala Chief Secretary Tom Jose

on Monday in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss the issue. “I did not call the chief secretary. It was a totally different thing. I don't want to discuss what had transpired between me and the chief secretary with the media,” he said.

Hardening his stand, the Kerala governor on Monday rejected the Left front Government's explanation over moving the Supreme Court against CAA without informing him and said it was 'unlawful'.

“No explanation can satisfy me”, the Governor had told reporters. Khan's strongly-worded reaction came hours after state Chief Secretary Tom Jose met him at the Raj Bhavan and explained the grounds under which the state government had filed a suit in the Supreme Court against the citizenship law.

163,22-1-20,Passenger vehicle retail sales dip 9 pc in Dec,"Automobile dealers’ body FADA on Tuesday said retail sales of passenger vehicles in December 2019 declined 9 per cent to 2,15,716 units year-on-year, as even the best offers failed to lift weak consumer sentiments. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), passenger vehicles (PV) sales stood at 2,36,586 units in December 2018.

Two-wheeler sales declined 16 per cent to 12,64,169 units last month as compared with 15,00,545 units in December 2018. Commercial vehicle sales declined 21 per cent to 67,793 units as compared to 85,833 units in December 2018.

Three-wheeler sales, however, rose one per cent to 58,324 units last month. Total sales across categories declined 15 per cent to 16,06,002 units in December 2019 as against 18,80,995 units in the year-ago month. FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said December sales de-growth was not on expected lines as the inquiry levels all through the month were quite robust.

Consumer sentiment continues to be very weak as customers did not conclude on the purchase even after taking the efforts of inquiring and despite the best offers being available, he added. “The sharp decline in growth has denied the dealer community an opportunity to reduce its BS-IV inventory making the transition to BS-VI trickier,” Kale said.

With such weak consumer sentiment, FADA recommends a very cautious approach to its members with serious focus on BS-IV inventory liquidation, he added. “FADA will work towards seeking relief from the Honourable Supreme Court for the BS-IV inventory of its members as with such weak consumer demand the near term retail sales are unpredictable, making it extremely difficult for our members to continue the current business and also ensure a nil BS-IV inventory on March 31,” Kale noted. The commercial vehicle and two-wheeler inventory still remains a concern, he added. Besides, liquidity still remains a concern for the dealers’ community as well as for the retail customer as banking industry continues to be in cautious mode, Kale said highlighting the challenges. “Equal importance needs to be given to availability of reasonably liberal credit, especially in a developing country like ours where the growth is driven by first time buyers or individuals and businesses looking to expand beyond their current capacity,” he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-dip-9-pc-in-dec.html

At the closing bell, the 30-share Sensex was down 205.10 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 41,323.81; while the NSE Nifty settled 54.70 points, or 0.45 per cent, lower at 12,169.85 — the third loss for the gauge in a row.

Indian bourses also remained under pressure tracking weaker global markets after the outbreak of a new deadly virus in China spooked investors. On the Sensex chart, Tata Steel was the top loser, shedding 3.01 per cent, followed by M&M, Maruti, Asian Paints, PowerGrid, ITC and Axis Bank. On the other hand, Ultratech Cement, Kotak Bank, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, IndusInd Bank and ONGC ended with gains. Sectorally, BSE power, realty, metal, auto, utilities, FMCG, bankex and finance indices ended up to 1.47 per cent. While telecom, teck and energy indices settled in the green. In the broader market, BSE midcap fell 0.21 per cent, while smallcap closed flat.

Besides rising concerns over growth in India, global investors turned risk-averse after confirmation of a deadly SARS-like virus in China. “Indian markets continued to fall for third consecutive day on the back of weak Asian and European markets. Global agencies are slashing India’s growth rates as domestic demand growth has slowed down more than anticipated earlier. Earnings season has started and the growth has not been very encouraging from the few Nifty companies that have declared their results so far,” Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager - Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management, said.

All eyes are now on the budget and government initiatives to revive the lagging economy, he added. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday lowered growth estimate for India to 4.8 per cent for 2019, citing stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth as the major factors for the downward revision. “Investors are profit booking in mid and small caps post the decent pre-budget rally. Some subdued results in Q3 compared to the solid expectation has triggered a consolidation in the market. We believe this is a rational reaction of the market which will hold in the short-term and can reverse as per the final outcome of Budget & Q3FY20 results,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex--nifty-tumble-on-tepid-q3-earnings--gdp-growth-concerns.html

168,22-1-20,Iran confirms 2 missiles fired at Ukraine airliner,"Iran has confirmed two missiles were fired at a Ukrainian airliner brought down this month, in a catastrophic error that killed all 176 people on board and sparked angry protests.

The country’s civil aviation authority said it has yet to receive a positive response after requesting technical assistance from France and the United States to decode black boxes from the downed airliner.

The Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines plane was accidentally shot down shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport on January 8. Iran has come under mounting international pressure to carry out a full and transparent investigation into the air disaster.

“Investigators... Discovered that two Tor-M1 missiles... Were fired at the aircraft,” Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation said in a preliminary report posted on its website late Monday.

It said an investigation was ongoing to assess the bearing their impact had on the accident.

The statement confirms a report in The New York Times which included video footage appearing to show two projectiles being fired at the airliner.

The Tor-M1 is a short-range surface-to-air missile developed by the former Soviet Union that is designed to target aircraft or cruise missiles.

Iran had for days denied Western claims based on US intelligence reports that the Boeing 737 operating Flight PS752 had been shot down.

It came clean on January 11, with the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace commander Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh accepting full responsibility.

But he said the missile operator who opened fire had been acting independently.

The deadly blunder triggered days of student-led protests mainly in the Iranian capital. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Friday that the demonstrations were unrepresentative of the Iranian people and accused the country’s enemies of exploiting the air disaster for propaganda purposes.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-confirms-2-missiles-fired-at-ukraine-airliner.html
169,22-1-20,China coronavirus: Death toll rises to 6 as leaders warn officials against cover up,"At least six persons have died of the new SARS-like virus in China with top leaders warning officials against any cover up of the information on its outbreak even as the WHO is considering declaring an international public health emergency to combat the deadly illness.

The number of infected people has also increased sharply to about 300 as the government scampered to contain its spread by increasing monitoring on the movement of public from the 12 million people strong Wuhan city from where the SARS-like virus was first reported in December.

The World Health Organization (WHO), which is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday, will consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola, BBC reported.

Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.

The week-long festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.

India has already issued a travel warning. Several countries started screening travellers coming from China, especially from Wuhan to detect symptoms like fever.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed on Monday about Chinese official’s attendance at the emergency meeting of the International Health Regulation (IHR) called by the WHO.

Experts from countries from where the virus is reported would also attend the meeting and share the information on the epidemic and come up with scientific solution, he said.

He said China has shared information with the WHO about the virus as well as the countries affected besides Hong Kong and Macau which are special administrative regions of China.

Meanwhile, as the fear grips Chinese cities, the country’s top leaders have warned lower-level officials against any cover up in the information relating to the spread of the new coronavirus.

China’s National Health Commission on Monday confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human. It said two people in Guangdong province had been infected this way. In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition.The workers presumably became infected with the virus due to the contact with patients.

170,22-1-20,Russian air strikes in Syria kill 15 civilians: Monitor,"Russian air strikes killed at least 15 civilians on Tuesday in northwestern Syria, as renewed violence tightened the noose around the country’s last major rebel-held bastion and deepened an already dire humanitarian crisis.

Retaliatory rocket attacks blamed on rebels and jihadists killed three more civilians in the government-held city of Aleppo in northern Syria, state news agency SANA said.

The spike in violence in the neighbouring provinces of Aleppo and Idlib follow so far unsuccessful diplomatic attempts to reduce hostilities in the flashpoint region, with the latest truce in theory going into effect less than two weeks ago.

Most of Idlib and parts of Aleppo province are still controlled by factions opposed to President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, including a group that includes onetime members of Al-Qaeda’s former Syria franchise.

The Damascus regime, which controls around 70 per cent of the country after nearly nine years of war, has repeatedly vowed to recapture the region.

On Tuesday, air strikes by regime-ally Russia on a rebel-held region in Aleppo’s western countryside killed eight members of the same family sheltering in a house, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Six children were among those killed in the raid on Kfar Taal village, where three girls already died a day earlier in strikes, according to the Britain-based monitor.

Another seven civilians were killed in Russian air strikes on western Aleppo and a southern region of Idlib.

“Over the past three days, the bombardment on Idlib and its surroundings, including in western Aleppo, has been exclusively Russian,” saud Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.

“They want to push rebels and jihadists away from the city of Aleppo and from the motorway linking Aleppo to Damascus,” Abdel Rahman said. SANA said rebel rocket fire on Tuesday also killed two women and a child in Aleppo city.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former wartime defence secretary who played a key role in ending Sri Lanka’s nearly 30-year civil war with the Tamil separatist rebels, told UN Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer last week that after the necessary investigations are completed steps would be taken to issue death certificates to these missing persons, the Colombo Gazette reported.

According to the government figures, over 20,000 people are missing due to various conflicts including the three-decade separatist war with Lankan Tamils in the north and east which claimed at least 100,000 lives.

The Tamils alleged that thousands were massacred during the final stages of the war that ended in 2009 when the government forces killed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.

Taiwan is at the vanguard of the burgeoning gay rights movement in Asia and became the first place in the region to legalise gay marriages last year after a bruising political fight.

Nearly 3,000 couples have since wed as of December but rights advocates say the law still contains restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples.

Same-sex couples can only wed foreigners from countries where gay marriage is also recognised and can only adopt their partners’ biological children.

“I hope President Tsai can see the difficulties international couples face,” said Lai Kai-li, whose partner is from conservative Malaysia.

“We feel like our futures are in limbo right now and we can’t really make any plans,” she added.

A 26-year-old Hong Konger -- who asked to be identified only as Yan -- said she longed for Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party to push further on gay rights. “Hong Kong doesn’t have freedom and human rights now and I think it would never recognise same-sex marriage,” she told reporters.

In case of a negative outcome, the telecom sector will essentially move towards duopoly kind of market benefiting Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio largely and the viability of other weaker players will be questioned amid uncertainty,” said Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Stock Broking.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to list next week the fresh pleas of telecom firms, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices, seeking a fresh schedule of payment of statutory dues to the tune of Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the Department of Telecommunications.

The telcos said they wanted an open court hearing on their fresh pleas with regard to working out fresh schedule of payment of their dues.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/telecom-stocks-mixed-after-sc-accepts-pleas.html
174,22-1-20,Trump touts ‘great American comeback’,"Shrugging off his impeachment trial back home, US President Donald Trump came out all guns blazing at the WEF summit here on Tuesday as he lauded the unprecedented economic boom in the United States and exhorted other nations to follow the American example of lower taxes and reduced regulations.

In his characteristic style, Trump also claimed that he shares an “extraordinary” relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and negotiations for the second phase of the US-China trade deal will commence soon.

Without directly mentioning climate change, Trump said he believed forecasts of apocalypse by the “perennial prophets of doom” were wrong.

In a special address at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit, Trump said since he last addressed Davos two years ago, the US has enjoyed the “great American comeback” that he had predicted.

“Today I am proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom the like of which has never been seen before,” he said.

The American dream is back and better than ever, Trump said.

According to him, 11 million jobs have been gained by America since his election and average unemployment rate is the lowest for the tenure of any US President in history.

Talking about reforms undertaken by his government, he said, “I knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people, cut taxes, slashed regulation, fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped American energy, that prosperity would come thundering back and that is exactly what happened.”

“Years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity,” he added.

“We have launched a historic step of removing job killing regulations. We are removing all archaic laws. Today I urge the nations to follow our example and liberate their citizens from the shackles of bureaucracy and other archaic laws. There is no better place on the earth than the United States,” the President asserted.

Amid simmering trade tensions between the US and China, Trump said the relationship with China has never been better. “We went through a rough patch, but things are good now,” he remarked.

The first phase of the trade deal between the two economic majors was signed recently, which has helped in reducing trade tensions which have been a major concern for the global economy.

Trump added that he shares a great relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“My relationship with Xi is extraordinary. He’s for China, I’m for the US but other than that, we love each other,” the American president said.

The second phase of negotiations for the US-China trade deal would begin soon and the administration is focussing on trade, which was neglected by his predecessors, Trump noted.

He also said that to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.

“They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers... They want to see us do badly, but we don’t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 80s. They always want to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives.

“We will never let radical socialism destroy our economy and wreck our country or eradicate our liberty,” he said.

Speaking at a session earlier in the day, young climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said a lot has happened since her campaign caught the eyes of the world but “nothing has been done” actually to save the planet.

While many leaders in Davos are talking about the need to end the use of fossil fuels, Trump said it was good news for all that the US was now “the number-one producer of natural gas, by far”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-touts----great-american-comeback----2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trump-touts----great-american-comeback---.html
175,22-1-20,Musk-run Tesla hit $100-bn market value for first time,"Signalling an all-electric future is coming our way, Elon Musk-run Tesla has hit the $100 billion in stock market valuation for the first time.

Tesla shares were last up 1.4 per cent at $555 after trading was closed on Tuesday, reports CNBC.

The milestone came less than a month after Tesla's stock crossed $420 -- a price Musk tweeted last year which put him in much trouble.

The $100 billion valuation must stay for both one-month and six-month average in order to help Musk get first of 12 tranches of $346 million in a record-breaking pay package.

Tesla is currently valued more than Ford Motor and General Motors combined.

Musk lost his position as Tesla Chairman after posting a notorious tweet in August last year that he was ""considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured"".

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over the tweet, saying he misled investors by claiming falsely he had lined up funding for the take-private transaction.

Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, agreeing to give up his role as Tesla Chairman and pay a $20 million fine.

Tesla surprised Wall Street in October by registering a profitable third quarter with a total revenue of $6.3 billion riding on sales of its Model S, Model X and Model 3 electric cars.

In the third quarter, automotive revenues were $5.35 billion. Tesla said it expected to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, representing 45-65 per cent growth.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/musk-run-tesla-hit--100-bn-market-value-for-first-time-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/musk-run-tesla-hit--100-bn-market-value-for-first-time.html
176,22-1-20,All must support WTO for global trade: Prabhu,"Former trade minister Suresh Prabhu on Wednesday said the WTO must be allowed to function freely and more efficiently for global trade to flourish, though some changes are evident in the multilateral institution going forward.

Speaking here at a session on 'The Great Indo Pacific Race', Prabhu also said oceans will play a very important role going forward, including for trade and security.

""We must allow free flow of trade and commerce in the Indo Pacific region. This region has huge growth potential provided there is cooperation and collaboration and improved connectivity,"" he said.

Prabhu, who is also the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's G20 Sherpa, said trade can create jobs and more business opportunities.

On World Trade Organization (WTO), he said, ""over a long period of time we have learnt and realised that multilateral bodies must be allowed to function freely and efficiently as they can promote economic integration.

""WTO in past few decades has allowed global trade to grow and we all must support it. Yes, we will need more changes in WTO going forward as the nature of global trade is very dynamic,"" he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-must-support-wto-for-global-trade--prabhu-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/all-must-support-wto-for-global-trade--prabhu.html
177,22-1-20,"GAIL to invest over Rs 45,000 cr to create infra for gas-based economy","GAIL India Ltd, the country's largest gas utility, plans to invest over Rs 45,000 crore over the next five years to expand the National Gas Pipeline Grid and city gas distribution network to help push for greater use of environment-friendly fuel, its chairman Ashutosh Karnatak said.

The gas pipelines are planned to take the fuel to the east and northeast regions as well as to consumers in the south as part of the government push to raise the share of natural gas in India's energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.2 per cent, he said.

GAIL's push for the creation of infrastructure is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of creating a gas-based economy that is less reliant on polluting fuels for meeting its energy needs.

""Before we transition to zero-emission technologies (for both automobiles and factories) say by 2040/2050, natural gas is best suited for tapering emissions from current levels,"" he said. ""Natural gas is 'happy fuel' as it has a fraction of emissions compared to alternate liquid fuels such as diesel in automobiles and coal in power plants.""

India currently consumes some 160 million standard cubic meters of gas per day and consumption has to rise to 400 mmscmd to reach 15 per cent share in the energy mix, he said, adding GAIL is playing its responsibility by creating the infrastructure for the same.

GAIL currently operates 12,160-km of pipeline network and markets two-thirds of all-natural gas sold in the country. It is currently executing more than 5,500 kilometers of pipeline projects and a similar length is at the planning stage.

Karnatak said the projects at hand include the ambitious Urja Ganga Project to take gas to Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand as well as Kochi-Kootanad-Bangalore-Mangalore line and the Indradhanush North East Gas Grid. ""These pipelines will connect supply and demand centers envisaged under the National Gas Grid.""

Besides pipelines, GAIL is also expanding city gas distribution (CGD) networks for retailing of CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to household kitchens. Investments are also planned for the expansion of petrochemical plants.

GAIL is looking to put up 400 CNG stations and give out a record 10 lakh piped natural gas (PNG) connections to household kitchens in the next 3-5 years.

The company is building a 2,655-km gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha. ""Pipeline up to Patna has already been commissioned and the rest of the project will be completed by end 2020,"" he said.

Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project, also known as the 'Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga' project, was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in July 2015. GAIL has commenced city gas operations in all the six geographical areas (GAs), including in Patna and Bhubaneshwar, that was awarded to it along the Urja Ganga route, he said.

The pipeline will be extended to Guwahati by laying an additional 750-km line. At Guwahati, it would interconnect with the upcoming 1,500-km 'Indradhanush' pipeline network conceived to operate in the northeast region by the public sector oil and gas majors.

GAIL will also lay a 600 km Srikakulam-Angul natural gas pipeline.

""Renewable power is set to grow to 227 GW by 2030 and gas has a complementary role in effectively addressing intermittency and supplying peaking load,"" Karnatak said, adding gas-based power generation can take over during the night or on not so sunny days in areas getting solar power and also supplement hydro and wind projects during downtime.

He said 20-22 GW of coal-fired power plants are obsolete and 25 GW of stranded gas power assets could be utilised to help meet the carbon emission objectives of India, he noted.

Gas can also be used as fuel in steel plants, oil refineries, industries, and transportation, he said, estimating that power sector alone would need 100 mmscmd of gas and 50-55 mmscmd each would go for city gas distribution and fertiliser plants. Steel plants and refineries can consume 70 mmscmd between them.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gail-to-invest-over-rs-45-000-cr-to-create-infra-for-gas-based-economy-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/gail-to-invest-over-rs-45-000-cr-to-create-infra-for-gas-based-economy.html

179,22-1-20,Historic Trump impeachment trial begins in Senate,"President Donald Trump’s historic impeachment trial begins in earnest Tuesday in the Senate, with Democrats calling for his removal from office and Republicans determined to acquit him — and quickly, if possible.

Four months after the Ukraine scandal exploded and went on to overshadow the end of Trump’s term, and 10 months before Americans go to the polls to decide whether to re-elect him, the 100 members of the Senate will gather at 1 PM (1800 GMT) with chief justice John Roberts presiding over the trial.

The job of these lawmakers, sworn in last week as jurors, is to decide if Trump abused his office and obstructed Congress as charged in two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House of Representatives.

They state that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 US election to help him win, and then tried to thwart a congressional probe of his behavior.

It will be only the third time a president has endured an impeachment trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999.

Part of the scandal centers on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s potential opponent in the November vote.

Democrats, who control the House of Representatives and led the investigation, accuse Trump of manipulating Ukraine by withholding nearly $400 million in military aid for its war against Russian-backed separatists and a White House meeting for Zelensky until the latter announced a Biden probe.

“The president did nothing wrong,” Trump’s lawyers responded in a 110-page brief submitted to the Senate on Monday.

This echoes the repeated assertions of the 73-year-old real estate magnate that the saga is a political witch hunt and a hoax, and that his phone call with the Ukrainian leader was “perfect.” In the president’s brief, his 12-man legal team contested the very idea of his impeachment. They called the two articles of impeachment — approved largely along party lines in the Democratic-controlled House — the product of “a rigged process” and “constitutionally deficient on their face” because they involved no violation of established law.

That team, which has recruited high profile lawyers such as Kenneth Starr, who tried to bring down Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, said in the brief, “The Senate should reject the Articles of Impeachment and acquit the president immediately.”

“President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,” the House managers said Saturday in a memorandum. They said the president’s behavior “is the Framers’ worst nightmare,” referring to the authors of the US Constitution, and that Trump deserves to be removed from office.

But Trump looks almost certain to be acquitted because of the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate. He will be abroad as his trial opens; Trump left late Monday for the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland. How long the trial will last is up in the air. The first order of business Tuesday will be to set the rules, such as how long they will hear the arguments of the House managers, or prosecutors; how long they will hear the defense; the time allotted for questions, submitted by the senators but read by Roberts; and whether they will call witnesses or seek other evidence.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/historic-trump-impeachment-trial-begins-in-senate.html

181,22-1-20,Improve your score,"Some may not have fared well in the JEE Mains held in January. Fret not, the April session gives another chance. Here’s what aspirants need to do this time to ace it, says Ramesh Batlish

The JEE Main 2020 was held in January between January 6-9, 2020. Around 9.2 lakh candidates had registered out of which around 8.7 lakh appeared. The result was announced and nine students scored 100 percentile from across the country.

However, the Common Rank List for JEE Main 2020 will be available in the first week of May after the declaration of the results of the April exam. The higher of the two scores of candidates who have appeared in either/both JEE Main January and April 2020will be considered for final ranking of JEE Main 2020.

The list will denote the All India and category ranks of the candidates in addition to the details of the candidates and marks obtained. The JEE Main rank will be the basis for admissions to the NITs, IIITs and GFTIs.

For those who could not do well in the January session need not worry as the April session is another chance for all students who wish to improve their scores. The following points must be kept in mind when taking up the April session of JEE Main 2020.

Here are some dos and don’t to avoid for the session in April:

One must not repeat the same mistakes committed in January session of JEE Main. Learning from mistakes is important.

Complete your syllabi if not done earlier.

Practice questions from previous year JEE Main papers and even from January session of JEE 2020.

Use the gap between your Boards to revise and take up mock tests on online mode from reputed source for consistency in preparation.

Keep a check on your speed and accuracy as it is also important as to how you solve the paper for a high score.

You must have done the test analysis of the JEE Paper you took in January and ensure you are confident with each of those questions now.

Take help from your subject teachers to clear your doubts and speak to them in case of any conceptual doubts or problems which you are unable to solve.

Prepare a quick revision plan and categorise the chapters like:

Easy: Generally you can solve any problem from these chapter/topic

Moderate: You take time to solve but your concepts of these chapters are clear

Difficult: You have not been able to understand the concepts in these chapter and find questions from these chapters tough.

While revising ensure you take help from your teachers for the difficult chapters and get all your concepts cleared as merely devoting time on these chapters may not help. You can join crash course for these topics.

For moderate chapters you will need more practice so devote time daily so that you have completed solving adequate no. of questions from these chapters.

For the chapters/topics you find easy it is important that you are always able to solve any given question from them.You must solve some questions even from these topics but avoid spending too much time on these as you are already good in these chapters.

While solving questions keep a check on your time and develop short cuts to avoid lengthy calculations. Use of diagrams/graphs will expedite your answers.

Try to remember all important formulae, named reactions as this will add to your speed while solving.

Your speed, accuracy and time management will be an important parameter for success in JEE Main (April), 2020.

Most importantly take care of your physical and mental fitness as there are external factors influencing your performance in the exam.

Avoid taking up new books or start any new chapters before the exam as this may spoil your confidence level.

Maintain a positive attitude throughout your preparation and remain focused. Staying confident and keeping calm while taking the exam also helps get a desired score.

Remember, it is the relative performance and not just how you have performed on the exam day.

Give in your best shot and you will ace JEE Main.

182,22-1-20,‘Learn & develop with content in real time’,"Organisations are making jobs leaner. It is important that new employees learn work assigned as quickly as possible, say SJ Raj

As organisations continually work toward making jobs leaner and people more efficient, jobs are quickly being automated. The speed with which a new employee can learn their job directly affects the speed of production and efficiency of the employee. And so, it is not only the nature of work that is changing, but also the way work is learned.

Learning and Working Simultaneously

Picture an industrial set up where a new engineer, who was given on-the-job training through audio, visual, and demonstrative sessions, comes across a machine he has never operated before. Considering that it is likely that engineer would not remember their training completely, they may fumble with the machine.

Now picture the same new engineer faced with a new machine, but this time, the machine has an automated bot giving real-time instructions on how to operate it. The new employee not only hears the content, but simultaneously gets hands-on experience with the machine directly.

Since participative learning methods, such as practice,result in a much higher retention rate of new learning than passive learning methods, such as lectures and demonstrations, this real-time training not only results in faster learning, but also makes the employee productive much sooner.

As repetition is the best way to strengthen new skills, a new employee may use the instructions from the bot every time until they feel completely ready to operate/work on their own. Such participative learning methods are more engaging, and the learner is unlikely to zone out while learning hands-on.

Rise of Smart Technology-Aided Learning

While more and more companies have incorporated virtual training labs, some are now also experimenting with virtual reality and augmented technology-based learning programmes, creating life-like situations to learn from.

Such applications are especially valuable in supporting engineers and technicians to learn the specific nuances of their roles on the job itself. For other non-mechanical roles, cloud-based, hands-on virtual labs continue to offer the cognitive learning and practice required for better retention.

AI is being used to design individual learning programmes by understanding and capitalising upon the individuals’ information, such as experience, educational backgrounds, personality insights, career goals, and learning preferences. This AI-assisted learning allows employees to take control of their learning and development with content that can be updated in real time.

AI and bots are also enabling faster and more accurate learning. Bots used for hands-on training may be programmed to pick up on feedback and comments from new employees in real time, tag that feedback appropriately, and get other employees or trainers to share their thoughts, expertise, and experiences, thus maintaining the human touch to the learning process.

Ideal Training Model

Great on-the-job training is a collective of methods, including simulation, practice, coaching, experiencing, and peer learning. On-the-job training must allow a learner to continuously reinforce what has been taught through practice.

As organisations step into the future and push to train their employees more efficiently and comprehensively, support from automated bots and artificial intelligence, paired with the expertise of mentors and senior management, is helping to build the ideal on-the-job training platform.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---learn---develop-with-content-in-real-time---.html
183,22-1-20,MindIT,"Empowering one's own self should trigger from within. Many of us have those triggers coming from within but, we succumb to the external factors and consciously make that voice coming from within, die down. This is worst we can do to ourselves.

Nature in its grand design has empowered us with unmatchable inner strength and powers. All one needs is to do that introspection and find our own legend.

Applying the power of three As, one would not have to wait for an external trigger to experience empowerment. The three As — Accept, Analyse, and Adopt — help one to experience empowerment inside-out. We all are having multiple influencing layers on to our own real-self. These layers influence our belief system and the subsequent thoughts and actions. One needs to identify these layers, and peel them to reach their core to further empower it.

Accept

Relieving oneself from own belief system is a process which requires a lot of determination. The first step to empowerment is to accept. Accept that you need to explore your real self, Accept that you are influenced by multiple external layers which need to be handled and accept that you have enough power to bring the best out of you.

These little acceptances coupled up with a persistent process of being mindful will start a journey of exploring yourself. Be aware of what your real self is saying to you, listen to it. Remember, you can listen to it only when you are ready to question your self and the surrounding circumstances. If you do not question you will not be able to accept. Acceptance of your current circumstances is key to your journey to empowerment.

Analyse

The second part of your journey is to decide what to do and what not to do. This is another important aspect of your journey where you use your intellect to identify and weigh various pros and cons of your decisions. Identify the you in you. The easiest way to know it, is to identify and analyse your feelings to various experiences and circumstances.

You need to removed multiple layers on your belief system which stop you to take action in particular direction. You should identify your core interest and strength then identify and select the field you wish to grow your career. This analysis is never easy to come. If your decisions continue to be influenced by your belief system your journey to the core will become equally difficult.

You must have a flexible mindset while you do this analysis. This flexible mindset will allow you to be more pragmatic in your reasoning and dealing with your influencing layers. Listen to your heart and the language of your heart is feelings. Never, let your feelings go waste, analyse them.

Adopt

The third A — adopt, is the most important as it lies in the action zone and requires you to take action for actualising your decisions. This requires a lot of resolve, will power and focus. Resolution remains weak if it is not coupled up with will power and focus to drive it.

All you need to do is to take the first step with full conviction, will power and focus. You must identify gaps in your resolution, reason out the lack in your will power and focus to adopt changes to go after your decision with full zeal.

You are already empowered, all you need to do is to be aware of the fact that you are empowered and take pragmatic logical steps to bring the power within to life.

186,22-1-20,‘Time is of essence when applying for a UG course’,"Want to study abroad after Class XII? The prep needs to start now, says Abhishek Singhal

What is the right time to begin preparations for studying abroad?

The answer to this is quite simple: Now! Given that the application can be filed in even two weeks, there's nothing to stop you from giving it a shot. While it is possible to apply for admission over a fortnight, an application that can pull its own weight, something that is bound to stand out and get noticed, that takes much longer. It is not a preparation for going abroad that you are looking for, it is preparation to be the best you can be. And for that, the earlier you begin, the better it is.

For UG Programmes

If you are in Class IX or X, and are keen on studying abroad start by exploring topics of interest. Aim to increase your general awareness, and then establish long term interests and commitments. Over a period of time, enroll in activities that could showcase your interests and skill sets. This kind of exposure helps students develop a better sense of maturity.

A child who follows international conflicts closely, understands diplomatic relations, and keeps tabs on current developments could possibly benefit. Similarly, children from a science background could increase their awareness in a specialised area by reading up about it, by participating in workshops, or even possibly doing online courses.

Expand interests by exploring different avenues. Join classes, camps, or workshops. Try out new activities, hone your existing skills, and use your free time proactively. Starting out early is ideal not just to build your portfolio, but also, most importantly, to figure out what your strengths and interests really are.

In Class XI/XII, it will be time to begin preparation for tests like SAT, ACT or AP. These are key scores for admission applications. An early start gives you the upper hand in preparations.

Consider how you can give better shape to your interests and activities. At this time, give direction to interests. If you are a football player, try to play at a higher level. You could even consider doing online courses (MOOCs) if you have time and inclination.

187,22-1-20,In Brief,"What to expect from this budget

According to Rupal Dalal, Executive Director, JD Institute of Fashion Technology: “The education needs an overhaul and we expect to see a reform-oriented education policy in 2020. The biggest challenge in the education sector is achieving higher literacy and employment.”

Today youths comprise 34.33 per cent of India’s population. In the last Budget, the Centre had allocated Rs 93,847.64 crore for the education sector, of which Rs 37,461.01 crores was earmarked for higher education. We expect the allocation to increase in the upcoming Union Budget 2020.

The Government should focus on providing affordable and quality education to all. “The role of technology and e-learning programmes will be key. We hope to see the Budget to introduce new programs in higher education. These schemes should offer re-skilling, up-skilling, e-education and vocational studies. The government should also create low-cost institutions for primary, secondary and higher education,” she added.

New UG and PG courses at rishihood varsity

The Rishihood University invites applications for the first batch of students looking to apply for under gaduate and post graduate programmes in Entrepreneurship, Healthcare, Education and Creativity. First phase of courses is slated to begin in the third week of July, 2020.

The university aims to integrate lifelong learning transcending age, subject choice and society by working with students, individuals pursuing higher education and working professionals.

A recent Niti Aayog report states that more than 53 per cent of individuals passing out from higher education institutions are unemployable.

Speaking on the launch of the programmes, Sahil Aggarwal, Co-Founder & CEO of Rishihood University said: “India is on the cusp of becoming a major contributor to the world's knowledge economy by 2030. Therefore, the entire ecosystem of educational institutions, Government and corporations must prepare today’s youth for an ever evolving and volatile transition.”

188,22-1-20,Be smarter than AI,"AI is growing in every sector and creating fear for many job holders and seekers. However, there are programmers who can do what AI can’t and may never be able to, says ANKIT Dudhwewala

In the early part of the last decade, the word outsourcing struck fear in the hearts of professionals in developed countries. White-collar workers feared their jobs would be outsourced to India, where someone would do them for a fraction of the salary than those expected in industrialised countries. Thankfully, outsourcing was a win-win for those in western countries and Indians because it created more jobs in developed countries than were offshored.

Today, there is fear that jobs of almost every kind will be automated. Physicians, lawyers, software architects, and others with highly-skilled, well-paying jobs never feared their jobs would be outsourced. Still, today they are concerned that Artificial Intelligence will become sophisticated enough to make them redundant. Software is becoming exceptionally advanced: What seemed impossible 10 years back, today seems just over the horizon. Self-driving vehicles are an example. Before 2008, few believed AI would be intelligent ever to drive cars itself. Today while much needs to be done to improve AI, most believe it is only a matter of time before it replaces humans behind the wheel.

The prowess of AI behind the wheel is only one example of machines doing jobs that were believed only humans could. Artificial Intelligence is getting better every year at writing its own software code. But AI’s growing prowess doesn’t mean it is only a matter of time before programmers become obsolete. There are a lot of programmers that can do what AI cannot and may never be able to. Programmers and designers who have expertise in the following software can rest easy that their jobs are unlikely to be assigned to AI.

AutoCAD

Engineers, architects, and designers who know AutoCAD will remain in demand. The modelling capabilities of AutoCAD let virtually any form and its components be modelled. What will make knowledge of AutoCAD so valuable to employers is it requires users to have an imagination as well as technical skills. Artificial Intelligence may be able to replicate human actions and make accurate predictions using more data points than humans. Still, it cannot, and may never be able to imagine. The ability of humans to imagine is a reason professionals who know AutoCAD will always be in demand.

Spark

The economy of the future will be data-driven, so there will continue to be a massive demand for those who understand how to use data science tools. Spark is the most popular data science tool. Hence, professionals who know how to use it will have little difficulty working in well-paying jobs. Using Spark, they will be able to accurately model consumer behaviour and make predictions that result in higher sales. While AI’s ability to make predictions is uncanny, employers need people who know how to extract compelling stories from data. A critical reason expertise in Spark will be crucial for future success is it will remain the best data science tool for the foreseeable future.

Selenium

Software testing is essential to roll out products that work as expected. Selenium is a vital software testing tool because much of it is automated. Software testers need to know how to use Selenium to put the software through the right tests. To do so, they must select the proper tests and author computerised tests. Knowing Selenium, they can do both.

The software is essential because it saves enormous time and effort in testing: Those with knowledge of the software will enjoy careers that are future proof.

C# for Unity

Creating games is challenging, fun, and can be extremely lucrative. Unity is one of the most popular game engines. Newbie game developers can bring their vision to life using C# for Unity. In addition to game developers, designers can use C# for Unity to work inside Unity’s Integrated Immersive Environment and create a virtual world. Because consumers have grown accustomed to outstanding visual experiences in games and also expect interactive virtual environments, knowing how to use C# in Unity is a hugely valuable asset. Those who know how to use C# in Unity will be prized resources for many organisations.

Depending on whose narrative is believed, automation is either a decimating job or is overhyped. The reality likely rests in the middle and should be cause for concern among professionals. Millions of developers are working to make AI smarter. AI is doing the same itself as well. While fear of outsourcing was overblown, AI’s ability to replace humans is not. Gradually more jobs will be assigned to AI. Yet, engineers and designers with expertise in the mentioned software may remain immune to its encroachment for decades, if not longer.

190,22-1-20,‘Liberal Arts help prepare good leaders’,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with Elizabeth Bradley about what the approach is, its benefits and how it makes students future ready

What is the liberal arts approach to education?

It is focused on providing students a world view, empowering them to approach complexity, change and diversity in a better manner, for example through the lens of science, culture and society.

A liberal arts education is needed to impart key communication skills (writing, speaking and negotiating); expose students to many disciplines like arts, humanities, and the social, natural and information sciences; and empower students to innovate, be creative and entrepreneurial, and chart their own paths in becoming engaged citizens and community role models.

What are its benefits?

A liberal arts education teaches one how to learn, how to think creatively, and how to communicate effectively. These are critical skills for leadership in the 21st century.

How does this approach help prepare students for all the challenges that lie ahead?

In a changing world, the most important skill is to be able to adapt, to take in new information and make sense of the situation. Learning how to learn is consistent with the liberal arts approach, where students learn across many different styles, topics and paradigms.

The liberal arts and humanities are vital to our future, preparing students for the challenges they will confront in their professional, political, social and cultural lives.

What should the Indian government do to promote liberal arts education?

The draft new education policy is a great step to recognise the importance of the liberal arts education.

Next will be needed resources devoted to infrastructure, increasing awareness about the benefits of such education, supporting faculty and students, and perhaps even supporting more international exchange programmes to learn from other countries as well.

How does the approach help in getting better jobs?

If there is one thing common in every job, it is human interaction. The humanities — the academic fields that study the human condition, society and culture — prepare young adults for the most essential aspects of work: getting along with other people, understanding multiple points of view and coming to terms with one’s place in the world.

As such, students of all majors need exposure to the humanities to be adequately — and practically — prepared for the working world. The return on investment of a Vassar liberal arts education can be seen in our excellent outcomes, with 95 per cent of students being employed, in graduate school or on a competitive fellowship within six months of graduation.

Partnership/collaborations that Vassar has entered into?

In the summer of 2019 Vassar partnered with the University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) in Rwanda, to teach classes in the humanities and sciences, helping shape the way medical education is delivered in Africa in the future; and forged a partnership with Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, enabling Vassar students to earn a master’s degree in public health a year after they graduate from Vassar.

Vassar was also in China this summer, exploring opportunities to incorporate a liberal arts model in a local context with gifted high school students there. In partnership with the Diligence & Delight Learning Center in Beijing, we ran a three-week program taught by Vassar faculty, exposing students to a liberal arts classroom environment.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---liberal-arts-help-prepare-good-leaders---.html
191,22-1-20,Fight career barriers,"Every number in numerology indicates towards a certain career and the person should choose his career according to the number of his destiny/conductor number. Through numerology we also understand the relationship or affinity or enmity between various numbers. So, we should not select that career, which becomes a barrier towards our success.

Let us take a few examples. Suppose a person whose destiny number is two, ruled by Moon and which is soft, artistic, caring, has interest in music, singing, and in case if he chooses the career of marketing, architect, salesman, which are characteristics of number five, then he is bound to fail. So, in this way we can avoid misfortunes.

Similarly, a person having destiny number one, ruled by Sun always aspires for managerial positions, head of the company, bureaucrats, politicians and if they choose a career in media, film industry, cosmetics, which are characteristics of number six, they will never be successful and will have to leave the job.

A person having destiny number seven is inclined towards spiritualism, meditation, politics and now if they choose a career in salesmanship, job in defence forces like army and air force, which are characteristics of number nine, then they will not gel with the profile.

People having destiny number eight are good organisers, inclined towards justice, good in banking and commerce, if they choose the career of share market, gambling, entertainment, which are characteristics of number seven, then their chances of growth will become less.

Hence, if a person chooses a career matching with his destiny number then his/her chances of becoming successful increases.

195,22-1-20,Sarfaraz hits unbeaten ton as Mumbai fight back against UP,"Young Sarfaraz Khan hit an unbeaten century as Mumbai fought back on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group B game against Uttar Pradesh here on Tuesday.

UP had posted a mammoth 625/8 declared in their first essay, courtesy Upendra Yadavs unbeaten double hundred (203 not out).

Mumbai resumed the day on their overnight score of 20/2 and had a mountain to climb.

Thanks to herculean effort by ‘crisis man’ Siddhesh Lad (98 off 174 balls; 10x4x1x6), who lived up to his billing and 22-year-old Sarfaraz (132 not out off 160 balls; 14x4; 4x6), the duo gave Mumbai the confidence that UPs first- inning score could be overhauled.

Overnight batsmen Bhupen Lalwani (43 off 80 balls; 5x4) and Hardik Tamore (51 off 94 balls; 10x4) had an uphill task on hand of surviving the morning session against the experienced Ankit Rajpoot and Yash Dayal.

They negated the challenge well and stitched a crucial 75-run stand for the third wicket.

Pacer Wajid Ali gave the visitors the much needed break-through after he trapped Lalwani in front of the wicket as Mumbai lost their third wicket at 91.

Tamore then notched up his maiden first-class fifty by driving Ali through the covers for a four, but could not convert it into a big score.

Bengal rout Hyderbad in 3 days

Kalyani (WB): Rookie spin all-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed shone with a first-innings hat-trick in a six-wicket match haul as Bengal thrashed a sloppy Hyderabad by an innings and 303 runs for their first win of the ongoing Ranji Trophy season, here on Tuesday.

The 25-year-old, who was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for the 2020 edition of the IPL, claimed the feat in his seventh Ranji appearance.

Shahbaz (4/26) ran through the Hyderabad lower order to help his side bundle out the visitors for 171 in their first innings. Following on, Hyderabad were all out for 161 with Shahbaz (2/51) accounting for two batsmen.

Shahbaz became the seventh player from Bengal, and first since India pacer Mohammed Shami, to claim a Ranji Trophy hat-trick. Shami had achieved the milestone against Madhya Pradesh in 2012-13.

Rookie pacer Akash Deep (4/38) was the star in Hyderabad’s second essay as Hyderabad were bundled out in 46.2 overs.

Bengal had scored 635 for seven declared in their first innings after electing to bat.

J&K posts win over Odisha

Cuttack: Jammu & Kashmir bounced back superbly after conceding first innings lead to pull off a four-wicket win over Odisha on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Group ‘C’match here on Tuesday.

Resuming its second innings at 136 for seven, Odisha could add only 30 runs as Umar Nazir picked up the last three wickets—Rajesh Mohanty, Suryakant Pradhan and Rajesh Dhuper.

Chasing 204 for a win, J&K opener Suryansh Raina (69) and Shubam Pundir (45) added 79 runs for the third wicket to lay the platform for an easy win.

Abdul Samad with a knock of 30 not out and the first-innings bowling hero Aquib Nabi (26 not out) too the side over the finish line.

For the home team, Basant Mohanty bowled his heart out and picked up four wickets in the second innings but could not prevent J&K from romping home.

196,22-1-20,Sharapova hits all-time low,"Maria fails to overcome first round hurdle in third consecutive Slam; Nadal launches record bid with easy win

Top seed Rafael Nadal turned on the style as he launched his bid for a record-equalling 20th Major title at the Australian Open on Tuesday, but falling star Maria Sharapova hit a career low.

Australia's Nick Kyrgios also cantered into the second round, but fourth seed Daniil Medvedev had to fight his way past American Frances Tiafoe in four sets.

Nadal, one shy of Roger Federer’s Grand Slam mark, dropped only five games as he swatted aside Bolivia's Hugo Dellien 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 in just over two hours at a sunny Rod Laver Arena.

“It was a positive start,” said the reigning Roland Garros and US Open champion, wearing a bright pink singlet and matching trainers.

“What you want in the first round is just to win, and it’s better if it's in straight sets.”

He joins Federer and defending champion Novak Djokovic in round two as the Big Three look to tighten a stranglehold that has brought them all but one of the last 14 Australian Open titles.

Nadal, the first player to be world number one in three different decades, is still thriving at 33 but it's a different story for five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova.

The 32-year-old, playing on a wildcard as she wrestles with a shoulder injury, lost 6-3, 6-4 to Croatian 19th seed Donna Vekic, making her an opening-round loser at three straight Grand Slams for the first time.

The future looks uncertain for the former world number one, who won Wimbledon when she was just 17 but has not reached a Grand Slam final since she lifted the 2014 French Open trophy.

“I can speak about my struggles and the things that I've gone through with my shoulder, but it’s not really in my character to,” Sharapova said.

“I was there, I put myself out there (playing). As tough as it was, I finished the match — it wasn’t the way that I wanted.” Britain’s Johanna Konta, a two-time Slam semi-finalist, also fell at the first hurdle as she battles to overcome a knee problem, losing 4-6, 2-6 to unseeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur.

Stormy Fognini

On a bumper day of 88 first-round matches, after rain wiped out half of Monday’s schedule, former US Open champion Marin Cilic and Milos Raonic both moved safely through.

Italy’s Fabio Fognini, two sets down against America’s Reilly Opelka when their match was suspended on Monday, returned to win it in five after a stormy encounter when both players argued furiously with the umpire.

A new star emerged in 18-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner, last year's NextGen champion, who earned his first Grand Slam victory against Australia’s Max Purcell. Australia's Kyrgios, who has spearheaded fundraising efforts for the country's deadly bushfire disaster, kept his notorious temper in check despite being taken to two tie-breaks in a 6-2, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7-1) win over Lorenzo Sonego of Italy.

“I feel super-comfortable, you guys are the best. I feel the support.... I am ready to go again,” Kyrgios told the crowd.

Medvedev, the narrow loser to Nadal in September’s US Open final, dropped the second set against Tiafoe before recovering to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.

Austria’s Dominic Thiem, who has reached the last two French Open finals, went through in straight sets against Adrian Mannarino, while 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka needed four to get past Damir Dzumhur.

Seventh seed Alexander Zverev beat Marco Cecchinato in straight sets but there was disappointment for France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 2008 finalist, who retired with a back injury against Australia’s Alexei Popyrin.

Elsewhere, women’s fourth seed Simona Halep survived some painful-looking falls to beat America’s Jennifer Brady, and 2016 champion Angelique Kerber dropped only four games against Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sharapova-hits-all-time-low-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sharapova-hits-all-time-low.html

198,22-1-20,ODIs this year could be used for World T20 preparation: Shastri,"Winning a World title is an ""obsession"" for India coach Ravi Shastri, who says the upcoming six ODIs against New Zealand and South Africa could be used as a platform for his team's preparations for the global T20 championship in Australia this October.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, the head coach spoke on a range of issues including the legacy he wants to create, preparations for the marquee meet, team culture and unfortunate injuries to his players.

""That toss will be taken out of the equation, we will play well irrespective of conditions, of opponents and in every country of the world. That's what our aim is and that is what we are chasing. Yes, the World Cup remains an obsession and we will do all to fulfil that ambition,"" Shastri said ahead of the start of India's tour of New Zealand.

India will play five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Test matches starting with the shortest format on January 24. The ODI series against South Africa is to be held in March.

The hallmark of this team is enjoying each others' success, said Shastri.

""The word 'I' is not there in our dictionary. It's 'we'. That's what this team stands for. It celebrates each other's achievements because it's the team that wins,"" he added.

So, is there a possibility that the ODIs held this year will be an extension of T20s, the former India captain replied: ""Yes, I believe it's very much possible.""

The 2-1 series win against a full-strength Australian side was a reflection of the Indian team's ""mental strength"", which came back strongly after being outplayed in the opening game.

""The Australia series was proof of the mental strength and the ability to play under pressure. After the hammering at the Wankhede, to come back and play like the way we did, merits a lot of credit and praise.

""It showed courage and as Virat used the word brave, it showed we are unafraid to play brave cricket and with intent,"" said Shastri.

While no one can deny that Shastri is pleased as punch with the series win against the mighty Australians, the 57-year-old now wants to only think about the new series.

""This team lives in the present. Whatever has happened in the past is history. We look to do what we did well in the past, in future also.

Skipper Virat Kohli has already said that KL Rahul keeping wickets is an option and Shastri seconded the view, saying he is happy that the team has got a multipurpose player of Rahul's quality.

""We love options,"" he said.

The only thing that makes him ""sad"" is Shikhar Dhawan, who has been ruled out of the New Zealand assignment due to shoulder dislocation.

""Very sad because he (Dhawan) is a senior player. He is a match-winner. When someone suffers an injury of that sort, everyone is hurt in the team,"" he said.

Known for his plain speak, Shastri rejected rumours that Kedar Jadhav has outlived his utility as an ODI player even though he is bowling rarely in international games.

""Kedar is an integral part of the ODI team that will play in New Zealand. He will be treated like every other player.""

It's been quite a while since Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal featured together in the playing XI in white ball games.

Will they be seen together?

""That's a call we will take. We play 'Horses for Courses'. We will judge it in that direction.""

Suryakumar Yadav's name has been propped up as an explosive power-hitter in the playing XI. The coach was non-committal on what was his take on the subject.

""That's a selector's job. I don't get involved in that department as such,"" he said.

He also wasn't bothered by the kind of surfaces New Zealand will dish out.

202,22-1-20,SC says it may refer pleas challenging CAA to larger constitution bench,"Making clear it will not stay the Citizenship (Amendment) Act without hearing the Centre, the Supreme Court on Wednesday gave the government four weeks to respond to petitions challenging the act and said a five-judge Constitution bench will hear the matter.

Hearing a batch of 143 petitions, an apex court bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notice to the Centre and restrained all high courts from hearing pleas on the CAA till it decides on the pleas.

The bench, also comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna, said it will hear the petitions pertaining to Assam and Tripura separately as the problem with the CAA in these two states is different from rest of the country.

""The matter is uppermost in everybody's mind. We will form a five-judge bench and then list the case,"" the court said.

Asserting that it will not grant any stay on the CAA without hearing the Centre on the matter, it said, ""Will pass order on granting any interim relief to petitioner opposing CAA after four weeks.""

The court also made it clear it will not pass any ex-parte order without hearing the Centre on staying the operation of the CAA and exercise of the National Population Register (NPR).

It said the earlier cut off date for citizenship in Assam was March 24, 1971 and noted that it has been extended till December 31, 2014 under the CAA.

The petitions concerning Tripura and Assam as well as the matters related to Uttar Pradesh, which is going ahead with the implementation of CAA without framing any rules, can be dealt with separately, the bench said.

The bench said it will decide in-chamber the modalities of hearing the batch of petitions on the CAA and may fix them for day-to-day hearing after four weeks.

Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, told the bench the government has been given copies of around 60 pleas out of the 143 petitions. He said it wanted time to respond to all the pleas.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal urged the bench to put on hold operation of the CAA and postpone the NPR exercise for the moment.

The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.

President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on December 12, turning it into an Act.

Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA. Among those who have filed pleas are the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi.

The IUML said in its plea that the CAA violates the fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion.

The petition had alleged that the government's CAA was against the basic structure of the Constitution and intended to explicitly discriminate against Muslims as the Act extended benefits only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians.

The plea filed by Ramesh said the Act is a ""brazen attack"" on core fundamental rights envisaged under the Constitution and treats ""equals as unequal"".

The other petitioners include the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the All Assam Students Union (AASU), the Peace Party, the CPI, NGOs Rihai Manch and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-says-it-may-refer-pleas-challenging-caa-to-larger-constitution-bench-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-says-it-may-refer-pleas-challenging-caa-to-larger-constitution-bench.html

204,22-1-20,De Kock replaces Faf as ODI skipper,"Quinton de Kock was on Tuesday named as South Africa’s one-day international captain as part of a long term transition plan.

His first assignment will be to lead the team in a three-match series against World Cup champions England, starting in Cape Town on February 4.

Test and Twenty20 captain Faf du Plessis was not in a 15-man squad named by Cricket South Africa on Tuesday despite committing himself to the organisation until the World Cup T20 in Oct and November. Independent selector Linda Zondi said Du Plessis' omission did not signal the end of his ODI career.

“We decided to rest Faf and Kagiso Rabada for this series because they have both played a lot of cricket,” said Zondi.

“A different squad will be picked for a T20 series against England after the one-day games and after that there are still T20s and ODIs against Australia.” Zondi said the appointment of De Kock was part of succession planning leading up to the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

In his press conference after the third Test against England on Monday, Du Plessis said there was an opportunity to relieve some of the pressure on his captaincy. De Kock, 27, has previously captained South Africa in two one-day internationals and two T20 internationals.

Graeme Smith, CSA acting director of cricket, said De Kock was one of the best wicketkeeper-batsmen in the world.

“He has a unique outlook and manner in which he goes about his business and is tactically very street smart,” said Smith. “We are confident that the new leadership role will bring out the best in him as a cricketer and that he can take the team forward into the future and produce results that South Africans the world over can be very proud of.”

The South African squad includes new ODI caps in batsmen Janneman Malan and Kyle Verreynne, all-rounder Jon-Jon Smuts, fast bowlers Lutho Sipamla and Sisanda Magala and left-arm spinner Bjorn Fortuin. Of these Magala and Verreynne have yet to play at any international level.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/de-kock-replaces-faf-as-odi-skipper.html

Another DDCA official added: “Luckily there is no fracture. There is an ankle tear. The moment he is in a position to walk, he will travel to NCA.”

However, the Indian cricket board is yet to issue a statement on Ishant’s injury.

“It’s a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in BCCI as we will again do his MRI to ascertain degree of tear and decide on his rehabilitation,” a BCCI source said.

208,22-1-20,‘NZ need to win 2 out of 3 formats to get pass marks’,"New Zealand are up against a “powerhouse” in the visiting Indian cricket team, says former all-rounder Craig McMillan who feels the Black Caps will have to win in two out of three formats to be eligible for at least the “pass marks”.

New Zealand will host India for five Twenty20s, three ODIs and two Tests beginning here on January 24 and the hosts will be desperate to bounce back from the recent 0-3 Test drubbing at the hands of Australia.

“It’s big. This whole Indian tour is big after what happened in Australia,” McMillan was quoted as saying by ‘Radio Sport Breakfast’.

“This Indian side are a powerhouse. Doesn’t matter if it’s Tests, ODIs, T20s, they are the real deal so it’s going to be a really intriguing tour. For New Zealand to get a pass mark for this tour they need to win two of the three series.”

The series against India will start with the T20 rubber on Friday and McMillan feels with the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled to be held later this year, it is imperative for New Zealand to win this assignment. “Five Twenty20s to start and I know it’s not everyone’s favourite format of the game but we’ve got a T20 World Cup later in the year in October in Australia so straight away these five matches become important. Because of the performance in Australia we need to start winning again and get that support back,"" he said.

“They’re still trying to find in T20 what our best side is. We’ve just seen the Super Smash and there’s an opportunity for some young guys who performed in that to be given a chance,”McMillan added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---nz-need-to-win-2-out-of-3-formats-to-get-pass-marks---.html
209,22-1-20,Character of pitches in NZ has changed: Tendulkar,"The pitches in New Zealand have become a lot more batting-friendly over the years, says iconic former batsman Sachin Tendulkar, insisting that India have the “ammunition” to trouble the sprightly hosts during the upcoming series.

Tendulkar feels that from seaming tracks during his early trips years, the tracks became high-scoring hard ones during his last tour back in 2009.

“Of late, the Tests in New Zealand have been high scoring and surfaces have changed,” Tendulkar told PTI during an exclusive interview.

From 2002, when India played ODIs and Tests on green tops, to 2009, when India won only their second Test series in 32 years, Tendulkar has seen it all in New Zealand.

“I remember when we played in 2009, the Hamilton pitch was different compared to other pitches.

Other pitches got harder (Wellington and Napier) but not Hamilton. It remained soft. “But Napier became hard with passage of time (where Gautam Gambhir scored an epic match-saving 12-hour hundred in 2009). So, from my first tour (in 1990 till 2009), I realised pitches got harder with passage of time,” Tendulkar said.

Tendulkar is confident that the Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah, has the ammunition to put New Zealand in trouble.

“We have a good bowling attack with quality fast bowlers as well as spinners. I believe we have the ammunition to compete in New Zealand.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/character-of-pitches-in-nz-has-changed--tendulkar.html

""Let them tell me the place and date and I will reach there. However, the debate should be only on development and issues like those related to unemployment, youth, farmers and students. The BJP has been constantly trying to divert attention from core issues by propping up issues related to caste and religion,"" he said in an informal chat with reporters at a function held to mark the 10th death anniversary of Samajwadi Party leader Janeshwar Mishra.

Responding to the speech by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Lucknow on Tuesday, Akhilesh said, ""The language being used on the issue of the citizenship law is not the kind used by political leaders. Words like 'Thok denge' and 'Zabaan kheench lenge' are being used by BJP leaders, which are not political in nature.""

He said that it was not the Samajwadi Party alone that was protesting against CAA but students and women who were leading the protests.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/akhilesh-challenges-bjp-to-debate-on-development-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/akhilesh-challenges-bjp-to-debate-on-development.html
218,22-1-20,Suspect in Mangaluru airport bomb case surrenders before Police,"A 36-year-old man, who is suspected to have planted the explosive at the Mangaluru Intentional Airport, surrendered before the police here on Wednesday, officials said.

The man turned up at the DGP and IGP office here, where he has been detained for inquiry and medical tests.

The suspect has been identified as Adithya Rao, a native of Manipal, they said, adding he resembled the one captured on CCTV footage at Mangaluru airport.

The suspect confessed to having planted the bomb at the airport, sources said.

Meanwhile, a team of police officials from Mangaluru have arrived in the city to question the suspect.

Mangaluru city police commissioner P S Harsha tweeted that the investigation team will question the suspect and will initiate further necessary legal action.

Police sources said, Rao, who was taken to Halsoor Gate police station in Bengaluru for questioning, is an engineering graduate and an MBA holder.

He had earlier been arrested for making a hoax bomb call to Bengaluru airport in 2018 and was jailed for six months.

This was an act of revenge as he was denied the job of a security guard at the Bengaluru International Airport which he had applied for due to lack of certain documents, they said.

Rao had come to Bengaluru in 2012 seeking a job and landed one in a private bank, which he resigned.

He then returned to Mangaluru, where he worked as a security guard for six months and then as a cook in Puthige Mutt in Udupi.

Later, he went back to the state capital and joined an insurance company, which he left and tried to become a security staff at the airport, the sources said.

A 'live' explosive device was found in an unattended bag near a ticket counter of the departure gate of the international airport in Mangaluru on Monday and later defused at a nearby open ground.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/suspect-in-mangaluru-airport-bomb-case-surrenders-before-police-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/suspect-in-mangaluru-airport-bomb-case-surrenders-before-police.html
219,22-1-20,"Anti-terror operations intensified in J&K, says DGP","Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said that counter terror operations have been intensified in Kashmir lately, which have led to many successful operations against the militants.

He was speaking at the wreath laying ceremony of special police officer (SPO) Shahbaz Ahmed at the district police lines in Srinagar. Ahmed was killed in an encounter between the militants and the security forces on Tuesday in Zand village of Tral, in which one soldier also died.

The operation in the village was still going on as the security personnel were searching for more militants hiding in the area.

To a question about the use of drones by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, he said the police uses drones to keep an eye on all those places where security forces are not present. He said the technology was already being used by the police in many places where physically the forces cannot be present.

A series of anti-terror operations have been launched by the police leading to the death of many top militant commanders.

Last week three top Hizbul Mujahideen commanders were gunned down in Shopian, including dreaded militant Waseem Ahmed Wani.

Speaking at the NCC Republic Day Camp in Delhi, Singh said: ""We (India) said we would not discriminate among religions. Why did we do that? Our neighbouring country has declared that their state has a religion. They have declared themselves a theocratic state. We didn't declare so.""

""Even America is a theocratic country. India is not a theocratic country. Why? Because our saints and seers did not just consider the people living within our borders as part of the family, but called everyone living in the world as one family,"" the minister said.

Singh underlined that India had never declared its religion would be Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist and people of all religions could live here.

221,22-1-20,Pak has 'limited options' to respond to India's decision on Jammu and Kashmir: CRS report,"Pakistan's leadership has ""limited options"" to respond to India's decision on Jammu and Kashmir as many analysts view that Islamabad has ""little credibility"" on the issue given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there, according to a US Congressional report.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) in its second report on Kashmir in less than six months also said that Pakistan's ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy.

CRS is the independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest for US lawmakers so that they can take informed decisions inside the Congress. Currently, two resolutions are pending in the House of Representatives, one of which is being sponsored by Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.

In its report dated January 13, CRS said that post August 5, Pakistan “appeared diplomatically isolated”, with Turkey being the only country to offer solid and explicit support for Islamabad's position.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories on August 5, evoking strong reactions from Islamabad.

Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue. However, India has maintained that the move was ""entirely an internal matter"".

The 25-page report said that Pakistan called for a UNSC session and, with China's support, the Council met on August 16 to discuss Kashmir for the first time in more than five decades, albeit in a closed-door session that produced no formal statement.

“Many analysts view Islamabad as having little credibility on Kashmir, given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there. Pakistan's leadership has limited options to respond to India's actions, and renewed Pakistani support for Kashmiri militancy likely would be costly internationally,” it said.

“Pakistan's ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy,” the CRS said.

“Given also that Pakistan and its primary ally, China, enjoy limited international credibility on human rights issues, Islamabad may stand by and hope that self-inflicted damage caused by New Delhi's own policies in Kashmir and, more recently, on citizenship laws, will harm India's reputation and perhaps undercut its recent diplomatic gains with Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE,” it said.

According to CRS, the long-standing US position on Kashmir is that the issue should be settled through negotiations between India and Pakistan while taking into consideration the wishes of the Kashmiri people.

“The Trump Administration has called for peace and respect for human rights in the region, but its criticisms have been relatively muted,” it noted.

With key US diplomatic posts vacant, some observers worry that the US government's capacity to address South Asian instability is thin, and the US President's July offer to “mediate” on Kashmir may have contributed to the timing of New Delhi's moves, it said.

The United States seeks to balance pursuit of a broad US-India partnership while upholding human rights protections, as well as maintaining cooperative relations with Pakistan, the report said.

CRS said that following India's August 2019 actions, numerous Members of the US Congress went on record in support of Kashmiri human rights. H.Res. 745, introduced in December and currently with 40 co-sponsors, urges the Indian government to end the restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir, it said.

An October hearing on human rights in South Asia held by the House Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation included extensive discussion of developments in Jammu and Kashmir. In November, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held an event titled “Jammu and Kashmir in Context.”

US policy, it said, seeks to prevent conflict between India and Pakistan from escalating, and the US Congress supports a US-India strategic partnership that has been underway since 2005, while also maintaining attention on issues of human rights and religious freedom.

CRS in its report told lawmakers that over the past decade, Washington appears to have grown closer to India while relations with Pakistan appear to continue to be viewed as clouded by mistrust.

The Trump Administration “suspended” security assistance to Pakistan in 2018 and has significantly reduced non-military aid while simultaneously deepening ties with New Delhi. It views India as a key “anchor” of its “free and open Indo-Pacific” strategy, which some argue is aimed at China, it said.

“Yet any US impulse to “tilt” toward India is to some extent offset by Islamabad's current, and by most accounts vital, role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation negotiations. President Trump's apparent bonhomie with Pakistan's prime minister and offer to mediate on Kashmir in July was taken by some as a new and potentially unwise strategic shift,” it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-has--limited-options--to-respond-to-india-s-decision-on-jammu-and-kashmir--crs-report-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pak-has--limited-options--to-respond-to-india-s-decision-on-jammu-and-kashmir--crs-report.html
222,22-1-20,Vote keeping welfare of your family in mind: Kejriwal to opposition party supporters,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday appealed to the supporters of opposition parties to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party in the February 8 assembly polls so that the work done in the last five years in the national capital is not ""undone"".

He said the entire Delhi should vote on the basis of development done in the education and healthcare system.

""We have worked hard to improve our schools, the education system, health care... Who will take care of the education of your children, who will help you get good and affordable health care if you vote for any other party? Just give it a thought,"" the chief minister said while addressing a roadshow in the Badli constituency in support of AAP candidate Ajesh Yadav.

""So, I appeal to you all, especially those who support the Congress and the BJP... Please be with your respective parties but vote for us this time. Cast your vote keeping the welfare of your family in mind,"" he said standing in a jeep as hundreds of his supporters walked along donning 'aam aadmi' caps and carrying banners of the party.

Kejriwal said his government did a lot for the people of Delhi in its five-year tenure but needed more time to complete the work pending for 70 years.

""We have tried our best to give maximum benefit to the people of Delhi... To make their lives prosperous. We have made water and electricity free, improved the education and health care system.. But the work pending for 70 years cannot be completed in just 5 years. We need more time,"" he said.

223,22-1-20,"As part of Gaganyaan, first unmanned mission this December: ISRO","Ahead of the launch of India's maiden human spaceflight venture 'Gaganyaan' in December 2021, the Indian Space Research Organisation will undertake two unmanned missions in December 2020 and June 2021, ISRO chairman K Sivan said on Wednesday.

Addressing the inaugural session of a symposium on ""Human Spaceflight and Exploration - Present Challenges and Future Trends,"" Sivan said the Gaganyaan mission not only aims at India's maiden human flight to the space but also setting up a new space station for 'continuous space human presence'.

""We are doing all this (Gaganyaan) on three points - short term plan of two unmanned mission in December 2020 and June 2021, followed by human space flight demonstration in December 2021.

We have the mid term goal of sustaining the human space programme and continuous space human presence in space on a new space station"", he said.

In this regard, the ISRO has initiated a full-fledged astronaut training facility in close proximity to Bengaluru for meeting its future requirements.

The space agency is also in talks with NASA and other space agencies and industries on how it can collaborate on human space flight and learn from their experience.

The Gaganyaan will also assist in ISRO's long term goal of inter-planetary mission.

""Inter-planetary mission is also on the agenda in the long term,"" the ISRO Chief said.

On Gaganyaan mission, Sivan said the space agency has already developed and demonstrated key technologies such as having an operational launcher with 10-tonne playload capability to lower orbit, demonstration ofmission design and management, and recovery system like space qualified parachutes.

""The only missing element were human life science and life support system, which we are developing now,"" he said.

ISRO, Sivan said, has taken onboard many national labs, academic institutions, DRDO labs, Indian Air Force, CSIR Labas well as many industries as stakeholders for Gaganyaanprogramme.

Noting that the astronauts have been selected from a pool of Indian Air Force test pilots, Sivan said the generic space flight training will commence in India shortly.

A mission specific training will be carried out in India using a host of simulators and other facilities, he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/as-part-of-gaganyaan--first-unmanned-mission-this-december----isro-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/as-part-of-gaganyaan--first-unmanned-mission-this-december----isro.html

225,22-1-20,"I'm not afraid, I'm angry: Naseeruddin Shah on CAA","Stating that he is not anxious but angry about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, actor Naseeruddin Shah says he can't produce a birth certificate, like many other Indians, and asks why 70 years of living here is not proof enough of him being a citizen.

The actor, who stressed that he was speaking as a concerned citizen and not a Muslim, said he has contributed to the country in the social and educational spheres and five generations of his family are buried in this land.

Shah, one of Hindi cinema's best known actors, joins others from the industry such as Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj and Richa Chadha to speak on the intense debate over the CAA.

""I don't have a birth certificate. I cannot produce one. Does that mean we are all going to be excluded? I do not need any reassurances that Muslims don't need to worry. I am not worried,"" Shah said in an interview to The Wire.

""If living here for 70 years does not prove me to be an Indian, I don't know what does. I am not afraid, I am not anxious, I am angry that such a law has been imposed on us,"" the 70-year-old added.

Referring to the protests across the country, he said the youth has risen and suddenly realised they are being trampled upon.

The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014, but leaves out Muslims.The government has been saying that the CAA does not target the Muslim community.

""You expect a refugee who is running for his life, who with his meagre belongings trying to outlive a trauma of leaving everything he owned and everything he loved and trying to cross the border to book a ticket to Jeddah? You expect him to go to UAE?"" Shah asked.

He said he was not speaking as a Muslim and had never thought of himself as one. ""I have not seen it as an obstacle in anyway,"" he added.

What hurt the most, Shah said, was the ""contempt"" for the student community and intellectuals.

“There's no leader in this movement, it's all spontaneous anger that is arising. If you dismiss the anger of the youth, you are creating dangers for yourself. That's all I can say,” he said.

Shah also spoke about the silence of big stars of the industry.

“As far as the established figures are considered, it's understandable why they don't speak up. One does wonder how much do they have to lose? Haven't you made enough to last you seven generations?

""It does seem to be like that. Loss of popularity, loss of revenue… will it kill you? The star is basically concerned with themselves and not other people around, otherwise there would be more parity.""

The outspoken actor, who has been vocal on many issues in the past, also praised Deepika Padukone, who went to the Jawaharlal Nehru University during a public meeting and stook silently behind student leaders.

“You have to laud the courage of a girl like Deepika who is in the top... And yet takes a step like this. Let us see how she takes this. She'll lose a few endorsements, sure. Will that impoverish her? Will that lessen her popularity? Will that make her less beautiful than she is?""

""The only god that the film industry worships is money,"" he added caustically.

Asked about instances of period films being made to rewrite history, the actor said there was nothing new in it.

""The film industry has always pandered to those in power. There is too money at stake. They do what pleases the centre. I really wonder how much conviction there is in these filmmakers who are helping rewrite history and what is the purpose of it.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-m-not-afraid--i-m-angry--naseeruddin-shah-on-caa-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/i-m-not-afraid--i-m-angry--naseeruddin-shah-on-caa.html
226,22-1-20,Man kills wife infatuated with Facebook,"Ahmed strangled Naina ‘for staying busy with phone’

Irked over his wife’s excessive use of Facebook, a 26-year-old man strangled his wife to death and threw her body at an isolated place near Jaipur-Delhi National Highway. Police said the woman, identified as Naina Manglani (22), alias Reshma, had over 6,000 followers on her Facebook page and was very active. This did not go down well with her husband who resented the way she was constantly hooked on Facebook and ignoring the family.

The accused identified as Ayaz Ahmed Ansari, a resident of Kho Nagaurian area, who works in a finance company, was arrested for the murder by the Jaipur Police on Monday.

Ansari reportedly told police that Naina would stay busy with her phone all the time and he was suspicious that she might be having an extra-marital affair. The excessive use of FB by her led to marital discord and frequent quarrels. Their relationship had reached the breaking point as they had started living separately, said a police official privy to the probe, adding that Naina had even threatened Ayaz that she would seek divorce from him.

A senior police official said deeply upset, Ayaz hatched a plan to kill her and asked Naina to come to Ramgarh Mod on Sunday and convinced her that he wanted to sort out differences with her. Naina believed his words and went to meet him at the designated place.

“He made her consume beer and after that they went to Amer hills on a scooty. There he strangled her to death and smashed her face and head with a stone. After committing the crime, Ayaz went to his uncle’s house. The body of Naina was recovered on Monday and police arrested Ayaz within a few hours,” said a senior police official.

“Naina and Ayaz had met two years ago and their friendship blossomed and it soon turned into an affair. Since both were from different religions, they solemnised their marriage twice as per Hindu and Muslim rituals. Their family members didn’t give their consent to their relationship. They had eloped from their homes and tied the nuptial knot in Ghaziabad in October, 2017,” said the police official, adding that the couple had a three-month-old son.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/man-kills-wife-infatuated-with-facebook-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/man-kills-wife-infatuated-with-facebook.html
227,22-1-20,"Trump again offers to 'help' resolve Kashmir issue, meets Pak PM Imran in Davos","President Donald Trump has said that the US is watching the developments between India and Pakistan over Kashmir ""very closely"" and repeated his offer to ""help"" resolve the longstanding dispute between the two neighbours as he met Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here in the Swiss ski resort.

Addressing the media with the Pakistan Prime Minister prior to their private meeting on Tuesday, President Trump asserted that trade and borders were both critical points for discussion, while Khan said that for him, Afghanistan was the top priority.

Trump told Khan, whom he referred to as ""my friend"", that he would speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the ongoing Kashmir issue. The US president is expected to visit India in the coming weeks, marking his first visit after taking up his post in the White House.

""What's going on between Pakistan and India … if we can help, we certainly will be willing to. We have been watching it very closely and it's an honour to be here with my friend,"" Trump said.

""The Pakistan-India conflict is a very big issue for us in Pakistan and we expect the US to always play its part in deescalating the tensions, because no other country can,"" Khan said.

President Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate following India's August 5 decision to revoke the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories, evoking strong reactions from Pakistan which has been trying to internationalise the issue.

New Delhi has defended its move, saying Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the issue was strictly internal to the country, and the special status provisions only gave rise to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

""The country took the decision of abrogation of Article 370, which had only given separatism and terrorism to that state,"" Prime Minister Modi said in October.

Although President Trump has offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation.

On the sidelines of the G7 summit in the French town of Biarritz in August last year, Prime Minister Modi, while interacting with the media alongside President Trump, categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, saying the two countries can discuss and resolve all issues bilaterally and ""we don't want to trouble any third country"".

This was the third meeting between Trump and Khan since Pakistan premier assumed office in 2018, and it came against the backdrop of Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's recent trip to the US, amid reports that the US and Afghan Taliban were close to striking a peace deal.

""There are issues we want to talk about. The main issue is Afghanistan because it concerns the US and Pakistan. Fortunately, we are on the same page. Both of us are interested in peace there and an orderly transition in Afghanistan with talks with Taliban and the government,"" Khan said.

When a reporter asked Trump if he would visit Pakistan considering he was already set to visit India, the US president said he was meeting the Pakistan premier in Davos.

""Well, we're visiting right now. So we don't really have to. I wanted to say that from a relationship standpoint, we got a great relationship. From the standpoint our two countries, we're getting along very well. I would say we've never been closer with Pakistan the way we're right now. And this is a big statement,"" Trump said .

Khan left for Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum and meet the world leaders, including President Trump, on Tuesday. The four-day summit which kicked off on Tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of the forum.

A total of 53 heads of State are on the guest list. Nearly 3,000 participants from 118 countries are expected to attend the event during which political leaders, business executives, heads of international organisations and civil society representatives are set to deliberate on contemporary economic, geopolitical, social and environmental issues.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-again-offers-to--help--resolve-kashmir-issue--meets-pak-pm-imran-in-davos-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/trump-again-offers-to--help--resolve-kashmir-issue--meets-pak-pm-imran-in-davos.html
228,22-1-20,Marijuana linked to increased risk of heart problems,"More than two million adults with heart conditions report that they have used or are currently using marijuana, according to a new study.

Observational studies have linked marijuana use to a range of cardiovascular risks, including stroke, arrhythmia and diseases that make it hard for the heart muscle to pump properly, said the researchers.

""Marijuana use, both recreational and medical, is increasing nationally yet many of its cardiovascular effects remain poorly understood,"" said lead author Ersilia M DeFilippis from Columbia University in the US.

""In our National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) query, we estimated that two million adults with marijuana use had cardiovascular disease in 2015-2016. Since that time, additional states have passed legislature related to marijuana so its use may have increased even further,"" DeFilippis added.

""Notably, many of our cardiology patients are on medications that can interact with marijuana in unpredictable ways depending on the formulation. This highlights that we need more data so that we can better counsel providers as well as patients,"" DeFilippis said.

For the findings, published in the journal Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers, including one of the Indian-origin, conducted a query of data from NHANES to estimate marijuana use among US patients with cardiovascular disease.

They estimated that two million (2.3 per cent) of the 89.6 million adults who reported marijuana use had cardiovascular disease.

According to the study, the researchers outline the ways that the components and compounds in marijuana may affect the heart and other tissue at a molecular level and the drug interactions that marijuana can have with drugs that are commonly given to cardiology patients.

They also describe observational studies that suggest a connection between marijuana and heart conditions, including: Smoking-related cardiotoxicity: Many of the same cardiotoxic chemicals found in cigarettes are also found in marijuana smoke.

Coronary artery disease: Cannabis inhalation can increase heart rate and blood pressure and may be a trigger of a heart attack.

Arrhythmias: Marijuana use has been associated with abnormal heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation.

Cerebrovascular disease: Surveys have found that marijuana smokers were three times more likely to experience a cerebrovascular event, such as a stroke.

""This was eye-opening for us. We're seeing an accelerating use of marijuana and now, for the first time, marijuana users are exceeding cigarette smokers in the US. said Indian-origin researcher and study author Muthiah Vaduganathan from Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/marijuana-linked-to-increased-risk-of-heart-problems-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/marijuana-linked-to-increased-risk-of-heart-problems.html
229,22-1-20,Bodies of eight Indian tourists under postmortem in Nepal; to be flown back on Thursday,"The bodies of the eight Indian tourists, including four minors, who died due to possible asphyxiation in their room at a mountainous resort in Nepal are undergoing postmortem here on Wednesday and would be flown back home on Thursday, according to a senior Indian official.

Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala when eight of them, including four children, died after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Makwanpur district, amidst cold wave in the Himalayan region.

The tourists were airlifted to HAMS hospital here where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Makwanpur police said the victims might have fallen unconscious due to asphyxiation.

""Postmortem of the bodies is being conducted at the Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu and they would be flown back home tomorrow (Thursday) morning,"" a senior official at the Indian Embassy told PTI.

The official said that out of the seven who survived, two stayed with the bodies while the others are already on their way back.

The victims were identified as Praveen Krishnan Nair, Saranya Sasi, Sreebhadra Praveen, Aarcha Praveen, Abhinav Saranya Nair, Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and Vyshnav Ranjith.

The deceased - two couples and four children - were part of a group of 15 people travelling from Kerala to Pokhara, a popular mountainous tourist destination. They were on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman in the district on Monday night.

The official said that the Indian Mission is in touch with the local authorities, family and friends of the deceased and the hospital authorities.

""We are ensuring that the process to send back the bodies is expedited,"" the official said.

According to the manager at the resort, the guests stayed in a room and turned on a gas heater to keep themselves warm.

Although they had booked a total of four rooms, eight of them stayed in a room and remaining others in another room, the manager said, adding that all the windows and the door of the room were bolted from inside.

230,22-1-20,McConnell abruptly eases impeachment limits McConnell abruptly eases impeachment limits,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell abruptly changed his proposed rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, backing off the condensed two-day schedule to add a third for opening arguments after protests from senators, including Republicans.

The trial quickly burst into a partisan fight at the Capitol as the president's lawyers opened arguments Tuesday in support of McConnell's plan.

Democrats objected loudly to McConnell's initially proposed rules, and some Republicans made their concerns known in private.

Without comment, the Republican leader quietly submitted an amended proposal for the record, after meeting behind closed doors with senators as the trial opened. He added the extra day and allowed House evidence to be included in the record.

""It's time to start with this trial,"" said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, the president's lead lawyer as the proceedings opened in public.

""It's a fair process,"" he said. ""There is absolutely no case.""

Chief Justice John Roberts gaveled open the session, senators having taken an oath last week to do ""impartial justice"" as jurors.

Senators were stunned by McConnell's shift, and aides offered no immediate answers/ But a spokeswoman for Republican Sen. Susan Collins said that she and others had raised concerns. The Maine senator sees the changes as significant improvements, said spokeswoman Annie Clark.

Democrats had warned that the rules package from Trump's ally, the Senate GOP leader, could force midnight sessions that would keep most Americans in the dark and create a sham proceeding.

""This is not a process for a fair trial, this is the process for a rigged trial"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the prosecution, told reporters. He called it a ""cover-up"".

McConnell opened the chamber promising a ""fair, even handed"" process — and warned that the Senate would stay in session until his proposed rules package was adopted.

""The president's lawyers will finally receive a level playing field,"" the Kentucky Republican said, contrasting it with the House impeachment inquiry.

The first test was coming as senators prepared to begin debate and vote on McConnell's proposed rules.

The rare impeachment trial, unfolding in an election year, is testing whether Trump's actions toward Ukraine warrant removal at the same time that voters are forming their own verdict his White House.

The Democrats say the prospect of middle-of-the-night proceedings, without allowing new witnesses or even the voluminous House records of the trial, will leave the public without crucial information about Trump's political pressure campaign on Ukraine and the White House's obstruction of the House impeachment probe.

""The McConnell rules seem to be designed by President Trump for President Trump,"" said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer.

He vowed to call for a series of votes to amend the rules and demand testimony and documents, but it seemed unlikely Republicans would break from the party to join Democrats.

""This is a historic moment,"" Schumer said. ""The eyes of America are watching. Republican senators must rise to the occasion.""

If the senators agree to McConnell's proposal for speedy trial and acquittal, Schiff said, ""It will not prove the president innocent, it will only prove the Senate guilty of working with the president to obstruct the truth from coming out.""

Rep. Jerry Nadler, the Judiciary Committee Chairman also leading the House team, said: ""There's no trial in this country where you wouldn't admit relative witnesses."" McConnell had promised to set rules similar to the last impeachment trial, of President Bill Clinton in 1999, but his resolution diverged in key ways.

GOP Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, whose votes are being closely watched, said he was satisfied with the proposal, even as he hopes to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton who had a front-row seat to Trump's actions.

The first several days of the trial are expected to be tangled in procedural motions playing out on the Senate floor and behind closed doors. Senators must refrain from speaking during the trial proceedings.

Like Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will also be away for the proceedings, leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Poland and Israel to commemorate the 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz at the end of World War II.

She issued a statement on Tuesday denouncing McConnell's proposed ground rules as a ""sham"" because of the compressed schedule and lack of guarantee that witnesses will be called or that evidence gathered by the House would be admitted in the Senate trial.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mcconnell-abruptly-eases-impeachment-limits-mcconnell-abruptly-eases-impeachment-limits-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/mcconnell-abruptly-eases-impeachment-limits-mcconnell-abruptly-eases-impeachment-limits.html
231,22-1-20,Pamela Anderson weds for fifth time to Hollywood mogul,"Former ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson has tied the knot for a fifth time, to ""Batman"" producer Jon Peters, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The actress-turned-animal rights campaigner reportedly wed Peters at a private Malibu ceremony on Monday, more than three decades after the pair first met.

""There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but -- for 35 years -- I've only wanted Pamela,"" Peters, 74, told THR.

Canadian-born Anderson, 52, has previously been married to rockers Tommy Lee and Kid Rock.

More recently she dated French soccer star Adil Rami.

Peters, a former hair stylist, rose to Hollywood prominence after a high-profile romance with Barbra Streisand, going on to produce her 1976 version of ""A Star Is Born."" He subsequently oversaw the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films in the 1980s and 1990s, and brought another DC comic books icon back to the screen in 2006's ""Superman Returns.""

Peters reportedly first met Anderson at the Playboy Mansion in the 1980s, and proposed to her shortly after.

But when asked about their relationship in an interview with THR in 2017, Peters said: ""You'll have to do your research. I can't even remember anymore.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pamela-anderson-weds-for-fifth-time-to-hollywood-mogul-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pamela-anderson-weds-for-fifth-time-to-hollywood-mogul.html
232,22-1-20,"Canada PM denies talking to queen about Harry, Meghan security","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday denied having spoken ""directly"" with Queen Elizabeth II about the costs of providing security for Prince Harry, his wife Meghan and their son.

The British press has reported that Trudeau promised the queen that Canada would assume the costs of protecting the Sussexes, who are currently residing near the city of Vancouver.

""I have not spoken to her Majesty directly. Discussions continue to be ongoing and I have no updates at this moment,"" Trudeau told a news conference.

Canadian media have estimated the cost of protecting the couple and their eight-month-old son Archie at about 1.7 million Canadian dollars (USD 1.3 million) a year. Other estimates run higher.

Harry, 35, returned to Canada late Monday to begin a new life away from the British monarchy with his American wife and their son in a mansion on Vancouver Island on Canada's Pacific coast.

Meghan Markle, 38, had gone back to Canada to be with Archie shortly after the couple announced they planned to step back from their royal duties and spend part of their life in North America.

The queen on Saturday gave her blessing, saying she supported their wish for a more independent life, after an agreement was reached under which they give up their royal titles and stop receiving public funds.

The question of who would be responsible for the cost of their security in Canada has not been resolved.

According to British media, Harry and Meghan have threatened to take legal action after tabloids published photographs of Meghan and Archie in Canada.

They complain that paparazzi with long-lens cameras are permanently installed on Vancouver Island to spy on them.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/canada-pm-denies-talking-to-queen-about-harry--meghan-security-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/canada-pm-denies-talking-to-queen-about-harry--meghan-security.html
233,22-1-20,India fulfilled its 'moral duty' by enacting CAA: Rajnath,"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said religious minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are living a ""life of misery"" and India has fulfilled its ""moral duty"" towards them by enacting the CAA.

Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Shatabdi Nagar here, he also questioned those opposing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and said the government has not discussed it.

Dismissing allegations that the Centre is pursuing a ""divisive agenda"" through the CAA, Singh said the BJP doesn't do politics on religious lines for selfish gains.

""In Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, religious minorities are living a life of misery. India has fulfilled its moral duty (by enacting the CAA),"" he said.

""The entire world is accepting India's power. We don't do politics on the lines of religion for selfish reasons,"" he said.

The citizenship law is being viewed from a Hindu-Muslim perspective, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks of justice, he added.

Singh said the NDA had prepared the citizenship legislation in its first tenure, but it could not be enacted.

On the NRC, Singh said, ""The government has had no discussion on the NRC. And suppose it has, then what is the problem with having a register of citizens.""

""Shouldn't there be a register of citizens? Shouldn't there be a document for people to seek benefits of government schemes,"" he asked the crowd at the rally.

Singh said the BJP wants to do politics by winning people's hearts and asserted that the party is working to fulfil all its promises.

""Whenever a political party contests elections, it makes various kinds of promises. I was given the responsibility to prepare the BJP's manifesto for the 2019 (Lok Sabha) elections. Within seven months of being elected, the BJP has been rapidly fulfilling its promises,"" he said.

""I want to assure the people of India that our party will deliver on whatever it promises. We do not want to cheat the people,"" he said.

""By the end of 2022, every house will have a pucca roof. Tap water will reach every household by the end of 2024. PM Modi put Rs 6,000 each in the bank accounts of farmers,"" he added.

The minister said the the BJP had also taken steps for farmers' welfare.

""Farmer brothers need not worry, we will pay you every single penny for your hardwork,"" he said.

The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before 2015 to escape religious persecution there.

Muslim migrants don't figure on this list.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone's citizenship.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-fulfilled-its--moral-duty--by-enacting-caa--rajnath-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-fulfilled-its--moral-duty--by-enacting-caa--rajnath.html
234,22-1-20,Will take appropriate action if Shaheen Bagh protest obstructs poll process: Delhi Police,"With the Shaheen Bagh protest continuing for over a month, the Delhi Police on Wednesday said it would take appropriate action if a complaint is received about any obstruction in the ongoing electoral process for the assembly polls next month.

Special Commissioner of Police (Election) Praveer Ranjan said the force has not yet received any complaint about protestors in Shaheen Bagh causing obstruction in the electoral process.

Thousands of people, including women and children, have been protesting since December 15 at Shaheen Bagh and nearby Jamia Millia Islamia against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Ranjan said police have already appealed to protestors to vacate the area, and Lt Governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday also requested them to call off their agitation as it has been causing inconvenience to schoolchildren, patients and the general public.

""If we receive a complaint about obstruction in electoral process, we will take appropriate action as per law,"" he told reporters in response to a question at a press conference at the office of Chief Electoral Officer.

Baijal on Tuesday met a delegation of protesters from Shaheen Bagh.

""Met the delegation of protestors from Shaheen Bagh. Assured them to convey their concerns to appropriate authorities. Appealed to call off their agitation in view of continued inconvenience to schoolchildren, patients, daily commuters, local residents, etc due to blockade of road,"" Baijal tweeted.

According to the amended citizenship law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. It does not include Muslims.

Those opposing the CAA have contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They allege CAA, along with NRC, is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

235,22-1-20,Review disqualification power: SC,"Parliament nudged to rethink absolute authority of presiding officers

The Supreme Court wants Parliament to put a full stop to the unbridled power enjoyed by presiding officers of legislatures in deciding disqualification pleas against lawmakers.

The SC on Tuesday observed that a Speaker also belongs to a political party and asked Parliament to think over setting up some sort of permanent body or independent mechanism to decide disqualification petitions. The Bench pointed out recent cases where Assembly Speakers came under scanner for their handling of disqualification petitions and said that MPs or MLAs should not be allowed to continue even for a day if they have incurred disqualification for issues like anti-defection.

In its Tuesday judgment in a case related to the role of the Manipur Assembly Speaker in not taking decision on disqualification pleas against a State Minister, the SC held that the Speaker can’t sit on a disqualification petition indefinitely and he must act within a reasonable time.

The court’s suggestion came in the wake of several cases where the Speakers were accused of deciding the disqualification pleas to suit their political preferences, disregarding norms and conventions, and using such pleas as a tool to arm-twist the lawmakers to protect or destablise State Governments.

Last year’s Karnataka political crisis was a case in point. The Assembly Speaker took weeks in deciding over the disqualification plea despite direction from courts.

The Speaker’s refusal to act on the disqualification pleas against the rebel Congress and JD(S) MLAs created such a standoff that the Karnataka High Court in April 2018 issued a direction to the Speaker and fixed a deadline for deciding a plea. The Speaker took his own time and then matter went to the SC.

More often than not, the Speaker “sit over” such pleas, which remain pending for months — in some cases for years — even after MLAS/MLAs have clearly violated the provision of anti-defection law. By not acting on such pleas, Speakers allow MLAs to retain their voting power despite switching side. This mostly helps the ruling party in a State.

Such arbitrariness by the Speakers often facilitated midnight political coup in North-East States.

Suggesting for an independent mechanism to deal with disqualification pleas against lawmakers, the SC asked the Manipur Assembly Speaker to decide within four weeks the plea of a Congress leader seeking disqualification of BJP lawmaker and Manipur Forest Minister Th Shyamkumar.

A Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman had granted liberty to Congress MLA Fajur Rahim and K Meghachandra to approach it again if the Assembly Speaker fails to take a decision within four weeks.

The BJP Minister had won the Assembly election on a Congress ticket and later joined the BJP. This led to filing of the disqualification plea.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/review-disqualification-power--sc-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/review-disqualification-power--sc.html
236,22-1-20,E-ticket racket linked to terror financing busted,"RPF nabs man from Jharkhand

In one of its biggest crackdown on illegal ticketing in the railways, the RPF has arrested a madrasa-educated, self-taught software developer from Jharkhand in a racket which has links to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Dubai with suspected involvement in terror financing, a senior official said on Tuesday.

Ghulam Mustafa (28), who was arrested from Bhubaneswar, has a team of programmers working for him. He started his career in 2015 touting counter tickets in Bengaluru and then graduated to e-tickets and illegal software, the RPF official said.

“For the last 10 days, the IB, Special Bureau, ED, NIA, Karnataka Police have interrogated Mustafa.

“Dimensions of money laundering and terror financing are suspected,” Railway Protection Force (RPF) Director General Arun Kumar said at a press briefing.

Kumar said Mustafa has 563 personal IRCTC user IDs, and a list of 2,400 SBI branches and 600 regional rural banks where he is suspected to have accounts.

He also said Mustafa used software to access darknet, and Linux-based hacking systems were found on his laptop.

An Indian software company with branches across the country and abroad has also come under the scanner for having links to the racket, Kumar said, refusing to name it. He, however, said the company has been involved in a case of money laundering in Singapore.

“Analysis of Mustafa’s laptops, which were highly encrypted. His phone has many Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Middle-Eastern, Indonesian,

Nepali numbers as well as six virtual numbers. There was also an application to create fake Aadhaar cards,” Kumar said.

The DG said Mustafa has revealed that he is a follower of a Pakistan-based religious group. Mustafa’s digital footprints were found on Government websites, he said.

The RPF chief named Hamid Ashraf as the mastermind of the racket which is suspected to generate revenue of Rs 10-15 crore per month.

Ashraf, who is also a software developer, was involved in the bombing of a school in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district in 2019 and is now suspected to have fled to Dubai, Kumar said.

“The first aim of these organised rackets is to generate cash. Once that money is amassed, then they turn towards terror financing. All the information gathered from them has indicated a link to terror financing and money laundering,” he said.

Describing the operation, the DG said Ashraf is suspected to have a technical team to maintain the cloud-hosted servers. He has 18-20 lead sellers or super admins in India who handle the money and send to Hamid through various hawala accounts and crypto currency, Kumar said.

Then there are around 200-300 panel sellers who buy the software panel from lead developers and forward it to agents.

“One panel is a set of 20 IDs bought with Rs 28,000 per month. They forward the IDs and software to agents. Roughly 20,000 agents are there in India who use the illegal software for booking. About Rs 10-15 crore black money is generated per month in cash through this,” he said.

The investigators are now trying to apprehend another person of interest who is called “Guruji” by the organisation who appears to be involved in the finance management of the gang. “He is higher up the pecking order of the gang and a technical expert. He will be picked up soon. He uses Yugoslavian number and VPN (virtual private network). He received around Rs 13 lakh from Mustafa recently through bank transfers involving 71 transactions,” the RPF DG said.

Kumar said the illegal software, ANMS, bypasses IRCTC’s login captcha, booking captcha and bank OTP to generate tickets.

For a genuine user, the booking process usually takes around 2.55 minutes, but for the software it takes around 1.48 minutes, thereby booking tickets much faster.

It also enables simultaneous login through several user IDs with pre-filled data, thus managing to corner most of the confirmed tickets.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/e-ticket-racket-linked-to-terror-financing-busted-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/e-ticket-racket-linked-to-terror-financing-busted.html

“Doesn’t matter. Many of them are filing for the first time. They are bound to make mistakes. We also made mistakes the first time. We should hand hold them. I am enjoying waiting with them. They are all part of my family,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.

238,22-1-20,8 tourists from Kerala choke to death in gas leak at Nepal resort,"Tragedy struck a group of 15 Kerala tourists in Nepal when eight of them, including four children, died after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Pokhara, amid cold wave in the Himalayan region.

The tourists were airlifted to HAMS hospital in Kathmandu where they were pronounced dead on arrival, Superintendent of Police Sushil Singh Rathaur said.

Postmortem will be conducted on Wednesday and bodies will be taken to Kerala by Air India on Thursday.

Other three victims are Ranjith Kumar and his wife Indu Lakshmi and their younger son Vyshnav. Their elder son Madhav, who was in other room, survived. It is believed that leak of carbon monoxide from the heater led to the death of the eight members of the two families.

The group of 15 from two Kerala families were on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman in Makawanpur district on Monday night.

According to the manager of the resort, the guests stayed in a room and turned on a gas heater to keep themselves warm.

240,22-1-20,Death toll in China's coronavirus goes up to 9; total cases rise to 440,"The death toll in China's novel coronavirus virus has gone up to nine with the confirmed infection cases sharply rising to 440, the health authorities said on Wednesday, warning that the disease could spread further in the ongoing Chinese holiday season during which millions travel at home and abroad.

The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the WHO.

The Chinese health authorities announced on Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday.

The cases had resulted in nine deaths, all in central China's Hubei Province, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission told at a press conference here on Wednesday.

Altogether 149 new confirmed cases were reported on Tuesday, Li added.

Li said China was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control following confirmation that that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place.

The official said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"".

Overseas, one case has been confirmed in Japan, three in Thailand, and one in Korea. The first case of the virus has now been reported in US with official confirmation that a person arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.

The patient was hospitalised on Sunday, after arriving in Seattle from Wuhan on January 15, officials at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sad.

Li said the figures from the commission show a total of 2,197 close contacts have been traced. A total of 1,394 are under medical observation while 765 people have been discharged.

All of the deaths were reported in central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared in the city of Wuhan.

China yet to confirm the exact source of the virus.

""Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic,"" Li said.

The warning comes as millions of people across China are travelling within the country and abroad for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday. The holiday season began on January 10 and would last for 40 days. Officially, China will declare week-long holiday from January 24.

The Wuhan Health Commission said it would authorise medical institutions to quarantine all patients and people in close contact with them as a prevention and control measure, Li said.

On Tuesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) upgraded the coronavirus to a Class B infectious disease, but said it would use the stricter control measures for a Class A disease to handle the outbreak, meaning any infection nationwide must be reported within two hours and monitored.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO), which is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday, will consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola.

Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.

The week-long festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.

241,22-1-20,'Panga' made me realise we never think about our mothers' dreams: Jassie Gill,"Punjabi actor-singer Jassie Gill says the society has never cared about the dreams of mothers and his latest ""Panga"" made him realise how he never knew what his mother wanted to do in life.

The 31-year-old actor stars opposite Kangana Ranaut in the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari-directed film which follows the life of a forgotten kabaddi champion who returns to pursue her dreams.

""When I heard the story, I realised that my mother was also doing the routine work day in and out, without complaining. We never asked her what she wants to do, never asked what her dreams were. This is the story of almost every household,"" Jassie told PTI in an interview here.

The actor landed the role in his second Hindi film, ""Panga"", even before his 2018 Bollywood debut ""Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi"" released.

""I was offered my second film while I was shooting for the first one. I am happy my work was liked in 'Happy Phirr...'. Coming from the Punjabi industry and getting the love and acceptance in your first film is important. I am glad I got that.""

""Panga"", also starring Neena Gupta and Richa Chadha, will show him in a different light, Jassie said.

""People will get to see me in a different way. I will sign more films after 'Panga'. It is a romantic film and has a different concept. It is a story set in Uttar Pradesh and you will get to see me in a 'desi' avatar,"" he added.

Jassie was a known figure in the Punjabi film and music industry before he headed to Bollywood.

The musician, who has hit songs such as Vigre Sharabi"", ""Bapu Zimidar"", ""Nikle Currant"" to his credit, made his acting debut in 2014 with the Punjabi film ""Mr & Mrs 420"".

Primarily a singer, Jassie said, he is an accidental actor.

""I always wanted to sing. Singers had a big influence on me. I had a clear idea about what kind of songs I'll make. Somehow I managed to make my first album which got a great response.

""After the second album, I started getting acting offers for Punjabi films as I had acted in my videos. That's how I got my first film and people liked my work in it. Gradually, I started gaining confidence that I can act too,"" he said.

""Panga"" is slated to be released Friday.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-panga--made-me-realise-we-never-think-about-our-mothers--dreams--jassie-gill-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-panga--made-me-realise-we-never-think-about-our-mothers--dreams--jassie-gill.html
242,22-1-20,SRK's epic reply to fan who wants to rent room in his bungalow,"Shah Rukh Khan gave an epic reply to a fan seeking to rent a room in the superstars bungalow, Mannat, during an open chat with fans on Twitter.

On Wednesday afternoon, SRK invited fans with a tweet: ""Chalo ek #AskSrk ho jaaye. Like only 20 Questions...then I have to go and face myself...and maybe shave too.""

Soon, fans were flooding the actors with questions, as a result the hashtag #AskSRK trended on Twitter throughout Wednesday.

During the chat, a fan asked how much would he need to shell out to get a room for rent in SRK's lavish bungalow Mannat in Mumbai's Bandra area.

The superstar replied saying that can be achieved only by 30 years of hard work.

A fan asked: ""If you weren't famous, what would you be up to right now?"" He replied that being famous is not a job: ""I would do the very same things I do around the house. Being famous is not a job it's a byproduct of the work you do sometimes.""

The actor replied to a few more interesting questions from his fans and offered them suggestions as and when required.

A fan tweeted: ""Sir, lots of rumours about your next project.. u pls announce yourself."" To this, SRK replied in Hindi that only he would announce his next project, when it happens.

Replying to another fan who quizzed what SRK plans to do in the new decade, he wrote: ""I have reserved it for the best movies of my life.""

A fan shared a photo of himself riding a bike, which features a picture of the actor, and asked him: ""What do you think about my bike.? Is it cool?"" The actor immediately advised the fan to wear a helmet!

Another fan randomly asked if he would like to share any advice for students of chemistry. To this, SRK tagged his ""Main Hoon Na"" co-star Sushmita Sen and replied: ""Please direct this question to my chemistry teacher..@thesushmitasen"".

A female fan expressed her heart out and tweeted: ""Might seem a little cheesy but I really really love you Shahrukh"". SRK didn't disappoint her and instantly responded saying: ""I like cheese.""

Since Mumbai doesn't experience a proper winter, the actor, who is a Delhi boy, informed another fan that he is missing Delhi's ""sardi"".

A young fan expressed: ""I'm at the age of Suhana and I wanna an advice from you!

can you do it for me please"".

The superstar advised: ""Don't let any negativity uninspire you in your journey. U r beautiful because of who u are.""

Another fan quizzed: ""How do you work on changing your voice for every character you play — It always differs in each movie. Also how difficult is it to modulate your voice?"" The actor explained: ""Glad you asked this. I try my best but not always succeed. Our voice box is an amazing tool... u have to learn how to control it.""

Not only fans, Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh also had a question for Shah Rukh. Riteish asked: ""What is the one life lesson that you have learnt from AbRam?""

Replying to this, Shah Rukh tweeted: ""Whenever you are sad hungry or angry... cry just a little bit while playing your favourite video game.""

243,22-1-20,'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' to re-release in India on Feb 14,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"", which has become an award-season favourite, will be re-released in India on February 14.

Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" was his love letter to Los Angeles of 1969, and it has won commercial success and critical acclaim all over the world.

""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" is a fictional story of fading stardom told through aging star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Tarantino has woven real life stories into the plot with the infamous Charles Manson murders, including actress Sharon Tate, as a backdrop to make it more intriguing.

Star power of two biggies, the Hollywood factor and ‘Tarantino' treatment to a historical criminal case left everyone with a dazzling yet disturbing emotion. The film has garnered glory in award galas, including 77th Golden Globe Awards ceremony. It has also got Oscar nods in major categories.

244,22-1-20,Apple to release smart keyboard with scissor design in 2020,"Apple is reportedly planning to introduce an updated Smart Keyboard with a scissor switch design alongside its next-generation iPad and iPad Pro models in 2020.

The iPhone maker introduced its scissor-switch keyboard design at the end of 2019 with the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Other MacBooks are also expected to get the keyboard in 2020, the Cult of Mac reported recently.

While, back in July 2019, known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that iPad keyboards would stick with a rubber dome design rather than scissor switches in 2020-21.

Kuo recently revealed that the iPhone maker is expected to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020.

Kuo in a research note with TF International Securities said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system.

As per report, Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off of objects in a room to generate a 3D map.

Additionally, Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release its low-cost iPhone ""SE 2"" in the first half of 2020 too.

The iPhone SE 2 will use a 10-layer Substrate-like PCB (SLP) for its motherboard, the same technology used by the iPhone 11's version.

Kuo expects the device to look similar to the iPhone 8 and believes it will be a popular upgrade option for existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S owners.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/apple-to-release-smart-keyboard-with-scissor-design-in-2020-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/apple-to-release-smart-keyboard-with-scissor-design-in-2020.html
245,22-1-20,Twitter updates Android app after users report glitch,"Hours after Android users reported glitches while logging into Twitter after it crashed on Wednesday, the micro blogging site rolled out an update on the Google Play Store.

Earlier in the day, the firm had acknowledged the issue and said it had started fixing it.

""We are investigating a problem with the latest version of our Android app that causes it to crash immediately once it is opened. If you use Twitter for Android, we suggest not updating it until we let you know it's fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience!"" the micro blogging site tweeted.

The glitch happened apparently due to the roll out of an update to its first-party app bringing it to version 8.28.

The update caused the app to immediately crash upon launch on Android.

Those who have already installed the update and are not able to use Twitter, could go to the app's info page and clear data and storage to get it working again.

Those users who have not installed version 8.28 can visit the Play Store listing and tap the overflow menu in the top-right corner to uncheck ""Enable auto-update.""

246,22-1-20,Musk-run Tesla hit $100-bn market value for first time,"Signalling an all-electric future is coming our way, Elon Musk-run Tesla has hit the $100 billion in stock market valuation for the first time.

Tesla shares were last up 1.4 per cent at $555 after trading was closed on Tuesday, reports CNBC.

The milestone came less than a month after Tesla's stock crossed $420 -- a price Musk tweeted last year which put him in much trouble.

The $100 billion valuation must stay for both one-month and six-month average in order to help Musk get first of 12 tranches of $346 million in a record-breaking pay package.

Tesla is currently valued more than Ford Motor and General Motors combined.

Musk lost his position as Tesla Chairman after posting a notorious tweet in August last year that he was ""considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured"".

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over the tweet, saying he misled investors by claiming falsely he had lined up funding for the take-private transaction.

Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, agreeing to give up his role as Tesla Chairman and pay a $20 million fine.

Tesla surprised Wall Street in October by registering a profitable third quarter with a total revenue of $6.3 billion riding on sales of its Model S, Model X and Model 3 electric cars.

In the third quarter, automotive revenues were $5.35 billion. Tesla said it expected to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, representing 45-65 per cent growth.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/musk-run-tesla-hit--100-bn-market-value-for-first-time-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/musk-run-tesla-hit--100-bn-market-value-for-first-time.html
247,22-1-20,"After Aus drubbing, looking forward to India series: Southee","Senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee is keen to move past his axing from the team for the new year's Test against Australia and focus on the series against India.

New Zealand suffered a heavy defeat in the Test series in Australia, losing it 0-3. After playing in the first two matches, Southee was replaced by Matt Henry in the playing XI.

He admitted he was disappointed at the time, but aims to continue contributing to the team's cause even when not a part of the XI.

""I don't think you can take it personally -- they make the decisions based on what they think is best for the team,"" Southee was quoted as saying by www.stuff.co.nz.

""You're going to agree to disagree and that's just the nature of sport.

""It's disappointing. You're gutted every time you're left out. It's an absolute dream to play for New Zealand and every time you do miss out it hurts, but you've got to respect the decisions and try to help out and give back to the team, even when you're not playing.""

Southee's focus is now on the T20I series against India that starts on Friday and he said it was nice to be playing a different format.

""We had a big chunk of Test cricket and the guys that were in Australia are reasonably experienced guys...they've had tough tours before and they've bounced back and the reason why they've played for a long period of time is they've been able to get through those ups and downs.

""It's about making that adjustment. What's gone is gone and it was very disappointing, the guys would have learnt from it, and now we've got to look forward to the Indian series.""

Southee was one of four players to play in all 12 of the Black Caps' T20I games last year and captained the side in nine of them, with Kane Williamson rested for one at the start of the year, then injured when they visited Sri Lanka and hosted England.

The regular skipper is set to make his first international appearance in the game's shortest format since last summer on Friday, and Southee will offer him whatever support he needs.

""I enjoy thinking about the game and it makes you think outside of what you're doing,"" he said of his experience as captain.

""I also try to help Kane out as well -- it's nice to have those senior guys (helping you) and Ross (Taylor) was good having captained the side in the past.

""It's a different challenge when you captain and it's something I enjoyed, but Kane's doing a great job, so I'll just try to help him out.""

248,22-1-20,I see 'incredible' Kohli breaking more records: Smith,"It's the year of the World T20 and it isn't just Virat Kohli and the Indian boys who are looking to take every opportunity to prepare for the showpiece event slated to be held later in the year. Run-machine Steve Smith is already excited at the prospect of playing another ICC event at home after the 2015 World Cup. In fact, he believes that his stint in the IPL with Rajasthan Royals will have a major role to play in the build-up to the mega event Down Under.

Speaking to IANS, Smith spoke about the much-debated proposal to have four-day Tests, India skipper Kohli's gesture to ask fans to support him during the 2019 World Cup, the Indian Premier League and how Tim Paine has done a brilliant job leading Australia in Test cricket.

For a man who has dominated batting charts in the last few years, Smith's numbers in the shortest format of the game definitely has room for improvement. But the former Australia skipper wants to keep playing and improving on the go rather than changing his style of training going into the World T20.

""No real specific training, but just playing a lot more T20 cricket and just getting the right tempo I guess for the game is the most important thing for me. I would love to be a part of the World Cup, it's obviously at home in Australia. I was involved in the ODI World Cup here in 2015 and had the most amazing six-weeks of my cricketing career and loved every minute of it. So yeah would love to be involved in another World Cup at home for sure!"" he smiled.

Asked if he was looking at his time with Rajasthan Royals to try some new stuff as it will be the perfect training ground for the World T20, Smith doesn't sound the sort who likes to tinker much with his training ritual. But he does have it on his mind to give his leg-spin skills a thought.

""Ah, don't want to try too much different. I don't really know, maybe a bit more bowling perhaps, but then that takes time away from my batting. So yeah, it's a difficult one but we'll wait and see,"" he reveals.

A chat with Smith can never move forward without discussing Kohli. It looks like these two will go ahead and share all the records between them when they hang their boots. The greatness of Smith though is in his humility. The moment the talks move towards the comparison, he decides to highlight how brilliant Kohli has been both as batsman and leader.

""Yeah, he is terrific. His batting numbers just speak for themselves. I think he's an incredible player in all three formats and I think we will see him break many records. He's already broken plenty of them and I see him breaking many more over the years. He has got the hunger for runs and doesn't stop getting them. Hopefully he can stop getting them against Australia, that'll be nice.

""As a captain he's already made India the number one side in the world in Test cricket. From what I have seen he sets really good standards for them. He is a lot about fitness and is health conscious and things like that. He's got the Indian side into a really good place and leads them exceptionally well,"" the 30-year-old pointed.

Asked about Kohli's gesture to ask fans to show him support during the 2019 World Cup, Smith feels it was really nice of the India skipper. ""In the World Cup it was really nice of Virat to do what he did. He did not have to do that and yeah it was a lovely gesture and really appreciated that,"" he smiled.

Kohli, in fact, won the 'Spirit of Cricket' award for his gesture in England.

There have been talks that Smith is a natural leader and that the national captaincy could well return to him in the near future. But for the batsman, Paine is the captain and someone who is doing a good job with the boys.

""Yeah, Tim's done a terrific job. He has led the troops really well. Obviously retaining the Ashes in England in twenty-odd years was an exceptional effort and yeah he has led the team exceptionally well,"" he said.

From the Ashes to the ICC's proposal to have four-day Test matches on a regular basis from 2023, Smith is a traditionalist in the matter and wants the format to stay as it is.

""I am comfortable with five days. I like the challenge of a five-day Test match. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk of the four-day Tests, but my personal opinion is I like five days. I don't make the decisions obviously of how it all works out but my opinion is five-days Tests is what it is all about,"" he signed off.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-see--incredible--kohli-breaking-more-records--smith-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/i-see--incredible--kohli-breaking-more-records--smith.html
249,22-1-20,"Senate approves impeachment trial rules, puts off witnesses","The US Senate plunged into President Donald Trump's impeachment trial with Republicans abruptly abandoning plans to cram opening arguments into two days but solidly rejecting for now Democratic demands for more witnesses to expose what they deem Trump's ""trifecta"" of offenses.

Trump himself claimed he wants top aides to testify, but qualified that by suggesting there were ""national security"" concerns to allowing their testimony.

""We have a great case,"" Trump said on Wednesday at a global economic forum in Davos.

In a press conference before returning to Washington, Trump said his legal team was doing a ""very good job.""

He appeared to break with Republicans efforts to block Democratic motions to immediately call witnesses and subpoena documents. Instead, Trump said he'd like to see aides, including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, testify as witnesses Trump said he'd leave the ""national security” concerns about allowing their testimony to the Senate.

Tuesday's daylong session started with the setback for Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell and the president's legal team, but it ended near 2 a.M. On Wednesday with Republicans easily approving the rest of the trial rules largely on their terms.

With the rules settled, the trial is now on a fast-track. At issue is whether Trump should be removed from office for abuse of power stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter as Trump was withhold aid to the country, and for obstructing Congress' ensuing probe.

Chief Justice John Roberts gaveled open the session, with House prosecutors on one side, Trump's team on the other, in the well of the Senate, as senators sat silently at their desks, under oath to do “impartial justice.” No cellphones or other electronics were allowed.

As the day stretched deep into the night, lawyerly arguments gave way to more pointedly political ones. Tempers flared and senators paced the chamber. Democrats pursued what may be their only chance to force senators to vote on hearing new testimony.

After one particularly bitter post-midnight exchange, Roberts intervened, taking the rare step of admonishing both the Democratic House managers prosecuting the case and the White House counsel to “remember where they are.""

""I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and the president's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body,"" Roberts said.

He told them that description of the Senate stemmed from a 1905 trial when a senator objected to the word ""pettifogging,"" because members should ""avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse.”

Over and over, Republicans turned back Democratic amendments to subpoena documents from the White House, State Department, Defense Department and budget office. By the same 53-47 party-line, they turned away witnesses with front-row seats to Trump's actions including acting White House chief of staff Mulvaney and Bolton, the former national security adviser critical of the Ukraine policy.

Only on one amendment, to allow more time to file motions, did a single Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, join Democrats. But it, too, was rejected, 52-48.

As the visitors' gallery filled earlier with guests, actress-and-activist Alyssa Milano among them, and Trump's most ardent House allies lining the back rows, the day that began as a debate over rules quickly took on the cadence of a trial proceeding over whether the president's actions toward Ukraine warranted removal from office.

""It's not our job to make it easy for you,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the prosecution, told the Senate. ""Our job is to make it hard to deprive the American people of a fair trial.""

White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the president's lead lawyer, called the trial ""a farce."" He scoffed that the House charges against Trump were “ridiculous.”

The White House legal team did not dispute Trump's actions, when he called Ukraine and asked for a “favour,” which was to investigate Biden as he withheld military aid the ally desperately needed as it faced off with hostile Russia on its border. But the lawyers insisted the president did nothing wrong. ""Absolutely no case,"" Cipollone said.

Schiff, the California Democrat, said America's Founders added the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution with “precisely this type of conduct in mind - conduct that abuses the power of office for a personal benefit, that undermines our national security, and that invites foreign interference in the democratic process of an election.""

Said Schiff: ""It is the trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment.''

The other lead lawyer on Trump's team, Jay Sekulow, retorted, “I'll give you a trifecta,” outlining complaints over the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry process.

In Davos, Trump repeated his attacks on Democratic House managers serving as prosecutors in the trial, saying he'd like to ""sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces"" on the Senate floor during the trial but that his attorneys might have a problem with it.

And he said he wants to deliver the State of the Union as scheduled on February 4 even if the trial is ongoing, calling the address ""very important to what I am doing"" in setting his administration's agenda.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/senate-approves-impeachment-trial-rules--puts-off-witnesses-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/senate-approves-impeachment-trial-rules--puts-off-witnesses.html
250,22-1-20,Crash barriers planned to slash NH fatalities,"Road Min plans to make it must for all highways

In a major step to prevent road accidents, the Centre is considering to install crash barriers along its existing NHs and make it mandatory for all future highway projects.

A week after Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said highway accidents lead to loss of 3 per cent of GDP annually, the Ministry is exploring ways to bring down highway crashes and fatalities. Installing crash barrier is one of the steps in that direction.

Crash barriers are designed to withstand the impact of even high speed vehicles. They are expected to slide and roll guide vehicles back on the road while keeping the level of damage to vehicle as well as to the barriers within acceptable limits. It has been found that less than five per cent of the total network of about 1.50 lakh km of National Highways has crash barriers installed.

“Ideally a crash barrier should present a continuous smooth face to an impacting vehicle so that the vehicle is redirected, without overturning, to a course that is nearly parallel to the barrier face and with a lateral deceleration, which is tolerable to motorists. To achieve these aims, the vehicle must be redirected without rotation about both its horizontal or vertical axis (without “spinning out”) and the rate of lateral deceleration must be such as to cause the minimum risk of injury to the passengers,” explained a senior NHAI official.

“We are preparing specifications to install crash barriers. Different type of crash barriers have to be installed, depending on the lanes of the highways,” said an official.

The Ministry has also taken immediate measures to identify faulty engineering and road designs across the country and has sought help from all stakeholders, including the States.

The Road Ministry is also identifying accident-prone spots. It has set up district-level committees to examine and suggest immediate repair and attention. The Ministry has also formed four separate working groups based on the principle of 4 Es Road Safety — Education, Enforcement, Engineering (roads as well as vehicles) and Emergency care. These groups would submit their recommendations on short-term and long-term measures for immediate implementation so as to curb road accidents in the country.

At the National Road Safety Council and 39th Meeting of Transport Development Council last week, it was pointed out that more people in India die annually in road accidents than those killed in militant strikes.

Gadkari had asked the States to prepare a roadmap to develop and reorient road infrastructure within their administrative limits to cut down fatalities on road.

A new format on ‘Environment and Emergency’ care of road accident victims with tie up with several NGOS, hospitals and stakeholders is also to be worked on.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/crash-barriers-planned-to-slash-nh-fatalities-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/crash-barriers-planned-to-slash-nh-fatalities.html
251,22-1-20,Want to make film on Chandragupta Maurya: Kangana Ranaut,"Actor Kangana Ranaut has expressed her desire to make a movie on Chandragupta, the shepherd- turned-emperor who founded the Maurya dynasty, noting that the film industry has ""not done enough justice to our history"".

The national award winner was here to take part in a programme organised by the publishers of a leading Hindi daily where she performed a jig to the tunes of Bhojpuri songs along with actor-turned-politician Ravi Kishan before the duo participated in a question and answer session.

Replying to the questions posed by Kishan, who is also the BJP MP from Gorakhpur, Ranaut on Tuesday said it was her second trip to Bihar.

""The last time, I was here as a child though I have not yet got a chance to explore the state with which I feel a connect as my Yoga teacher has his roots here,"" she said.

Ranaut, who won acclaim for portraying Rani Laxmibai -- the valiant queen of Jhansi who took on the British during the revolt of 1857 -- in 'Manikarnika', when asked if she would like to be associated with a film on any historical figure from Bihar, said, ""It would be Chandragupta Maurya. The film industry has not done much justice to our history"".

A self-confessed admirer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the 32-year-old, who has won three National Awards in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, replied in the affirmative when asked about reports that she has turned producer and her first venture is based on the theme of Ram temple in Ayodhya.

The Himachal Pradesh-born actress, who has courted controversy for taking on well-entrenched Bollywood ""insiders"" like Karan Johar and Hrithik Roshan, said she has had a rebellious streak since childhood and shared an anecdote about her breaking her teacher's stick upon being hit for chatting with a classmate in school.

When Kishan asked why she has gained so much weight, Ranaut replied it was in preparation for her upcoming biopic ""Thalaivi"", based on late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

The actress said her forthcoming release ""Panga"" is a family drama.

Ranaut said after landing in Patna, she gorged on 'Litti Chokha', a local delicacy.

She also regaled the audience by greeting them in Bhojpuri and repeating several commonly used phrases of the dialect after Kishan.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/want-to-make-film-on-chandragupta-maurya--kangana-ranaut-2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/want-to-make-film-on-chandragupta-maurya--kangana-ranaut.html

253,22-1-20,Didn't expect 'Sex Education' to connect with so many people: Asa Butterfield,"""Sex Education"" star Asa Butterfield is happy that their show, a one of its kind young-adult high school series that explores the matters of the body, has normalised the discussion around the word ""sex"".

Butterfield plays the show's lead protagonist Otis Milburn, an awkward teenager who ends up becoming somewhat a sex therapist to his peers. His partners-in-crime are his best friends Eric Effiong and Maeve Wiley, portrayed by Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey, respectively.

The British show, now in its second season, was a path-breaking success for Netflix with critics hailing it for its exploration of a number of issues such as sexual performance anxiety, impotency, abortion and social-media shaming among others.

With the sophomore installment, showrunner Laurie Nunn has taken the discussion ahead by including topics like sexual harassment and importance of consent.

Butterfield said whatever inhibitions he may have had in the beginning, working on the show turned out to be a refreshing experience.

""We knew what we getting into when she started shooting and we have only become more comfortable with the story and the themes that it tackles,"" the actor told PTI in an interview.

Though the show is set in the sex comedy genre, Butterfield said it explores everything that teenagers go through.

""Everyone has these issues and what we're saying is, it's normal. What teenagers know about sex? I hope it takes the pressure off from people a little. But it's not just about sex. It's a coming-of-age story, a love story, a friendship story... It's very funny, but it's got a lot of heart.""

The 22-year-old actor, who has featured in films such as ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"", ""X+Y"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"", is particularly happy the series has struck a chord with the global audiences.

""The word sex is still a taboo for so many people around the world. Our show deals with it on so many levels. It makes me feel great that it has been able to resonate with the audiences, not just in the UK but all over.

""I knew it would be a risky issue to deal with but what I liked was that the script was venturing into an uncharted territory. I hoped it would be talked about a bit but the reaction it has got from everywhere has blown me over. I didn't expect it to connect so instantly with so many people.""

For Mackey, it was important that the story addressed sexual harassment.

""There are so many women in the UK and all over the world that don't report such incidents. People say these cases do not fall into sexual violence but they do. It is harassment and sexual assault. We need to call a spade a spade.

""I think it is important to acknowledge that these cases are indeed referred to as sexual assault incidents. It made me proud that my show calls it.""

Mackey, 24, said she wouldn't have known to report sexual assault herself, but having seen a character in the show go through such an ordeal has changed her thoughts about it.

""It made me happy that my character was rightly able to say that this was a sexual assault and Aimee (Gibbs) needs to report it. She goes to the police with her and comforts her. That was something I really admired about my role.""

""I believe it was also eye-opening for young boys as they get to see things and are sensitised by what women go through on a regular basis,"" Butterfield added.

Gatwa, who plays Eric, an openly gay teenager hailing from a religious Ghanaian-Nigerian family, said the best thing about the show was its gender-neutral gaze.

""We see in the show what happens from a gender-neutral lens. We try to show the good and bad. It's real and raw, and the emotions are on the table. Our show tries to empower people, giving voice to people who thought they didn't have a voice before.

""It's about openness and having difficult conversations, facing things that don't make you that comfortable, and I've learnt a lot from Eric in that way. It's what the world needs - a very inclusive, diverse show,"" the 27-year-old actor said.

254,22-1-20,Bigg Boss 13: Friendship of #SidNaaz 'kharab ho gaya',"#SidNaaz fans has gone bust, at least for now. Housemates Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill are officially no longer friends, amid the ever-changing love/hate dynamics on the ongoing ""Bigg Boss 13"".

The duo has been possessive about each other in the show, and fans have been loving it. Now, however, it seems like things have soured between them.

Sidharth was recently seen refusing to talk to Shehnaaz, thereby leaving her in tears. She was trying to understand what went wrong but Sidharth did not give an explanation. He simply told Shehnaaz that he cannot be friends with someone who is not on good terms with her family, reports bollywoodlife.com.

In the latest promo of ""Bigg Boss 13"", Shehnaaz says #SidNaaz ""kharab ho gaya hai"". She also ends up having a war of words with fellow contestant Arti Singh.

Shehnaaz's father recently said in an interview: ""I want them to come out and see whether they carry on with their relationship. Sidharth should know this very well, if he goes on to break Shehnaaz's heart, he will remain forever this way (alone and single). No good parents will think of getting their daughter married to Shukla. Shehnaaz knows Siddharth is a womaniser, has had multiple relationships. Three of them are already in the house. There is Rashami Desai, Shefali Jariwala, Arti Singh and I am sure there will be many more outside the house also. He just uses women.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bigg-boss-13--friendship-of--sidnaaz--kharab-ho-gaya--2020-01-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/bigg-boss-13--friendship-of--sidnaaz--kharab-ho-gaya-.html
