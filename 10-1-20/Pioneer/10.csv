0,10-1-20,Will FM pass the litmus test?,"With the economy under stress, India Inc. and citizens are looking at long-term assurances from this Union Budget

The first full Union Budget by a woman, the most powerful, democratically-elected Member of Parliament in India, is just a few days away. Even though technically Nirmala Sitharaman has presented a couple of mini-Budgets since June 2019, this will be her first litmus test on a colonial remnant of the annual policy document called the Budget. Gender and gestures apart, this is a crucial Budget if India is to achieve its stated goal of a $5 trillion economy in the next few years. The slowdown in the economy begun even as the Finance Minister walked into her office last year.

Coupled with rising inflation and a deepening geopolitical crisis, the situation could easily spiral into a blazing bushfire. Oil prices have been rising by an average 10 per cent for the last two months, the US and Iran are standing eyeball to eyeball close to our western borders and the US and China are going through one of the largest decoupling exercises from the global economy on our eastern front. The ingredients are just right for an economic meltdown.

India’s dependence on crude imports as a percentage of consumption is the highest, any global rise in crude prices will push up inflation, harden gold prices further and weaken the rupee. This means the country will spend more on import while investors will continue to pull out money from India’s shores in search of safer harbours. The Indian economy has been projected to grow at its slowest pace ever in a decade at merely five per cent. Manufacturing is estimated to be in a two per cent range for 2019-20, down from nearly seven per cent last year, while the services sector is likely to be in the 6.9 per cent range, that is slower than last year. These poor growth numbers will make the Government’s task of managing the fiscal discipline tough. The Government has hoped to rein in fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the ongoing fiscal year. However, the pressure on revenues is likely to widen.

This leaves a very complicated situation to tackle for the Finance Minister when she reads out the Budget provisions. She has to balance growth with fiscal discipline. As most economists will be able to point out, primary demand creators such as private consumption, investments, foreign or domestic, in long-term job-creating projects and net exports have been on the downward spiral for a year now. That leaves the Government as the primary driver of growth through investments, which creates imbalances in the fiscal discipline.

Yes, the Finance Minister has already announced a slew of measures in the last few months such as bringing down the effective rate of corporate tax to 22 per cent from 30 per cent for companies that don’t seek exemptions and 25 per cent from 35 per cent for those that do. She also put in nearly $10 billion in nationalised banks, rolled back levy on foreign funds and created special vehicles to persuade people to buy more cars and houses.

As we head into the Budget, the clamour will grow for meeting populist demands like lowering personal income tax rates for those earning below Rs 50 lakh a year while increasing it for those in the Rs 1 crore plus bracket and for providing additional tax incentives for the middle class to buy second and perhaps third homes, as this will prop up jobs and have a beneficial impact on the steel cement and infrastructure sector. The Finance Minister may as well announce some of these as incentives in February.

However, it is deeper reforms which will push the economy towards the $5 trillion mark. The stated and desired sale of the flying Maharaja, Air India along with key value-rich public sector companies is still a few quarters away. Make in India defence projects are few, electronics manufacturing is stuck in the mangrove swamp of regulatory hurdles and startups are more of money sponges than job creators.

Telecommunications, a huge demand driver, has had nearly 10 rough quarters and the Government has to step up to stop any further player exit from a fragile market. Just providing a few relaxations, installments of taxes and levies for buying lifeblood called spectrum for the telecom sector, isn’t going to help. The Government has to relook at monetisation models from spectrum if it wants to bring in the next generation 5G-driven digital economy in the next fiscal.

It has to ensure banks are healthy enough to absorb some of the bad debts as well as be prepared to lend afresh to retail, small and medium sector enterprises. Auto as a sector may be undergoing a technology shift, leading to job losses and lower demand. However, the Government has to ensure this job creating sector gets a graceful glide path to its new variant. Factories need to start producing goods, not just for India but for the world and the only path towards that, is perhaps not for a Budget speech but by diplomatic manoeuvres and removing regulatory mesh. India Inc. and citizens are looking at long-term assurances this Budget.

1,10-1-20,Circular economy an imperative now,"The growing Indian economy will continue to compel geologists, technocrats, economists, manufacturers, service providers and policymakers to explore superior options to face the challenge of increasing material consumption and depleting natural resources

In a major decision, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics authorities have decided that the medals at the games will be made from 50,000 tonnes of electronic-waste produced in Japan.

A US firm has designed a 99 per cent recyclable battery, which for a product so chemically complex and hazardous, is of enormous importance. Highly deficient in precious-metal resource India, which produces a whopping two million tons of e-waste annually is at the cusp of mobilising its recycling strategy. The world seemingly has realised the true need of the circular economy.

The Indian economy will continue to compel geologists, technocrats, economists, manufacturers, service providers and policymakers to explore superior options to face the challenge of growing material consumption and depleting natural resources.

The increasing consumption demand for material is primarily due to increased population and prosperity, demographic changes, lifestyle transformations and intervention of disruptive technologies. The result is increased volatility in product prices and ecological imbalance, affecting societies adversely. Scarcity of material is a concern but the good news is that the circular economy approach can serve as a powerful solution.

The circular economy seeks to eliminate all kind of wastes in the market, i.e. waste of resources where material/energy cannot be regenerated; wastage of capacities where assets are hardly or not fully utilised, e.g. poor utilisation of family-owned cars; underutilisation of life-cycles through accelerated development of new products, processes and business models resulting in difficult-to-serve demand peaks, e.g. smartphones; and waste of embedded value where precious metals/energy are lost in waste streams, e.g. gold and palladium in e-waste.

The widely-used linear business model of “mine-refine-shape-assemble-use-discard” ends up in waste generation. India expects to double its consumption of metallic resources by 2030. Its per capita consumption of stainless steel touched a new peak of 2.5 kg in 2019 (ISSDA report). Consumption of copper is likely to double in the next five years. India is also the largest consumer of gold in the world.

For such a growing consumption and the widening production-consumption gap, material recyclability and improved natural resource productivity can provide sustainable relief.

The concept of recycling/reuse is not new in Asia. Second-hand garment, furniture, utensil and vehicle markets, though unstructured, are common in India. This phenomenon is replacing the linear model by the circular model of “mine-refine-shape-assemble-use-collect-reprocess-reuse” with a “10-R” approach as its backbone.

The first “R” attempts to reduce material consumption by using products with longer life instead of use-and-throw. Also, additive-manufacturing and 3-D printing in new product development and in manufacturing of spare parts of aircraft can lead to practically no waste generation.

In the remarket route, the discarded products are resold and utilised in an alternate market in different avatars, e.g. Cars24; OLX in the used automotive market. Large volumes of defective products are discarded even when repair can provide a longer life, e.g. kitchenware.

In the refill route, the product under breakdown due to End-of-Life (EoL) of one of its parts may get a new lease of life if the defective part is replaced with a new EoL part. Refurbishing or remanufacturing is another business route. For instance, machine tools, home-appliances are refurbished to near original state of performance. Remanufactured car engines can be 30-50 per cent less expensive.

The retro-fitment route upgrades existing machine tools, which is a growing industry today. In the reuse of parts route, discarded products get their parts having residual EoL stripped-off, to be used in another product, like in electronic goods. The reuse of high-value metals route extracts gold, palladium, iridium from e-wastes to be used in other applications. In the reprocess scrap route, instead of discarding engineered products like motors, batteries and canisters, metals like steel, copper, lead can be recovered efficiently through scrap melting.

Finally, the rental route is a product-as-a-service business model providing tangible goods as a service. In place of purchasing a product, provide a shared-platform for multiple end-usage. For instance, UK-based hydrogen fuel cell car manufacturer Riversimple behaves as a lessor rather than a manufacturer by charging a rental, covering maintenance, fuel and insurance from its customers. Instead of selling robots for spot welding to car manufacturers, robot manufacturers can not only build, own and operate robots but also sell the client world-class weld spots, thereby maximising utility and life of robots and delivering more reliable cars.

The 10-R approach can accelerate the circular economy drive but not without associated barriers and challenges.

One of the first barriers is the inferior positioning of remanufacturing business with original equipment manufacturers. Creating a sense of urgency and awareness of its larger benefits and introducing material circular in schools/colleges can trigger the change. The challenge in handling the probabilistic reverse-logistics for collection of discarded products in terms of varying quantum, quality and frequency is genuine. It induces volatility in business. Low collection-efficiency of products after EoL is a big challenge. To facilitate collection, ownership will have to move upstream in the supply chain. Rental/shared-platform related approach can majorly eliminate issues of collection.

Lack of strong product design- based reverse supply chain is leading to a challenge in improving collection of EoL products. Smart designs, taxing virgin-material application and moving towards zero-landfills may be the way out. The current, less privileged informal sector MSMEs engaged in repair and maintenance of products will have a critical role to play in the effectiveness of the approach. A higher degree of transparency of ownership coupled with access to smartphones and internet; reducing costs of sensors are facilitating mapping of physical systems digitally to track EoL of products.

Lack of incentive for product-return in today’s disposable society with “cash-rich” and “time-poor” consumer needs revisiting. Rapid awareness creation of the key drivers to circularity to the young population is the order of the day. A quick implementation of a comprehensive circular economy policy by the Government has become inevitable, as the Centre finalises the legal framework for effective looping of material in the automotive sector and National Resource Efficiency Policy. Hope this happens sooner than later.

2,10-1-20,How did CES end up being a car show?,"The Consumer Electronics Show has become the world’s largest tech show. But why are there so many carmakers and cars? Is this a sign of a tectonic shift in the auto industry?

This past week I spent a painfully short amount of time at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held every January in America’s ‘Sin City’ or Las Vegas. And if you get excited by tech, it is an amazing show. Just the sheer multitude of large-screen 8K televisions on display is mind-blowing and some of the stands of giants like LG, Samsung, Sony, Canon, TCL make your jaw drop thanks to sheer complexity of their displays. There are drones, 3D printing, electric cycles and all sorts of robots, so much of it invariably from China. But what has become interesting about CES particularly over the past few years is the number of automakers who attend it.

I was personally a guest of Hyundai Motors and Hyundai wasn’t showcasing a car or even a new user experience. Rather, it had a new vision for the future of mobility —wait for it, a helicopter. Well, they called it an ‘Urban Aerial Mobility’ craft. The life-size model SA-1 we saw at the Hyundai was quite big and the vision the company has in collaboration with Uber Elevate, of a fleet of connected electric vehicles attached to hubs alongside public transport and shared mobility. These hubs themselves would be connected by these oversized drones. Seriously, that is what these look like. And I appreciate that this is still quite a way forward in the future, definitely in India and possibly even in the San Francisco Bay Area, which Hyundai and Uber used as an example. The vision of 2023 for the prototypes and a functional fleet by 2025 is a bit premature although I believe something like this can very easily work in Dubai and the rest of the United Arab Emirates.

But Hyundai’s efforts to jointly develop an urban shared mobility model with Uber was not the craziest thing I saw at CES. Because that inevitably had to be the Vision-S car, from Sony. Yes, Sony. The Japanese guys are more famous for televisions and audio players. Now, Sony has gone into related businesses before. They were the first hardware company to discover the concept of forward integration, that is creating the content for all those televisions and music players. And Sony has become among the largest film and television production houses in the world. This alongside being the largest video game company thanks to the Playstation brand. And while you might think a car is a stretch, when we spoke to Sony’s Public Relations folks with the car, it really is not.

The Vison-S has 33 different sensors and cameras from ultra-sonic sensors, radar to solid-state LIDAR, all of which are made by Sony. Also add the user experience for the driver and passengers, the audio system with neck-mounted speakers built into the seats, and the battery technology powering two 200 kilowatt motors which would equate to 525 horsepower, which would put this at a similar level as performance variants of German sedans such as the BMW 5 Series.

But after I saw the car and the technology, as well as spoke to Sony executives, I realised that the Vision-S is a technology demonstrator where Sony is putting out the fact that modern electric and autonomous cars are powered by their technology. And frankly, because electric cars have reduced the mechanical complexity of manufacturing and because Sony is clear that they will make a road-legal demonstrator of the Vision-S, it isn’t beyond the realm of possibility that Sony will manufacture such a car. Though unlikely but not impossible.

Other major manufacturers were there as well. From Audi, BMW and Mercedes, showcasing their latest technology, particularly improvements in their user experience systems inside the cabin, to the guys who make the innards of cars such as Bosch and ZF as well as the other technology companies that power modern automotive technology including Google who showcased how the Google Assistant on Android Auto is improving. There was ‘HERE Maps’ as well showing off the latest mapping tech. There was so much automotive technology on display that one might at such a place begin to realise that car manufacturers are now competing with consumer technology companies and Sony, making a car, should have some like their Japanese compatriots worried.

Cars have always been at the forefront of technology but now more than ever, the car itself is a piece of modern electronic gadgetry. It isn’t surprising that CES is becoming a major automotive show and I’m pretty sure that this will only get bigger for carmakers. And they will evolve just like Hyundai plans to and become something else altogether. Tech shows have become auto shows and as we head for the Auto Expo in three weeks’ time, auto shows also ought to change and become something more.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-did-ces-end-up-being-a-car-show--2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/how-did-ces-end-up-being-a-car-show-.html
3,10-1-20,Agri mandis should pay more cow cess: Yogi,"With the aim to generate more resources for gaushalas (cow sheds), Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that since the income of agricultural mandis had increased, they should give three per cent cess for cow shelters instead of the existing two per cent.

The chief minister made this announcement during the 157th meeting of the governing council of State Agricultural Produce Market Board (Mandi Parishad) held at Lok Bhawan here on Thursday.

He said the additional money generated through the increased cess should be given to only those institutions that run cow shelters with devotion and keep them neat and clean.

Some amount of this money could also go to the Animal Husbandry Department, he added.

The government has sanctioned Rs 47.50 crore in the current financial year for maintenance of destitute and stray bovines kept in temporary bovine shelter homes.

Of this, Rs 4.42 crore has been sanctioned for Kanha Gaushalas and cattle shelter homes run by Lucknow Nagar Nigam.

A government order has been issued in this regard by the Animal Husbandry Department.

During his address, the chief minister cautioned officials against traders who could hoard essential commodities like pulses and cooking oil in view of the ongoing tensions in the Gulf countries.

“Some people may indulge in black marketing, storage and smuggling of essential commodities in view of tension in the Gulf region. Such people can increase the prices of these commodities by creating artificial shortages. Keep a close eye on them and take stern action if necessary. Also, keep a special watch on the prices of pulses, oil and vegetables”, Yogi Adityanath said.

The chief minister directed that one lab each should be set up in Lucknow, Varanasi and Gorakhpur as well as in Bundelkhand and Western UP for organic products.

“It would be better to set up such labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in every district,” the chief minister said.

As per the guidelines of the Centre, 500 ‘haat paith’ (local market) in the state should be made with the consent of the gram panchayats concerned.

“Make panchayats accountable for the upkeep of ‘haat paith’. For this, the panchayats should also charge a minimum fee,” he said.

The chief minister pointed out that the mandis formed under the Bundelkhand package had not been shifted so far and directed officials to shift them by increasing the facilities there.

“Encourage export of agricultural products from the state. Whatever conditions are set for these, they should be absolutely clear so that no one interprets it according to one’s interests,” the chief minister said

4,10-1-20,Noida SSP suspended,"Much to the embarrassment of the Uttar Pradesh government, the objectionable video of Noida district police chief Vaibhav Krishna that went viral turned out to be authentic, forcing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to suspend him and order a high level enquiry to save his government from attacks by opposition parties on this issue.

Yogi Adityanath not only suspended Krishna but also shunted out four of the five IPS officers posted as district chiefs following allegations of corruption in postings made against them.

The government spokesman claimed that the action had been initiated under the ‘zero tolerance’ policy of the state government towards corruption.

According to an official communiqué of the state government released on Thursday evening, the chief minister took stern action against Gautam Buddha Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna and placed him under suspension after forensic lab in Gujarat submitted its reports on the viral video of his chat with a woman.

Krishna has been suspended for violation of conduct rules.

A departmental inquiry has also been ordered against Krishna. The inquiry has been handed over to Lucknow Zone ADG SN Sabat. He will submit his report as soon as possible.

The forensic lab report confirmed that the video and chat were authentic.

Krishna had claimed that it was a morphed video aimed at maligning his image. He had even lodged a report against unknown persons for making the video viral.

In his FIR, Krishna had alleged that the video was fake and was posted by some IPS officers and journalists to malign his image as he had initiated action against them for their corrupt practices.

The government spokes-man claimed that the forensic investigation revealed that the video was not edited or morphed.

The report was submitted to IGADG Meerut Zone, Alok Singh, who was investigating the case. During the investigation, Singh had sent the video to the forensic lab in Gujarat.

Interestingly, while alleging that the video was posted to malign his image, Krishna had held a press conference and leaked a confidential letter he had sent to the government, requesting inquiry into the corrupt practices of some IPS officers and journalists.

Meanwhile, the government release said that under the zero tolerance policy towards corruption, the chief minister took stern action against five IPS officers named in the Vaibhav Krishna’s case by removing them from the post of district incharges. All these five police officers have been removed from field.

The official communiqué said that a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) had been constituted under senior IPS officer. DG (Vigilance) Hitesh Chandra Awasthi heads the SIT that has IG (STF) Amitabh Yash and Jal Nigam MS Vikas Gothalwal as members.

The SIT has been asked to complete the investigation within 15 days and action will be taken as soon as the report is received by the government.

The government spokes-man claimed that action at this level had been taken for the first time in the history of the state to send out a strong message.

It may be mentioned here that the Noida SSP, in his letter to the government on November 26, 2019, had accused senior IPS officers and other officers of corruption in transfer and posting.

The officers charged by the Noida SSP are IPS officers Ajay Pal Singh, Sudhir Kumar Singh, Ganesh Saga, Rajiv Narain Mishra and Himanshu Kumar. The other officers are director media in chief secretary’s office, Diwakar Khare, and PCS officers Gulshan Kumar and Rajnish.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/noida-ssp-suspended.html
5,10-1-20,Lucknow SSP among 14 IPS officers shifted,"In a major reshuffle, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday shifted 14 IPS officers and appointed new police chiefs in nine important districts, including Ghaziabad, Etawah, Rampur and Barabanki.

The transfer list also included the name of Lucknow district police chief Kalanidhi Naithani, who has been shifted to Ghaziabad as SSP.

However, no officer was so far posted as SSP of Lucknow and also the SSP of Noida, where Vaibhav Krishna was placed under suspension.

Sources said that the government was planning to introduce police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida.

The government, however, shifted the five IPS officers who were charged with corruption by Krishna in a letter sent to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for necessary action.

According to the official communiqué released on Thursday evening, Lucknow’s SSP Kalanidhi Naithani has been made SSP of Ghaziabad, replacing Sudhir Kumar Singh, who has been posted as commandant of PAC in Agra.

SP, PTC Unnao, Shiv Hari Meena, has been made the new SP of Sultanpur, replacing Himanshu Kumar, who goes as commandant of PAC in Etawah.

Etawah SSP Santosh Kumar Mishra has been made SP of Rampur, replacing Ajay Pal Sharma who has been made SP (PTC Unnao.

Barabanki’s SP Akash Tomar has been shifted as SSP of Etawah while SP of Ghazipur, Arvind Chaturvedi, has been shifted as SP of Barabanki.

SSP of Jhansi, Dr Om Prakash Singh, has been made SP of Ghazipur and commandant of PAC in Moradabad, Muniraj, has been shifted as the new SSP of Jhansi.

ASP Kushinagar Gaurav Bhanswal will be the new SP of Hathras, replacing Siddharth Shankar Meena, who has been made SP of Banda, replacing Ganesh Prasad Saha, who has been shifted as SP, Human Rights.

6,10-1-20,Dispose of cases of entrepreneurs without delay: CS,"Chief Secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari has directed officials to dispose of the cases of entrepreneurs without any delay and resolve the issues raised during meetings at the earliest.

He said the district officer should ensure that relevant information was provided regarding disposal of problems raised in the Udyog Bandhu meeting within one month.

Tiwari said if this was not done, the divisional commissioner and district magistrates concerned would be required to come in the meeting and give clarification in this regard.

He said that the pending issues should be shortlisted within 15 days and their approval taken from competent authorities for disposal. “If in any matter unnecessary delay or repeated queries are found, the officer concerned will be marked and action will be taken against him/her as per the rules,” he said.

The chief secretary was presiding over a high-level meeting of Udyog Bandhu in which he issued directions for quick disposal of pending issues to the officers concerned.

Tiwari said that industrial development was one of the highest priorities of the state government and to solve the problems of industries, a meeting of the Udyog Bandhu would be held every month under the chairmanship of the IIDC and in every two months under the chairmanship of the chief secretary.

Expressing displeasure over long pending land-related issues at the district level, the chief secretary issued direction that land-related report for industries be made available within one month by the district administration.

7,10-1-20,Don’t be a silent tool,"Incidents at JNU have cast a shadow on the integrity of the police force. It’s high time Delhi Police restores credibility. It owes allegiance not to the Government but to the rule of law

The modern police force (some would call this an oxymoron) is often assumed to have been around for centuries. India, with its colonial backdrop, got its own police force from what the British had left. However, even in democracies that are centuries older, the modern police force is a relatively recent concept. In the US, for example, policing was primarily profit-based. Meaning, it was a privately-funded system and was often a luxury only for the rich and the powerful. Slowly, this model changed from an individually-funded luxury to more of a collective good where a larger number of people pooled in money to pay for the protection of their town/city.

In the northern part of the US, this requirement for a police force was primarily driven by economic factors, ie, to keep the property and assets of a community safe. In the southern part, however, policing was driven by a different motivation. The focus of the police was on “protection” and “preservation” of the slavery system and on “enforcing segregation.” As the Time magazine put it eloquently, in the US, throughout the 19th century, the definition of public order, which a police officer was entrusted to maintain, depended on who was asking. This policing system in the later part of the 19th century was driven by political parties, where the police captains and sergeants for each precinct were usually picked by the local political party ward leader. This police would then target forces that challenged the prevailing political establishment.

Fast forward to 2019 and to the Indian police force, events of the past month show just how little can change over a period of time. This past week, we saw one of the most troubling episodes in police history at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). On January 5, a mob of masked men and women entered the JNU campus armed with machetes, hammers and rods and attacked the students and teachers there. At least 23 people were injured, including faculty members and students.

The one image that stood out was of a “helpless” police force standing outside the gates of the university campus even as violence and damage raged inside JNU. As per reports, WhatsApp alerts where sent to the Delhi police, raising an alarm that a large gathering had entered JNU with weapons and sticks and were attacking the students. These alerts were sent around 3 pm. However, until 7:45 pm, additional forces failed to enter JNU to stop the violence and get a grip of the situation.

In fact, as per a Delhi Police report, starting from 2:30 pm, the police control room received more than 50 calls about masked miscreants entering the university campus and beating up students. This was not the only curious element in the sequence of events. As the attacks took place, an entire stretch of the road of up to one kilometre in front of JNU became pitch dark. Why were the streetlights switched off or missing? And how did this happen? As a former police officer and a bearer of common sense, I feel the first thing the police should have done was to somehow get the lights working in the area where the worst attack was taking place. One doesn’t need police training to know that there is less likelihood of crime and violence when people think they can be identified. Yet, we do not know what caused this curious case of missing lights. The Delhi police’s image was further dented due to photographs that showed people armed with rods and sticks walking right in front of them.

In Uttar Pradesh, too, there have been certain horror stories that have emerged over the past month regarding the conduct of the police. As per eye witness accounts and newspaper reports, it is estimated that more than 5,500 detention and 1,100 arrests took place across the State while various groups protested against the BJP Government’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). In fact, the Allahabad High Court took suo motu cognisance of the matter and sought a reply from the State Government over the incidents of police brutality against the protesters. More and more stories of lawless and police-backed gundaraj are emerging in the Yogi-ruled State. The stories we hear, however, are limited, to a large extent, by internet blockade that seems to be the go-to weapon of the BJP.

Both the JNU incident and the episodes in Uttar Pradesh are a shocking indictment of the police in our country. We are no longer talking about modernising the police force or improving investigation. All those improvements can only be built on a police force that has integrity, which the ruling Government has eroded. What we are witnessing now is how the police force is being directed, instructed or nudged to overlook certain incidents from certain pockets of people and amplify certain incidents from another. The discourse has been set by the ruling Government with phrases like tukde-tukde gang or labelling every critic as anti-national.

Why the BJP is setting the nation aflame? It has nothing to talk about other than these imagined rivalries between Indians. The fear and hatred that pits one Indian against another is created by the BJP, propagated by certain stooges of the ruling dispensation and then implemented on the ground by various agencies, be it the police force or the tax authorities or any other tool that the BJP can get its hand on. The Government can’t have us focus on the fact that its rule has been an unmitigated disaster. Unemployment is at its highest in 45 years, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is low and consumer spending, too, is down. Which is why these incidents keep happening under its rule.

A study conducted by three political scientists of the Yale University had said that the BJP benefits every time there is a riot or religious discord. It has, therefore, decided to return to its tried and tested method. The police, however, must realise that they owe allegiance to the rule of law and to the Constitution. They know this already but may be the police needs reminding that public order is not what is defined by the BJP. If they allow it to be, then it might as well be the knell of democracy.

8,10-1-20,Guided tour in J&K,"Rather than flying envoys in and stage-managing PR, the Govt must first ensure a degree of normalcy in the Valley

These are cold facts. The Kashmir Valley has been under a digital siege with internet and mobile networks shut down ever since Article 370 was abrogated in August. Zero online operations and transactions have hurt everything that matters on the human liveability index — businesses, bank transfers, hospital referrals, telemedicine, distant learning and even student registrations. There has been an unprecedented security lockdown ever since Jammu and Kashmir was downgraded from a State to a Union Territory, ostensibly to prevent people from protesting against the decisions imposed. Three former Chief Ministers, who have always been the bridge between the people and the Centre and have acted as a bulwark against exported militancy taking roots on home soil, continue to be under detention for fear that their old stated positions on protective status for the Valley would now amount to inciting treason. And without addressing the civilian drift, resulting from the denial of the basic right to life’s conveniences, and the continued disfranchisement of people, the Government, once again ill-advisedly, is resorting to a “guided tour” diplomacy to prove that all is well. May be, it should have focussed on working on ordinary locals and empowering local governance structures than para-trooping its own version of the truth. But faced with increasing criticism over what it justified as a decision within India’s Constitutional space, it is now going out an arm and limb to quell international anxieties about the situation on the ground. Needless to say, its controversial policies on citizenship and student protests over the same have made it somewhat desperate for some goodwill hunting. So while the Government may tomtom having the US ambassador on board as part of a delegation of envoys for a familiarisation trip in the Valley, what it forgets is that the European Union nations, Australia and many Gulf countries have chosen to stay out. The EU ambassadors have been receptive to the European Parliament’s concerns about the rights situation in Kashmir and recused themselves as they insisted on meeting the former Chief Ministers and wanted to move freely. It is shameful that our democracy has come under a cloud of suspicion and doubt from the many nations that valued and respected us for honouring it in the first place. Except the US envoy, who may have joined in as part of his nation’s strategic fair weather with India, there are no heavyweights (most are from Africa and Latin America). Also, they were rushed through the “troublesome” Srinagar during the first part of the day and then taken to Jammu for civilian interactions.

Clearly the Government’s desperation to re-order propaganda over perception has meant that it has hardly learnt lessons from its last PR misadventure when it let in an “unofficial” EU delegation of MPs for an ear-to-the-ground survey of Kashmir. It turned out to be a “friendly” mission, having been organised by a pro-Government NGO. Besides, the delegation comprised known hardliners and far-right MPs. Clearly then, this looks like another stage-managed, damage control fix than an open house. Except that such gimmicks are past their prime at a time when information has a way of trickling out from the many subterranean highways. The Government should understand that a narrative of victimisation will always find more takers than the dissemination of its sanitised intentions. Justifiably, a whole spectrum of Opposition leaders, led by the Congress, are demanding that countrymen be allowed to visit the Valley first. This is indeed unavoidable as civil and political engagement, howsoever chaotic or negative, has to happen if the administration wants to go anywhere with its wishful thinking of changing the political template of the sub-region. Otherwise, the reorganisation of Kashmir will only be seen as an exercise in point-scoring and demonisation of another kind of otherness, that all of the Valley is secessionist and the enemy at our gates. In fact, this pick-and-choose approach queers the perception of India even more. If indeed the Government wants to publicise normalcy, then it should first ensure a degree of it at the ground level. If the Government is so confident that the world at large and citizens at home have made peace with the legality of the changed situation there, then it should take a step forward, no matter what the risks, and let the muzzled voices out. It should have the absorptive strength of criticism, too, if it wants to mainstream the political economy of Kashmir. Unless it wants to prove Pakistan right and allow terrorism to grow here.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/guided-tour-in-j-k-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/guided-tour-in-j-k.html
9,10-1-20,Feisty Deepika,"The actor has chosen to do what more privileged and established stars have not done before her

Finally, it has come to this. Members of the party with a difference, which commands the absolutist heft of 303 Lok Sabha seats, cornered celebrity citizen and Bollywood A-lister Deepika Padukone for showing solidarity with students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who were holding a protest against the violence unleashed on the university’s campus. Not only that, loyalists of the ruling BJP dismissed her championship of the democratic right to speak out and be heard as equivalent to an endorsement of the “tukde tukde” gang, a blanket term for intelligent citizenry who question wrongful Government policies. Worst, they even made a “nationalist” call for boycotting her films. Many may slam her appearance as a PR stunt or claim she seized the first mover’s advantage as a breakout artiste when Bollywood is being shamed for being politically correct. Others may argue that at a time an A-lister’s ratings are guided by her relevance in Twitterverse and young Indian consumerists, she has made a smart move. But Deepika, no stranger to far-right fanaticism, still took a significant first step. Let’s not forget she is among the highest paid actors in the country, is a producer and has every reason not to jeopardise her ivory tower life. Yet she has chosen to do what the more privileged and established stars have not done before her, grasping the sentiment of the times, taking a public stand against violence in institutions of education and the erosion of what she calls “the foundation of her country.” There have been activist veterans of the industry like Shabana Azmi, Javed Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap and the Delhi-schooled brigade led by actor Swara Bhaskar. But they don’t command Deepika’s market value. And if she is taking a stand, then she is swaying that market with it. As a youth icon, her act was change-making and as a conscience call to an industry generally considered supine, she has genuinely shattered the glass house.

No one knows the decimating and terrifying power of hate better than Deepika. She has had bounties on her head when her film Padmavaat turned fringe Rajput groups against her. Fortunately, most Indians have risen to her defence. When celebrities make humongous amounts of money for their ability to influence the masses, then why shouldn’t they also lend themselves to a cause like any right-minded citizen if they so deem fit? Deepika has done what every conscientious Indian should do when democracy is threatened. Sadly, such gestures by celebrities are few and far between.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/feisty-deepika-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/feisty-deepika.html
10,10-1-20,Find a better alternative,"A Government proposal to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, to render all underage marriages void, is being opposed by child rights activists

A proposal by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006, to render all underage marriages void, has raised the hackles of women’s groups, child rights activists, community-based organisations and legal and development researchers. They contend that this move would not benefit underage girls and do more harm than good.

At present, under the PCMA, though all underage marriages are voidable, they are treated as valid. This means that while such marriages can be prevented with the help of this Act, they are considered valid once they take place. It (the marriage) can, however, be nullified by the underage girl. On the other hand, if amended, the PCMA will no longer recognise the marital status of underage girls or their matrimonial rights as it does now. It will also take away their right to decide whether or not they want to continue with the marriage or nullify it.

Then, how will this amendment empower girls? Why is the Government pushing for it when Karnataka has already tried this and not succeeded in deterring the incidence of underage marriages? In 2016, the Karnataka Government declared all underage marriages as legally void (as compared to such marriages being voidable if the underage girl so wants under the Central legislation). In such legally void underage marriages, while the girl continues to stay at her matrimonial home despite no legal recognition of her marriage, she has no access to inheritance and marital rights.

Experts say that making the marriage void impacts the girl negatively as she will continue to be vulnerable until such time the couple marries again on reaching adulthood. Only then will their alliance be considered legally valid and the girl become eligible to avail social welfare benefits. Consultations on whether or not this amendment was needed were held recently by the Partners in Law in Development (PLD), a legal resource group. Over 25 NGOs working on the issue shared experiences of the circumstances in which girls were forced into underage marriages and how the law worked on the ground when they sought help either to prevent or nullify them from duty-bearers or community workers.

The inability of the law to protect the community or NGO workers when they intervened to help these girls was also discussed, just as it failed to help Bhanwari Devi, a Government worker employed to stop child marriages in Rajasthan. She was sexually assaulted to punish her for intervening in the marriage of an infant girl from a dominant caste. It has been over 25 years but her case is yet to come to any conclusion and the perpetrators are yet to be punished. Therefore, in such a scenario, greater focus on eliminating root causes of such marriages, addressing existing patriarchal attitudes and investing on empowering girls and their families could be a better way to end child marriage. As early marriage is often not a choice, there was an urgent need to tackle poor education, taboos around adolescent sexuality and the lack of employment opportunities, all of which combine to make marriage compulsory for girls according to Madhu Mehra of PLD.

A study by PLD on how PCMA has been used over nine years shows that the law had been largely used with criminal laws by parents of girls to target marriages without their consent. It found that PCMA cases filed by the parents of the girl, essentially to counter elopements were far greater that those by Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPO) against forced marriages.

In such cases, parents used the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) in conjunction with PCMA to prosecute boys in consensual relations and runaway marriages. Under POCSO, the age of sexual consent is 18, the same as the minimum age of marriage. This makes POCSO a powerful legal tool to punish the boys in a sexual relationship with the adolescent girls even if it is consensual.

In fact, romantic cases in which the girl admitted to a consensual relationship with the accused boy constituted a high percentage of cases under POCSO. A study by the Centre for Child and the Law in Bengaluru’s National Law University of India found that of the 2,788 POCSO cases in the five States studied, Delhi topped the list with 23 per cent of them being romantic cases followed by Karnataka (21.8 per cent in just three districts), Andhra Pradesh (21.2 per cent), Maharashtra (20.5 per cent) and Assam (15.6 per cent).

In Mumbai too, it was no different. Aarambh India, a portal dedicated to protection of children from sexual offences, worked on 260 cases jointly with Prerana, a not-for-profit working on child protection and the international ‘Break the Silence’ campaign of the Hong Kong-based ADM Capital Foundation. They found that about 25 per cent were involved in consensual sexual relationships, of which a large number were between the age group of 16-18 years.

A study of 731 police cases in 2017 in tribal areas of Gujarat’s Dahod, Panchmahal and Morbi districts revealed that reports of missing girls aged between 14-18 years were registered as abduction cases. Conducted by Area Networking and Development Initiatives, (ANANDI), a non-profit working in the State, the research found that 46 per cent of these abduction cases filed were related to marriage (against wishes of parents) and all the complainants were parents of the girl.

Adolescent girls who elope often do so from desperation. In their recent report on Why Girls Run Away to Marry, the PLD points out that girls take this step when they realise discovery of their romantic relationship will cause trouble, or when forced marriage is imminent. The study states that elopement is also a way for the girls to escape isolation or abuse in natal homes while bearing the drudgery of housework. In such cases, the report states that punitive laws cannot be a solution to tackling either elopements or marriages forced by conditions of economic deprivation.

Since a high percentage of these cases are of consenting relations between adolescents, there needs to be a recognition and acceptance of their sexuality instead of criminalising them. Since health service providers are mandated to report cases of sexual activity and pregnancy among adolescents that come to them, it automatically pushes their case into the criminal justice system without the consent of the girls.

Ongoing interventions and research between the Mumbai-based Centre for Enquiry Into Health and Allied Theme (CEHAT), with Mumbai Municipal Hospitals showed that of the girls brought in during the period 2008-2016 by the police for rape examination, 41 per cent were under 18 years.

Although these girls clearly stated that they were in consenting relationships and did not want to record a complaint, their parents insisted on filing First Information Reports (FIRs). Further, CEHAT also found that when girls visited public hospitals seeking a medical termination of an unwanted pregnancy, the hospitals violated their right to choice by making abortion conditional i.e. it would be allowed only if the girl reported her case with the police and registered a FIR.

Past cases have shown that delays following such reporting sometimes exceed 20 weeks within which a termination of pregnancy is allowed by law. This forces the girl to either approach the courts or carry the pregnancy to full term, both of which can be traumatic.

India is among 196 countries which are signatories to the Convention of the Rights of Child (CRC). This calls for recognising adolescent sexuality as well as underage marriages of older adolescents to be treated as valid if the indirect harm outweighs its benefits.

Studies by the organisations opposing the proposed PCMA amendment have provided evidence of the harm caused by the law. Criminalising consenting adolescents is a violation of their rights and addressing the root cause of such marriages/elopements by building capacities and sexual and reproductive health knowledge of adolescents must be the only options.

12,10-1-20,HWC receives 150 complaints of sexual harassment in 6 months,"Haryana State Commission for Women received around 150 complaints of sexual harassment of Women at work place from various parts of the State in the last six months.

Vice-chairperson of the Commission, Preeti Bhardwaj said that the Commission is concerned with the rise of crime cases against women in the State. Taking serious note of it, the Commission has written a letter to Haryana Chief Secretary and suggested that the executing departments should take urgent and relevant actions to enforce strict legal compliances under the law of Sexual Harassment of Women at workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.

Bhardwaj said the Commission had earlier sent letters with regard to the necessary compliances under POSH Act 2013 to different government institutions of the State but have received fractured responses wherein the Act is followed in bits and pieces and not in totality. “Now with the spurt of such complaints with the Commission in the recent times it becomes imperative on the executing departments in the State to take urgent and relevant actions to enforce the strict legal compliances of the Act 2013,” she said.

Bhardwaj said that the Commission received such complaints from different institutions, organisations, bodies, NGOs and includes both government and private sectors.

in the last six months, eight cases of sexual harassment of women at work place each were reported at Commission from Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal. 14 from Rohtak, 10 from Panipat and Hisar; 11 from Sonepat; four from Yamunanagar; three from Jhajjar; six from Jind; eight from Mahindergarh; three from Rewari, four from Karnal; six from Bhiwani and Sirsa; nine from Kaithal; six from Ambala among others.

The Vice Chairperson said that the POSH Act, 2013 applies to all institutions, irrespective of their nature and sphere of work whether corporate, universities, schools, colleges, hospitals and hotels among others.

“Act states that no women shall be subjected to sexual harassment at any work place. However it is matter of concerns that as per the reports women in many of their workplaces are facing consistent sexual harassment in the State,” she said.

The vice-chairperson said that in the letter the Commission suggested the State government that a circular to this effect enforcing compliances under Act to be issued to all the district deputy commissioners, government departments/PSUs, Boards, Corporations, Commissions, Universities, Government Affiliated bodies and institutions. The deputy commissions may be further directed to issue circulate for relevant compliances under the Act for all private institutions and bodies among others, she said, adding the local Complaint Committee established under this Act to look into the complaints of sexual harassment at district level may be further instructed to be involved in the compliance of POSH Act, 2013.

13,10-1-20,Won’t quit politics without giving job opportunities to all: Capt,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday declared that he would not quit politics till he had ensured jobs for the youth and opportunities for all to grow in a progressive Punjab.

Capt Amarinder, addressing Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) members and workers at the installation ceremony of the youth wing’s newly-elected office-bearers including its president Barinder Singh Dhillon, made it clear that he would continue to lead Punjab in its growth and development.

“This is my state, you are all my people…I will always be here for you, and will not go anywhere till I have ensured the welfare of every citizen of Punjab,” said the Chief Minister amidst slogans of ‘Saada naara, Captain dobaraa’.

At the same time, Capt Amarinder assured the newly-elected office bearers of State Government’s full support in ensuring holistic development, and promised that they would get full respect from the officials and others in all departments for any work in the interest of the State and its youth.

Referring to the State Government’s flagship ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ scheme, Capt Amarinder said that the private sector was supporting the initiative in a big way to supplement job opportunities for youth.

A large number of youngsters had already secured good jobs in the private sector, with one girl even getting a yearly package of Rs 42 lakhs, he pointed out, adding that the Government was doing its best to woo industry into the State to generate more employment opportunities.

Charging the Akalis with ruining the state to promote their self-interest, Capt Amarinder blamed them squarely for the spread of drugs and gangsterism in the state.

He flayed them for what he called the state’s second partition, which caused industry to shift to Haryana/NCR and tourism to Himachal Pradesh, leaving Punjab to struggle with poor resources.Speaking on the occasion, Cabinet Minister Vijay Inder Singla said that the youth body had been a great breeding ground for future leaders.

Zira MLA Kulbir Singh Zira lauded former Punjab Youth Congress presidents, including Singla, Jalalabad MLA Raminder Singh Awla, and Amarpreet Singh Lalli for their leadership, and expressed the confidence that new team would further strengthen the party at the grassroots.

He also requested the Chief Minister to give prominent posts to former PYC chiefs and members for their service to the party and the State.

Lauding the Chief Minister for heralding an era of all-round development, the new youth Congress president Barinder Singh Dhillon urged party’s all youth activists to vigorously spread the State Government’s programmes and policies.Thanking the Chief Minister for ensuring political space for youngsters, especially from middle class families, Dhillon said that leaders like Raja Amarinder Singh Warring, Kulbir Singh Zira and Dalvir Singh Goldy, amongst others, could only succeed because of the vision and leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh.

BOX: PREAMBLE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO BE TINKERED WITH: CAPT

Terming the situation in the country these days as “extremely distressing”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the youth to come forward to safeguard the nation and its Constitutional principles of democracy and secularism.

“Congress is the only party that could provide secular, democratic rule,” he said.

The Congress fought for India’s independence and the Constitution was framed on the Preamble of a socialist secular democratic republic, he pointed out, adding that though the various Articles of the Constitution had since undergone many amendments, the Preamble has remained untouched.

“The Preamble cannot be allowed to be tinkered with,” said Captain Amarinder, lashing out at the current attempts by the BJP to divide the nation.

“What prevails today is not Lok Raj but goonda raj. We all know what happened with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh,” he said, underlining the need for youth to take the lead in saving the country.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/won---t-quit-politics-without-giving-job-opportunities-to-all--capt.html

25,10-1-20,SAD condemns delay in Sixth Pay Commission by another six months,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday termed the Congress-led Punjab Government’s latest decision to delay the release of Sixth Punjab Pay Commission report by another six months as the biggest betrayal of promises made to State employees.

At the same time, Akali Dal condemned the state Finance Minister Manpreet Badal for always making excuses of empty coffers when it came to release the dues of employees but wasting crores on newly-appointed advisors and chairpersons.“The State Government has again stabbed its employees as well as pensioners in the back by announcing another extension in the term of Sixth Punjab Pay Commission,” said the senior SAD leader Janmeja Singh Sekhon.“Finance Minister Manpreet Badal had promised to implement the Sixth Pay Commission from January 2020. Now, its implementation has been further postponed up to June 30, 2020, and likely to be extended even more,” he said.

Lashing out at the State Government for turning back on every promise it made to the people at the time of assembly polls, the SAD leader said that the Government owed Rs 4,000 crores to the state employees in Dearness Allowance dues.“Around 27,000 employees are awaiting regularization. Instead of giving anything, the Government is taking away facilities from employees as it is planning to stop 13th salary to Punjab police personnel. Earlier, it had also slashed the salary of teachers from Rs 40,000 to Rs 15,000,” he said.

Stating that the SAD would fight alongside the State employees to force the Government to release the Sixth Pay Commission report, Sekhon said: “We also demand a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss all pending promises made to the people.”

“Like the government’s promise to implement the Sixth Pay Commission at the earliest, similarly farmers were promised complete loan waiver, youth were promised jobs and the Congress promised to augment social welfare benefits. None of this has been done. We demand the forthcoming session of the Vidhan Sabha be extended to discuss all these issues,” said Sekhon, the former Minister.

Simultaneously, it should stop wasteful expenditure,” he said.Sukhbir announced that the SAD would agitate along with employees for fulfillment of their genuine promises. He said that besides more than Rs 4,000 crore pending in the form of Dearness Allowance, the Congress Government was not allowing implementation of the sixth Pay Commission and not regularizing 27,000 employees whose cases had been cleared by the previous SAD-BJP government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-condemns-delay-in-sixth-pay-commission-by-another-six-months.html

Under the scheme, loans worth Rs 1,950 crore were waived by banks in a lump sum settlement scheme. In total, loans of more than Rs 7,000 crores of more than 20 lakh farmers were waived.

Efforts for the betterment of Government servants who have worked shoulder-to-shoulder for the implementation of the schemes and programmes of the State Government and have been the basis of disaster management were started immediately. Government servants were paid the second installment of the seventh pay scale arrears. Also, action was taken to make payment of arrears of seventh pay scale to employees of public corporations / boards. Teacher's cadre was linked to the treasury system. Process of approval and payment of pension of Government servants was simplified. The Staff Commission was constituted to consider salary discrepancies and service conditions.

For fast progress of the State, a smooth and proper transport system is very important.

38,10-1-20,SAD condemns delay in Sixth Pay Commission by another six months,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday termed the Congress-led Punjab Government’s latest decision to delay the release of Sixth Punjab Pay Commission report by another six months as the biggest betrayal of promises made to State employees.

At the same time, Akali Dal condemned the state Finance Minister Manpreet Badal for always making excuses of empty coffers when it came to release the dues of employees but wasting crores on newly-appointed advisors and chairpersons.“The State Government has again stabbed its employees as well as pensioners in the back by announcing another extension in the term of Sixth Punjab Pay Commission,” said the senior SAD leader Janmeja Singh Sekhon.“Finance Minister Manpreet Badal had promised to implement the Sixth Pay Commission from January 2020. Now, its implementation has been further postponed up to June 30, 2020, and likely to be extended even more,” he said.

Lashing out at the State Government for turning back on every promise it made to the people at the time of assembly polls, the SAD leader said that the Government owed Rs 4,000 crores to the state employees in Dearness Allowance dues.“Around 27,000 employees are awaiting regularization. Instead of giving anything, the Government is taking away facilities from employees as it is planning to stop 13th salary to Punjab police personnel. Earlier, it had also slashed the salary of teachers from Rs 40,000 to Rs 15,000,” he said.

Stating that the SAD would fight alongside the State employees to force the Government to release the Sixth Pay Commission report, Sekhon said: “We also demand a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss all pending promises made to the people.”

“Like the government’s promise to implement the Sixth Pay Commission at the earliest, similarly farmers were promised complete loan waiver, youth were promised jobs and the Congress promised to augment social welfare benefits. None of this has been done. We demand the forthcoming session of the Vidhan Sabha be extended to discuss all these issues,” said Sekhon, the former Minister.

Simultaneously, it should stop wasteful expenditure,” he said.Sukhbir announced that the SAD would agitate along with employees for fulfillment of their genuine promises. He said that besides more than Rs 4,000 crore pending in the form of Dearness Allowance, the Congress Government was not allowing implementation of the sixth Pay Commission and not regularizing 27,000 employees whose cases had been cleared by the previous SAD-BJP government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-condemns-delay-in-sixth-pay-commission-by-another-six-months.html

In collaboration with the departments related to Jai Kisan Crop Loan Waiver Scheme, time out loans of up to Rs 2 lakhs and current loans of up to Rs 50 thousand of eligible farmers were waived off.

Under the scheme, loans worth Rs 1,950 crore were waived by banks in a lump sum settlement scheme. In total, loans of more than Rs 7,000 crores of more than 20 lakh farmers were waived.

Efforts for the betterment of Government servants who have worked shoulder-to-shoulder for the implementation of the schemes and programmes of the State Government and have been the basis of disaster management were started immediately. Government servants were paid the second installment of the seventh pay scale arrears. Also, action was taken to make payment of arrears of seventh pay scale to employees of public corporations / boards. Teacher's cadre was linked to the treasury system. Process of approval and payment of pension of Government servants was simplified. The Staff Commission was constituted to consider salary discrepancies and service conditions.

For fast progress of the State, a smooth and proper transport system is very important.

Similarly, it was decided to obtain Rs 1600 crore (US $ 225 million) from New Development Bank for Indore Metro Rail Project.

62,10-1-20,Convert Satyanagar crematorium to LPG mode,"Early in 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the Central and State Governments to initiate a programmes to provide alternative modes of cremation, saying the traditional method of wooden pyres emitted hazardous pollutants into the environment.

Three years ago, the Odisha State Pollution Control Board had revealed that the smog generated from burning of bodies at the Satyanagar Crematorium emits particulate matter (PM-10) much above the permitted level of 100 micrograms. The raw smog released from the pyres rises PM-10 up to 200 microgram. As the place is within a thickly residential area, this is very harmful for the inhabitants.

Even though the civic body had introduced an electric crematorium in 1986, the facility has been more out of use than functioning. Repeated breakdowns due to non-maintenance have been the norm.

The defunct facility has been affecting people belonging to the lower-income group who are finding it tough to cremate the deceased owing to the high cost of firewood.

In Cuttack, the civic body had introduced electric furnace system at the Khan Nagar crematorium in 1980. After struggling to bear the electricity bill, the CMC converted the three-decade-old electric unit into an LPG one in 2017, at a cost of Rs 15 lakh.

The LPG furnace system charged Rs 250 for adult and Rs 50 per child below 12-year-old while BPL and ration cardholders and the unclaimed bodies availed the facility at free of cost. This furnace was damaged in the Fani cyclone and is not functioning.

A city based trust, Moksh Dwaar, had given a plan along with a project report to the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation for converting the Satyanagar Crematorium into a LPG/CNG furnace in October last.

The use of natural gas produces around 90 per cent less pollution than the funeral pyre. This eco-friendly system is a cheaper option, at Rs 800, quite less than the cost of the traditional pyre which is around Rs 3,000. It takes about an hour and a half or less for the body to turn into ashes.

According to Renu Narula, one of the trustees of the Moksha Dwar, it is impossible to change age-old tradition overnight; the change has to come slowly. She says that the CNG furnace will bring down the usage of wood, if not completely, at least the requirement can be halved. With the Government and environment NGOs not having launched any initiatives to avoid pollution caused by wood pyres, the public certainly doesn't get to resort to a cleaner option.

The capital cost of the gas models varies from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 33 lakh, depending on the capacity. The prospect of getting cheaper gas when pipelines are laid will make it more cost effective.

The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is set to construct two more crematoriums in view of shortage of space in the existing facilities. The city’s oldest crematorium at Kali Gadia in Bhimtangi is in a dilapidated condition due to illegal encroachments. The Damana village had a crematorium spread over 1.25 acres, but major portions of it have been encroached upon with several illegal constructions.

The Garabadu crematorium at Kapilaprasad in the Old Town was originally spread over 2.5 acres, however, nearly 2 acre land has been illegally encroached upon and constructions made. The old timers of Nayapalli say that there were three graveyards spreading over 14 acre of land in the four villages. Most of these have been leased out to educational institutions and only around half an acre of land is left.

All these places are dirty, unkempt and without modern facilities. Many of them are not even walled. There is an immediate need for electric or gas based crematoriums at these places.

Using environment-friendly methods to cremate dead bodies is the way forward for all, says Nalini Sarma. ""We use at least one fully grown tree to burn one body. In India, we cremate approximately 50 lakh dead bodies each year, so one can just imagine the magnitude of loss to the planet’” she says.

Use of wood for cremation is a not a religion-mandated ritual, many people believe so but it is just a myth. Even if Hindus use LPG it will not be going against the scriptures at all, the Shastras only mention about consigning the body to flames and there is no mention on what apparatus has to be used for that.

The plan to modernise the Satyanagar crematorium was put on hold considering the fact that the civic body's new state-of-the-art multi-storey headquarters is coming up opposite it. They object that a 30 feet chimney will be an eyesore and that the hot emission will pollute.

However, the burning of nearly 25 wood pyres each day instead brings little solace. There are even plans of shifting the crematorium portion, the graveyard and cemetery will be left intact.

86,10-1-20,Buzz over Marandi joining saffron brigade continues,"Uncertainty prevails in the BJP over who would be the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in House at the time when two of the senior BJP leaders’ in House sitting adjacent to the vacant chair of Leader of Opposition (LoP).

At the time when three senior BJP State leaders including outing Chief Minister Raghubar Das, former Speaker Dinesh Oroan and State BJP president Laxman Gilua losing the election, there was speculation that either Chandreshwar Prasad Singh (CP Singh) or Neelkanth Singh Munda having vast experience in party and House could be made as Leader of Opposition (LoP), but during the three day long special session of Jharkhand Assembly the LoP chair remained vacant.

Buzz continued in the BJP that its Central leadership is in talks with JVM chief Babulal Marandi over merging his party with the BJP after which Marandi will be appointed leader of the BJP legislative fold and the leader of the Opposition. A senior state BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “The Central leadership of party is in talks with Marandi either merging his party or if he comes alone than also he is very much welcome.” The BJP leader claimed that Marandi is very much ready to join the party, but two of his legislators are reluctant to join the saffron party delaying the merger of JVM with BJP.

Apart from vacant chair of leader of opposition (LoP) in just concluded special Assembly session, the other indication that party is planning to appoint an outsider as leader of opposition is that Marandi has dissolved the executive committee of JVM and put on hold the formation of new team till January 14.

Sources said that it will be win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats. The JVM (P) in the just concluded Assembly election won Dhanwar, Poraiyahat and Mandar seats, but in later two seats personnel charisma of candidate was more important than the party which they belong.

Till now, leaders from both BJP and JVM camp have denied the theory of merger of two parties publicly. Mandar MLA, Bandhu Tirkey said, “The talks about merger of BJP with JVM is rumour without any substance. We have fought against BJP and in such situation we will never join hands with BJP.”

Marandi is a former RSS leader who resigned from his job as a teacher to work for the organisation.

In 2000, he became the first chief minister of newly created state of Jharkhand. But he had to resign in 2003 and Arjun Munda became the chief minister. In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State. In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/buzz-over-marandi-joining-saffron-brigade-continues.html

88,10-1-20,"Mentally-ill, homeless become ‘burden’ on RIMS?","Several poor and homeless patients suffering from mental disorders have become a burden on the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) – the premiere Government-run hospital in Jharkhand – as it lacks a dedicated psychiatry unit. Paradox is the fact that Ranchi has two Government-run psychiatry institutes – Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) and Ranchi Institute of Neuro Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (RINPAS) – but none have enough space to accommodate the homeless, mentally-ill patients of RIMS for a longer period, Director of RIMS Dr. DK Singh said on Thursday.

“We have so many patients who are suffering from mental disorders, but do not have a place to go. The psychiatry institutes too do not have sufficient beds to accommodate all of them. We refer them to RINPAS, they get treated there, and again some or the other ambulance drops them back at RIMS,” said Singh, adding that he expects civil society organizations to intervene and do something for such patients.

The sorry state of affairs came to light after a patient at RIMS was found eating a dead pigeon on the hospital premises on Tuesday. The picture of the woman hogged media attention and forced the RIMS authorities to probe into the matter. “The patient was mentally unstable. But she is not the only one in RIMS. There are several patients here who need psychiatric intervention,” said Singh.

The woman was admitted in RINPAS on Thursday evening, said doctors from the psychiatry institute. Senior Resident at RINPAS, Dr. Siddharth Sinha said that RINPAS too does not have enough space to accommodate homeless patients for a lifetime. “We never refuse to treat any patient that comes to us through the right channel. But we have limited resources, and we cannot keep every homeless patient here for their entire life,” said Sinha.

He added that RINPAS had several such patients who were staying at the institute since years, but they are gradually being sent home with the help of District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and other NGOs. RINPAS has around 600 operational beds, and the number of patients undergoing treatment there is much higher if the registrations at the Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) are counted. “Any patient who has some or the other psychosis needs special attention and treatment. We are doing our best,” Sinha said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mentally-ill--homeless-become----burden----on-rims-.html

In 1998-99 Justice Shahdeo was leading the movement of a separate State. The Union government in 1998 had decided to send a Bill in the Bihar Assembly for the formation of Jharkhand to which Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the State would be divided over his dead body.

It was then that BJP, JMM, AJSU, Congress- a total of 16 political parties came together to start the movement and formed the ‘All Party Separate State Formation Committee’. Coming from a non political background, Justice Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee.

The voting in the Bihar Legislature on the Jharkhand Act was to be done on September 21, 1998 and on this day under the leadership of Justice Shahdeo the committee called for a Jharkhand bandh. Thousands of Jharkhand supporters took to the streets on this day shouting slogans like ‘Pehle Maati, Phir Party’. As Justice Shahdeo was leading the protest, he was arrested near Shaheed Chowk and taken to Kotwali police station where he was detained for hours along with other supporters

Justice Shahdeo was always a strong supporter of a separate State and upon retiring from the High Court in 1992 he continued to support the movement through his writings in local newspapers and public forums.

Justice Shahdeo was born on January 3, 1930 in Kaamta village of Latehar district. He did his primary education in a government school and completed his matriculation from Balkrishna High School, Ranchi. On completing his graduation from Ranchi College, Shahdeo got his law degree in 1954 and started his practice at the Ranchi Civil Court.

It was in 1958 that he joined judicial services and got his first posting as a Munsif Magistrate in Hazaribagh. In 1989 he became the district and session judge in Dhanbad. From 1986 to 1992, he was the judge at Patna High Court’s Ranchi bench.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/remembering-multifaceted-hero-of-jharkhand-movement.html

94,10-1-20,"Over 15,000 fowl culled","An outbreak of bird flu has been reported from a state-run poultry farm in Korea district, prompting the authorities to cull over 15,000 birds and step up vigil on poultry birds within 10 km radius of the affected area, officials said on Thursday.

So far, 15,426 chickens and quails have been culled and 30,000 eggs destroyed after the highly contagious H5N1 virus was detected among birds at the poultry farm and hatchery in Baikunthpur town, located around 300 km from here, they said.

There has been no case of infection in humans so far due to the outbreak of the avian influenza, they said.

""After some chickens and quails were found dead on December 7 last year in the farm, their samples were collected and sent to local laboratories for testing,"" Dr R S Baghel, deputy director, veterinary department, Korea, said.

When the disease was not properly detected, samples were further sent to Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh where veterinarians suggested symptoms of chronic respiratory disease, following which their line of treatment was followed.

""Despite the treatment, the abnormal deaths of birds continued,"" Baghel said.

Later, the samples were sent to Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases where tests were found positive for the H5N1 virus on December 23, he said.

Of the total culled birds, nearly 641 chickens were being reared by locals within one km radius of the farm. The locals were given compensation for the culling of their birds, he said.

""We have completed the culling process and sealed the farm. After sanitizing the area in 10 km of its radius, we submitted a report to the state's directorate of veterinary services on Wednesday,"" Baghel said.

96,10-1-20,BJP to launch ‘Bhaat par Baat’ on the occasion of Chherchhera festival,"Government of Chhattisgarh is celebrating local traditional festival ‘Chherchhera’, wherein foodgrains are donated.

On the occasion, state BJP is launching a drive ‘Bhaat par baat’ (Talk over cooked rice) from January 10.

Addressing the media, former minister and BJP Kurud MLA Ajay Chandrakar alleged Friday is ‘Chherchhera’ and the state government has no other programme.

The festival is celebrated in villages by donating foodgrains.

This government has literally made the farmers cry in the name of paddy procurement, he said.

He said promise of procuring paddy at Rs 2500 was made but still payment of the balance amount is unsure. A committee has been constituted to decide the balance payment, but like other committees it has also failed to deliver, he alleged.

BJP leader said Chhattisgarh has left behind Punjab in consumption of liquor while panel constituted to look into the possibility of introducing prohibition is still to submit its recommendations.

Similarly, he said, the 14th Finance Commission funds have been utilised for ‘Narva, Garva, Ghurva and Baari’ scheme which could be utilised for rural development. The flagship scheme has no head or tail and government is misusing panchayat funds.

On the drive, he said the party would hold discussion with the farmers while having food with them. State government has shown total disrespect to the food growers and not a single scheme has been started by the government.

Plan is to reach all 20,000 villages covering the 27 districts.

A panel will be declared up to Janpad level for three-tier panchayat poll, he said. It would be monitoring the old age pension, chit-fund affected victims and other schemes including village linked issues, the BJP leader said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-launch----bhaat-par-baat----on-the-occasion-of-chherchhera-festival.html

98,10-1-20,"Superstition, sectarianism killed more people in Jharkhand than Naxalism","Superstition and sectarianism killed more people in Jharkhand than Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in 2018, says the latest report on Crime in India by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), highlighting the deep-rooted superstition and caste distinction in the tribal State.

The report, released on Wednesday, said that the motive behind at least 18 murders in Jharkhand was witch-hunting in the year 2018, while honour killing was the reason behind nine murders in the same year. Interestingly, “Extremism/ Naxalism/ Insurgency” was reason for only two murders in the State in year 2018, the report added.

While figures with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) claim that at least 19 of 24 districts in Jharkhand are Left Wing Extremism-affected, the NCRB data may convince one to believe that superstition was far more dangerous and widespread here, say social activists. According to the NCRB report, the motive behind 62 murders across India in 2018 was witchcraft and 18 of them were reported in Jharkhand – the highest in the country.

“Witch-hunting is a social malady. We require joint efforts from different stakeholders to spread awareness against such age-old superstitious practices,” said Jharkhand Director General of Police (DGP) KN Choubey. He, however, refused to comment on the NCRB figures of murders executed by LWE groups, claiming that he was yet to personally go through the report. “The NCRB is a trustworthy and reputed agency,” he added.

This is, however, not the first instance when Jharkhand has topped in terms of murders related to witchcraft in India. Superstitious practices in the interiors have remained a major concern for the Government here for several years. The tribal dominated state witnessed at least 590 cases of witch-hunting from 2001 to 2018, says combined figures of the State police and the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Besides, several incidents of occultists trying to resurrect dead people and women getting married off to snakes and dogs have been reported from far off villages in Jharkhand in the past – a proof of the deep-embedded superstition in the rural society here.

Jharkhand also tops in terms of honour killings. The State witnessed nine incidents of honour killings in 2018 – the highest in India. Police said that most of the honour killing incidents are triggered by sectarianism and caste distinctions. Inter-caste love affairs and marriages were still one of the most common reasons for honour killings in Jharkhand, they added. “Such flawed idea of honour and caste distinction has to be dealt with extensive social awareness campaigns. The police can investigate murder cases and nab the accused, but the change has to begin in the society,” said Choubey.

While the NCRB report puts the figure of human sacrifice to zero in Jharkhand in 2018, some incidents of alleged human sacrifice too have been reported here in the past decade.

In a suspected case of human sacrifice, the police had to exhume half-buried, naked and decapitated bodies of two children from a village in Latehar, about 100 Kilometers northwest of capital Ranchi, in July last year.

In May 2017, the police arrested a 26-year-old Ranchi man on charges of attempting to sacrifice his mother to appease a goddess. And in 2015, a 60-year-old man was reportedly sacrificed in Gumla for better rainfall.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/superstition--sectarianism-killed-more-people-in-jharkhand-than-naxalism.html

JAC also sends model test papers for all the class X subjects- English, Maths, science, social science, Hindi and Sanskrit which may be downloaded from the council's website and get students to practice.

This has helped children in overcoming their fear of the examination hall and to check where they went wrong. JAC's model test papers have also helped children to practice the examination's question pattern,"" said a principal.

East Singhbhum scored a pass percentage of 77.259 per cent in the secondary examination results released by Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC) in 2019.

Also it had asked schools to conduct extra classes for poor students and to clarify their doubts.

"" The increase in number of students securing first division marks is an indicator in the better quality of matric result. This is a huge qualitative improvement, "" said an official of JAC.

An official of education department said he was happy with the response from the students, this year would see even better scores. However considering the available resources and infrastructure the result was satisfactory last year.

"" The credit goes to the hard work of teachers. We are also focusing on teacher's training and students grooming this year keeping in mind the poor results for the last couple of years in the district.

104,10-1-20,Candid Notes,"Plain speak

When it comes to forthrightness, there are very few politicians in the Himalayan state who can match Harak Singh Rawat. Though due to his candidness the mercurial minister has landed in many controversies during his chequered political career spanning three decades, to his credit he has kept the quality intact. The minister was in a jovial mood on the floor of state assembly recently while answering a question on the rights of forest dwellers. During the light hearted banter, Harak boasted that destiny has always landed him on the right side of power and once when his party was not in power, he enjoyed government perks as he was leader of opposition then. Indicating towards the chair of leader of the house (CM), the wily minister who has hopped parties with as much ease as changing clothes admitted that the coveted chair still eludes him. Indicating that there is still bad blood left between him and former CM Harish Rawat, the minister while parrying an attack by Congress MLA Karan Mahara said that he has set up a snake enclosure in Dehradun Zoo and these snakes welcome the visitors and don’t bite like brother in law (Jija) of Mahara.

Old Gold

Genuine concern on public safety was raised by the members cutting across party lines over the old dams, bridges and other such structures in the state assembly during the recent one day session. The members demanded that the government should inform about the life span of these structures most of whom were built during the British era and undertake concrete action to ensure their safety. They emphatically pointed out that since the dams and bridges built by the British have served their purpose well, the structures which have completed their life should be decommissioned. Later the issue was point of informal discussion outside the house and everyone agreed that present day structures are not strong when compared to those built during the colonial times. The reason of the difference is not hard to comprehend as it is a common knowledge that the contractors have to pass 30 to 40 per cent of the project amount to grease the palms at various levels.

Scam sham

With High Court getting tough on stern action over the high and mighty in the infamous scholarship scam, the SIT has started cracking its whip. In one such recent instance, case has been registered against administrators of a college which is said to be owned by the son of a seasoned lawmaker belonging to the saffron party. Many more skeletons are likely to tumble out of closets as the SIT is taking some other institutions under its scanner for the probe. After creation of a separate state many politicians got directly or indirectly involved in the booming business of education in Uttarakhand and many of them are said to be involved in the game of gobbling up the scholarships. In the scam, money from state treasury was siphoned out in the name of scholarships for nonexistent students of the SC and ST categories in collusion with the corrupt Babus by the powerful owners of the many private colleges.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes.html

108,10-1-20,Morning feeds — Karma and our choices,"We have been taught since childhood whatever goes around comes around like a boomerang. Ever thought of, what if we can control what goes out of us?

When we choose to hate and seek revenge it does more harm to us than to others. Instead of making people responsible for your own thoughts of vengeance and implementing them, own your actions irrespective of the fact they were right or wrong. They were taken at certain point of time keeping in mind some externalities and situations. Everyone has heard of buzz word ""Karma"", which balances the positive and negatives of world and tracks you down. Let’s talk a little about this in detail.

Karma is not like God, which will pardon you with time. It’s a voracious vicious cycle and has insatiable hunger for neutralising the good and bad deeds. When karma is acting on us we should focus on not blaming anyone else for it. Blaming others and seeking revenge will only create one more new cycle of karma.

When karma is acting on you try to think of channelizing your energy to create a new positive field. “Make peace with past” and help your present to have a beautiful satisfying future. Articulate new visions as change is the only permanent thing in life.

Just as if we keep eating stale food our stomach get upset keep eating bad thoughts makes the mind upset. Instead of seeking for vengeance, think for compassion, grace and reconciliation. Believe me if with this thought boomerang goes while returning it will give you the most positive results. Even the greatest leaders of history who took the best of decisions considering the worst situations have been apprehended.

I have always been fascinated by the Krishna's story of death. He is one of the greatest deities of Hinduism. When Kurukshetra war lead to hundreds of death of Gandhari’s sons she cursed him in fit of rage thinking that it was Krishna who deliberately did not put end to the war. The curse ended up killing Krishna by Jara who shot an arrow thinking of him to be deer. Kauravas were destined to die but Krishna had to take the responsibility of being a strategist in the war which in turn led him to be cursed to die a slow painful death. This gives spectrum of answers on ideological freedom of human beings, the choices they make and there responsibility towards themselves and others. You need to take it in your stride and move. In a way to teach the lesson to others we may end up hurting ourselves. Decide you need peace, tranquility and calmness or noise, conflicts and irritation.

Think choose and act wise! Once if you end up hurting someone it is a mistake twice or more is a convention.

Enough lies, ploying, plotting, revenge have been discussed and done in history. You never know what the other person has been through when you were ploying on them. Point is when we ploy on someone our hands get dirty too. The seeds of hatred have been laid by us and the damage that happens is the fruits as results. Karma sits and watches and is back to us in a very brutal way. At that moment sit back and think and work for your future and not plot revenge again, to derive power from destroying someone else. Remember Karmic chakra will still follow again therefore It’s indeed to stop the future cycle and work on betterment of our life. Sometimes enemies of yours our hiding beneath your sleeves Choice is upto us from which lens we orchestrate. Hatred is like a cancer which makes us die each day so eat the right thoughts to avoid mental diarrhea.

Dog – man’s best friend - had not received the attention and care it deserved in the Eastern part of India, particularly in Bihar prior to April 1977. This was due to absence of any association or club of dog lovers.

To overcome this, it was thought way back in 1977 to form a Kennel club at Jamshedpur, affiliated to the Kennel Club India Chennai. The idea was to strive to promote the state of canine world by arranging scientific breeding, training, dog show and trial, registration of dogs, expert veterinary advice etc. This was discussed with several dog lovers in Jamshedpur and finally Bihar Kennel club was born on April 7, 1977.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rare-breeds-set-to-put-their-best-paw-forward-at-dog-show.html

He said that when tourists come here, it will be a center of attraction for them and people will stop here and take selfies. Raturi further said that the national flag to be hoisted on the 100 feet mast in Suman Park is being prepared in Rajasthan. This 30 feet long and 20 feet wide flag is being made from parachute material which is very light and strong.

124,10-1-20,Odia researcher traces river Saraswati to Harappan age,"A researcher from Odisha has found an ample evidence of existence of sacred Saraswati iver mentioned in Indian mythology on the plains of northwestern India.

Professor Jyotiranjan Srichandan Ray along with researchers Anirban Chatterjee and Anil D Shukla of Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad and another researcher Kanchan Pande of IIT-Bombay claimed that the legendary river Saraswati mentioned in Rig Veda has often been hypothesized to be an ancient perennial channel of the seasonal river Ghaggar that flowed through the heartland of the Bronze Age Harappan civilization in northwestern India.

The research has been published in journal – ‘Scientific Reports’ by the Nature Publishing Group.

According to the new study led by PRL in collaboration with IIT-Bombay, the Ghaggar-Hakra river-system shares identical geographic position with the legendary glacier-fed river Saraswati mentioned in some of the ancient Indian scriptures (Rig-Veda, Mahabharata) and often been correlated with the latter.

River Saraswati was perennial and had flowed from higher Himalayas between 7,000 BC and 2,500 BC. The Harappans had built their civilisation near the river between 3,800 BC and 1,900 BC. However, the climate change is considered to be the primary cause for the demise of river, which was responsible for end of the civilisation.

Although, the Ghaggar received sediments from the higher Himalaya during the river’s rejuvenated phase, there exists no evidence to suggest that any of its modern tributaries originated from glaciers. In this scenario, the possible pathways for delivery of such sediments into the Ghaggar could have been through the neighboring Sutlej and Yamuna, which currently flow through the higher and lesser Himalayan rocks.

However, since it is believed that Yamuna had abandoned the Ghaggar channel, the only remaining pathway for the higher Himalayan sediments into the Ghaggar during the Holocene could have been the Sutlej, the study says.

Notably, Triveni Sangam at Allahabad – the confluence of three holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati – has a great significance for Hindus. However, mythology says that Saraswati river has disappeared completely.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odia-researcher-traces-river-saraswati-to-harappan-age.html

132,10-1-20,Kailash emerges as strong leader,"Would controversy's favourite child — Kailash Vijayvargiya stage a political comeback in Madhya Pradesh politics?

BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya is emerging stronger in Madhya Pradesh making many of his rivals within the State BJP sit up.

Vijayvargiya's objectionable statement that he would have burnt the city, if RSS meeting was not underway in Indore, created controversy around four days ago. After registration of an FIR against him and his supporters, who had staged dharna in front of the Indore Commissioner's rersidence further helped Kailash in emerging stronger.

After an FIR, a war of words between the senior BJP leader and minister of Kamal Nath government continued. However, the police did not make any arrests till date. On Tuesday, the police going through the video footages of dharna, decided to name BJP MLA Akash Vijayvargiya, son of Kailash. Kailash, not known to mince words, is seen as one taking on Kamal Nath and draw huge media attention.

Ironically, soon after the controversy erupted, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was seen in defensive mode. Kailash left behind Chouhan in cornering the Kamal Nath government.

In past one year, since the Congress came to power, it was only Chouhan whohad been raising several issues in the State, despite the fact that the high command asking him repeatedly to show up in the national arena.

However, for past few months, Chouhan did not take up any important issue and following the guidelines of Central leadership. He had recently visited Assam creating awareness towards Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

On the contrary, Kailash Vijayvargiya, who had been in-charge general secretary of West Bengal remained out of Madhya Pradesh for long; even during the assembly elections held in November 2018, he remained out of the State. After a long time, when he was in hometown Indore, his followers told him that the State government was targeting houses and businesses of BJP leaders and workers, he decided to meet district Collector and the Commissioner. Since, they were not available in the office despite having intimated in advance, he got infuriated and staged dharna in front of Commissioner's residence. During dharna, he gave that controversial statement to media and made headlines in next day's newspapers in the country.

Now, the Kamal Nath government is mulling whether, Kailash Vijayvargiya be arrested or not.

Political grapevine is that if Kailash is arrested, he would emerge as a strong leader of the BJP in Madhya Pradrsh and chief ministerial candidate of the party in future. This would also help the BJP central leadership in shunting former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan from Madhya Pradesh politics.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kailash-emerges-as-strong-leader.html

“Have you ever heard Modiji speak on issues of women, youth and farmers. They always preach Congress on nationalism. I wish to urge Modiji to name anyone from his party who took part in freedom struggle. At least name anyone among his kin who was a freedom fighter. And they are the ones who teach us nationalism,” Nath said.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Thursday accused the BJP of diverting the attention of people from real issues and said no one from the party took part in the freedom struggle but it was giving lessons in nationalism.

Speaking at the Congress Seva Dal training session programme, Kamal Nath said country's culture was under attack.

He also attacked the government over the manner in which the National Population Register (NPR) exercise was sought to be conducted.

""Today, our culture is being attacked. They talk about the National Register of Citizens. When you will go to register your name, you will be asked your religion. If you say you are Hindu, you will be asked to prove it. You should know BJP politics in last six-seven years. They divert attention. Have you heard PM Modi talking about farmers and women? Will they teach Seva Dal lesson of nationalism?"" he asked.

""Modiji should tell one name from his party who was a part of India's freedom struggle. If not, name any of your relative who participated in the independence movement. There was no one from his party who was part of freedom struggle and they are teaching the lesson of nationalism to the Congress,"" the Chief Minister said.

The Congress leader also slammed PM Modi over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Kamal Nath said, ""They talk about NRC. What is the meaning of NRC? When you will go for registration they will ask what's your religion? What was your father's religion?""

Further, Kamal Nath announced that Madhya Pradesh will have an active IT cell for the Congress party's Seva Dal. ""It will be a command centre for the Seva Dal at the national level.

134,10-1-20,"Min clears air on NPA, 13th month salary","Clearing air on the issue of non-practice allowance (NPA) to the doctors and 13th-month salary to the Punjab police personnel, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal on Thursday maintained that no decision have been taken to stop the two.

Manpreet, following the Cabinet meeting, made it clear that it had not withdrawn the NPA prescribed for the doctors in the State, while also clarifying that the 13th month salary for the Punjab cops has also not being discontinued.

Dubbing the reports of discontinuation of NPA and 13th salary as “rumours”, Manpreet said the two would continue to be the same as before.

Notably, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have been targeting the Congress-led State Government for its plans to stop the NPA provided to the doctors in government hospitals and dispensaries in Punjab and allowing them to do private practice, besides stopping the 13th salary to Punjab police personnel.

It has been learnt that the State Government has been mulling to discontinue NPA and 13th salary to cops — with the sole aim to improve state finances at least to some extent.

Dubbing the discontinuation of NPA as a “lopsided decision”, AAP had cautioned the it would hit the public health services in the State, besides giving more teeth to the health mafia active in Punjab. “Allowing doctors to do private practice in the name of saving just Rs 153 crore is a lopsided decision all set to hit health services in the State. The worst affected would be the poor people,” AAP leaders had stated.

Notably, the Capt Amarinder government, during its tenure in 2002-07, had also proposed to discontinue the NPA but had to roll back following intense protests.

In fact, the as “anti-people” and “anti-doctors” move was also opposed by the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) doctors which decided to raise the issue with the state Health Minister.

PCMSA president Dr Gagandeep Singh maintained that the NPA is given to the doctors for their long study of the medical education which leads them for their late entry to the government services, besides because of their engagement in tough and high-risk duties like emergency duty, VIP duty, and postmortem duties.

The Association had maintained that the decision would be a step towards privatization of the health services across the State, besides further deepening the prevailing crunch of specialist doctors in the state.

Manpreet clarification came on the day his cousin and SAD president Sukhbir Badal asked the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to immediately direct the Finance Department not to implement its decision to stop the 13th salary of Punjab Police personnel.

“We will fight this move tooth and nail, and even if the Congress Government succeeds in implementing this anti-people step, we will reverse it immediately after formation of an SAD- BJP government in the State,” said Sukhbir.

Sukhbir said that the law and order situation had already deteriorated in the State with Congress Ministers and MLAs patronizing gangsters and stopping the State police from functioning professionally.

“Stopping the 13th salary of police personnel will help anti-social elements further,” he said.

Notably, the 13th salary was given in lieu of 30 discretionary holidays which were forsaken by police personnel in the interest of bettering policing.

The facility had been granted to the police personnel in 1979.

“It is because of this sacrifice made by the police personnel that our police stations are manned efficiently round the clock and sufficient personnel are available for patrolling and other law and order duties. Doing away with the 13th salary will have a detrimental effect on police functioning and will cause great inconvenience to the general public,” he said, adding that doing away with it would adversely affect 80,000 police personnel and their families.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/min-clears-air-on-npa--13th-month-salary.html

137,10-1-20,"Kejriwal presents report card of BJP-run MCDs, calls it pathetic","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday presented report card of BJP-ruled Municipal Corporations of Delhi (MCDs), alleging that the ""pathetic"" state of waste disposal in the city is making people call it the ""garbage capital.

Sharing the statistics of various sectors under the MCD and Delhi Government, Kejriwal highlighted the loopholes of the MCD across education, healthcare, sanitation, and other domains. Comparing education sector in primary schools of the MCD as well as the Delhi Government senior secondary schools, he said that the MCD has shut down 109 schools in the last nine years and the Delhi Government has opened 20,000 new classrooms in their schools in the last five years.

""The strength of the MCD schools in the last nine years has gone down by 2,50,000. The same trend can be noted with the decreasing strength of private schools in Delhi, as parents are taking their wards out from private schools and admitting them in schools run by the Delhi Government,"" he said.

The Delhi government schools are equipped with all the facilities such as swimming pools, lifts, sports grounds, and complexes, he said, adding that according to a recent study, around 74 per cent of students completing education till 5th standard from MCD schools cannot read a simple text from their Hindi textbooks. ""On the other hand, the passing percentage of the 12th standard students of the Delhi government schools is 96 per cent this year, more than the private schools where the passing percentage is 93 per cent,"" he said.

Talking about the issue of sanitation and cleanliness in Delhi, he said, ""The BJP and the MCD have made Delhi the garbage capital of India, with open dhalaos and dumps of garbage across every nook and corner of the city. ""This is a matter of shame for Delhi that Delhi is rated at the bottom position in the BJP's Swachh Bharat Mission, with Delhi MCDs rated amongst the bottom 10 of the 49 largest cities for cleanliness by Government of India in December 2019,"" he said.

Kejriwal also highlighted the inconvenience caused to people due to huge garbage mountain in Ghazipur. ""The biggest gift of the BJP to Delhi is the garbage and waste mountain in Ghazipur, which is expected to cross the height of the Taj Mahal in Agra,"" he said.

""Almost 80-90 per cent of toilets constructed by MCDs do not have water or electricity facility. Most of them often remain locked. In comparison, the Delhi government's DUSIB has built and ensured good maintenance of 20,000 community toilets built between 2010 and 2018,"" he added.

The Chief Minister also revealed the figures of a recent audit carried out by the internal audit agency of the MCD. As per a recent internal audit released by MCD's audit unit, South MCD has Rs. 1,177 Cr outstanding arrears of property tax. And we know why there has not been a single attempt to recover the amount,"" he said, adding that the North MCD's chief auditor has found Rs. 3,299 Cr of financial irregularities.

In the healthcare sector, Kejriwal said that no additional dispensary was constructed in the MCD hospitals in last seven years. Most of the MCD dispensaries and hospitals are poorly maintained, with no availability of medicines, missing roof tiles, falling wall plasters, dirty corridors, and toilets, etc,"" he said.

In the last three years, the combined health budget of all the three MCDs has reduced by Rs. 97 Cr, he said, adding that on the other hand, the Delhi government has added 450 new mohalla clinics and 26 polyclinics in the last five years.

""The number of beds in hospital has increased from 7,200 to nearly 10,000 and the construction of three new government hospitals is nearing completion. All mohalla clinics have an air-conditioned with state of the art facilities and hygienic environment, which is appreciated across the globe. The health budget in Delhi has increased from 3,500 Cr to 7,500 Cr in the last five years,"" he said.

Reacting on BJP's claim of providing five times subsidy on water and electricity to the people than the current subsidy by the AAP government, Kejriwal said ""We provide 200 units of free electricity, will they provide 1000 units of free electricity as per their claims? We provide 20,000 litres of free water; will they provide 1 lakh litres of free water? And if what they are claiming is true, they should sanction the provision of free water and electricity in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to gain the trust of the people of Delhi.""

""The people now have to decide between the governance of the BJP and the Delhi Police and the governance of the AAP with improvements in the education and health sectors in the city. I hope that the people will cast their votes based on the good governance model of the AAP in Delhi,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-presents-report-card-of-bjp-run-mcds--calls-it-pathetic.html

""The full Statehood of Delhi is what the people of Delhi want. This multiplicity of agencies is not favorable to anybody. I have been blamed several times regarding the completion of maximum initiatives in the last one year of my tenure. That is because all our files used to go to the Lieutenant Governor and it used to get stuck due to political reasons. When we got power, we were able to build mohalla clinics, install CCTV cameras,"" he said.

""In a republic, the power should reside with the people who have been voted to power. This (not having statehood status) is neither good for the country nor for the national Capital,"" he said.

Reacting on opinion polls carried out in the city, Kejriwal said, ""The opinion polls can notify a trend but cannot count the exact seats of an electoral party. The opinion polls are clearly showing that the people want an AAP Governance model in the city. They do not want Delhi to have the same fate as MCDs or BJP,"" he said.

""I believe that the people of Delhi have already decided to vote for AAP in the upcoming elections, we will get a huge mandate and we will see the number of seats only then,"" he added.

143,10-1-20,Will ask Kejriwal 10 questions on Govt's failures: Tiwari,"Accusing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for evading people's questions on dirty water supply, potholed roads, pollution and poor condition of public transport, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Delhi's chief Manoj Tiwari said he will ask Kejriwal 10 questions on failures of the AAP Government and expects him to give timely replies.

Tiwari asked the Chief Minister why, in the past five years, his Government did not release funds amounting to Rs 20,000 crore due to the municipal corporations.

""Today's question for Kejriwal is why Rs 20,000 cr due to the municipal corporations was kept back like a thief. This fund could have been used for payment of salaries to employees of the civic bodies,"" he said.

Kejriwal is trying to escape questions in order to avoid discussion on the performance of his government but the BJP will not allow him to do so.

""When we ask him about dirty water supply, pollution, potholed roads, and poor public transport facilities in the city, he starts talking about other states. Elections in Delhi are just a few days ahead, and people need to know what the AAP government did in five years,"" Tiwari said.

The Delhi BJP president also promised to provide five times more facilities to people if his party won the elections, as compared to what the Kejriwal government gave them.

""We have said it already that unlike the AAP Government our facilities will be for full five years, and not just three months.""

South Delhi BJP Member of Parliament (MP), Ramesh Bidhuri said Kejriwal is comparing work of his government with municipal corporations while we are asking him about the schools, colleges and hospitals he had promised, which were never built by his government in five years.

These elections are for Delhi Assembly but Kejriwal is trying to divert the attention of the people from real issues and talking about municipal corporations and other states, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-ask-kejriwal-10-questions-on-govt-s-failures--tiwari.html
144,10-1-20,Grey water treatment workshop concludes,"A daylong workshop on opportunities and challenges in grey water treatment technology concluded at the UPES. The Uttarakhand State council for Science and Technology (UCOST) director general Rajendra Dobhal presided over the workshop sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology.

Addressing the gathering, Dobhal spoke on the current water availability scenario and its management.

“In view of the current water resource scarcity, its effective management has become even more important. The need of the hour is to regularly undertake requisite steps for its proper management to avoid association of additional challenges with this already scarce resource. Though 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by water, less than one per cent is available for human consumption, therefore it becomes even more essential that everyone should contribute for its conservation. Researchers and scientists need to develop technology for water solutions and collate its valuable data for the next generations,” he added. Senior scientist from CSIR-NEERI, Delhi, Raman Sharma spoke about revival of water bodies and lakes carried out by NEERI with Delhi Jal Board’s support. Brij Mohan Sharma from Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS) also shared his field experiences and case studies on water treatment units in Dehradun while addressing the audience. Associate professor and assistant dean (Research), School of Engineering, UPES, SM Tauseef spoke of his research experiences.

Water scarcity and its management pose a big challenge that should have been acted upon by yesterday instead of today or tomorrow. Despite the delay, it is still better to be late than never, he added.

Mahendra Rana from Government Inter College, Shilodi (Pauri) spoke on the loss of water in mountains due to lack of proper water management while Sakshi Gupta from Graphic Era University spoke on rainwater harvesting and entrepreneurial opportunities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/grey-water-treatment-workshop-concludes.html
145,10-1-20,US Defence Secy briefs to Rajnath,"As tension prevails between Iran and US following the killing of an Iranian military commander, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper briefed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in a telephonic conversation on Thursday about the recent developments in the Gulf region. For its part, India conveyed its concerns over the region during the conversation.

“We expressed firm resolve to strengthen the bilateral defence cooperation. He also briefed me about the recent developments in the Gulf Region. I shared India’s concerns and interests in the region,” Singh said on Twitter.

This apart, India also said it will like the situation to de-escalate as soon as possible and was in touch with important players in the Gulf region.

Making this position clear, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here India is “very closely” monitoring the situation in the Gulf region. On Wednesday, India took a series of measures including an advisory to its citizens to avoid travelling to Iraq and rerouting the flight path of the national carrier. The Indian Navy is also on standby to evacuate Indian citizens in case of any exigency.

The External Affairs Ministry’s remarks came a day after Iran said it will welcome any peace initiative by India to de-escalate tensions with the US following the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.

Major General Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran’’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday last week. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

On Wednesday, Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces’ are stationed in Iraq. Tehran said it was a “slap in the face” of America.

Kumar also said while India is ‘closely monitoring” the situation, “peace, security and stability in the region is of utmost importance to us. We are talking to several stakeholders. The External Affairs Minister has spoken to players in the region,” Kumar said.

He also said in the past, the US has shown understanding on the importance of Chabahar project in Iran. “How the whole thing is going to impact is hypothetical, we’ll have to see. But, we do appreciate US exempting Chabahar port from the sanctions,” Kumar added.

In December 2019, the US had exempted the Chabahar port in Iran - being jointly developed by India, Iran and Afghanistan - from sanctions, saying it recognised that the port was a lifeline for Afghanistan to get humanitarian supplies from India.

The Chabahar port is considered a gateway to golden opportunities for trade by India, Iran, and Afghanistan with central Asian nations. It is located on the Indian Ocean in the Sistan and Baluchistan province of Iran. Easily accessible from India’s western coast, the port is increasingly seen as a counter to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, which is being developed with the Chinese investment.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/us-defence-secy-briefs-to-rajnath.html
146,10-1-20,Health Ministry OK’s setting up of AIIMS in Darbhanga,"With the Bihar Government clarifying that the Darbhanga Medical college Hospital (DMCH) is not a heritage building, the Union Health Ministry has given its nod for setting up a second AIIMS-like institute on the campus of the medical facility in the State. The first AIIMS has been set up in Patna.

Bihar, thus will be the third State in the country to boast of having two AIIMS-like institutes. Uttar Pradesh has one each in Rai Bareli and Gorakhpur. Jammu & Kashmir also has one each in the two union territories.

A proposal for setting up the AIIMS-like institute in DMH in Bihar was cleared last week by Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, said a senior Health Ministry official.

Initially, the Centre had rejected the Nitish Government’s proposal for setting up the super specialty institutes like AIIMS, pointing out that the land was not fit for.

But with the State government asserting that the building is not a heritage structure and making various commitments concerning infrastructure, the Ministry gave green signal to the proposal for setting up the super specialty institute in the area sprawling over 200 acre land. The cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 1,200 crore.

A proposal will now be sent to the Cabinet and according to sources the construction work for the second AIIMS is likely to start by the end of this year.

The officer said that the Bihar Government has assured that the four-lane road connectivity from the institute to NH-57 and a railway over bridge shall be provided and the cost of the required sand filling shall be borne by it. The land for the AIIMS like institute will be provided within six months.

Earlier, a health ministry team had flagged lack of proper drainage system for discharge of treated nd storm water and that the present approach roads to the proposed AIIMS site was very congested. It also stated that a four-lane road connectivity to the campus from state roads or national highway and from city arterial road is essential.

Apart from 22 new AIIMS which have been announced/sanctioned, proposals for setting up AIIMS-like hospitals have also been received from Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tripura and Mizoram.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/health-ministry-ok---s-setting-up-of-aiims-in-darbhanga.html

The agency initiated investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act after taking cognisance of a Faridabad police FIR relating to cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery of valuable security and using forged document as genuine. While the Faridabad police had filed a chargesheet in the case, an additional FIR from the Economic Offences Wing, New Delhi was also received in the instant case.

“During PMLA investigation, it is revealed that accused Anil Jindal, Jitender Kumar Garg and Praveen Kumar Kapoor were the key promoters of SRS Group. They along with other accomplices/ associates hatched a criminal conspiracy and have lured investments from several individual and institutions on fake promises of high returns in the guise of investments in real estate units viz. shops, plots, flats, SCOs, apartments etc, “ the ED said in a statement.

These funds/investments were later siphoned off into group companies through various shell companies of the SRS Group having dummy directors who were mainly SRS Group employees.

Further they presented fake and fabricated balance sheets in order to enhance their turn-over and balance sheets, the agency said.

The Group kept investors in dark by not giving investors specific investment plans. To sustain their illegal investment schemes, they further availed loans which were used for repayments and to develop their other projects, it said.

“These schemes of investment were not prudent financial structure but only proved their mens rea and culpability and with no intention of repaying the amount invested. Investigation also revealed that movable and immovable properties have been illegally acquired in the name of various companies of SRS Group and family members of accused and being proceeds of crime these assets totalling to Rs. 2510.82 crores have been provisionally attached PMLA,” it added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-2-500-cr-of-srs-group.html

150,10-1-20,Elephant Laxmi’s mahout fails to get its custody,"A 26-year-old mahout failed to get the custody of elephant Lakshmi as the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain his habeas corpus plea seeking its release from alleged illegal detention.

Lakshmi was in news a few months back when she was allegedly taken away by the mahout before Delhi police rescued her and took to a forest shelter.

Saddam, the mahout of the 47-year-old pachyderm, had moved the apex court seeking its directions to release Lakshmi from “illegal detention” at Elephant Rehabilitation Centre and bring her back to Delhi.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde wondered how a habeas corpus plea can be heard for an elephant and asked the lawyer appearing for the mahout whether he had document to show legal right of possession.

“Is elephant a citizen of India?” the bench, also comprising Justice B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, said.

The Supreme Court said that if the animal was with the Elephant Rehabilitation Centre, the petitioner would have to produce some documents to get back the custody of Lakshmi.

At this, advocate Wills Mathews, appearing for the petitioner, withdrew the petition with liberty to approach the high court.

The top court in its order said, “Counsel for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw this petition with liberty to approach the High Court for appropriate relief. Permission sought for is granted.

The writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to approach the High Court for appropriate relief in accordance with law.”

In July last year, the elephant had gone missing and a countrywide alert was issued to trace it. The animal was found by the Delhi forest department two months later. The police had “detained” the jumbo — Lakshmi — along with its mahout Saddam, from Yamuna Pusta area in the national capital in September.

The plea alleged that Lakshmi was not being kept properly in the rehabilitation centre at Haryana and that the elephant would eat and drink fine only when Saddam is around. According to the petition, Saddam and the elephant has a long bonding of over 10 years since 2008.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/elephant-laxmi---s-mahout-fails-to-get-its-custody.html

A bench comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and the poll panel while seeking their response within four weeks.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by advocate W Edwin Wilson against the National Green Tribunal’s order asking the Election Commission of India and the chief electoral officers of all states and UTs to monitor the compliance of advisories against the use of plastic.

The plea, through advocates Sanjay Upadhyay and Salik Shafique, in the apex court said that the NGT did not pass effective order on the main issue of ban on PVC banners used in elections which are a huge menace.

Wilson had claimed that campaigning material made of plastic is used during elections and later discarded as waste, which was detrimental to the environment.

He has sought a direction to prohibit use of short-life polyvinyl chloride (PVC), synthetic plastic polymer and chlorinated plastic, which includes banners and hoardings, for promotion and advertising during the poll campaigns.

The NGT’s decision came after it was informed that the MoEF had asked the chief secretaries and the chief electoral officers of all states and UTs to use alternative options during election campaigns.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/apex-court-notice-to-centre--eci-on-plea-against-use-of-plastic-during-polls.html
152,10-1-20,New system adopted by Edu Dept for retiring teachers,"The education department has decided to give the benefit of extension of service till end of academic year to all the retiring teachers. The arrangement would help the department in overcoming the problem of shortage of teachers in the schools.

As of now the department follows a procedure to grant service extension for the retiring teachers till end of academic year according to which the teachers concerned are required to apply for the benefit.

The process takes time. The education minister Arvind Pandey told The Pioneer that now instead of seeking applications from the teachers; the benefit of extension of service would be given to all the teachers who are retiring in the middle of academic year. He said that the new procedure would be followed in all the government schools and the aided schools. Pandey added that the move would help in maintaining the staff in the school.

The minister informed that the teachers who are not interested to get the benefit of service extension till end of academic year should inform the department about their intention in advance.

It is pertinent to mention here that the management of aided school seldom show interest to grant service extension to the teachers as they are more interested to start recruitment process on the vacant posts due to their vested interests.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/new-system-adopted-by-edu-dept-for-retiring-teachers.html

Sources said it was more a ‘raw’ experience than any ‘soft’ one as teachers had not done their home work any good for the PTMs. Sources said a door of the school was found closed and students many of them bare footed were lined up to say mid noon prayer before going home for the remaining hours of the day on Thursday.

On age-old black boards of the schools, which are neither pure black nor white because of chalk based writing there and none bothering to wash it every day a PTM was written in a very dull and lackluster manner.

Sources said there was dirt in the class room and outside too. At Urdu Girls Middle School Kasab mohalla Agrahari found just a dozen parents sitting as aloof as possible in the PTM while this school was getting ready for a half day closure today and full day closure on Friday as this school being Urdu one has its own holiday!

Agrahari spoke to a few parents present there like M K Alam, Uneza Parween and Saira Khatoon who could not explain as to for what they were so called in to the school by the head mistress N Yasmin.

He found the school in mess and asked DSE M Tudu accompanying him to look into this school. He was unhappy to find just around 50 students present out of the registered 228 and the head mistress too could not explain the poorest attendance of students and the parents.

At another PTM at Sarvodaya Girls High School he found the number of students ‘too good and encouraging’ but for parents he looked towards school’s head master S Ram who chewed more words than he could explain when DC asked him as to how many girls here who were found to be weak in academic pursuits have been lifted from the morass under the Gyan Setu programme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/parents-teachers-meet-offer-mixed-bag-for-dc-palamu.html

“This case presents usual dilemma between environment degradation and development. Obviously, each situation involves different considerations,” the bench said.

It added that whatever be the method adopted for evaluation of the loss to the environment, it is desirable that alternatives to proposed felling of heritage trees is considered by experts.

During the hearing, the bench told the West Bengal government, “When we cut a heritage tree, imagine the value of the oxygen the tree produced all these years. Compare it to how much you would have to pay for equivalent amount of oxygen these trees produced, if you have to buy it from somewhere else”.

Chief Justice Bobde recalled that when the Nagpur-Jabalpur road was constructed around 4000 trees were cut.

“Legally, the decision to construct the road was upheld by the High Court but loss to the nature was enormous,” he said, adding prima facie it is in the favour of construction of ROBs and widening of the road but if the alternatives can be found then there is no harm in exploring them.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/alternative-to-tree-felling-for-road-widening-along-indo-bangla-border--sc-forms-panel.html

Chenab bridge, at 359 m above river bed and having 467 m of single arch span across mighty Chenab river, will be highest Railway Arch Bridge in the world. This iconic bridge soaring 359 metres above the bed of the River Chenab will be 35 metres higher than the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris.

Chairman and Managing Director of Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd, Sanjay Gupta,told reporters in Jammu, “The Udhampur — Srinagar- Baramulla Rail Link Project is the most challenging project being undertaken post-independence “.

He said it has reached at a stage where we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and in a very short time, probably by the end of December 2021 we should be able to complete all works and have a train run through from Katra to Kashmir valley”. Railway engineers claimed, “passengers will reach Kashmir valley in less than 5 hours from Jammu and the total journey time between Delhi and Kashmir valley will be reduced to around 12 hours”.

Gupta said, the benefits of this national project are going to be huge. “It will provide all weather rail connectivity to the Kashmir valley, and it will help in supply of all kinds of commodities to the valley and also for export of produce from the valley”. From the strategic point of view, all weather rail connectivity will help Indian Armed forces and paramilitary troops to reach Kashmir valley in a short span of time.

Interacting with the media in Jammu, after reviewing the progress of the ongoing construction work, Gupta said, “ once completed the national railway project will give impetus to the tourism to a great extent and it will help boost the economic activity in the region and also along the route of the train”. We are already witnessing many changes in the socio-economic profile of the local residents in the area ever since construction work of the railway bridge started.

“Earlier we used to see only temporary structures and now concrete houses have come up in the region. We now even spot two wheeler and at some places four wheelers parked inside the houses” Gupta added.

Referring to challenges faced by the engineers on ground zero, Gupta said, the alignment of the project passes through three major geological thrust zones namely Reasi, Muree and Pir Panjal thrust. Constructing large number of tunnels in the region was one of the biggest challenges.

He said, there are 17 tunnels aggregating length of 46.1 Kms. So far, Konkan Railway has completed tunnel excavation of 37.1 kms out of 46.1 kms. The works are in progress for rest of the four tunnels, he added.

The Tunnels on this project are being constructed using the state of art technology of New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM)) and conventional method. Out of the 17 Tunnels, 13 Tunnels have been made through and work in progress in balance tunnels.

Highlighting the features of the arch bridge, Chief Public Relations Officer, Konkan Railway, LK Verma said, This is the first time in India that this technique has been successfully carried out and USBRL team need special commendation for having successfully executed the work. Fabrication work of the super structure of this viaduct was carried out by installing and commissioning of an extremely efficient and technically superior workshop at the site.

Verma said, “The erection of Arch from both ends with the help of cable crane is under process. It consists of 2 nos. Arches (One upstream and other downstream) joined by wind bracings together parabolic in shape having crown at 359.0 m height from river bed making it World Highest Railway bridge”.

Till date, erection of 5462 MT out of 9010 MT has been completed. State of the Art technology is being used to control the Geometry of the Arch, Verma added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/world---s-tallest-rail-bridge-coming-up-over-chenab.html

He stressed it was Pilot's right to raise the issue as he also held the post of the state Congress chief.

“Pilot is the Pradesh Congress Committee president. It is his right to say this about the Government. It is not the Opposition only, which could ask questions. People from the Government could also ask questions,” said Gehlot.

Pilot, after a visit to Kota's J K Lon Hospital, had told the media that the death of infants was a serious matter and the Government could not be spared of its accountability.

“We have to fixaccountability. After 13 months of being in government, it may not serve any purpose to keep pointing towards the previous Government. We have to face responsibility and consequences. People expect us to deliver,” Pilot had said.

Talking to the media, Gehlot here at the airport said Pilot should give suggestions and say openly about any lacunaes.

“I have no problem with it as it would ensure good governance,” the CM said. He also termed the deaths a conspiracy against the State Government and said those who died had come from outside.

“It was a conspiracy against the Government. In order to propagate a word on it, media from Delhi was called. It was done on purpose close on the heels of the Nirogi Rajasthan launch,” the CM said, adding that only time would tell who were behind it. Referring to the recent violence by a mob at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, Gehlot said the democracy in the country was in danger and there was chaos everywhere.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kota-deaths--people-from-govt-can-also-ask-questions--says-gehlot-on-criticism-by-pilot.html

163,10-1-20,Gujarat CM talks to fishermen as part of ‘Mokla Mahe’ interactive session,"In his attempt to reach out to the communities across Gujarat, Minister Vijay Rupani has started meeting people to understand their genuine grievances and also understand their expectations from the Government.

Keeping with his initiative, Rupani met 65 fishermen from 15 coastal districts, extending from Saurashtra & Kutch to south Gujarat, as part of the State Government’s ‘Mokla Mane’ interactive session at his official residence.

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister said that a Rs 1,200-crore project to build nine new harbours in the State has been started in consultation with the Central Government.

The State will take steps needed to develop inland and marine fishery in sync with Prime Minister Narendrabhai Modi’s call for total revolution. “Fishermen’s children will live so long fishlings live,” he said.

Talking to The Pioneer, the Chief Minister said, “Gujarat Government considers fishermen as ‘Sagar Khedut, meaning ‘farmers of the sea’. They have requested me to issue Kisan Credit Cards to them on the lines of farmers, I have directed concerned department it out for them. We have also started to provide big trawlers to small fishermen for their survival” he said.

The State Government is also mulling issuing permits to fishermen of neighbouring states for fishing in the Gujarat’s territorial waters. “This is imperative since others States do not allow fishermen from Gujarat to fish in their waters since the coastal areas are well defined. A problem typical to Gujarat’s fishermen is the State’s territorial water bordering that of Pakistan, inadvertently entering one another’s territory or being forcibly captured – a sensitive international issue. Gujarat has asked the Central Government to ensure early release of such Gujarati fishermen from Pakistan’s detention”, the Chief Minister added.

“ We are providing subsistence allowance of Rs 300 per day to the families of each of such detainee. As far as fishermen declared missing in high sea during storms or cyclone, the State Government provides ex-gratia compensation as compassion towards the kin of such fishermen who do not return for five years”, Ruapni said.

During interaction, a farmers’ representatives from Devbhumi-Dwarka suggested that Chief Minister should inaugurate the new harbour at Okha. It may be noted that Rupani had earlier held ‘Mokla Mane’ interactive session with representatives of slum-dwellers, teachers, differently abled and nomadic tribes.

“After every interactive session, officials of the concerned departments work on the feedback and petitions that are received from people. This initiative has gone a long way in ameliorating the condition of the underprivileged class. I hold this session with the representatives of various sections of the society on the fourth or fifth of every month” the chief minister said.

A senior official of the chief minister’s office said that participants are mostly from the underprivileged and disadvantaged classes of society and they are called to meet the Chief Minister irrespective of religion, caste or sex to be a part of the programme. These informal interactions help in solving problems as they provide instant feedback, the official added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/gujarat-cm-talks-to-fishermen-as-part-of----mokla-mahe----interactive-session.html
164,10-1-20,"Didi to skip Sonia meet in Delhi, fight CAA alone","Angered by the vehemence of the Wednesday’s general strike sponsored by the Left-Congress alliance Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to skip the January 13 all-party meeting called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

“I will not attend the meeting convened by Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Jan 13 in protest against Congress-Left hooliganism during Wednesday's strike,” Banerjee said even as a Trinamool Congress twitter handle declared that the Bengal ruling party will fight against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens alone.

Banerjee was angered by the alleged hooliganism on streets in the name of bandh senior party leader Partho Chatterjee said reminding how the Chief Minister had supported the issues raised by the Front and Congress — related to minimum wage hike, pension, apart from withdrawal of the controversial CAA — “but she opposed the strike because she is against the practice of spoiling mandays in the name of bandhs.”

Both the Left and the Congress had been complaining against the way the State Government had tried to foil the strike through a circular demanding compulsory attendance. The two parties also demanded an impartial investigation into the video footages showing how the men in uniform in Malda’s Sujapur were torching the civilian and police vehicles apparently in a bid to malign the sponsors of the strike.

The Chief Minister’s decision to skip the meet comes a day after the Left-Congress sponsored nationwide bandh against the Central Government’s economic policies.

The CPI(M) and the Congress were “indulging in dirty politics” in Bengal and it would be difficult for her to share a joint platform with them Banerjee reportedly told her colleagues adding she would fight her battle against CAA and NRC on her own. Both the CPI(M) and the Congress promptly returned fire questioning her true intention to fight the BJP. “With the topmost echelon of the TMC trapped in Sharada, Narada and … with their necks in the hands of the CBI she is afraid of the BJP Government which wants her to break the anti-CAA-NRC movement. So she is avoiding the all-party meeting,” senior CPI(M) leader Sujan Charkabarty said.

Congress’ Abdul Mannan said “either the Chief Minister wants to break the opposition solidarity or she the very impact of the strike after many years has unnerved her leading her to sense some kind of alienation which is why she is avoiding the joint meeting.”

Meanwhile the Chief Minister on Thursday led yet another rally in Kolkata leading thousands of people at Barasat in the northern fringes of the city.

Accusing the BJP Government of misleading the people on the refugee issue she said “the BJP is today taking the credit of enacting CAA to provide citizenship to the refugees which is all bunkum. In fact we had provided the refugees lands and other rights after coming to power making them permanent citizenship of India.” She also asked the justifiability of amending CAA and applying it on the refugees who had already been living in the country for decades and taking parts in elections.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/didi-to-skip-sonia-meet-in-delhi--fight-caa-alone.html
165,10-1-20,Yashwant launches ‘Gandhi Shanti Yatra' from Mumbai to Delhi,"With no sign of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) abating, former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha on Thursday launched a 3,000 km 'Gandhi Shanti Yatra' from Mumbai to New Delhi to seek the repeal of CAA and concrete assurance from the Government that there would not be a nationwide National Citizens Register (NRC).

NCP chief Sharad Pawar flagged off the 'Gandhi Shanti Yatra' at the historic Gateway of India in south Mumbai, a yatra that will pass through five States —Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana — before culminating at Raj Ghat in New Delhi on January 30, the death anniversary of the Mahatma Gandhi.

Apart from the repeal of CAA and non-implementation of NRC across India, Sinha is demanding a judicial inquiry by a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court into the acts of “state-sponsored violence” like the one witnessed at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) recently.

Senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, senior actor-turned-politician Shatrugan Sinha, State Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik and former MP Balachandra Mungekar were prominent among those present at the yatra flagging-off ceremony.

Speaking on the occasion, Sinha said: The country is witnessing the disturbance and therefore, we are taking out a yatra [march] in order to establish peace and harmony in the country. We will not let the country be divided. We will go by constitution. We will not let anyone kill Gandhi”.

Pawar hit out at the Narendra Modi for creating an atmosphere of fear in the minds of people across the country over CAA and NRC. “There is acute fear in the minds of people with no birth and other documents with them that they may be sent to detention camps.

The people across the country are unhappy with the Government at the Centre. That’s why people are taking to streets in protest against the Modi Government. There is need to show right direction to the people. We can save the Constitution through non-violent means,” the NCP Chief Minister.

Pawar expressed confidence that a large people would turn out in Sinha’s 21-day “Gandhi Shanti Yatra”.

The rally is being organised under the banner of Rashtra Manch, a political platform launched by Yashwant Sinha last month. The yatra is supported by farmers' organisation Shetakari Jagar Manch. “Various organisations including farmers will participate in the yatra,” Sinha said.

Sinha tweeted that the route for Gandhi Shanti Yatra-2020 and all other updates would be made notified on a specially created Facebook page for the yatra.

Sinha, who resigned from the Indian Adminstrative Service (IAS) and joined active politics as a member of Janata party in 1984, was a Union Finance Minister in the Chandra Shekhar and AB Vajpayee Governments during 1990-91 and 1998-2002 respectively, while he was the External Affairs Minister in the Vajpayee Government between July 2002 and May 2004. He quit the Bharatiya Janata Party on April 21, 2018.

Even while he was in the BJP, Sinha had undertaken a three-day-long agitation to press for the demands of the farmers in the suicide-hit district of Akola in Vidarbha region in December 2017. Through his agitation, Sinha had forced the BJP-led Government to accept all his seven demands.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yashwant-launches----gandhi-shanti-yatra--from-mumbai-to-delhi.html

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of his campaign in neighbouring Lawspet block to garner the support of people for the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said, “Congress is trying to politicise the CAA issue also. Congress and left parties are seeking to gain politically out of it.”

He said there was no room for any apprehension on the part of anyone in the wake of the enactment of CAA.”If any one has any grievances they can turn up for debates and parties were welcome to have a debate in a “peaceful manner” in Parliament on CAA,” Angadi said.

The Union Minister of State for Railways also contended that it was not the duty of the States to say that they would not implement the Act as it was the Centre that had the right to grant citizenship.

The top court asked the Allahabad High Court to proceed with the similar plea before it concerning the bail of journalist and decide the issue expeditiously.

A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant issued notice to the state government and sought its reply within two weeks.

Advocates Prashant Bhushan and Govind Ji said the journalist was arrested in August last year but the high court was not deciding his bail plea.

Bhushan claimed the high court has been frequently adjourning the matter and giving opportunity to the state government to file counter affidavit, without appreciating uncontroverted facts on record and baseless, motivated and uncorroborated charges levelled against the journalist.

He said petitioner Nitish Pandey is a journalist and not a gangster that he can be booked under the stringent law.

169,10-1-20,NC says it’s Govt’s bid to normalise ‘clampdown’,"The National Conference on Thursday said it was “disappointed” with the way the Government brought envoys from various countries to Jammu & Kashmir to “endorse” its “claims of normalcy” in the Union Territory.

The party alleged that the envoys have been brought to the Valley on a “guided tour”, where access has been limited to “handpicked individuals who toe the Government line”.

“The National Conference is disappointed with the way foreign envoys have been brought to the valley to endorse the Centre's claims of normalcy,” it said. Envoys from 15 countries, including US Ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster, arrived here on Thursday on a two-day visit to Jammu and

Kashmir, the first visit by diplomats since August last year when the state's special status was revoked and it was downsized to a union territory.

“The NC wishes to ask these envoys that if the situation in Jammu & Kashmir is “normal”, then why are scores of people, including three former chief ministers, under detention for almost 160 days and why have the people been denied access to the internet for over 5 months?” a statement issued by the party said.

The party described the visit of enjoys from 15 countries to Jammu & Kashmir on Thursday as a “repeat visit” of the European Members of Parliament to the erstwhile State earlier.

The NC said while these visits may provide “short lived propaganda victories”, true normalcy will only be achieved when all detainees are released, communications and internet restored and “genuine” political activity resumed.

“While the rest of the country is told that peaceful dissent is the cornerstone of democracy, this right does not seem to extend to the people of Jammu & Kashmir. Are the people of J & K expected to live without the fundamental rights accorded to other Indian citizens?” it said.

Officials said envoys of several countries had requested the Government for a visit to Kashmir to get a first-hand account of the situation in the Valley following the August 5 decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 and bifurcate it into union territories, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

This is the second visit of a foreign delegation to Jammu & Kashmir since August 5.

170,10-1-20,Baig: Mehbooba Mufti's provocative statement downgraded J&K status,"One of the founding members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Deputy Chief Minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig on Thursday claimed PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti should not have made a 'provocative' statement that none would be left to hold the Tricolour in Jammu & Kashmir if Article 370 was tampered with.

Reacting to one of the straight questions during his first media interaction in Jammu after August 5, PDP stalwart Baig maintained, “that statement was made by Mehbooba Mufti in my absence. I was not there when she made that statement”. He said, “statements like that resulted in downgrading Jammu & Kashmir from State to Union Territory.It didn't help us. That statement should not have been made”.

Talking about his own approach on such issues, Baig clarified, “if people of Jammu & Kashmir have to stay together and take up their issues/grievances, then we have to be polite and humble in our approach. We cannot intimidate Prime Minister, Home Minister and even NSA of the country with our aggressive approach.We cannot earn anything”.

Expressing his serious concerns over continuous detention of three former Chief Ministers like Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference leaders Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, Baig said, “They took oath under Indian Constitution. They stood against Hurriyat and fought militancy. And, now all of them have been detained since August 4” .

Seeking their immediate release Baig said that when one of Farooq Abdullah’s friend moved a petition under Section 107 (then RPC, now IPC) questioning detention of a former CM and sitting MP, Government slapped PSA on him.

“Others, who were thinking of doing the same, dropped the idea out of the fear of getting booked under PSA,” he said.

“I want to urge the Government that detained politicians should be immediately released and if they have done something wrong then book them under sedition charges and let them face trials,” Baig added.

The PDP leader said that since the state lost its special status and has been downgraded to Union Territories, he would like the Centre and Parliament to ensure domicile safeguards, land and job rights to the people of Jammu & Kashmir on the lines of northeastern states.

“The Government has put domicile safeguards via Article 371 in Northeastern states. Since J&K is also a hilly region and unemployment is a serious problem here, there should be similar domicile safeguards, job and land rights in place for the people here”, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/baig--mehbooba-mufti-s-provocative-statement-downgraded-j-k-status.html
171,10-1-20,25 tonne Quran up for auction at International trans-shipment container terminal in Kochi,"January 21 will see 25,000 kg of Holy Quran described as “unclaimed and uncleared” imported goods being auctioned at the International Trans-shipment Container Terminal at Vallarpadom in Kerala’s Kochi.

The Holy Quran, believed to be from a West Asian country and printed in state-of-the-art presses abroad had been lying unclaimed in the Trans-shipment Container Terminal for the last few months. Strangely, the authorities said there were no addresses of the consignees or senders printed on the container. Since the quantity of Qurans in the container weigh only 25 tonnes, there are speculation that the container could have been used to import some other materials about which there are no disclosures.

MIV Logistics Private Limited, the shipping company which has placed the advertisement in local media was tight lipped about the why and how of the Quran consignment. What baffles the port authorities and intelligence agencies are the absence of the names and addresses of the sender and consignee. Sources in Kochi Port said the intelligence agencies have ordered a probe into the whole affair.

“The Vallarpadom Container Terminal is infamous for the import of containers carrying high denomination currency notes during the 2004 to 2014 period. The entire consignment of counterfeit currency notes were injected into the Indian economy through a series of well planned and conceived hawala transaction,” said Suresh Gopinath, auditor and tax practitioner based in Kerala’s Perumbavoor. He said the town of Perumbavoor was the hub of hawala transactions and an amount of Rs 1,000 crore has been distributed among one particular minority community in the small town.

MIV Logistics Pvt Ltd Container Freight Station is a joint venture company in which the major share holders are Infrastructure Kerala Ltd (a public sector undertaking in which the Government of Kerala is the majority stake holder), Mfar Bahrain, the business house owned by West Asia based P Mohammed Ali.

What has shocked the authorities in Kochi is the callous manner in which the holy book consignment has been dumped in the port. The printing rights of the book is reserved for “The Custodian of The Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Complex for the Printing of The Holy Quran”. The earlier instances when the Holy Book was shown disrespect at Guantanamo Bay had given rise to large scale furor.

Shipping agents who spoke to The Pioneer expressed shock over the indifferent manner in which the religious books have been sent to India. “Any international consignment could sent only with the addresses of the senders and consignees. It is shocking to note that the people who are behind the export and import of this consignment has played with fire because what they have done is blasphemy,” said a shipping agent.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/25-tonne-quran-up-for-auction-at-international-trans-shipment-container-terminal-in-kochi.html

As the video of the incident went viral in the social media and the matter became a hot topic of discussion, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai unanimously said they would get the matter investigated.

According to information received, a group of BJP workers, all supporters of local party leader M M Govindaraj, had put up a poster “India Supports CAA” on the wall of Jyoti Nivas College near Koramangala. This was opposed by girl students, who said they would not allow any such poster to be put up on the college property. The BJP workers then tried to shout down the students. “You are not concerned about citizenship, you are concerned about yourself. You should be concerned about India first. You are not an Indian then,” a BJP worker is heard screaming at the girls in the video.

They also questioned the students if they had valid reasons to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act and sought to know whether they wanted an argument or a debate.

The BJP workers purportedly told the girls that they were only the students of the college and not the owner. “What's your problem madam with the CAA? Are you the owner of the college?” they asked. Amid the heated argument, the BJP workers resorted to sloganeering like 'We want CAA' and “Go back to Pakistan', as seen in another video shot by the students.

Agitated by the incident, students of the college staged a demonstration holding placards and raising slogans.

They asked the BJP leaders not to bring politics into the campus. They put up posters and held placards reading, Stop turning colleges into war zones, Say no to CAA and You cant force your opinion on us.

They came to the campus, put up the poster and wanted us to sign in favour of the law but we did not agree. Then, they spoke to us in a rough manner, which we opposed, said a student on the campus requesting anonymity.

A posse of police was sent to the college to pacify the agitated students and persuade them to get into the college campus. BTM Layout Congress MLA Ramalinga Reddy visited the college on Thursday after learning about the incident and spoke to its management.

Later, he told reporters that the campus should not be allowed for any political activities.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-workers-create-ruckus-in-college-during-pro-caa-campaign.html
175,10-1-20,Opp parties in Goa join hands against K’taka on Mahadayi,"Opposition parties in Goa on Thursday came together to resist neighbouring Karnataka's plans to divert the water of the river Mahadayi.

The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, Goa Forward Party, Shiv Sena and others came together under the banner of Rs Progressive Front of Goa' and resolved to create awareness about the issue across the State.

""Cutting across political affiliations, all Goans should come together to fight for the cause of Mahadayi,"" MGP working president Narayan Sawant told reporters.

In Karnataka, political parties bury their differences and fight together on the river issue, he pointed out.

""Goa may be small politically, but we should fight this battle united,"" he said.

Goa Youth Forward president Raj Malik alleged that Chief Minister Pramod Sawant could not even get Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appointment to discuss the issue in the last three months.

Progressive Front of Goa leaderHrudaynath Shirodkar said that Union ministers Prakash Javadekar, Pralhad Joshi and Chief Minister Sawant had ""cheated"" the people of Goa on the Mahadayi issue.

""I condemn the action of Goa government which stalled adjournment motion (during recent assembly session) on a technical ground. When it avers that the Mahadayi is more than our mother, it can not stall the adjournment motion on technical ground,"" he said.

The Goa government is opposed a drinking water project proposed by Karnataka on the river, fearing that it would divert Goa's share of water.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-parties-in-goa-join-hands-against-k---taka-on-mahadayi.html
176,10-1-20,WB lowers India’s growth to 5%,"India’s growth rate is projected to decelerate to five per cent in 2019-20 amid enduring financial sector issues, according to a World Bank report, which said the country’s GDP was likely to recover to 5.8 per cent in the following financial year.

India’s GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and construction sectors, government data showed on Tuesday.

“In India, where weakness in credit from non-bank financial companies is expected to linger, growth is projected to slow to five per cent in fiscal year 2019/20, which ends March 31 and recover to 5.8 per cent the following fiscal year,” the Bank said in its latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects on Wednesday.

It said tighter credit conditions in the non-banking sector are contributing to a substantial weakening of the domestic demand in India.

“In India, activity was constrained by insufficient credit availability, as well as by subdued private consumption,” the report stated. The Bank said the regional growth in South Asia is expected to pick up gradually, to six per cent in 2022, on the assumption of a modest rebound in domestic demand.

“Growth in India is projected to decelerate to five per cent in FY(financial year) 2019/20 amid enduring financial sector issues,” the WB report said.

It said key risks to the outlook include a sharper-than-expected slowdown in major economies, a re-escalation of regional geopolitical tensions, and a setback in reforms to address impaired balance sheets in the financial and corporate sectors.

In India, economic activity slowed substantially in 2019, with the deceleration most pronounced in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, whereas government-related services sub-sectors received significant support from public spending, the Bank said.

GDP growth decelerated to five per cent and 4.5 per cent in the April-June and July-September quarters of 2019, respectively, the lowest readings since 2013, it said.

Sharp slowdowns in household consumption and investment onset, the rise in Government spending.

High-frequency data suggest that activity continued to be weak for the rest of 2019, the Bank said.

The Bank, in the report, praised India’s efforts to gradually eliminate subsidies on LPG. In India, starting in 2012, the government reformed its subsidy regime for liquified petroleum gas (LPG).

LPG subsidies to households encouraged the formation of black markets where subsidised LPG distributed to households was diverted to the commercial sector.

The government gradually increased the price of LPG for households while implementing a large-scale targeted cash transfer mechanism, it said. “The programme successfully eliminated distortions in the LPG market, with limited adverse consequences for the poor, and the fiscal savings obtained from the reduction in subsidies fully offset the costs of the targeted cash transfer,” the report stated.

In its report, the Bank said the global economic growth is forecast to edge up to 2.5 per cent in 2020 as investment and trade gradually recover from last year’s significant weakness but downward risks persist.

America’s growth is forecast to slow to 1.8 per cent this year, reflecting the negative impact of earlier tariff increases and elevated uncertainty. Euro Area growth is projected to slip to a downwardly revised one per cent in 2020 amid weak industrial activity, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/wb-lowers-india---s-growth-to-5-.html
177,10-1-20,EV dream not very far: M&M,"Automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on Thursday said India’s electric vehicles dream is not far from realisation but it needs steps like priority financing and duty reduction on certain parts to push e-mobility in the country. The company, which sells various electric models like e-Verito and e2O, said that with more manufacturers like Tata, Hyundai, MG Motors and Maruti Suzuki coming in the segment, there will be more acceptance of electric vehicles.

While stating that the government has done its bit to help e-mobility, the company said it was time for manufacturers to work towards reducing EV prices in order to make it viable for personal usage even as new business models in the shared mobility space proving it to be a sound proposition.

“Government has done what needs to be done... Electric vehicle dream is now not very far and with many players coming in, Tatas have announced their vehicles, Hyundai have launched their Kona, MG has announced their EV and Maruti has talked about its EV as well, with that we will see more and more EVs coming in,” Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here. This certainly will make it more acceptable when we see many more products on the road for public to start using EVs, he added.

Goenka further said it was now up to the companies to take it forward in order to make e-mobility affordable. “OEMs need to reduce prices of electric vehicles by 8-10%. Commenting specifically on Mahindra, he said the company would like to reduce the price of e-Verito to around Rs 11 lakh from Rs 12 lakh currently. “To achieve that, we are focussing on localisation and also with cell prices going down, it should help. Right now, there is 5% duty on import of cells, if that can be reduced then there can be a reduction of at least Rs 20,000 in vehicle price,” he said.

He said that one of the major hurdles was in financing as banks and non-banking financial companies were reluctant to give loans as they were not sure about the resale value of EVs.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ev-dream-not-very-far--m-m.html

Markets sank Wednesday after Tehran launched missiles at bases housing Americans in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of an Iranian general. Anxiety subsided after reports indicated no Americans were killed and President Donald Trump said Iran “appears to be standing down.”

The lack of casualties “gave the markets more confidence that the Iranians had instigated little more than the intention to make a public show of force mainly to save face at home,” said Stephen Innes of AxiTrader in a report.

182,10-1-20,Yediyurappa should control hooligans of his party: Sidda,"Accusing the BJP of threatening college students here to support the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, senior Congress leader K Siddaramaiah on Thursday said Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa should control “hooligans” from his party.

The former Chief Minister was reacting to an incident where some BJP workers allegedly created ruckus near a girl's college here, while seeking support for CAA by raising slogans, as students opposed a pro-CAA banner on the wall of their institution.

“@BJP4Karnataka goons are threatening students of Jyotinivas College to support CAA. Mr @BSYBJP, I am strictly warning you to control hooligans from your party.

Don't subvert knowledge & institutions for your selfish motives. We won't let Ktaka to be victim of your Hitler rule!” Siddaramaiah tweeted. “Educational institutions are a source of dissemination of knowledge, critical thinking & scientific temper.

While @BJP4India ideology is on weak foundations of fascism. BJP is threatened by the knowledge base of our Universities & hence they want to subvert & weaken them,” he said in another tweet.

Later, speaking to reporters in Hubballi, Siddaramaiah said there was no democracy in the country now, and the freedom of expression that has been guaranteed by the constitution is being curtailed.

Alleging that an “atmosphere of fear” was being created in the country, he reiterated that the recent attack on students at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University was “Government sponsored” and questioned as to why no one has been arrested so for in connection with the incident. The Congress leader also claimed that the freedom of students and rights enshrined for citizens under the Constitution are being snatched away, and there was kind of “totalitarianism” in the country these days.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yediyurappa-should-control-hooligans-of-his-party--sidda.html

All Assam Students Union (AASU), which has been spearheading the protests against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), has hinted at launching a political party.

“What is there to discuss after they said they will launch a political party. It will be settled in the political arena only...In the EVM only. How will it be elsewhere,” said Sarma, the State Finance and Health

Minister. “When the agitation was an agitation, we had said about talks and that the doors are open for discussions.

Now, we cannot put forward the ball and say hit a goal,” he added.

Sarma, the influential BJP leader of the region, said AASU general secretary Luring Jyoti Gogoi has forgotten about the CAA and is devoting most his time in criticising the

BJP. “If we hold discussion under the present circumstances then I will have to say I will surrender my seat or BJP will not contest the next elections. The clause of the CAA, the protesters are against or want to talk about, does not exist now,” he said.

184,10-1-20,DIG More suspended over molestation charge,"Absconding Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Motor Transport Dept) Nishikant More was finally suspended from his service on Thursday for allegedly molesting a minor girl at a birthday in June last year.

More’s suspension came hours after a Raigad Court rejected the DIG’s plea seeking an anticipatory bail.

The Maharashtra government also suspended More’s driver Dinkar Salve for allegedly threatening the father of victim girl at a Panvel court hearing More’s anticipatory bail plea on Tuesday.

Confirming the two suspensions, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said: “We have formed police teams to look out for the absconding DIG. We have also suspended the DIG’s driver for threatening the father of the victim girl”.

The Navi Mumbai police said that they had formed three teams to trace the absconding DIG. “ We are confident of arresting him soon,” a senior investigating officer said.

The alleged incident had taken place at birthday party of the victim girl at her Navi Mumbai residence on June 5, 2019, where More had barged in when the girl was cutting the cake and allegedly molested her.

Though the victim’s family had lodged a complaint with the police against the DIG, the police dilly-dallied on registering a case against More. Finally on July 26, the police booked DIG for alleged molestation.

Meanwhile, the 17-year old victim left her home three days ago, leaving behind a note threatening that she would commit suicide. In her note, she held More responsible for her suicide.

The police are on the look-out for the victim girl. “ We do not think that the girl would commit as we have seen her in the CCTV footage of her building where she was carrying a bag while leaving her home shortly before midnight on Monday along with her male friend. We have learnt that the male friend lives in Navi Mumbai,” a senior police officer said.

Eyewitnesses to the incident have told the police that the victim girl’s birthday on June 5 last year was attended by several inivitees. Some of them offered thre cake and also smeared it on her amid clapping and singing.

More, who was standing next to the victim girl, reportedly scooped some of the cake from her face with his fingers and licked it. He allegedly continued to lick the cake pieces even when it fell on her chest. Upset with More’s misconduct, the victim girl subsequently lodged the molestation complaint against More. Afterwards, the DIG allegedly stalked the victim girl.

185,10-1-20,Northern Army Commander on a rare visit to Xinjiang,"Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Ranbir Singh is on a rare visit to China's politically significant Xinjiang province, bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, during which he will hold talks with top Chinese generals.

Lt Gen Singh's visit is the second-ever by a Northern Army commander to China, earlier being in 2015 by his predecessor Lt Gen B S Hooda.The visits of the Northern Army Commanders to China are significant as one of its previous heads Lt Gen B S Jaswal was denied regular visa in 2010 on the ground that the Northern Command covered the ""disputed"" Jammu & Kashmir, which led to an angry reaction from India and disruption of ties between the two militaries.

The issue was resolved with Lt Gen Hooda's visit in 2015 leading to the normalisation of ties between the two militaries.

Lt Gen Singh in the last three days has visited Beijing and Chengdu. On Thursday, he reached Urumqi, the provincial capital of Xinjiang, which borders PoK.

He is due to interact with the top officials of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Urumqi and visit local military installations on Friday, sources here told PTI.

Technically China and Pakistan have no borders but only connected through PoK.

Xinjiang is the starting point for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor over which India has protested to Beijing as it is being laid through the PoK.

Singh's visit to Xinjiang also assumed significance as it comes in the backdrop of India's move to revoke Article 370 which granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir, and bifurcate the State into two Union Territories.

China has said that bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir into two union territories is ""unlawful and void"", and it ""challenges"" China's sovereignty.

India has told China that the revocation of the special status of Jammu & Kashmir is an internal matter and sole prerogative of the country and has no implication for either the external boundaries of India or the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

The boundary issue is being discussed through the Special Representatives (SR) mechanism. The SRs - National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi - held the 22nd round of border talks in New Delhi last month.

Xinjiang has been in the news in recent months over allegations that China has interned more than a million Uighur Muslims, a claim Beijing deny.

Earlier, Lt Gen Singh met Chinese ground forces' commander Gen Han Weiguo and discussed issues having strategic ramifications and measures to enhance peace and tranquillity along the sensitive borders.

The visit would ""serve as a milestone"" by cementing mutual ties. ""This will achieve the twin aims of high level military co-operation and stabilising the sensitive borders of both the countries,"" an Indian army official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/northern-army-commander-on-a-rare-visit-to-xinjiang.html

Soon after the fourth carcass was found, the Goa forest department on Wednesday arrested three men from Golavali village that lies within the Mahadayi Wildlife Sanctuary on the suspicion that the felines were poisoned in a ""revenge killing"" for preying on the cattle.

Sawant said two families were found residing in the area, where the tigress and her cubs were moving around.

191,10-1-20,2019 witnesses worst-ever decline in auto sales: SIAM,"The automobile industry recorded its worst-ever sales decline in two decades in 2019, with an unprecedented slowdown hampering vehicle offtake across segments, according to industry body SIAM.

As per data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Friday, all vehicle segments reported de-growth last year as low consumer sentiments, weak rural demand and economic slowdown took toll on demand.

Overall wholesale of vehicles during the year across categories, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, saw a decline of 13.77 per cent in 2019 at 2,30,73,438 units as against 2,67,58,787 units in 2018.

This is the worst fall in sales since the industry body started recording monthly and yearly sales data in 1997. The previous lowest was recorded in 2007 when overall sales had declined by 1.44 per cent.

Similarly, total passenger vehicle sales during 2019 declined by 12.75 per cent to 29,62,052 units as compared with 33,94,790 units a year ago. This is the worst performance in the segment since 2013 when sales witnessed a dip of 7.49 per cent.

Two-wheeler sales also saw a dip of 14.19 per cent last year to 1,85,68,280 units as compared with 2,16,40,033 units in 2018. Likewise, total commercial vehicles saw a dip of 14.99 per cent to 8,54,759 units as against 10,05,502 units in 2018.

""Challenges remain for the auto industry despite the government bringing in several growth enablers. GDP growth rate remains an area of worry as commercial vehicle segment is clearly linked to it. Besides, low demand from rural areas continues to be a matter of concern,"" SIAM President Rajan Wadhera told reporters here.

In passenger vehicles, utility vehicles are driving sales as other segments are not performing that well, he added.

When asked about the 2020 outlook, Wadhera said the situation is going to remain tough due to impending changeover to the BS-VI emission regime.

""We expect prices of commercial vehicles to go up by 8-10 per cent due to BS-VI norms and it is going to impact demand. But, if economic growth is there, this factor would not be such a sore point,"" Wadhera said.

Similarly, passenger vehicles would see cost increase in range of 3-7 per cent, which would also act as an dampener for sales growth, he said.

""So, growth in the segment is expected to remain flat. In two-wheelers, low demand from rural areas continues and challenges are expected to remain going ahead as well,"" Wadhera said.

He further said if the economy grows at around 6-7 per cent, the auto sector could see a return to growth rates witnessed four quarters ago.

When asked if job losses witnessed in various industrial sectors, such as auto and telecom, have had an impact on demand slump, Wadhera said, ""Yes.""

The auto industry body also said the positive sentiment that was witnessed during the festive season has not sustained with retail sales in December coming back to negative.

Commenting on the industry's Budget expectations, he reminded of the long-standing demand of reducing GST rate to 18 per cent and introduction of scrappage policy to spur demand.

In December, domestic passenger vehicle sales declined 1.24 per cent to 2,35,786 units in December from 2,38,753 units in the year-ago period.

Domestic car sales were down 8.4 per cent to 1,42,126 units as against 1,55,159 units in December 2018, according to SIAM.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India posted a growth of 2.49 per cent in its passenger vehicle sales in December at 1,22,784 units. Hyundai Motor India saw a decline of 9.84 per cent at 37,953 units, while Mahindra & Mahindra posted a growth of 3.94 per cent at 15,686 units.

Motorcycle sales last month declined 12.01 per cent to 6,97,819 units as against 7,93,042 units a year earlier. Total two-wheeler sales in December declined 16.6 per cent to 10,50,038 units compared to 12,59,007 units in the year-ago month.

In two-wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp posted a decline of 5.63 per cent at 4,12,009 units in December. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) saw its sales drop by 2.26 per cent at 2,30,197 units, while TVS Motor Co witnessed a decline of 25.09 per cent at 1,57,244 units.

Sales of commercial vehicles were down 12.32 per cent to 66,622 units in December, SIAM data showed.

Vehicle sales across categories registered a decline of 13.08 per cent to 14,05,776 units from 16,17,398 units in December 2018, it added.

194,10-1-20,"US, Iran step back from the brink; region still on edge","The US and Iran stepped back from the brink of possible war on Wednesday as President Donald Trump signaled he would not retaliate militarily for Iran’s missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing US troops.

No one was harmed in the strikes, but US forces in the region remained on high alert.

Speaking from the White House, Trump seemed intent on deescalating the crisis, which spiraled after he authorized the targeted killing last week of Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani.

Iran responded overnight with its most direct assault on America since the 1979 seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran, firing more than a dozen missiles at two installations in Iraq. The Pentagon said Wednesday that it believed Iran fired with the intent to kill.

Even so, Trump’s takeaway was that “Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.” Despite such conciliatory talk, the region remained on edge, and American troops including a quick-reaction force dispatched over the weekend, were on high alert.

Last week Iranian-backed militia besieged the US Embassy in Baghdad, and Tehran’s proxies in the region remain able to carry out attacks such as the one on Dec. 27 that killed a U.S. Contractor and set off the most recent round of hostilities.

Hours after Trump spoke, an ‘incoming’ siren went off in Baghdad’s Green Zone after what seemed to be small rockets “impacted” the diplomatic area, a Western official said. There were no reports of casualties.

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that it was “perhaps too early to tell” if Iran will be satisfied that the missile strikes were sufficient to avenge the Soleimani killing.

“We should have some expectation,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper added in a Wednesday briefing, “that Shiite militia groups, either directed or not directed by Iran, will continue in some way, shape or form to try and undermine our presence there,” either politically or militarily.

There is no obvious path to diplomatic engagement, as Trump pledged to add to his “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions. He said the new, unspecified sanctions would remain in place “until Iran changes its behavior.” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the overnight strike was not necessarily the totality of Iran’s response.

“Last night they received a slap,” Khamenei said. “These military actions are not sufficient (for revenge). What is important is that the corrupt presence of America in this region comes to an end.” Trump, facing perhaps the biggest test of his presidency, credited the minimised damage to an early warning system “that worked very well” and said Americans should be “extremely grateful and happy” with the outcome.

The strikes had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and left the world waiting to see whether the American president would respond with more military force.

Trump, in his nine-minute, televised address, spoke of a robust US Military with missiles that are “big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast.” But then he added: “We do not want to use it.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us--iran-step-back-from-the-brink--region-still-on-edge.html
195,10-1-20,Boris urges ‘end to hostilities’ in Iran call,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday to end the confrontation with the United States and underlined Britain’s commitments to Tehran’s nuclear agreement, Downing Street said.

Johnson “called for an end to hostilities” and said Britain viewed the 2015 nuclear deal as “the best arrangement currently available to deliver on our goal of stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon”, his spokesman said.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said “the time has come” for Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to follow Washington’s lead and abandon the 2015 nuclear agreement, which sets limits on Iran’s enrichment levels.

196,10-1-20,Iran sends mixed signals as tensions with US ease,"Iran sent mixed signals Thursday as tensions with the US appeared to ease, with President Hassan Rouhani warning of a “very dangerous response” if the US makes “another mistake” and a senior commander vowing “harsher revenge” for the killing of a top Iranian general.

Both sides appeared to step back on Wednesday after Iran launched a series of ballistic missiles at two military bases housing American troops in Iraq without causing any casualties.

Iran said the attack was retaliation for the US strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the architect of its regional security strategy, in Iraq earlier this week.

Rouhani said the strike on the bases was a legitimate act of self-defense under the UN Charter, but he warned that “if the US makes another mistake, it will receive a very dangerous response.”

In addition to launching the missile attack, Iran also abandoned its remaining commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump had walked away from in May 2018.

But Rouhani said Thursday that Iran would continue to cooperate with UN inspectors.

Senior Iranian military commanders struck a more defiant tone.

Abdollah Araghi, a member of Iran’s joint chiefs of staff, said the country’s Revolutionary Guard “will impose a more severe revenge on the enemy in the near future,” according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

Tasnim also quoted Gen. Ali Fadavi, the acting commander of the Guard, as saying the missile attack was “just one of the manifestations of our abilities.”

“We sent dozens of missiles into the heart of the US bases in Iraq and they couldn’t do a damned thing,” he was quoted as saying.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-sends-mixed-signals-as-tensions-with-us-ease.html
197,10-1-20,Residential demand grew just 2 per cent in Delhi in 2019,"The demand for residential space registered a meagre 1.8 per cent growth in Delhi in 2019, while the market is still struggling in Gurugram and Noida despite improving infrastructure and lower interest rates, a report has said.

Out of the 12 cities surveyed, 10 residential markets have shown positive market dynamics in the last quarter of the year, Magicbricks’s PropIndex Report Q4 2019 said. While some areas of the country faced downward pressure on prices and reduction in supply, searches remained robust in the affordable segment. The search trend suggests that India is looking for houses under Rs 4,000-5,000 per sq ft, it said.

“In Delhi, the demand has started to pick-up, but the options are limited. While the city prices remained low in the last 5 years, an increase of 1.8 per cent in the last one year indicates a positive development for the residential segment of the city. The residential demand in Gurugram has been dull. However, the city’s improving infrastructure could boost demand,” the realty portal’s report said.

It added Noida and Greater Noida markets are struggling to pick-up despite demand matching supply, affordability, and lower interest rates.

While Noida’s average prices fell by 10 per cent, Greater Noida witnessed an increase of just 3.6 per cent in the last 5 years. The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under PMAY has led to increased buyer interest in the affordable and lower-mid segment. Emerging localities in the price bracket of Rs 4,000-5,000/sq ft observed the highest consumer interest.

The premium segment witnessed price declines in most tier-1 cities, as above Rs 10,000 per sq ft buyers looked for negotiated deals.

The segments of Rs 20-30 lakh, Rs 30-40 lakh and Rs 40-50 lakh each accounted for 10 per cent of the searches at the India level, the report said.

In most of the cities, supply-managed to keep pace with the demand. Bengaluru has shown steady growth in the residential market, with a strong 25 per cent growth in the last 5 years.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/residential-demand-grew-just-2-per-cent-in-delhi-in-2019.html
198,10-1-20,Tax dept rolls back order; allows simple forms for filing returns by joint property owners,"Rolling back its week old order, the Income Tax Department on Thursday allowed joint owners of single house property to file income tax return using simple Form-1 (Sahaj) or Form-4 (Sugam).

On January 3, it had debarred individual taxpayers owning house property in joint ownership and those who paid Rs 1 lakh in electricity bills in a year or incurred Rs 2 lakh expense on foreign travel from filing their annual income return using the simple return forms. “After the notification, concerns have been raised that the changes are likely to cause hardship in the case of individual taxpayers,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.

According to the statement, the issue was examined and “it has been decided to allow a person, who jointly owns a single house property, to file his/her return of income in ITR-1 or ITR-4 Form, as may be applicable, if he/she meets the other conditions”.

“It has also been decided to allow a person, who is required to file return due to fulfilment of one or more conditions specified in the seventh proviso to section 139 (1) of the Act, to file his/her return in ITR-1 Form,” it added.

The Government, which usually notifies forms for filing income tax returns by individuals in April every year, on January 3 notified tax return forms for assessment year 2020-21 (income earning year April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020).",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/tax-dept-rolls-back-order--allows-simple-forms-for-filing-returns-by-joint-property-owners.html

“While auctions should be held at the earliest, a lot of things need to be kept in mind. We need to look at whether 4G itself has been used to full capacity, and need to keep in mind that 5G standards haven’t been set,” PHDCCI Chairman (Telecom Committee) Sandeep Aggarwal said.

He added 5G spectrum may continue to be given since AGR and SUC will anyway be payable by the operators, and noted that further discussions on this with the stakeholders will be held during TEMA-PHDCCI’s ‘Telecom Summit 2020’. Aggarwal also emphasised that India should buy 5G technology and ensure local manufacturing through licensing as it would enable domestic telecom equipment manufacturing companies to develop and flourish.

5G trials in the country are widely expected to begin in this quarter. According to sources, the government has received applications for 5G trials and all operators and vendors (including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE and Samsung) are keen to participate.

PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) has also suggested setting up Telecom Finance Corporation that can provide domestic line of credit funding to telecom operators to procure domestic PMI-compliant equipment. The industry body, along with Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (TEMA), will host Telecom Summit 2020 on the theme ‘5G Technology:

The 30-share BSE Sensex opened on a strong footing and maintained its momentum throughout the session. It finally closed at 41,452.35, up 634.61 points, or 1.55 per cent.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty surged 190.55 points, or 1.58 per cent, to 12,215.90.

""It's a strategic partnership that we look to not for the next four to five years of an election cycle, but a long term relationship in which we must see a mutuality of benefits between the two countries, that have the same values, same shared principles and the same way of looking at how we'd like to see the rest of the world evolve,"" India's Ambassador to the US, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, said.

""In that one important aspect is the fact that we must look at ways to provide a policy framework and facilitation that could secure, a partnership and relationship on the economic side that is a sustainable in the long term,"" Shringla said at farewell in his honour by US Chambers of Commerce, and US India Business Council.

Shringla has been appointed as India's new Foreign Secretary and will leave for New Delhi next week. He has served as India's envoy to the US for about an year.

""We are happy that we are making very good progress on our trade package between our two sides. But, what we are really looking at is to engage in a long term framework under which our two countries can provide preferential or free market access to goods from each other's countries,"" Shringla said in his address to the members of the US corporate world having businesses in India.

Noting that there are a lot of complementarities in trade between the two countries, Shringla said they can open up windows that are exclusively for ""our companies and thereby take our trade"" figure from the current USD160 billion to double it, if the conditions are correct.

In her remarks, USIBC president, Nisha Desai Biswal, said that Shringla in a very short period of time became ""a very important fixture"" here in Washington DC, in the corridors of power in the policy conversations around the city and also across the country.

She said she has been struck with the tenacity and the enthusiasm with which Shringla approached his very broad and expansive mandate here in the United States in this role.

“I also want to acknowledge the fact that you have been, open, direct and ready to engage across the broad spectrum of constituencies of relationships that you manage. While your main counterparts have been in the administration, I have to say you've been equally active with governors and mayors, with members of the Congress, with business executives and with community leaders,” she said.

In about a year, Shringla visited 21 US states.

Ralph Voltmer, partner Covington and Burling and a USIBC Global Board of Directors said that Shringla has written extensively on conflict prevention and how to promote peace and prosperity among nations.

""Mr. Ambassador, your reflections on supporting an area of diplomacy are all the more relevant today as we sit here in Washington and see the potential for increased conflict,” he said.

The mood at the 27th edition of the South Asia Travel and Tourism Exchange (SATTE), a B2B travel trade engagement show, therefore, wasn’t quite upbeat. So how do political upheavals impact the travel and tourism in the country? Says Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director for Informa Markets, “Nobody wants this kind of uncertainty and violence. People wish to travel in peace and with conveniences. Most of all they cannot compromise with connectivity. Travelling is a recreational and aspirational activity. So you don’t want to go into turmoil. Having said that, India is resilient and has waded through crisis. And the travel and tourism industry is bound to become one of the growth engines of the economy.”

The three-day expo brought over 1,050 exhibitors, 200 foreign buyers from over 50+ countries and 500+ domestic hosted buyers from 104 Indian cities. Union Minister for State for Tourism and Culture Prahalad Singh Patel, who was the chief guest, shared India’s advantage in the tourism sector. “Ours is the only country that has a different cultural identity across dimensions and geography. A new experience is always awaited.”

EXPERIENTIAL BREAKS

Operators have zeroed in on a few trends that will shape the contours of the travel industry. “With millennials becoming new-age travellers, they are constantly on the lookout for off-beat experiences and are moving towards the short break concept,” says Yogesh.

Every year, different trends emerge in the travel and tourism industry, which cater to the desires of wanderers and Yogesh points out that the idea of experiential tourism is gaining popularity in the country. He says, “If a person has gone to a particular destination, s/he wants to enjoy a city exactly the way locals do. People don’t even mind spending but they wish to do it wisely and prioritise experiences. For instance, all Indians dream of taking that 15-day Europe tour in which they travel to seven countries at one go. However, later, the same people prefer travelling to each destination all over again just to experience them in a different way.”

SOCIAL MEDIA HOLIDAYS

A new twist to the trends has been added due to the rising craze of getting more insta-worthy shots. He adds, “People want to flaunt it all on social media and tell their followers what they are experiencing each day rather than travelling many destinations at one go. Which is why exploring all the nooks and corners of one city has been getting more traction.” Yogesh feels that if you give millennials a choice between buying a car or going on an overseas trip, they will anyday pick the latter.

“This has been the big change in the outlook of the people over the years because travel doesn’t just let them recreate but make their social media handles quirkier. It lends a new sense of conquest,” says he.

CRUISE TOURISM

One of the key dignitaries, Mansukh L Mandaviya, Minister of State for Shipping, points out how cruise tourism among Indians has become very popular. He says, “India’s coastline runs for 7,500 km, which offers immense potential for cruise tourism. Keeping this in mind, we have built international cruise terminals such as the one in Mumbai. A few in Goa, Mangalore, Kochi, Paradip and Kolkata are in the pipeline as the ministry and its stakeholders are continuously working to build the tourism sector.”

The cruise sector has witnessed double-digit growth in recent times. Vishal Suri, managing director of SOTC Travel, believes that this is not limited to just families or new couples as even millennials are opting for cruise holidays over other traditional vacation spots. “Given that cruises are becoming extremely stylised and offer multi-destination routes along with a range of amenities, including adventure activities, entertainment shows and authentic cuisines, they are sure to be included in more travel itineraries,” says he.

SIZE OF BUSINESS

Yogesh tells us that despite the current economic and political crackdown, the tourism industry still remains one of the fastest growing sectors in the country. The reason for this could be government initiatives like e-visa, which have helped in attracting various international tourists and boosted circuit travels.

Vishal points out some other travel trends to bleisure, which combines both travel for work or business and leisure. This is going to take the lead in 2020. “Today, Indian travellers place greater emphasis on viewing the world and they don’t want to let go of any opportunity for the same. With the newer generation of travellers stepping into the workplace and jet-setting off on work-related trips, they will be enterprising in their approach and make the most of their journey by ticking off another destination on their bucket list,” he says.

RETURN TO TRAVEL AGENTS

Yogesh believes that the travellers are getting more aware and want more customised and linked packages. They may be technology-savvy but cannot find their deal online. So they may want to use travel agents to understand a destination better and to map it their own way. He points out another shape-shifting arc for the year 2020. He says, “Do it yourself travel, in which you create your own itinerary that includes the things you most want to see and do, is growing rapidly.” Individualised and extremely local are the way to go.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-journey-goes-on-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-journey-goes-on.html
206,10-1-20,Trend Blazer,"I do not endorse violence: Sunny

Actor Sunny Leone took a neutral stance on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) violence by saying that she doesn’t want to comment on the anti-CAA protest and fee hike issue in JNU, adding that she is pro-peace and she hopes that all concerned parties will come out with a solution on the matter.

“I don’t want to share my opinion on an actual thing that people are fighting over. I feel there are many things that we can do if we put our foot down, speak to each other and stop the violence because it is something that our children will see and learn. Violence doesn’t affect just one person. It affects the entire family because it also emotionally hurt them. I am pro-peace and do not endorse violence” said Sunny.

‘I have always been very passionate about cricket. And when I was offered to host the show Zing Game On, there was no way I could turn it down as it brought me closer to two things I absolutely love. Talking to celebrated personalities from the world of cricket was like a golden opportunity knocking at my door. I feel blessed to be associated with the show.’

—Karan Wahi

Actor Sanjay Dutt came up with his first Marathi production titled Baba along with Maanyata Dutt and has received a great response from the audience.

Baba has now won big at three coveted national as well as international award ceremonies among a list of other projects.

The film won big at the 59th edition of the Asia Pacific Film Festival, Lifft India Awards 2019 and SAKAL premiere Awards 2019. Baba also got 12 nominations in different categories.

I feel empowered now: Selena

Singer Selena Gomez feels that there are perks of being single. “I love going to my room at the end of the day. Just me and my dog. I got the full granny panties situation, stretched out in my bed. I’ve been single for over two years now and I am okay with that,” Gomez said.

Her first new album in four years Rare, debuts today. The title track of the album, Lose You To Love Me was a major hit. Some have even speculated that it is about her former beau and singer Justin Bieber.

The album also touched how much Gomez has grown emotionally and the continual self-work she puts in. “I had low self-esteem and that’s something I work on continuously. But I feel so empowered because I’ve gained a lot of knowledge about what I was going through mentally,” said she.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-01-10.html
207,10-1-20,Tanushree questions silence of male superstars,"Bollywood actor Tanushree Dutta has slammed Bollywood heroes who refuse to take a stand on the ongoing unrest at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), calling them “eunuchs.”

Taking a dig at male stars who have refrained from commenting on the ongoing issue that threatens to boil over, Tanushree said, “Men in Bollywood only know how to gang up against women and youngsters, take away their work and livelihood, and throw insults at them. They don’t know how to stand with women and young people and support them for justice. Don’t expect much from these muscle men. All their machismo is only for the show and box-office ticket sales. They are more like eunuchs in real life. In fact, I think they have more male integrity than our Bollywood heroes.”

Incidentally, at a time when several Bollywood A-listers including Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu and Richa Chadha have condemned the attacks on JNU students, Bollywood’s biggest superstars — Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, and Akshay Kumar — have chosen to stay silent.

Not just about Sunday’s attack on the institutes students, the industry’s male superstars have also kept quiet on the issues of the CAA and NRC that have generated nationwide protests and debate. They have also stayed silent on the recent incidents of police crackdown on the students of universities such as Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University.

Why are our superstars silent? Is it because SRK and Aamir faced severe flak for their honest “intolerance” comments a few years back? Has Akshay Kumar become wary after recently being trolled for liking a tweet video that mocked the attack on Jamia? Does Salman fear that opening up on a political issue right now might affect the box office business of his latest release Dabangg 3, which is currently running in the halls?

Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan is normally known to stay away from political debate of any kind. This time, too, he has stayed away from all the storm. Recently, he posted a cryptic tweet of a folded hands emoji, when a section of social media asked him to react.

Many insiders in the trade, however, are of the opinion that a lot of the show of support by Bollywood is nothing but publicity stunt. Senior trade analyst Amod Mehra said, “All those who are courting the limelight are either there to promote their film or to gain publicity, like Anurag Kashyap. Also, there are the likes of Farhan Akhtar, who are the so-called pseudo-intellectuals.”

Taking an obvious dig at Deepika Padukone without mentioning her name, Mehra added: “You can share your personal views on social media. Why make an issue of it? Because you want publicity for your film Chhapaak? Why didn’t you meet Nirbhaya’s parents in Delhi? Because that will not make news now. Everybody wants name and fame. Today there is so much commercialisation that people have forgotten that there is something called humanity, too.”

Mehra also shared his views on why megastar Amitabh Bachchan and superstar Shah Rukh are silent. He said, “If any film of Amitabh Bachchan were to release today, he would have said something. Shah Rukh is not speaking because he has no films.”

Deepika’s solidarity gesture — of visiting JNU while she was in Delhi to promote Chhapaak — has left the Twitterati divided. While some lauded her for standing with the students, others criticised her action as a cheap publicity stunt to bring her film which releases on Friday, into the limelight.

Still, many on social media have expressed the opinion that they want their biggest male superstars to break their silence, especially, at a time when the country is witnessing a political turmoil. In a nation where worshipping male superstars as demigods is the norm, the silence of Bollywood’s top voices is surely deafening!",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tanushree-questions-silence-of-male-superstars-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/tanushree-questions-silence-of-male-superstars.html
208,10-1-20,A sensorial journey,"Ophelia, The Ashok’s latest offering, takes you on a culinary expedition where you eat not just with your palate but eyes, nose and skin. By Saimi Sattar

The entire experience is sensory — where you eat not just with tongue but as a wholesome experience with your eyes, skin and nose. But the journey at Ophelia, the Mediterranean-European tapas bar, at The Ashok does not begin with the food but the ambience. The restaurant has two segments — an outdoor one and another indoors. The night that we visited was particularly chilly. So we decided to sit inside even though the outdoors looked welcoming.

Stepping in, our senses were aflush. It was The Great Gatsby meets Renaissance meets kitsch. In short, decadent and wonderfully so. The reds, browns, blues on the walls and the furnishings enhanced the description further. Tracing the lights of a massive chandelier that hung above us, my gaze was enamoured by the ceiling. Paintings were splashed across covering it partially where men nattily dressed in breeches hinted at an era gone by but donning sunglasses that are as contemporary as they get. Then, there were portraits on the walls, some with gashes and others with some portion left out. And it is here that the relevance of the restaurant being named after Ophelia from Shakespeare’s famous play, Hamlet comes to the fore. The lady in question has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture, which the pictures hint at.

But enough about the restaurant’s ambience as there were other important things to focus on, like food. Here again, the play with vision was what the restaurant centered itself around. First up was Chicken veloute capellini pasta soup. I know you must be wondering as to how can it be something to be fire the vision with wonder for after all a soup, is a soup and nothing more. But this concoction was brought together with its disparate elements and assembled together on the table itself. The pasta, curled up in a ball was placed at the centre of the bowl on the side of which was a generous spoonful of cooked chicken mash. The broth followed in a separate separate kettle and was poured into the bowl. One could see the the lump of chicken gradually dissolve in the liquid as the pasta too uncurled, not much, just a hint. A sip of its nutty, mushroom-chicken flavour which was perfect without overpowering the senses was just what the doctor would have ordered on a cold, wintry evening. The pasta gave the creamy concoction a bit of a bite. Needless to say, I wiped the entire melange clean.

Next up was the Duck pâté, orange glaze. cocoa soil, beetroot jam and thick toast. The server informed us that this was one of their hot sellers with the regular customers ordering it frequently. One bite into it and we could see the reason why. The pâté, rolled into a ball, was ground into smoothness, looked like an orange on account of the glaze covering it which gave it tartness. The beetroot jam on the side balanced it out with its sweetness making it perfect.

Alongside, we were served drinks. My companion ordered a Hamlet. The way it was served again grabbed eyeballs. A bound Hamlet was placed in front of her. On opening the cover a cavity inside contained a small steel flask with the drink which was pored out with a flourish. I took a mocktail, Ophelia Love, which had flavours of spices and guava. Here again, optics scored. It arrived inside an inverted bell jar which was filled with nitrogen. Opening it dissipated the blur to reveal the mirage of a drink.

By the time that we finished the pâté, the tables around us had started to fill up and we could see that a massive Mezze platter, which could clearly be shared among people had found favour. One made its way to our table as well. It had Lamb adana (a Turkish seekh kebab), chicken roast, an assortment of dips and Chicken pide (a bread, the insides of which are layered with a delicious chicken mixture and is something akin to the garlic bread, which Domino’s, the pizza dial up serves, in appearance). While I found the adana a little tough given my penchant for melt-in-the-mouth kebabs whether of the shami or seekh variety, the pide was a revelation. I broke off a piece and then another and then some more — you get the drift. The chicken inside was tender and flavourful while the bread in which it had been encased, piping hot. Certainly, one which could make for a wholesome snack when you are feeling peckish but don’t want to go the whole hog. But this was not the only highlight of the platter. The six dips, of which I liked the Muhammara, with its red pepper and walnuts, enhanced the flavours of the portions further.

We were quite full but the Beetroot risotto, confit beetroot, mascarpone and crackers followed. We did eat a spoonful but perhaps would have been able to do better justice to the dish if we weren’t full till the gills.

But after everything there is room for dessert. Always. We were served two — Chocolate mushroom, Belgian praline and Apple crumble cheesecake, candied walnuts, grapes, sorbet. The first one, shaped like a mushroom could be eaten in entirety including the stem of the fungus and was attractive but usual. However, I preferred the latter with its mix of smooth cheesecake and slightly crunchy crumble. A perfect end to an immensely satisfying meal.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-sensorial-journey-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-sensorial-journey.html
209,10-1-20,They deserve a spot,"Food expert Katie Workman suggests some must-have tools and gadgets for the modern kitchen

I love a shiny new kitchen object as much as the next cook, and at times my kitchen has resembled a kitchen specialty store. But if you have a small kitchen, counter space and cabinet storage are at a premium.

Here are some of my all-time favourite gadgets to make your cooking life better. I am skipping the bigger appliances like slow cookers and air fryers. I am also skipping knives, cutting boards, pots and pans, measuring cups and the like, because you pretty much know you need those.

This is about great gadgets, both low- and high-tech that deserve a spot in your kitchen because they work hard and smart.

Perfect peeler

I use a peeler pretty much every day for something. Potatoes, carrots, apples, winter squash, etc. I am a fan of Kuhn Rikon peelers, which are lightweight and easy to use on peels thick and thin. OXO also make an assortment with different blades, shapes and widths.

Peppermill

Nothing is more important in the kitchen than salt and pepper, and freshly-ground pepper is much better than pre-ground. The Peppermate Traditional Pepper Mill is sleek and contemporary-looking, made of ceramic with a side crank. It has a removable, clear bottom cup under the grinder to catch the pepper, and an adjustable grinding size, from very fine (for most things) to very coarse (for things like steak au poivre). For a more classic look, Peugeot makes high-quality mills.

Mandoline

It’s hard to get perfectly thin slices for most of us home cooks even with a good knife. But with a mandoline, you can get even slices of all sorts of vegetables and other ingredients. One example is the OXO Good Grips Hand-Held version, which comes with settings for three different thin-nesses and a handle so you can slice safely and quickly into a bowl or over a plate.

Food preocessor

I use no appliance more than this one. I use it for pureeing, chopping, slicing and shredding. Cuisinart has long been my go-to brand; I grew up with one and now own half a dozen. Other companies, like KitchenAid and Breville, also make good food processors. Sizes range from quite large (14 or 16-cup bowls) to mini (about two cups). I recommend one little one, for things like mincing garlic or making pesto, and one large, for everything else.

Microplane

One of those products where the brand name has become synonymous with the thing itself even though other manufacturers make similar items. This is basically a small, handheld grater. The most classic one is long and narrow with a lot of fine blades that turn lemon zest and hard grating cheese and chocolate into fluffy mounds of delicate tiny shreds. You can also get versions that grate food into larger strands.

Instant-read thermometer

There are many versions of it in the market from digital to analog to Bluetooth to infrared. When you want to make sure that you are not overcooking a roast meat or that your bread is cooked through, an instant-read thermometer is indispensable. (You’ll justify the cost quickly when you consider how much you spent on that holiday filet) In the most user-friendly digital arena, Thermapen instant thermometers are fast and precise with a wide temperature range.

Immersion blender

I love my blender and food processor but if you’ve ever tried to transfer a pot of hot, chunky soup to a blender, then you understand why an immersion blender is such an asset. Instead of pouring, just place the immersion blender right into the pot. You can even stick the wand into a can of whole tomatoes and puree them right there. There are loads of good ones in the market from companies like Breville, All-Clad, Braun and Philips.

Wine opener

If you’re not a wine drinker, then obviously this isn’t a go-to gadget. But if you are, investing in a nice one makes opening a bottle a real pleasure. Williams Sonoma makes a great assortment including classic winged corkscrews and easy-to-use lever corkscrews. Rabbit is an another reliable name in the wine-opener world and you might splurge on a Pro Electric Corkscrew with an Infrared Thermometer for the true oenophile in your life.

Sous vide

If you have been curious about sous vide (and many people are), then now is a good time to try this latest-technology gadget. There are a lot of options out there at pretty reasonable prices. Sous vide is a cooking method that entails putting food in a vacuum-sealed bag and cooking it in water at a controlled temperature. It’s basically impossible to overcook it. The Joule Sous Vide is small compared to other sous vide appliances but powerful as well as sleek and attractive enough to leave out. It works with phone apps as well for the ultimate in modern cooking.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/they-deserve-a-spot-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/they-deserve-a-spot.html

211,10-1-20,India face selection dilemma ahead of 3rd T20,"To go with a winning combination or give much needed game time to Sanju Samson and Manish Pandey? That is the dilemma India are facing ahead of the third and final T20 against Sri Lanka here at MCA stadium today.

An inexperienced Sri Lanka was no match for India in Indore and considering that, a case could be made for the inclusion of Pandey and Samson.

Pandey has played just one in the last three series, including the current one, while Samson is yet to get a game since he made a comeback with the Bangladesh series in November.

India have been experimenting ahead of the T20 World Cup in October-November but these two players are yet to be tested.

On the other hand, the absence of senior pacers has opened the doors for Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini to make an impression, which they did in the previous game by sharing five wickets among themselves.

Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube, who took the injured Hardik Pandya’s place, have got significant opportunities to show what they are capable of.

After the win in Indore, skipper Virat Kohli spoke on how his team is getting better with each passing game.

Most of the players select themselves while he hinted that someone like a Prasidh Krishna could be the surprise package he is looking for the mega event in Australia.

Samson and Pandey must be a tad frustrated to sit out game after game but today could be their day. However, what can also not be discounted is the fact that the team management will pick the eleven with the sole aim of winning the series.

Focus will also be on Shikhar Dhawan, who is competing for the second opener’s slot alongside K L Rahul. At the moment, Rahul seems ahead in the race to partner Rohit Sharma in Australia.

Jasprit Bumrah did not have the best of outings in his comeback game on Tuesday and he will be raring to go full tilt in the final game.

If he gets to bat, Dube will have do something spectacular to retain his place in side after Pandya returns to action.

Thakur and Saini were impressive in Indore. Thakur was brilliant in the death overs while Saini rattled the batsmen with pace and bounce.

With Sri Lanka having several left-handers, spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-38) and Washington Sundar (1-29) are likely well retain their place, which effectively means that Ravindra Jadeja and Yuzvendra Chahal will have to sit out.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have a lot to work on if they are to trouble the home team. The batsmen will have to make it count after getting starts, which they were not able to do in the second T20.

All-rounder Isuru Udana being ruled out of the game is also a setback. Their main bowler, as put by skipper Lasith Malinga, did not bowl in Indore after injuring himself during warm-up.

The Sri Lankans can definitely do with some experience in the batting department.

Angelo Matthews, who has made a T20 comeback after 16 months, was not picked for the second game in a row. But he could be in the eleven today.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-face-selection-dilemma-ahead-of-3rd-t20.html

215,10-1-20,"Impeachment standoff deepens, testing McConnell and Pelosi","The standoff over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial deepened on Wednesday as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there will be “no haggling” with Democrats as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demands for more details and witnesses.

McConnell’s Senate majority has the leverage Republicans need to launch Trump’s trial toward swift acquittal of the charges, but Pelosi’s reluctance to transmit the articles of impeachment leaves the proceedings at a standstill.

What started as a seemingly minor delay over process and procedures is now a high-stakes showdown between two skilled leaders facing off over the rare impeachment trial, only the third in the nation’s history.

“There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure,” said McConnell, R-Ky., who met later Wednesday with Trump at the White House. “We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. The House Democrats’ turn is over.”

Three weeks have passed since the House impeached Trump on the charge that he abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine’s new leader to investigate Democrats, using as leverage $400 million in military assistance for the US Ally as it counters Russia at its border. Trump insists he did nothing wrong, but his defiance of the House Democrats’ investigation led to an additional charge of obstruction of Congress. Senators from both sides are eager to serve as jurors for Trump’s day in court. The trial will be conducted in the Senate, where Republicans have a thin majority. But even as McConnell spoke from the Senate floor, Pelosi, D-Calif., was giving no indication of her willingness to agree to his terms. In a closed-door meeting with the House Democratic caucus, she spoke instead about the crisis in the Middle East, with Iran’s retaliatory ballistic missile attacks on US Bases in Iraq, according to several Democrats in the room.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/impeachment-standoff-deepens--testing-mcconnell-and-pelosi.html
216,10-1-20,US officials: ‘Highly likely’ Iran downed Ukrainian jetliner,"US officials said on Thursday it was “highly likely” that an Iranian anti-aircraft missile downed a Ukrainian jetliner late Tuesday, killing all 176 people on board. They suggested it could well have been a mistake.

The crash came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops amid a confrontation with Washington over the U.S. drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general last week. Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, said they had no certain knowledge of Iranian intent. But they said the airliner could have been mistaken for a threat.

President Donald Trump suggested he believed Iran was responsible for the shootdown but wouldn’t directly blame the Iranians. He dismissed Iran’s initial claim that it was a mechanical issue.

“Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.” Trump said, noting the plane was flying in a “pretty rough neighborhood.”

“Some people say it was mechanical,” Trump added. “I personally don’t think that’s even a question.”

The U.S. officials wouldn’t say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.

A third U.S. official said the intelligence pointing to likely Iranian responsibility became clearer overnight into Thursday.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-officials-----highly-likely----iran-downed-ukrainian-jetliner.html
217,10-1-20,British lawmakers finally approve historic Brexit deal,"Britain’s parliament finally approved Brexit on Thursday, allowing it to become the first country to leave the European Union by the end of this month, ending years of arguments that toppled two Governments and divided a nation.

The House of Commons erupted in cheers after MPs ratified Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s divorce deal with Brussels 330 votes to 231, drawing a line under an extraordinary era of political drama and chaos. For much of the time since the 2016 Brexit referendum, lawmakers have been at each others’ throats over how, when or even if Britain should leave its closest trading partners after nearly 50 years.

Some viewed Brexit with horror, fearing that it stripped them of their European identities and turned Britain into an insular, less important nation.

Others embraced it with fervour, viewing it as a chance to “take back control” from officials in Brussels and see Britain regain some of its past might.

Businesses and Governments in Europe, puzzled by Britain’s struggles over what they viewed as a self-inflicted wound, hoped that Brexit could still somehow be undone. But Johnson’s comprehensive victory in last month’s general election brought an abrupt end to the turmoil, giving his Conservatives a parliamentary majority with which to push it through.

MPs gave their initial blessing to the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill before Christmas, and the government set aside just three days this week for detailed scrutiny of the complex text. But few MPs even bothered to turn up on Tuesday and Wednesday, with both sessions ending early, while the Government easily saw off Opposition attempts to amend the text.

The momentous day on which Johnson effectively gets permission to abandon the European integration project was all but ignored in Thursday’s media.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/british-lawmakers-finally-approve-historic-brexit-deal.html
218,10-1-20,"Missile, technical malfunction among Iran crash leads: Ukraine","Investigators are pursuing several leads following the crash of a Ukrainian passenger plane in Iran, including a surface-to-air missile strike, an act of terror and engine failure, a Ukrainian security official said on Thursday.

The Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Boeing went down outside Tehran shortly after take-off on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board.

“For the moment we are working on seven different versions of the event that took place in Iran,” Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council (RNBO), told AFP.

The council is tasked with coordinating the probe into the disaster, the first fatal crash involving Ukraine’s biggest carrier UIA.

Danilov also said on Facebook that the leads being studied include both technical malfunctions and foul play, but told AFP that “there is no priority version” yet.

The leads under consideration include a collision with another airborne object, a rocket from Iran’s missile defence system, an engine explosion caused by a technical problem, and an explosion on board the aircraft due to an “act of terror”, he said on Facebook.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/missile--technical-malfunction-among-iran-crash-leads--ukraine.html
219,10-1-20,Kuldeep to work on new variations,"Admitting that 2019 was a “tough year” for him, Indian left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav on Thursday said he has learnt from his mistakes and will work on more variations to surprise the batsmen, who seem to have decoded him.

In 2019, the 25-year-old Kuldeep’s India appearances were few and far apart and his stint with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League was also lacklustre.

“It (2019) was a tough one. I learned a lot of things and the biggest positive was getting to know that I could have planned things better,” Kuldeep told reporters on the eve of the third T20.

“If I thought more and gave more time to myself, I could have performed better. In 2020, I will try to plan every game better and give myself more time...You have to give yourself more time to plan for the next game. I want to be more mentally prepared this year,” the Chinaman elaborated.

So what will he do to get better?

“I will definitely take the help of video analysts and speak to the bowling coach (Bharat Arun) in the nets, where we can figure out the strengths and weakness of various batsmen and also to know how he (the batsman) bats on the ground.

“Now everyone knows how Kuldeep bowls. He is a chinaman, who has wrong-uns, flippers. I have to bring changes in my bowling, which the batsman cannot figure out,” he added.

Kuldeep praised the Indian pace bowling attack, saying their performances ensure that the spinners are able to try different things.

“...There is lesser load on spinners. Even in the last match (in Indore), when I came to bowl it was already 10 overs and the way they (pacers) bowled, spinners can take a chance to do something different,” said the bowler, who has 39 wickets from 21 T20s.

“Sometimes it happens that the fast bowlers give too many runs and you have to bowl defensively. This is a great opportunity that the spinners have (to try various things) since pacers are doing so well,” added the Kanpur-born spinner.

Asked if he focusses on taking wickets or being restrictive in T20s, Kuldeep said, “If a wicket falls for the opposition, you sometimes try to contain them. And if there is a partnership going on, I feel like I should push for a wicket and stop runs.

“Whenever I am bowling and there is a set batsman, I try to take a chance and get their wicket to put pressure on the opposition. And at the same time, I try to contain. Whenever we are defending a total, I focus more on containing,” he stressed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kuldeep-to-work-on-new-variations.html
220,10-1-20,Real Madrid through to Super Cup decider,"Toni Kroos scored a wonder goal straight from a corner as Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-1 on Wednesday to reach the final of the controversial Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Kroos caught Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech napping with a brilliant, instinctive strike before Isco made it two and Luka Modric added a classy third from a curling finish with the outside of his foot.

After two superb goals, the only shame was more fans were not there to see them given the King Abdullah Sports City stadium appeared only a little more than half full.

The official attendance was given as 40,877 out of a capacity of 62,345.

Dani Parejo scored a late Valencia penalty but Madrid advance to Sunday’s final where they will meet the winner of second semi-final between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.

“I’m happy with the whole performance,” said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane.

“For the goal of Isco, because maybe he needed that, the genius of Kroos and then something that only Modric can do. But it is a semi-final, we haven’t won anything yet.”

Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had said earlier said that he preferred the traditional format of this competition, that pitted the La Liga champions against the winners of the Copa del Rey in a match in Spain in August.

Under those rules, Real Madrid, who finished third in the league last term and failed to reach the final of the cup would not even have qualified but they now have the chance to win their first trophy of the season, possibly against Barca in a Clasico final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/real-madrid-through-to-super-cup-decider.html
221,10-1-20,"Saina, Sindhu enter Malaysia quarters","Saina Nehwal and reigning world champion P V Sindhu produced dominating performances to progress to the women’s singles quarterfinals of the Malaysia Masters Super 500 badminton tournament here on Thursday.

Sixth seed Sindhu notched up a commanding 21-10, 21-15 victory over Japan’s Aya Ohori in a pre-quarterfinal match lasting just 34 minutes. It was Sindhu’s ninth successive win over Ohori.

The 24-year-old Indian now will take on world number 1 Tai Tzu Ying in the quarterfinals after the Chinese Taipei shuttler got the better of South Korea’s Sung Ji Hyun 21-18, 16-21, 21-10.

Saina, who had won the Indonesia Masters last year before going through a rough patch, dispatched eight seed An Se Young of South Korea 25-23, 21-12 after a thrilling 39-minute contest to make the last eight.

This is Saina’s first win over the South Korean, who got the better of the Indian in the quarterfinals of the French Open last year.

The two-time Commonwealth Games champion will next take on Olympic champion Carolina Marin.

In the men’s singles, India’s challenge ended after both Sameer Verma and H S Prannoy crashed out in the second round.

222,10-1-20,Iheanacho denies Villa party,"Brendan Rodgers warned Leicester will have to suffer to reach the League Cup final after Kelechi Iheanacho’s late goal earned a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa on Wednesday.

Rodgers’ side fell behind to Frederic Guilbert’s first half goal in the semi-final first leg at the King Power Stadium.

But Iheanacho came off the bench to equalise with his sixth goal in eight appearances this season.

Leicester will feel they should have won after dominating for long periods, but the team in second place in the Premier League will have to finish the job at Villa Park in the second leg on January 28.

“Overall I thought we dominated the game. Villa made some blocks and the keeper made some good saves,” Rodgers said. “Over two ties it was always going to be tough and to get to a final you have to suffer, but the boys are confident.”

Rodgers has a remarkable record of advancing from his last 30 domestic cup ties with Liverpool, Celtic and Leicester.

But the last team to beat Rodgers in a domestic knockout competition were Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals in 2014-15 when he was Liverpool manager.

And Villa, whose last major trophy was the 1996 League Cup, will feel they are in pole position to reach the final after surviving a stern examination.

The second leg winner will play Manchester City or Manchester United in the final at Wembley, with City leading 3-1 after their first leg at Old Trafford on Tuesday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/iheanacho-denies-villa-party.html
223,10-1-20,PSG hit Saint-Etienne with 6,"Mauro Icardi scored a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain demolished a depleted Saint-Etienne 6-1 on Wednesday to power into the semi-finals of the French League Cup.

Icardi struck the opening goal inside two minutes at the Parc des Princes before teenage Saint-Etienne defender Wesley Fofana was dismissed for a second booking on the half-hour.

PSG ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage as coach Thomas Tuchel elected to field all four members of his fearsome attacking quartet — Icardi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria — against a side decimated by injury and illness.

“I am convinced that Icardi and Mbappe love to play together,” said Tuchel. “We talk about the four attackers but we are a team with 11 players. Neymar, for example, helps Juan Bernat.

“That’s the sort of spirit which we need to be dangerous. We have the best players but we also have the best team.”

Neymar doubled the lead with a nonchalant chipped finish over goalkeeper Jessy Moulin, who scored a comical own goal on the stroke of half-time. Di Maria’s low cross was hacked by Timothee Kolodziejczak into the legs of team-mate Loic Perrin, the ball rolling back off the post before hitting Moulin and trickling over the line.

The hosts bagged a fourth when Mbappe rounded Moulin and cut back for Icardi to add to his tally, and he completed his hat-trick when the former raced clear before selflessly presenting the Argentine with a tap-in.

The pair reversed roles for the sixth goal, Icardi controlling superbly and sliding across goal for a lunging Mbappe to turn home from close range.

224,10-1-20,‘It’s not time to make waves': Mbappe on new PSG contract,"French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe brushed aside questions about his future at Paris Saint-Germain when he said “it’s not the time to make waves” over contract talks.

The 21-year-old striker, long linked with a move to Real Madrid, insisted his mind was only on helping PSG defend their Ligue 1 title and chase an elusive Champions League triumph.

“For now, I am ready to play football,” Mbappe said after scoring in his team’s 6-1 rout of St Etienne

“It is January, it’s the start of the final sprint where there are titles to play for. Therefore it’s not the moment to make waves.” Mbappe has a deal at PSG which runs until 2022.

“The club is calm and serene, everyone is pulling in the same direction, so talking about things that are off the pitch is not very realistic and not very beneficial for the team,” added Mbappe who now has 19 goals for the season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---it---s-not-time-to-make-waves---mbappe-on-new-psg-contract.html
225,10-1-20,Serena extends perfect start,"Williams recovers after dropping first set to beat McHale and enter Auckland quarters

Serena Williams rallied from a set down to beat journeywoman Christina McHale at the WTA Auckland Classic on Thursday, and said it was just the workout she needed.

With her focus on winning a 24th Grand Slam at the Australian Open, Williams said she needs all the court time she can get after a long off-season since losing September’s US Open final.

It took the top seed two hours to put away the 27-year-old McHale and advance to a quarter-final with Germany’s Laura Siegemund, who ousted teen prodigy Coco Gauff in the second round.

Williams was broken three times before losing the first set 3-6 but recovered to take the next two sets 6-2, 6-3 in the all-American affair.

“I really need to play matches like that to get to my goals,” said Williams, who is determined to equal the record of 24 Grand Slams held by Australian great Margaret Court.

“Tournament time is super-important, match time is good. After losing that first set I’m just glad to be still in the event.”

It was the reverse from Gauff, seen as one of the rising stars of tennis, who started strongly against Siegemund but faded as the match wore on.

The 31-year-old Siegemund, who played her first WTA qualifier in 2003 before Gauff was born, was up 5-4 and serving when the American teen broke twice to take the first set.

But from there, she used her considerable experience to ruffle the 15-year-old, forcing her behind the baseline and then drawing her forward with deft drop shots.

Against Siegemund, she finished with seven double faults and 49 unforced errors, which she put down to youth and inexperience.

“I’m still learning and that’s the problem that I have,” Gauff said.

“I didn’t play the right way and if I lost playing the right way it would have been fine, but I don’t think I was playing the right way.”

Defending champion Julia Goerges cruised through to the final eight with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Jil Teichmann.

226,10-1-20,Rising Australia star Labuschagne aspires to emulate Virat as top performer in all formats,"In-form Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne says he considers the upcoming ODI series against India a big opportunity in his quest to emulate Virat Kohli and Steve Smith across all formats.

The 22-year-old right-handed batsman scored back-to-back Test centuries against Pakistan and another ton and a double hundred against New Zealand in the summer before embarking on the ODI tour of India where he will find out whether he makes his shorter-format debut or not.

Labuschagne, who can be handy with his leg-breaks, says long-term consistency across formats would be his major goals for the future.

""You look at the guys I look up to and aspire to -- Steve Smith, Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson, Joe Root. They've been doing it for a very long time, five, six years they've been consistent, not just in one format, but two or more formats,"" Labuschagne was quoted as saying by 'ESPNCricinfo'.

Australia will play a three-match ODI series against India starting January 14 in Mumbai. The team landed in the country on Thursday night.

""...I've had some success this summer but the real challenge for me is to be more consistent going on and being able to keep putting continued performances on the board. If I can continue to do that, then that's obviously going to be the challenge for me,"" said Labuschagne who has scored 1459 runs from 14 Tests.

Having got his first chance to be in the white ball squad, he said the one-day series in India would be an opportunity to show a slightly different aspect of his game.

""...That's a really exciting challenge too. It's going to be tough conditions in India and they're obviously a very strong side. So just about enjoying the challenge and not getting too far ahead of yourself, taking it ball by ball and game by game,"" he said.

""A big part of playing in India is how you play spin, so for me being clear with my plans about how I play spin and then just trusting the processes I have.

""Batting in the middle order it's about running really hard between wickets and trying to get those runs through the middle, then when you get the opportunity towards the back end to open the shoulders a bit.""

Labuschagne said would like to follow the path of former Australia batsman Michael Hussey as far as adapting to different conditions is concerned.

""With the opportunities that might come in the next few months, we'll have to see, but definitely Michael Hussey is a great person to learn from,"" Labuschagne said.

""The way he played the one-day game, the way he finished off the innings and the way he probably started his innings. There are a few similarities there, but I'm definitely not comparing myself to Michael Hussey.""

If he gets a chance to make his ODI debut in India, Labuschagne may play a somewhat different role than his preferred No.3 spot.

With Aaron Finch, David Warner and Smith seemingly confirmed for the top order, Labuschagne, Peter Handscomb, Alex Carey and Ashton Turner may be tried in the remaining spots.

""Whatever role I'm given is one I'm going to try and keep. If that's batting in the top four or even outside the top four, whatever that is.

""The whole one-day game's moved in that more aggressive, positive direction, but I've been lucky I've been able to move with that and play in this era where one-day cricket is a really high scoring game.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rising-australia-star-labuschagne-aspires-to-emulate-virat-as-top-performer-in-all-formats-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rising-australia-star-labuschagne-aspires-to-emulate-virat-as-top-performer-in-all-formats.html
227,10-1-20,‘Dhoni may end his ODI career soon’,"Two-time World Cup winning India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may “soon end his ODI career”, head coach Ravi Shastri has revealed.

“I have had a conversation with MS and that is between us. He has finished his Test career, he may soon end his ODI career... In all probability, he will finish one-day cricket,” Shastri told CNN News18.

“People must respect that he’s played non-stop in all formats of the game for a while.

“At his age, probably the only format he’ll want to play is T20 cricket which means he’ll have to start playing again, get back into the groove because he’s going to play in the IPL and see how his body reacts.”

The coach reiterated that the 38-year-old veteran could still be a contender for the T20 World Cup if he does well in the upcoming Indian Premier League.

“... So he will be left with T20, he will definitely play the IPL. One thing I know about Dhoni is that he will not impose himself on the team. But if he has a cracking IPL, well, then...”

Shastri said form and experience will be taken into consideration while picking the team for the shortest format’s biggest event.

“We will have to consider the person’s experience and form. They will bat in the number 5-6 position. If Dhoni plays well in the IPL then he does put himself in contention.”

Dhoni, who is on a sabbatical right now, has turned up for the country in 350 ODIs, 90 Tests and 98 T20 Internationals while effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---dhoni-may-end-his-odi-career-soon---.html
228,10-1-20,We’re ready for India: Finch,"The sub-continent can make visiting players doubt their abilities, Australia captain Aaron Finch said on Thursday as he and his team headed to India for a three-match ODI series, aiming to upstage Virat Kohli’s on-song team in its own backyard.

Australia scripted an unexpected comeback to win the five-match ODI series 3-2 in India 12 months ago after losing the first two games. The upcoming series starts January 14 in Mumbai.

“It just gives us confidence that our game plan in those conditions is good enough,” Finch told cricket.Com.Au ahead of the team’s departure when asked about the series win in India last year.

“What can happen when you play in the sub-continent is you start to doubt your game plan because they’re so dominant when they get on top. India or Pakistan... Or Sri Lanka. They can make you start doubting yourself.

“Knowing that our game plan is good enough and knowing that our skills are good enough to beat India in India. That gives us a lot of confidence going there,” said Australia’s limited overs skipper.

The in-form Marnus Labuschagne is set to make his ODI debut against India after earning a maiden call-up at the back of his stellar form in Tests.

Finch feels there is no reason why Labuschagne cannot carry his Test form into white-ball cricket.

“We know that he’s not going to be overawed by the occasion. He’s come back into Test cricket after missing out at the start of the Ashes and he’s been unbelievable, so hopefully he can continue that.

“The form that he showed in the (Marsh Cup) one-day games was outstanding. He’s averaging up around 40 there batting at three, batting at four for Queensland on what’s been a little bit tougher batting conditions over the last couple of years in domestic cricket.”

Labuschagne is good against spinners and that will help him in India, said Finch.

Australia made a lot of changes to the ODI squad, leaving out experienced hands like Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Usman Khawaja and Nathan Lyon. Finch backed all of them to make a comeback.

“It’s never closed, but when you’re picking a side there has to be a spot there. It just comes down to being in the right place at the right time and having the right match-up,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we---re-ready-for-india--finch.html

“James Anderson has been ruled out of the remainder of the Test series against South Africa after sustaining a left rib injury in England’s second Test victory at Newlands,” an ECB statement said.

“Anderson felt tightness and discomfort at the end of the morning session on day five and was only able to bowl eight overs during the day. He will return to the UK in the next few days.”

American qualifier Jennifer Brady notched up her first-ever win over a top-10 player when she beat Barty 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) at the Pat Rafter Arena.

Barty conceded afterwards she had simply been outplayed by Brady, who also beat former world number one Maria Sharapova in the first round.

Brady will now play two-time Wimbledon champion Czech Republic’s Petra Kvitova, who beat Russian qualifier Liudmila Samsonova 6-3, 6-2.

232,10-1-20,"Aus, Russia storm into ATP Cup semis","A dynamic Nick Kyrgios and dogged Alex de Minaur powered Australia into the ATP Cup semi-finals on Thursday with an epic 2-1 win against the Tim Henman-led Britain, and they were joined by Russia who overpowered Argentina.

The home team clinched the tie after an 18-16 third-set tiebreaker in the doubles to set up a potential blockbuster last-four clash against Rafael Nadal’s Davis Cup-winning Spain who face Belgium today.

Russia, spearheaded by world number five Daniil Medvedev won both their singles to sweep past Argentina.

Their reward is a semi-final against either Novak Djokovic’s Serbia, or Canada.

Kyrgios crushed Cameron Norrie in the opening singles 6-2, 6-2 before Dan Evans came through a memorable showdown against De Minaur 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-6 (7/2) to set up the decisive, winner-takes-all doubles.

Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt took a huge gamble by dropping regular doubles pair John Peers and Chris Guccione in favour of Kyrgios and de Minaur, and it looked a poor decision when they lost the first set 6-3.

But, spurred by Kyrgios’ booming serve, they took the next 6-3 before a nailbiting tiebreaker that lasted more than half-an-hour.

Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury had four match points, which were all saved, with Australia finally converting on their fifth match point, sparking jubilant scenes.

“That was incredible tennis. All three matches today everyone gave 100 percent and left it all out on the court,” said Hewitt.

“Really proud of the boys, the way they were able to turn it around... it could have gone either way.”

In the second quarter-final, Karen Khachanov continued his hot run of form and got the ball rolling for Russia by beating an out-of-sorts Guido Pella 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).

The world number 17 has won all four of his matches this season and was in control throughout against the Argentinian, who appeared on the verge on tears in the opening set.

Medvedev, also unbeaten, quickly took charge of his showdown with world number 13 Diego Schwartzman, but lost focus in the second and was slapped with a point penalty for twice smashing his racquet into the umpires chair during an argument with the official.

He regrouped to race through the third set for a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win.

Rodgers said Ndidi suffered an injury in Tuesday's training session and may face an operation, although he did not specify what the problem is. “Wilf took a knock in training yesterday, which unfortunately means he might need a slight operation tomorrow,” Rodgers said. “That'll put him out for a few weeks, but it's not overly serious, so hopefully, going into February, he'll be fit and ready to go again.”

234,10-1-20,Serena donates signed dress to Australian bushfire appeal,"A signed dress worn by Serena Williams at her first tournament of the year is being auctioned off to raise funds for firefighters tackling Australia's unprecedented bushfire emergency.

Williams, who is preparing for this month's Australian Open at the WTA Auckland Classic, joins a slate of sports stars from around the world who have stumped up memorabilia and cash to help pay for firefighting efforts.

""I have so many friends in Australia and it's just been really tragic all around,"" the 23-time Grand Slam champion said on Friday.

""I just keep asking every day to people back home or in Australia, what can I do? Is there anything I can do? It's literally devastating for me and I'm sure a lot of other people feel the same way.""

Her outfit, listed as ""a bespoke Nike dress made specifically for Serena"", was worn by the American when she beat Italy's Camila Giorgi in the first round at Auckland. Williams progressed to the tournament's semi-finals on Friday.

Also for sale is a tennis ball signed by Williams and Caroline Wozniacki, as well as a one-hour private training session from Serena's long-time mentor Patrick Mouratoglou.

The auction closes at midday Saturday (2300 GMT Friday).

Earlier on Friday, Australian cricket legend Shane Warne raised more than Aus$1 million (nearly $700,000) for bushfire victims by auctioning off the ""baggy green"" cap he wore through his Test career.

It came a day after reigning Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton pledged $500,000 for relief efforts, saying that he had been deeply saddened by reports that over a billion animals had been killed in the fires.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/serena-donates-signed-dress-to-australian-bushfire-appeal-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-donates-signed-dress-to-australian-bushfire-appeal.html
235,10-1-20,Iran says rumours missile caused plane crash make 'no sense',"Iran on Thursday ruled out a missile strike as the cause of a Ukrainian passenger plane crash near Tehran, saying such a scenario made ""no sense"".

The plane crashed shortly after take off Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, shortly after Iran fired a volley of missiles against military bases in Iraq housing US personnel.

""Several internal and international flights were flying at the same time in Iranian airspace at the same altitude of 8,000 feet (2,440 metres),"" Iran's transport ministry said.

""This story of a missile striking a plane cannot be correct at all,"" it said in a statement.

""Such rumours make no sense,"" Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's civil aviation organisation and deputy transport minister, said in the statement.

Abedzadeh was reacting to rumours on social networks that the Boeing 737 was hit by a missile fired by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

He said Iran and Ukraine were in the process of ""downloading information"" from black boxes retrieved from the crash site.

""But if more specialised work is required to extract and analyse the data, we can do it in France or another country,"" he added.

On Wednesday, Iran's Mehr news agency -- close to ultraconservatives -- quoted Abedzadeh as saying Iran ""would not give the black boxes to the Americans"".

But the minister's statement on Thursday rejected ""rumours of Iran's resistance to delivering the black boxes... To the US"".

Iran is not obliged to have the black boxes analysed in the US, but America is one of only a few countries -- including France and Germany -- capable of carrying out such work.

Iranian authorities say initial indications showed the plane had turned back after suffering a problem.

A team of Ukrainian experts flew in and joined the investigation on the ground Thursday.

Kiev said it was studying several scenarios, including an in-flight collision, a rocket strike, an engine explosion caused by a technical problem, and an onboard blast.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-says-rumours-missile-caused-plane-crash-make--no-sense--2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/iran-says-rumours-missile-caused-plane-crash-make--no-sense-.html
236,10-1-20,SC stays NCLAT order restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Group,"The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the NCLAT order restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of the Tata Group, observing that there were ""lacunae"" in the orders passed by the Tribunal.

At the outset, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision suffers from ""basic errors and we have to hear the matter in detail"".

The bench also said, ""You (Cyrus) have been out of the saddle quite a long time. Does this hurt you....How does it hurt you today"".

The bench said there was no prayer in the petition for reinstatement of Mistry but the tribunal went ahead with it and ordered his reinstatement.

""We find there are lacunae in the judicial orders passed by the NCLAT,"" the bench said issuing notices to Mistry and others.

Tata Sons Private Ltd (TSPL) challenged the December 18 decision of NCLAT that gave a big relief to Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd and Mistry, restoring him as the executive chairman of TSPL.

The bench posted the matter after four weeks.

The top court also ordered that the Tatas will not exercise power under Article 25 of the Company Law for pushing out shares of minority holders in the company.

Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for the company Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd, submitted that instead of staying the NCLAT order, notice should be issued and two weeks be given for filing the reply.

However, the bench said, ""Our first impression is not good about the order of the tribunal. The tribunal granted the prayer which was not prayed"".

The Mistry's side wanted to place a note about interim arrangement which was not accepted by the bench.

Senior advocate N K Kaul appeared for Mistry while senior advocate Shyam Divan was appearing for the shareholders which were on Mistry's side.

During the hearing, Sundaram said he was not pressing for the consequential relief of reinstatement of Mistry but was against the wrongful removal of Mistry from Tata.

Senior advocates A M Singhvi, Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Mohan Parasaran represented the Tatas.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-stays-nclat-order-restoring-cyrus-mistry-as-executive-chairman-of-tata-group-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-stays-nclat-order-restoring-cyrus-mistry-as-executive-chairman-of-tata-group.html

Rushikesh Devdikar alias Murali, 44, who was absconding was arrested on Thursday from his hideout at Katras in Dhanbad district of Jharkhand, the SIT said in a statement.

According to the probe team, Devdikar was part of the conspiracy to kill Lankesh. He is accused number 18 in the case.

""His house is being searched for clues. He will be produced before the jurisdictional Judicial Magistrate tomorrow (Friday),"" the SIT said.

Lankesh, a left-leaning journalist, was shot dead on September 5, 2017 outside her house by a member of a gang that apparently planned to kill her after being inspired by a book brought out by right-wing group Sanatan Sanstha, that had identified Lankesh as a 'durjan' (evil person).

Investigators said the gang had also prepared a list of people whom they wanted to kill. The list included noted playwright Girish Karnad and rationalist K S Bhagawan.

The SIT had found that Lankesh was killed after a conspiracy was hatched by members of a right-wing group, which is also accused of killing rationalist M M Kalburgi.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/one-arrested-in-gauri-lankesh-murder-case-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/one-arrested-in-gauri-lankesh-murder-case.html

242,10-1-20,Spinners to play a big role in series against India: Cummins,"Australian pace spearhead Pat Cummins expects spinners of his team to play a bigger role in the ODI series against India even though he is not expecting dust-bowls during a limited-overs assignment.

The series begins in Mumbai on January 14, followed by the second and third match in Rajkot on January 17 and Bengaluru on January 19 respectively.

""I think spinners play a bigger part in India than they do around the world but it's rare you get a big spinning dust bowl for a one day international,"" Cummins told reporters ahead of Australia's departure.

Australia made a brilliant comeback to win the five-match ODI series 3-2 in India last year after trailing 0-2.

""Last series I think we played two spinners, they also played two so they are certainly important, especially in the middle overs,"" Cummins said.

Australia are travelling with two specialist spinners in their squad -- left arm spinner Ashton Agar and leg spinner Adam Zampa.

Talking about the tracks in India, the 26-year-old Cummins said the ball gets softer as the game progresses which makes it easier to bowl as compared to other countries.

But playing in smaller, faster fields come with their own set of challenges.

""Up front there's always a little bit in it with a new ball like anywhere else in the world. But then after that I actually feel that the ball gets probably a little bit softer and chewed up more over there than it does in other parts of the world which makes it a little bit easier sometimes bowling with a bit of a softer ball.""

""But it's just a different challenge, the fields there are a lot smaller and faster than here in Australia, the wickets aren't as pacey and bouncy but it's the same format just a slightly different beast,"" he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spinners-to-play-a-big-role-in-series-against-india--cummins-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spinners-to-play-a-big-role-in-series-against-india--cummins.html
243,10-1-20,"BCCI stands with Kohli & Shastri, wants 5-day Tests to stay","The ICC cricket committee is set to discuss the idea of four-day Test matches, but it will, in all likelihood, get a red flag from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as the Indian board is set to stand with skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri.

Both the captain and the head coach of the team have made it clear that they want the traditional format to not lose its sheen by turning from a five-day affair into one of four days.

Speaking to IANS, a BCCI official said that while the board will discuss the matter with Cricket Australia and the English and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) around the BCCI awards on January 12 in Mumbai, the board is clearly in support of skipper Kohli and coach Shastri.

""See, it is only right that you discuss these matters and we will do the same with CA, ECB and Cricket South Africa. But as things stand now, we are on the same platform as our skipper and coach and don't see much sense in cutting Test cricket to four days from the conventional five. In fact, it is not just our captain or coach, you have also heard the likes of Joe Root (English captain) and Faf du Plessis (South Africa skipper) make their opinions clear on the matter. It might be an option for the lower ranked teams, but not when two big teams clash. Tradition can't be toyed with,"" the official pointed.

Kohli made his opinion clear on the eve of the opening T20I between India and Sri Lanka in Guwahati and said: ""According to me, it should not be altered. As I said, the day-night is another step towards commercialising Test cricket and you know, creating excitement around it, but it can't be tinkered with too much. I don't believe so.

""You know the Day-Night Test is the most that should be changed about Test cricket, according to me. Then you are purely only talking about getting numbers, entertainment and you know. I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests. I mean where do you end? Then you will speak of Test cricket disappearing.

""So I don't endorse that at all. I don't think that is fair to the purest format of the game. How cricket started initially, and you know five-day Tests was the highest of tests you can have at the International level.""

Shastri also called the idea nonsensical. ""Four-day Test is nonsense. If this goes on we may have limited-overs Tests. There is no need to tamper with five-day Tests. If at all they want to tamper then let the top six sides play five-day Tests and the next six be allowed to play four-day Tests.

""If you want to preserve Tests then let the top six play more against each other. You have the shorter format to popularise the game,"" he told News18.

While the meeting of the Big Three is set to take place next week and will see discussions on the ICC's proposal of 4-day Tests, it looks unlikely that the BCCI will budge from the stance taken by skipper Kohli and coach Shastri.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bcci-stands-with-kohli---shastri--wants-5-day-tests-to-stay-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bcci-stands-with-kohli---shastri--wants-5-day-tests-to-stay.html
244,10-1-20,Anand opens season against elite field in Tata Steel Masters chess tournament,"Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand will be up against a strong field comprising the likes of Magnus Carlsen when he makes his 18th appearance at the Tata Steel Masters super-tournament which gets underway here on Saturday.

The 50-year-old Anand, a five-time winner here, had last won this event in 2006 and remains one of the favourite visitors to this Dutch hamlet near Amsterdam.

It was in 1989 that Anand debuted here and this will be his 18th appearance in the last 31 years.

The star attraction will be the reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway who had a remarkable last year, ending it as the world champion in all three formats -- Rapid, Blitz and Classical. At 2872, Carlsen is eying the 2900 rating barrier, a feat that was unthinkable for the previous generation.

While Carlsen starts as the top seed, Fabiano Caruana of United States will be back as the second seed ahead of local star Anish Giri and compatriot Wesley So. Anand starts the event as the fifth seed.

Notable big names missing from the line up are Levon Aronian of Armenia, Ding Liren of China, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France and Hikaru Nakamura of United States. However, this year's field has a fine mix of youth and leading their challenge will be 16-year old Iranian Firouza Alireza.

Marred by a recent controversy which ended with Firouza playing under the FIDE flag in the recent World Rapid and Blitz, it looks like he will be playing under a different federation soon.

The Iranian federation had decided to withdraw the team from the world rapid and this led to Firouza playing under the FIDE flag. The youngster had won the silver in the rapid section.

Expectations will also be high from Jan Krizstof Duda of Poland, Vladislav Artemiev of Russia and Jeffery Xiong of United States in the 14-players round-robin tournament.

There will also be a challengers section, wherein Indian challenge will come from young Grandmaster Nihal Sarin and seasoned GM Surya Shekhar Ganguly.

For Anand, much will depend upon his results with the young-brigade. At 50, Anand is by far the oldest participant in the field.

If there is one record missing from Carlsen's collection, it is remaining undefeated for maximum number of games. Among the elite, Magnus recently crossed the '100-game-unbeaten' record by Ding Liren but the overall record rests with GM Sergei Tiviakov of Holland who, at some point, remained unbeaten for 110 games.

Carlsen needs to be unbeaten for the first eight game to set up a new record.

The draw of lots will take place on Friday evening in a glittering ceremony and the first round will be played on Saturday afternoon. January 15, 20 and 23 have been marked as rest days in this marathon event.

Players: Viswanathan Anand (India), Magnus Carlsen (Nor), Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So Jeffery Xiong (All USA), Jan Krizstof Duda (Pol); Nikita Vituigov, Vladislav Artemiev, Daniil Dubov (All Rus); Anish Giri, Jorden Van Foreest (both Ned); Yu Yangyi (Chn); Firouza Alireza (Fid); Vldislav Kovalev (Blr).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/anand-opens-season-against-elite-field-in-tata-steel-masters-chess-tournament-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/anand-opens-season-against-elite-field-in-tata-steel-masters-chess-tournament.html
245,10-1-20,AP CM Jagan Mohan Reddy appears before CBI court in Hyd,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday appeared before a CBI Special Court here in connection with the ongoing trial in the quid pro quo investments cases against him.

This is Jagan's first appearance in court for the trial after he assumed charge as Chief Minister on May 30, 2019.

The Special Court judge had on January 3 directed Jagan to appear in person for the trial, rejecting the latter's plea for an exemption.

Along with Jagan, his close aide andYSR Congress Rajya Sabha member V Vijaysai Reddy, who is also one of the accused in the cases, too appeared before the court.

In view of Jagan's court appearance, security was beefed up near the court's premises.

The YSR Congress president has been facing trial wherein he was charge-sheeted in at least 11 cases as the prime accused in alleged quid pro quo deals.

The cases relate to investments made by various companies in Jagan's firms as quid pro quo for various favours bestowed on them during the tenure of his father late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy as Chief Minister between 2004 and 2009.

Several former ministers and bureaucrats are also accused in the case.

Jagan is currently out on bail, having spent time in jail as an ""un-convicted criminal prisoner"" in the Chanchalguda Central Prison from May 2012 to September 2013.

In the run-up to the Assembly elections in AP last year, Jagan's appearance in the court had reduced after he urged the court to dispense with his appearance and the court had allowed his pleas.

Soon after becoming Chief Minister, Jagan had filed a petition in the special court of CBI seeking exemption from personal appearance as he would be busy with official duties.

Also, lakhs of rupees of public money has to be spent for his security and other protocol requirements in view of his position, Jagan contended.

On November 1, the court, however, rejected his plea and directed that he appear for trial every Friday.

Jagan had not been attending the trial proceedings citing his official engagements as the reason for his absence.

Not impressed by this, the Special Court judge had on January 3 directed that Jagan attend the proceedings on January 10.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ap-cm-jagan-mohan-reddy-appears-before-cbi-court-in-hyd-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ap-cm-jagan-mohan-reddy-appears-before-cbi-court-in-hyd.html

250,10-1-20,CAA comes into effect from Jan 10,"The Centre on Friday announced that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will come into force from January 10.

In a gazette notification, the Union home ministry said the act under which non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be given Indian citizenship, will come into force from January 10.

""In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of the section 1 of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (47 of 2019), the Central government hereby appoints the 10th day of January, 2020, as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,"" the notification said.

The CAA was passed by parliament on December 11.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

There have been widespread protests against the act in different parts of the country.

Those who are opposed to the legislation are saying that it is for the first time that India will grant citizenship on the basis of religion which violates the basic tenets of the country's constitution.

However, the government and ruling BJP has been defending the act saying that the minority groups from the three countries have no other option but to come India when they face religious persecution there.

The home ministry, however, is yet to frame the rules for the act.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/caa-comes-into-effect-from-jan-10-2020-01-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/caa-comes-into-effect-from-jan-10.html

252,10-1-20,15 envoys’ J&K tour sparks row,"Cong slams it as ‘guided tour’; MEA retorts allegations unfounded

A 15-member group of envoys, including US Ambassador to India Kenneth Ian Juster, commenced their two-day visit to Jammu & Kashmir on Thursday as part of the Government’s outreach programme to apprise them of the ground situation there after the abrogation of Article 370. The team didn’t include any envoy from the European Union, while Brazil Ambassador backed out at the last minute.

Envoys from the European Union (EU) countries are understood to have conveyed that they will visit the Union Territory on a different date and are also believed to have stressed on meeting the three former Chief Ministers — Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — who are under detention.

Officials said envoys of several countries had requested the Government for a visit to Kashmir to get a first-hand account of the situation in the Valley following the August 5 decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 and bifurcate it into two Union Territories, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The Congress accused the Government of “adopting double standards” by organising “guided tours and terming it “political tourism.” However, the External Affairs Ministry said this allegation was unfounded.

Justifying the envoys’ tour, External Affairs Ministry Spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in New Delhi the objective of the visit was for them to see first-hand efforts to normalise the situation there and termed the criticism that it was a “guided tour” unfounded. He also said a similar visit to Kashmir can be organised in future for others, including for European Union (EU) envoys.

His clarification came after Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in New Delhi, “the Government is adopting double standards by allowing foreign envoys to visit Jammu & Kashmir, but not Indian politicians.”

He, however, clarified that the Congress party was not opposed to such a visit, but Indian politicians should also be allowed to visit there.

Ramesh said this was the second such attempt by the Government, after the one planned for delegates of EU Parliamentarians on October 29 last year. At that time after facing criticism, the Government had to say it was an informal visit and not an official one, the Congress leader said.

When a parliamentary delegation, Opposition leaders, former Congress president and CPI(M) general secretary, could not go to Jammu & Kashmir, then what was the purpose of taking foreign envoys there, Ramesh asked.

After they arrived in Srinagar by a chartered flight, they were then taken directly to the Army cantonment for a briefing. Top officials from the newly carved out Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir received the delegation, which will be going to Jammu later in the day and stay the night there.

The envoys will meet Lt Governor GC Murmu as well as civil society members and receive briefings on the security situation from various agencies, officials said.

Besides the US, the delegation includes diplomats from Bangladesh, Vietnam, Norway, Maldives, South Korea, Morocco, and Nigeria. They will return to Delhi on Friday. Brazil’s envoy Andre Aranha Correa do Lago was also scheduled to visit Jammu & Kashmir. However, he backed out because of his preoccupation here, the officials said on Wednesday.

Giving details about the visit, the External Affairs Ministry Spokesman said in New Delhi the tour was facilitated by the Government and the envoys met security officials, political leaders, civil society groups and media. The visit was organised considering prevailing situation, he said.

Asked about political leaders who met the group, Kumar said the visit by the envoys to Kashmir is not yet over. The EU envoys wanted to visit Kashmir in a group and the Government did not extend invite to all, he said.

Reacting to the visit, the National Conference, whose two leaders Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah are in detention since August 5, said it was “disappointed” with the way the Government brought envoys from various countries to J&K to “endorse” its “claims of normalcy” in the UT.

The party alleged that the envoys were brought to the Kashmir Valley on a “guided tour”, where access has been limited to “handpicked individuals who toe the Government line. The National Conference is disappointed with the way foreign envoys have been brought to the Valley to endorse the Centre’s claims of normalcy.”

In another development, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) expelled eight party leaders for going “against the will of the people” by engaging in parleys with the Government. The eight leaders met the visiting envoys.

“PDP expels leaders for going against the will of the people,” the party said in a Press release posted on its official Twitter handle. The leaders who have been expelled are Dilawar Mir, Rafi Ahmad Mir, Zaffar Iqbal, Abdul Majeed Padroo, Raja Manzoor Khan, Javaid Hussain Baig, Qamar Hussain and Abdul Rahim Rather -- all former MLAs.

The Press release also said the party disciplinary committee has recommended the expulsion of all these leaders from the basic membership of the party. The expelled leaders have thrown their weight behind former PDP leader Syed Altaf Bukhari and were part of the delegation that met Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu On Tuesday.

This is the second visit of a foreign delegation to Jammu & Kashmir since August 5 when Article 370 giving special status to Jammu & Kashmir was abrogated. Earlier, Delhi-based think tank International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies, a Delhi-based think tank took 23 EU MPs on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the Union Territory.

The Government had distanced itself from the visit with Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy informing Parliament that the European parliamentarians were on a “private visit”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/15-envoys----j-k-tour-sparks-row-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/15-envoys----j-k-tour-sparks-row.html
253,10-1-20,Sacking VC not a silver bullet: HRD Secy; JNUSU adamant,"Virtually ruling out the possibility of sacking Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, HRD Secretary Amit Khare on Thursday said removal of the V-C is not a solution to the present crisis. But a delegation of JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) and JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) remained adamant on the VC’s removal.

The agitating students got a boost when senior BJP leader and former HRD Minister Murli Manohar Joshi too called for the removal of the JNU VC. But downplaying those demands, Khare said the HRD Ministry will talk to the JNU VC and the students’ representatives again on Friday over the students’ claims of revised fee not being implemented.

“Removing the VC is not the solution. The basic issue on which the whole problem has arisen needs to be addressed first. Changing X, Y or Z is not as important as resolving the issues that have come up. The basic bone of contention needs to be resolved,” Khare said.

He met a delegation of representatives from JNUSU and JNUTA where they put forward the demand for the VC’s removal. JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said the students and faculty will not relent till the VC is sacked. Ghosh said they appealed to the HRD Ministry to remove the VC, which in turn said a dialogue will be held on Friday.

“We will not compromise with the HRD Ministry over the removal of the VC. It is still thinking whether the VC should be removed,” said Ghosh.

The HRD Ministry has called the students again on Friday after the meeting with the VC and his team. Ministry officials, however, asserted that a “formula” decided during consultations with students and administration needs to be implemented.

The VC, however, denied claims that the formula arrived at the Ministry is not being fully implemented. “As far as the fee issue is concerned, there has been no deviation from the formula arrived at the HRD Ministry last month. As decided, students are not being charged any services or utility fees,” said the VC. He also claimed to have written to the UGC to release funds for covering the utility and service charges as decided.

The HRD Ministry had in November formed a three-member panel to mediate between the agitating students and administration and restore normalcy in the campus.

According to the formula proposed by the Ministry, the JNU administration would charge only the increased room rent and the service and utility charges were to be borne by the UGC. In return, the students would call off their agitation and engage in dialogue with the university administration.

To compensate for the lost academic period, JNU was asked to extend the semester by two weeks. The university was also advised to notify the students’ union and withdraw police complaints against students.

On the issue raised by students of their Union not being officially notified by the university, HRD Secretary said, “the Ministry’s focus is on academic issues on campus and not political”. “We will talk to the university administration that the fees changes which were decided last month are implemented. We are working on resolving the issues and restoring normalcy. It is a prestigious university and should remain that way,” Khare said. Meanwhile, former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi called for the removal of JNU V-C, saying it is “shocking” that he is adamant on not implementing a Government proposal to resolve fee-hike crisis in the university.

“Reports are that the HRD Ministry had twice advised the JNU V-C to implement certain reasonable and working formula for resolving the issue of enhanced fees in JNU. He was also advised to reach out to teachers and students. It is shocking that the V-C is adamant on not implementing the government proposal. This attitude is deplorable and in my opinion such a V-C should not be allowed to continue on this post,” Joshi tweeted. Hundreds of demonstrators, including students and members of civil society organisations, hit the streets on Thursday protesting the recent violence at JNU and demanding resignation of the varsity V-C.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sacking-vc-not-a-silver-bullet--hrd-secy--jnusu-adamant-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sacking-vc-not-a-silver-bullet--hrd-secy--jnusu-adamant.html
254,10-1-20,FM’s absence from PM-tycoons meetingdraws Twitter barbs,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s absence from a high-level meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with top Ministers, Government officials and tycoons of India Inc created a buzz on the twitter.

More so because when the PM interacted with top business tycoons to discuss the issues facing the economy and measures needed to boost growth, the FM was not present. Business tycoons, like Ratan Tata, Mukesh Ambani, were among those who attended the meeting.

Away from the meeting, the Finance Minister was present in the BJP office discussing Budget proposals with the party’s frontal organisations’ leaders.

The Congress took a swipe at the Finance Minister over her absence at a pre-Budget meeting with economists and experts at the Niti Aayog here which was chaired by the Prime Minister. “Here’s a suggestion, next Budget meeting, consider inviting the Finance Minister,” the Congress said on its official Twitter handle, using the hashtag “FindingNirmala”.

“How many men does it take to do a woman’s job,” the Opposition party said in another tweet, using the same hashtag. The Congress tagged a tweet of the BJP that said the Finance Ministry has invited suggestions for the Union Budget 2020-21.

“Citizens from all walks of life are welcome to be a part of this exercise,” the tweet on the BJP twitter handle said.

The FM’s meeting assumes significance as the Government is in the process of formulating Budget proposals for 2020-21, the focus of which is likely to be on accelerating economic growth which is estimated to slip to an 11-year low of 5 per cent during 2019-20.

Home Minister Amit Shah, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Commerce and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar, CEO Amitabh Kant, Bibek Debroy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister were present at the Thursday meeting which discussed a host of issues, including those related to agriculture, infrastructure sectors.

The FM’s absence from the PM’s meeting created quite buzz on twitter. Some of the interesting tweets are as follow:

255,10-1-20,"SC rejects urgent hearing on CAA plea, to wait till violence ends","Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Thursday observed that the country is going through difficult times and there is so much violence going on as the Supreme Court (SC) refused urgent hearing on a plea seeking to declare the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as constitutional. The apex court said it will hear the plea once the nation-wide violence stops.

A bench headed by CJI Bobde expressed surprise over the petition and said this is the first time that someone is seeking that an Act be declared as constitutional. “There is so much of violence going on. The country is going through difficult times and the endeavour should be for peace... This court’s job is to determine validity of a law and not declare it as constitutional,” the CJI said.

The bench also comprising justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant said it will hear the petitions challenging validity of CAA when the violence stops.

The observation came after advocate Vineet Dhanda sought urgent listing of his plea to declare CAA as constitutional and a direction to all States for implementation of the Act. The plea has also sought action against activists, students and media houses for “spreading rumours”.

On December 18, the apex court had agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the CAA, but refused to stay its operation. The newly amended law seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Bobde had fixed a batch of 59 petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, for hearing on January 22. Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the Act including by RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi.

Several other petitioners include Muslim body Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, All Assam Students Union (AASU), Peace Party, CPI, NGOs ‘Rihai Manch’ and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students have also approached the apex court challenging the Act.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-rejects-urgent-hearing-on-caa-plea--to-wait-till-violence-ends.html
256,10-1-20,JNU solidarity protest march to Rashtrapati Bhawan triggers jam,"Hundreds of students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Delhi University (DU) and senior leaders such as Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Prakash Karat, Brinda Karat and Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) leader Sharad Yadav hit the streets of Thursday in solidarity with JNU students demanding removal of Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, leading to traffic jams in Central Delhi.

Police said JNU student leaders “provoked” fellow protesters to move towards the Rashtraparti Bhavan which escalated tensions. The protesters tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhawan but were prevented by the Delhi Police that had barricaded Rajendra Prasad Road, Raisina Road and Janpath.

Besides, a number of people protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) raising slogans and carrying placards, banners, also participated in the march from Mandi House to Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). They shouted slogans demanding strict action against those involved in January 5 campus violence that left around 35 injured.

“JNU students and teachers marched from Mandi House to MHRD, Shastri Bhawan via Rajendra Prasad Road. A delegation of nine people, including teachers, went to meet JS, MHRD. The gathering remained peaceful till they remained in meeting.

However, when the delegation came out after meeting, one of the student leaders provoked the gathering to move towards Rashtrapati Bhawan. Consequently, they stopped traffic at Rajendra Pd Road and some of them tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhawan. They were prevented from doing so. In the process 11 people were detained and subsequently released,” said Eish Singhal, DCP, New Delhi.

Yechury, CPI (M) general secretary, said, “For three hours, people wearing masks beat up varsity students. They entered the campus with police being present at the main gate.”

Alleging that the incident could not have happened without the V-C knowing about it, he said, “The V-C has to go.” Last week on Sunday, a group of unidentified people wearing masks entered the JNU campus and created ruckus, beating students inside Periyar Hostel with sticks and laathis. They also vandalised university property. About 35 students were hurt.”

The JNU students union has been demanding a rollback of hostel and mess fee hike for the last 70 days and also boycotted registration for the next semester.

The JNUSU office bearers also had a meeting with the MHRD officials on Thursday but after the meeting they led the protest towards Rashtrapati Bhavan, saying they were ‘unsatisfied’ with the official meeting with HRD, “We will not compromise with HRD Ministry over the removal of the V-C. It is still thinking whether the V-C should be removed,” said Aishe Ghosh.

The students demanded resignation of the JNU V-C. Ghose also said that the students and faculty will not relent till Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar is sacked. “We appealed to HRD ministry to remove the V-C, which in turn said a dialogue will be held on Friday,” she said.

The police also resorted to baton charge to control the mob who tried to block the traffic at Janpath. Using loud speakers, the police also appealed to the crowd to maintain peace.

“Today students of JNU marched to MHRD in Delhi with their demand to roll back the fee hike and a resignation of the V-C who gave a free hand to the ABVP, RSS goons to attack the students on campus. The MHRD didn’t agree on the demands of removing V-C and rolling back fee hike. Students union of JNU decided to march towards Rashtrapati Bhawan,” said a member of Pinjra Tod.

The police used force on the students and teachers and during the clash, a student from Ambedkar University of Delhi (AUD) has been injured, they said.

“We were beaten up by the Delhi Police while marching from MHRD to Rashtrapati Bhawan. Female students and teachers have been illegally detained and taken to Mandir Marg and other police stations,” said a student. Meanwhile, about 100 protesters reached Connaught Place (CP) to continue the protest demanding resignation JNU V-C.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jnu-solidarity-protest-march-to-rashtrapati-bhawan-triggers-jam.html

Deepika on Tuesday made a surprise visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University to express solidarity with students who were attacked by a masked mob inside the campus on January 5. She did not address the public meeting but stood silently behind student leaders.

According to Irani, Deepika had made her political affiliations known in 2011 itself when she praised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and called him a suitable candidate for the post of the prime minister.

""I think I would rather know what her political affiliation is than not know. I think that anybody who has read the news knew where you are going to stand... (They) knew that you are going to stand with people who wanted the destruction of India, knew that you are standing with people who celebrate every time a CRPF jawan is killed,"" Irani said at an event hosted by The New Indian Express here on Thursday evening.

The video of the minister's remarks was posted on the publication's Twitter handle.

""... They hit some girls on their private parts with 'lathis'. So she stood next to them. That is her right. I can't deny her that right. She will stand next to people who will beat up other girls, who don't see eye-to-eye ideologically, in private parts. That's her freedom. She made her political affiliation known in 2011 that she supports the Congress party,"" the minister said.

The Textiles minister added that people who admired the Bollywood star's work are in shock over her decision to visit the JNU campus.

""I think the problem that has happened is that a lot of people are in shock. They didn't know. There were a lot of people who were admirers and possibly watched many of her films and for them it was a shock.""

Deepika has been in the eye of the proverbial storm after her visit to JNU, getting appreciation from the film fraternity, activists, politicians and other sectors of society but also being criticised and trolled by many on social media and elsewhere.

Earlier this week, Deepika was in Delhi to promote her latest release ""Chhapaak"", based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/irani-hits-out-at-deepika-for-jnu-visit--says-she-stood-with-those-who-want-destruction-of-india-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/irani-hits-out-at-deepika-for-jnu-visit--says-she-stood-with-those-who-want-destruction-of-india.html

These people were detained and booked under the PSA after August 5 last year when the Centre revoked special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories.

The Jammu and Kashmir High Court had quashed the PSA of some of the individuals recently and passed some scathing remarks against the officials who had signed the orders.

In a recent order, Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey, while quashing the PSA of Bilal Ahmad Mir, had said no documents were supplied to the detenu about the grounds on which he was detained.

""On these counts alone....The detention of the detenu is vitiated, the detenu having been prevented from making an effective and purposeful representation against the order of detention,"" the judgment had said.

Three-time chief minister Farooq Abdullah, who is a member of the current Lok Sabha, was also slapped with the PSA on September 17 after MDMK leader Vaiko had approached the Supreme Court with a habeas corpus petition seeking his production.

Scores of other politicians including his son Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti have been kept under preventive detention.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court said Internet access is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution and asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to review within a week all curbs in the union territory.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana and comprising justices B R Gavai and R Subhash Reddy, said magistrates should apply their mind and follow the doctrine of proportionality while passing prohibitory orders.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jk-admin-revokes-psa-of-26-people-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jk-admin-revokes-psa-of-26-people.html

264,10-1-20,Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna suspended,"The Uttar Pradesh Government on Thursday suspended Noida Police chief (SSP) Vaibhav Krishna as the objectionable video involving him was proved to be authentic, officials said.

The Government also transferred five other IPS officers whom the Noida SSP had named in the leaked letter he had sent to State police chief OP Singh for being involved in the transfer racket.

They are Sudhir Singh (SSP Ghaziabad), Ajay Pal Sharma (SP Rampur), Ganesh Saha (SP Banda), Himanshu Kumar (SP Sultanpur) and Rajeev Narayan Mishra (SSP Special Task Force Lucknow).

“Vaibhav had himself made a complaint over the circulation of the clip... The video clips were sent to a Gujarat-based forensic lab which concluded that the video is not edited or morphed. There is no sign of edit,” the official added.

While Krishna has been suspended, a three-member high-level committee has been formed to probe the allegations of corruption he made against the five officers and submit a report in 15 days, a government official said. The Government spokesman claimed that the action had been initiated under the ‘zero tolerance’ policy of the Yogi Government towards corruption.

Krishna had claimed that it was a morphed video aimed at maligning his image. He had even lodged a report against unknown persons for making the video viral.

In his FIR, Krishna had alleged that the video was fake and was posted by some IPS officers and journalists to malign his image as he had initiated action against them for their corrupt practices.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/noida-ssp-vaibhav-krishna-suspended.html
265,10-1-20,Iran will never have a nuclear weapon: Trump,"Iran will never have a nuclear weapon, President Donald Trump asserted on Thursday and said Tehran was getting ""hurt very badly"" by US sanctions.

""Iran right now is a mess. They can straighten out the economics of their country very, very quickly. Let us see whether or not they negotiate,"" he told reporters at a White House event.

New sanctions were imposed on Iran following missile strikes by it on bases housing US troops in Iraq.

Iranian state TV had said the attacks were in revenge for the killing of the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, General Qasem Soleimani, in a US drone strike, which was ordered by Trump.

The president reiterated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. They understand that. We have told them very strongly. Iran now is not wealthy like it was when President (Barack) Obama handed USD 150 billion. There are much different country,” he said.

On January 8, Trump had said as long as he is president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.

“We'll see whether or not they want to negotiate. Maybe they want to wait until after the election and negotiate with a weak Democrat, somebody like a (Joe) Biden or a Pocahontas or (Pete) Buttigieg or one of these characters,” he said.

In November last year, Trump had dubbed Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren ""Pocahontas"".

Iran, he said, is getting ""hurt very badly"" by the sanctions. “It all can end very quickly. But as to whether or not they want, that's up to them. Not up to me, it's totally up to them,” the president said.

The Iranian nuclear deal, Trump said, has not worked. “I always call it the Iran Nuclear Deal that didn't work. The Iran Deal. It was just something that it is no good for our country. It expires in a short time,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-will-never-have-a-nuclear-weapon--trump-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-will-never-have-a-nuclear-weapon--trump.html
266,10-1-20,Canadian PM: Iranian missile brought down airliner,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday multiple intelligence sources indicate that Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner after it took off from Tehran, killing all 176 on board, including 63 Canadians.

Trudeau's comments came as video emerged that appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.

That and other footage posted on social media increasingly pointed to a catastrophic mistake by Tehran's air defense batteries in bringing down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 early Wednesday.

The video, which The New York Times said it verified, shows a fast-moving object rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash is seen, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later an explosion is heard.

Citing information from allies as well as Canada's own intelligence, Trudeau said the plane appeared to have been hit by an Iranian surface-to-air (SAM) missile. ""We know this may have been unintentional. Canadians have questions, and they deserve answers,"" Trudeau told reporters.

He was backed by other Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who said mounting evidence supported a missile strike, which ""may well have been unintentional."" US President Donald Trump indicated that Washington officials believed the Kiev-bound Boeing 737 was struck by one or more Iranian missiles before it ditched and exploded outside Tehran.

The US National Transportation Safety Board late Thursday said it had received formal notification of the crash from Iran and would send a representative to join the crash probe.

Iran's foreign ministry earlier invited the US plane maker Boeing to ""participate"" in the inquiry.

The flight went down in the dark just minutes after takeoff, with no radio message from the pilot to indicate distress, according to the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization. It was carrying 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three Britons.

With tensions high between the United States and Iran, the disaster unfolded just hours after Tehran launched ballistic missiles towards bases in Iraq housing US troops. Iran retaliated for the January 3 US drone strike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian general.

The Iranian government said the missile strike scenario made ""no sense,"" however, arguing that several internal and international flights had been sharing approximately the same airspace.

Tehran later asked Ottawa to share its information with Iranian investigators.

Trudeau said Canada was working with allies to ensure a credible probe. ""The families of the victims want answers, Canadians want answers, I want answers,"" he said.

""This government will not rest until we get that."" Canada's transportation safety board on Thursday said it had accepted an invitation from Iran's civil aviation authority to join the inquiry.

Britain's Johnson called Thursday for a full, transparent investigation.

Trump would not directly confirm what US intelligence was saying privately. ""I have my suspicions,"" Trump said, adding that ""somebody could have made a mistake."" But unnamed officials told US media that satellite, radar and electronic data indicated Tehran's air defense units downed the aircraft.

ABC News reported that an unnamed official said it was ""highly likely"" the plane was brought down by two SAMs.

Ukraine called for United Nations support for a broad investigation, and sent 45 crash investigators to Tehran to take part in the inquiry led by Iranian authorities. Investigators are pursuing several possibilities, including engine failure, a missile strike or an act of terror.

""If any country has information that can help conduct a transparent and objective investigation into the tragedy, we are ready to receive it and cooperate in further verification,"" the Ukraine presidency said in an English-language statement. Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's civil aviation organization and deputy transport minister, said Iran and Ukraine were ""downloading information"" from the aircraft's black boxes retrieved from the crash site.

""But if more specialized work is required to extract and analyze the data, we can do it in France or another country,"" he said.

Analysts were examining photographs posted online of the wreckage and a private video apparently taken of the flight when it was struck for evidence that it was downed by a missile.

""I think this has a very good possibility of being accurate,"" John Goglia, a former US aviation safety expert on the National Transportation Safety Board, said of the missile theory.

""Airplanes that have just taken off and have made a climb to 8,000 feet, that's entering the safest period of time in the flight. So even an engine failure at that altitude should not cause the type of event we've just observed,"" he told AFP. The Ukrainian airline crash brought back memories of another tragedy, involving a US military error.

In 1988, an Iran Air flight was mistakenly shot down over the Gulf by a surface-to-air missile fired from the US warship USS Vincennes. All 290 people aboard, most of them Iranians, were killed.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/canadian-pm--iranian-missile-brought-down-airliner-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/canadian-pm--iranian-missile-brought-down-airliner.html

269,10-1-20,Prince Harry's wife Meghan returns to Canada amid royal storm,"Prince Harry's wife Meghan has returned to Canada following the couple's bombshell announcement that they were quitting their frontline royal duties, their spokeswoman said on Friday.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent an extended Christmas break in Canada with their baby son Archie, before returning to break the news that has rocked the royal family.

""I can confirm reports that the duchess is in Canada,"" the couple's spokeswoman told AFP, without providing further details.

The Daily Mail newspaper reported that the royals left eight-month-old Archie with his nanny in Canada when they flew to Britain earlier this week.

It said Meghan, a former US television actress, headed back to rejoin him on Thursday and ""she may stay there for the foreseeable future"".

An unnamed source was quoted as saying by the domestic Press Association news agency the duchess had travelled to the UK ""to attend some meetings"" before returning to Canada Senior royals were caught off guard by Wednesday's announcement that the couple wanted to ""step back"" from their roles.

Queen Elizabeth II reportedly held crisis calls on Thursday involving Harry, his brother Prince William and their father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne.

William, Harry and their wives have been viewed as the modern face of the royal family, hailed for bringing fresh energy into the institution.

But Harry and Meghan last year admitted to struggling with the spotlight following their wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018 and Archie's birth a year later.

The couple have lashed out at negative news coverage -- Harry calling some of it racist -- and taken several papers to court.

The prince also confirmed he was growing apart from his brother, who is second in line to the throne.

The couple said they wanted to forge ""a progressive new role"", split their time between Britain and North America and become financially independent.

A palace source on Thursday said the queen had instructed aides to work ""at pace"" with Meghan and Harry and the government ""to find workable solutions"".

Key questions include whether they will keep their royal titles and how much of their funding -- mostly from Prince Charles -- they will maintain.

The couple's decision follows a turbulent year for the wider royal family.

270,10-1-20,"15 killed, 20 injured in blast at mosque in Pakistan's Quetta","A powerful blast inside a mosque in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Friday killed at least 15 people, including an Imam and a senior police officer, and left 20 others injured, three days after a bomb explosion claimed two lives in Quetta.

The nature of the explosion, which occurred inside the mosque in Ghousabad neighbourhood, was not immediately known, Dawn newspaper reported.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Amanullah was among the 15 people killed in the incident, Quetta Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Abdul Razzaq Cheema said.

Twenty others were also injured in the blast, the report said.

Law enforcement agencies have cordoned off the area.

271,10-1-20,US announces new sanctions on Iran after missile strikes,"The Trump administration on Friday announced a new wave of sanctions on Iran following this week's missile strikes by the Islamic Republic on U.S. Bases in Iraq.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the new sanctions will target eight senior Iranian officials involved in ""destabilising"" activities in the Middle East as well as Tuesday's missile strike, which came in retaliation for the US killing of a senior Iranian general in a drone strike.

Mnuchin said President Donald Trump will issue an executive order imposing sanctions on anyone involved in the Iranian textile, construction, manufacturing or mining sectors.

They will also impose separate sanctions against the steel and iron sectors.

""As a result of these actions we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime,"" the treasury secretary said.

The administration has already reinstated all the US sanctions that were eased under the 2015 nuclear deal, which has caused significant economic hardship in Iran and cut its oil exports to historic lows.

274,10-1-20,"Pakistan epitomises 'dark arts', no takers for its 'malware': India at UNSC","In a hard-hitting response, India said Pakistan ""epitomises the dark arts”, but there are no takers for its ""malware” after Islamabad raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the UN Security Council.

“One delegation that epitomises the dark arts has, yet again, displayed its wares by peddling falsehoods earlier today. These we dismiss with disdain,” India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said on Thursday.

""My simple response to Pakistan is even though it is late, neighbour, heal thyself of your malaise. There are no takers here for your malware,” Akbaruddin said, addressing the UN Security Council open debate on ‘Maintenance of International Peace and Security Upholding the United Nations Charter.'

Akbaruddin's strong response came after Pakistan's envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir while addressing the Council during the open debate.

The Pakistani envoy also raised the abrogation of Article 370, communications lockdown in Kashmir and referred to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan after an aerial combat in February last year after New Delhi had conducted counter-terror operations in Pakistan's Balakot.

Akram called on the Security Council and Secretary General Antonio Guterres to “act decisively to prevent a disastrous war between Pakistan and India.”

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcating it into two union territories.

Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India's high commissioner.

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

In his statement to the Council, Akbaruddin said that it is increasingly acknowledged that the 15-nation Security Council faces crises of identity and legitimacy, as well as relevance and performance.

“The globalisation of terror networks; the weaponisation of new technologies; the inability to counter those resorting to subversive statecraft are showing up the shortcomings of the Council.”

Akbaruddin noted that in a world constantly in flux, the challenges to international peace and security are a step ahead of the systems designed to tackle them. “It is evident now that fires are all around the horizon. To undertake a fair evaluation of the available mechanisms without belittling their importance, we need to ask ourselves – are they still fit for the purpose of implementing the fundamental principles of the Charter?”

He underscored the need for the Council to be part of the political tool kit to address ongoing and future threats to global peace and security, emphasising that the Council should represent current global realities and be fit for purpose.

“The answer to the crises the Council faces, lies in invoking and working through Charter provisions that provide for reform and change. We need a Council that is representative of current global realities, credible, and legitimate, rather than one that rests merely on the claim that it existed at the inception. The Council needs to be fit for purpose for the 21s?t? century.”

Alluding to Mahatma Gandhi's quote of ‘One must care about the world one will not see', Akbaruddin said resilient organisations are those that are not resistant to change, “or else current emergencies can turn into catastrophes, even while we continue our endless prevarication. Humanity, it is said, progresses when it collectively rises to its responsibility to the future. It is now time to do that.”

The Indian envoy said there is a case to be made for innovations that enlarge the vision of global rule of law. “It is possible that just as Generals often re-fight the last war, the drafters of the Charter responded to the factors and forces that led to World War II, without anticipating what we are now faced with.”

Further he said notwithstanding all its imperfections, the UN Charter is still the main incarnation of the global spirit. “Moving away from a formal system which is well understood, to one which is based on untested interpretations, may have unexpected consequences. Justice dispensed on the fly may come to be resented.”",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan-epitomises--dark-arts---no-takers-for-its--malware---india-at-unsc-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pakistan-epitomises--dark-arts---no-takers-for-its--malware---india-at-unsc.html
275,10-1-20,Advancing India-US ties crucial for America: Congressman Engel,"Describing India-US relationship as one of the most important ties for America, a powerful Congressman said that strengthening and advancing this partnership is his country's top strategic goal.

Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said this in his address at a Capitol Hill event on Thursday to bid farewell to outgoing Indian Ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla.

Engel said that Shringla, who now heads to New Delhi to take charge as the country's next Foreign Secretary later this month, would play an important part in helping America to achieve this goal.

Engel in an exception let House Foreign Affairs Committee room in Rayburn House building be the venue for the farewell for an outgoing foreign envoy at the US Capitol.

“I regard the relationship between the US and India as one of the most important relationships the US has. As chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I will continue to do everything in my power to strengthen the relationship between India and the US,” Engel said.

“We (India and the US) have so much in common,” he said in his farewell remarks at the prestigious Congressional room, which is the venue for all House hearings on foreign affairs issues. It was also the venue for the Congressional hearing on Kashmir in October.

“The very strong Indian American diaspora we have here in the US helps not only enrich the US but helps bring our the two countries together,” Engel said in his remarks. “We will keep working together to strengthen the bilateral ties between the two countries,” he said.

The farewell reception was hosted by Ranju Batra, chair, Diwali Foundation US and Ravi Batra, chair, National Advisory Council South Asian Affairs.

New York-based attorney Ravi Batra thanked Engel for allowing this special reception for an outgoing ambassador inside the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which he said is symbolic of the strength and the vitality of the bilateral relationship. The reception was addressed by other influential Congressmen, including Brad Sherman, Indian American Raja Krishnamoorthi, Pete King and Jim Vargas.

Noting that he arrived in this country exactly a year ago on January 9, Shringla said this has been an eventful and result-oriented year for India-US ties. “We had very significant engagement with Congress. We've been given every encouragement by our friend in Congress, particularly by Chairman Engel,” he said.

“We have a debt of gratitude to you for being so understanding of some of the issues that are part of our relationship. I'm happy that because of your encouragement, we made a lot of progress in initiatives that are important to us. You'll also be happy to know that as we speak, Ambassador Ken Juster, the US Ambassador to India is in Jammu and Kashmir visiting that part of our country,” he said.

The foreign secretary-designate said that India will continue to be fully engaged with the US Congress because as a democracy, it understands what it means to be engaged with the elected representatives of the people in the US.

“And if you want to forge a close relationship with the US, we have to have a close relationship with Congress, we have to be able to be in touch to that, we can inform them of what is happening are, we can encourage them to take steps to bring our relationships closer and it's with their oversight that the relationships can thrive and prosper,” Shringla said.

276,10-1-20,Most meat-eaters admit veganism is ethical: Study,"Most meat eaters admit veganism is ethical and good for the environment, researchers have found.

The study, published in the journal Sustainability, looked at public opinion on plant-based diets and found widespread support for the ethics and environmental benefits of veganism and vegetarianism among meat-eaters.

The findings from University of Bath, UK, suggest that 73 per cent of meat-eaters surveyed, considered veganism to be 'ethical', 70 per cent said it was good for the environment and half (50 per cent) considered it healthy and 60 per cent thought veganism was 'acceptable'.

""At a time of year when many people are considering switching to plant-based diets with 'Veganuary', this study shows that most people already agree with the ethics of veganism and are aware of the benefits of vegan diets to the environment,"" said study researcher Chris Bryant from the University of Bath.

The study, which involved 1,000 men and women with an average age of 34, was conducted in September 2018. Participants were recruited online through the survey platform Prolific.

By contrast, over 80 per cent of respondents thought veganism was not easy, 77 per cent thought it 'inconvenient' and over 60 per cent thought it was not enjoyable.

Attitudes from respondents towards vegetarianism were significantly more positive on almost all counts.

According to the researchers, this research is focused on shifting preferences away from animal consumption in view of climate change and reducing animal suffering.

""Many people agree with the principles of veganism is one thing, but in terms of changing behaviours we need to acknowledge that for many it has been seen as too expensive, inconvenient and a sacrifice in terms of taste,"" Bryant said.

277,10-1-20,Trump says new Iran sanctions already in effect,"President Donald Trump said Thursday the United States had imposed new sanctions on Iran following missile strikes on bases housing US troops in Iraq that resulted in no American or Iraqi deaths.

""It's already been done. We've increased them. They were very severe, but now it's increased substantially,"" Trump said, without offering any specifics.

Trump had promised the ""additional punishing sanctions"" in an address to the nation Wednesday in retaliation for the attack -- seen by experts as a measured first response by Tehran to the killing of Iran's top General, Qasem Soleimani, in an American drone strike in Baghdad.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-says-new-iran-sanctions-already-in-effect-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-says-new-iran-sanctions-already-in-effect.html
278,10-1-20,US likely to sign trade deal with China on Jan 15: Trump,"The US will sign the first phase of a pending trade deal with China probably on January 15, President Donald Trump said on Thursday.

Beijing's trade envoy Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to visit the US next week to sign the interim agreement's ""Phase One"", marking a pause in the nearly two-year trade war between the two sides.

""We're signing, as you know, a very big deal among many other things with China … probably on January 15,"" Trump told reporters at a White House event here.

Liu will lead a delegation to the US from Monday through Wednesday, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday.

The ""Phase One"" of the trade deal, Trump said, is ""a big percentage of the deal"".

""Some would say half. Some would say a little less or a little more than half, but it's a tremendous percentage. It's pretty much all for the farmers, also bankers,"" he said responding to a question.

""We also have regulations for a lot of different things... That people are going to be very surprised to see. But it's a big chunk of it, and we'll start right away negotiating Phase 2,"" Trump said.

However, he said negotiations for the second phase ""will take a little time"".

""I think, I might want to wait to finish it until after the election because by doing that I think we can actually make a little bit better deal, maybe a lot better deal,” Trump said.

The US had postponed planned tariff hikes following the announcement of the deal's ""Phase One"" in October.

However, earlier punitive duties imposed by China and the US on billions of dollars of each other's goods stayed in place, affecting global trade.

Phase one of the deal, Trump said, could be up to USD 50 billion in farm product. That is numerous times more than they were buying in the past, the president said.

“It's going to have a huge impact, and I see farm prices are going way up. I see corn is just--had some big increases over the last little while. Cattle has been doing really well. The farmers liked me anyway. That's what I like about the farmers,” Trump asserted.

The trade deal with China, he said, will be great for farmers and for banks.

“Great for finance companies. Really a lot. Then we're going to be covering the opening of China and various other things in Phase Two,” Trump said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-likely-to-sign-trade-deal-with-china-on-jan-15----trump-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-likely-to-sign-trade-deal-with-china-on-jan-15----trump.html
279,10-1-20,Only fair probe can unmask face of terror,"Anyone familiar with even the basics of the CrPC will know that the police have absolute right to enter any premises in pursuit of an offender, or if they have genuine reasons to believe that a crime is taking place there. Not only that, the CrPC also authorises the police to go beyond its jurisdiction in the hot pursuit of an offender.

This is made clear in Section 48 of the CrPC which states, “A police officer may, for the purpose of arresting without warrant any person whom he is authorised to arrest, pursue such person into any place in India.”

The criminal code does place restriction on the policemen if they want to enter any premises while pursuing a non-cognisable offence. In that case the police must acquire a search warrant from a magistrate. The murderous crime that took place on the JNU campus on the Sunday night was certainly not a non-cognisable offence.

Taking the argument further, if a man trespasses into a private property on hearing the cries of help of a person shot at by a criminal, will he be arrested or rewarded? Letter and spirit are two dimensions of law. In case of the JNU, the spirit of law has been conveniently sacrificed to justify the police inaction.

The January 5 night of terror has spawned contradictory tales. But one thing stands above the blame game: The police were well informed about the assembly of masked men, wielding sticks, iron rods and hammers, within the JNU premises much before they went on rampage, breaking the skulls and limbs of their “targeted victims”. The cops stood outside the gate and entered the campus only at 8 pm after they got an official “invitation” from Vice Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar to do so.

Why did the cops wait outside when they knew that students were subjected to mayhem by dozens of masked men? And why did the VC take so long to send formal letter permitting the cops to enter the premises?

The answer to these questions hold the key to the conspiracy angle that has been widely in circulation — and not without reason — to project the JNU incident as part of a bigger design.

The police and JNU administration have their own version to justify their inactions. For example, in the FIR, which the police registered on Monday, it has been admitted that the JNU administration alerted the police when skirmishes first broke out at the Periyar hostel around 3.45 pm on Sunday.

What did the police do? Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West) Devender Arya has gone on record claiming that when a PCR van reached outside the campus, around 40-50 lathi-wielding masked men were found to be attacking the students and vandalising property.

Going by Arya’s reported version, the rioters fled after seeing the approach of 15-20 police personnel permanently stationed inside the campus at the directive of the Delhi High Court. So, a sizeable police force is present inside the campus and a posse of policemen is deployed outside. And yet the goons get away freely, and no one is arrested.

Even if we take this on the face value, the police will be expected to take follow up measures to prevent recurrence of such a situation and track the culprits. One would expect the police to at least secure the premises, make inquiries, and try to track the fleeing goons, give them a hot chase, and do nakabandi of nearby areas. They did nothing of this sort. They go back to the cozy confines of their police station, leaving the campus vulnerable for return of terror.

The police claims that DCP Southwest District Devender Arya did enter the campus around 5.15 pm and inspected the situation at Periyar Hostel. He found nothing amiss and returned to the main gate.

Who did the DCP approach? Did he talk to any of the students? Did he try to find out who were the vandals? What sort of enquiry did he make? There are no answers. Only questions begging for answers.

According to the FIR, the police rushed a PCR van to the JNU north gate when they received calls around 7 pm about a “mob attack” and vandalism at Sabarmati T-point and Sabarmati hostel. The cops stationed inside the campus found masked men on the rampage and used public address system to ask them to disperse peacefully while at the gate waited the PCR and cops for permission to enter the campus.

The masked men continued to assault the students at liberty. Only around 8 pm the cops entered the premises. By then the goons had completed their tasks and gone, leaving behind a trail of destruction and bleeding and crying students.

The FIR claims that the administration asked the police to reach the campus at around 3.45 pm and the cops claim that the V-C sent a WhatsApp message to station themselves at the main gate and granted permission only at 7.45 pm to enter the campus.

This raises more questions. Why the V-C did ask the police to wait at the gate? Didn’t the police know that the situation was grave and goons had unleashed murderous attack on students? After all, the cops had received more than 100 SoS calls from panicky students. Did the police seek permission to enter the campus? What did the cop stationed inside the campus do to contain the situation? Didn’t they alert their bosses that any delay could be fatal? Why didn’t the police not barge into the campus to arrest the goons?

The V-C by his own admission was present on the campus when the attack took place. Anyone in his position, seeing his students attacked by dozens of masked men could have been terrified. One would expect him to call up the Police Commissioner and even the Home Minister and apprise them of the dangerous situation. Who knows the masked men could have been jehadi terrorists?

The roles of the police and the Vice-Chancellor are under the scanner. More so of the police, which has not arrested anyone even after four days of the attack? It’s the same police which arrest suspects without any evidence even in cases of routine crime. Incidentally, the police have more than 100 video clips and tell tale chat groups messages showing how the attack was preplanned. Some of the messages also claim that the police will not act when the students are bashed up.

If it was a case of a lone wolf attack, the police could be excused. But in the case of such a large scale vandalism and brutality, the failure of the police to arrest even a single culprit is bizarre, to say the least. After all, it was the same Delhi Police which invaded the Jamia university campus without any permission from the Vice Chancellor on December 25 and thrashed the students without discriminating between innocent once and stone peters.

It’s also puzzling as to how do the street lights go off during the attack, and how did all the attackers vanish even when the police was stationed outside the gate.

Nothing the police or the Vice-Chancellor say will satisfy the ‘nay sayers’. Only an impartial probe, led by retired or sitting Supreme Court judge, can restore the confidence of the students and the nation about the intention of the authorities to punish the culprits!",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/only-fair-probe-can-unmask-face-of-terror-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/only-fair-probe-can-unmask-face-of-terror.html

Both the films released on Friday and are locked in a battle for box office dominance.

Ajay's ""Tanhaji"" is based on the life of Tanhaji Malusare, the military leader of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's army.

While Deepika's ""Chhapaak"", directed by Meghna Gulzar, presents the story of acid attack survivor and activist Laxmi Agarwal.

Deepika's film, however, has been facing the wrath of certain section of people after she visited Jawaharlal Nehru University to express solidarity with the students, who were attacked by a mob on January 5.

Soon after her visit, hashtag #boycottchhapaak started trending on Twitter and several people asked the audience to watch ""Tanhaji"".

When asked about the Twitter war between both the films, Ajay said, ""Who is doing the war? I don't think there is any war. People put their opinion and we should not take it seriously. Both films have good subjects and I hope both the films do well.""

The actor was talking on the sidelines of a special screening of ""Tanhaji"" for school children. Ajay's co-actor Sharad Kelkar, who played the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, accompanied him at the event.

""I am very happy with the response. Media has seen it and they have loved it, hopefully, everyone will love it,"" Ajay said.

""Apart from this (technology), this kind of story, on this scale and technology has not been made, the emotion, the drama, the action has worked as per the media,"" he added.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hope-both--chhapaak--and--tanhaji--do-well--ajay-devgn-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/hope-both--chhapaak--and--tanhaji--do-well--ajay-devgn.html
281,10-1-20,"Facebook Gaming grows 210%, Twitch still leads","Facebook gaming is fast eating into the market share of Amazon's video live streaming service Twitch, registering 210 per cent growth in monthly viewership (year-on-year) in December.

Facebook Gaming had 8.5 per cent market share compared to 3.1 per cent a year earlier, according to data from StreamElements and Arsenal.gg.

Twitch is still the biggest player though, gaining 728 million hours of viewership. However, its market share dropped from 67.1 to 61 per cent.

'Just Chatting' became Twitch's most popular category for the first time while 'xQc' was Twitch's most watched streamer in December.

""While most of the top 10 games are the usual suspects, two notable additions are Path of Exile and Escape from Tarkov,"" said StreamElements in a statement on Thursday.

In November and December, 'xQc' managed to take the pole position, but if last year's constantly changing guards are any indication of what the future holds, it could be anyone else's game in the months ahead, it added.

YouTube Gaming was the second-biggest game streaming service after Twitch, with 27.9 per cen share.

With the idea of expanding into the gaming universe and gaining a stronghold in the Cloud game streaming market, Facebook in December acquired Madrid-based video gaming start-up firm PlayGiga for about $78 million.

Facebook Gaming has released two new games titled Pokemon Tower Battle and Pokemon Medallion Battle on its Instant Games platform.

282,10-1-20,"Huawei launches Mate 30 Pro 5G outside China, enters UAE","After launching the standard Mate 30 Pro in Europe and the Middle East late last year, Huawei has now introduced the 5G variant of the flagship smartphone in the UAE.

This is the first time the 5G mate 30 Pro has launched outside of China.

Despite lacking what many would consider the ""necessary"" official access to Google Mobile Services, the device was confirmed during an official launch event in Dubai, UAE. The Kirin 990 5G-powered device supporting the UAE's local 5G network infrastructure ahead of a January 23 launch at retailers in the region, 9to5Google reported on Thursday.

It is being said that the smartphone, which comes sans Google and its Play services, will fit in pretty well in the region.

Huawei has already opened a Notify Me option on their official website in the region, that should prompt prospective buyers ahead of the official pre-order start date.

Fans will be able to head into selected stores on the January 23 launch to experience the device for themselves. The Huawei Mate 30 Pro 5G will be available in two colour options: Orange and Emerald Green priced at 3899 AED or roughy $1061, the report added.

It is pertinent to note that the only primary difference between the 5G and 4G variant of the Mate 30 Pro is the processor.

The rest of the internals are same, with the impressive camera performance, battery longevity and display all making this quite an enticing prospect.

293,10-1-20,'Chhapaak': Hard truth told the hard way,"""Chhapaak""; Cast: Deepika Padukone, Vikrant Massey, Madhurjeet Sarghi; Direction: Meghna Gulzar; Rating: * * * (three stars)

Meghna Gulzar's ""Chhapaak"" is a hard film to watch. It is brutal in impact, horrifying in its depiction of pain and trauma, and seems a tad too long despite a runtime of just around two hours given the heavy subject at hand.

At the end of it you feel ""Chhapaak"" could only have been this way.

For all its bleak packaging, ""Chhapaak"" isn't a story of despair. Narrating the story of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal (rechristened here as Malti), this can ultimately be seen as a story of hope. The film is about the victim's constant battle to overcome seemingly insurmountable depths of hopelessness, and it underlines the fact that the most important thing in life is life itself.

The story traces about 13 years in the life of Malti, played by Deepika Padukone, from the time she was a class XII student when the bestial attack happened on her, right through the years when she waged a legal battle for justice.

As the story takes off, Malti is struggling to get a job. Seven years into her court case she still hasn't given up hope. She is associated with an NGO that campaigns against acid attacks, and is run by Amol (Vikrant Massey). Through the ordeals of other victims like her, Malti finds a purpose in life -- she works diligently at garnering support for a PIL advocating the ban of the open sale of acid.

Malti's undying effort to rise above the tragedy that has altered her life seems to define the film's title. ""Chhapaak"" translates to the short, sharp noise of a liquid, in this case acid, landing on a surface, in this case the victim's face. The impact of such an action could be momentary, but the effect of such a sound could ring a while longer. The moment of attack in Malti's life is similarly a very brief one, though its outcome resonates through almost everything she does for the rest of her life.

Meghna Gulzar has collaborated with Atika Chohan to write the film. Chohan scripted ""Margarita With A Straw"" in the past, and Meghna's recent efforts have included ""Raazi and ""Talvar"" -- films that revealed superb storytelling acumen.

The build-up of the script is just right. As we are led into Malti's world, and we get a glimpse of what she has gone through, you are fully hooked to the narrative long before intermission point.

However, the later portion should have been tighter. The courtroom drama, particularly, needed better writing. It could have been more engaging. The melodrama spun around the protagonist's romantic track also distracts at times, although Deepika and Vikrant do share the odd moments that act as brief poetic interludes amidst the sombre text.

Meghna Gulzar has written and directed a film that seems wholly tailormade for Deepika, a reason why almost every other character, including Vikrant Massey's Amol, seems underdeveloped. Many of the characters, including Malti's father and brother, vanish midway.

Despite the fact, Massey and Madhurjeet Sarghi (as Malti's lawyer) are impressive.

The stage is left wide open for Deepika to shine in the most demanding role of her career yet. She does meet the demands of being Malti. She is subtle in scenes that require her to merely express Malti's emotions with her eyes or a smile, just as she judiciously avoids hamming even when she has to scream out loud staring at her distorted face before the mirror.

As a commentator, Meghna Gulzar drives home a solid message about a few societal ills the harsh way. As a storyteller, however, she has done better with ""Talvar"" and ""Raazi"". Her new film is disturbing and yet relevant, while jolting you out of your senses. But somewhere down you get the feeling that the filmmaker is too overwhelmed with her subject matter.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-chhapaak---hard-truth-told-the-hard-way-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-chhapaak---hard-truth-told-the-hard-way.html
294,10-1-20,All-round India thrash Sri Lanka by 78 runs to win series 2-0,"Shikhar Dhawan silenced his critics, KL Rahul sizzled as usual and the trio of fast bowlers were intimidating in India's one-sided 78-run victory over Sri Lanka in the third T20 International on Friday, sealing the series 2-0.

India were sent into bat by Sri Lanka captain Lasith Malinga but on a flat track, the hosts managed an above-par 201 for 6, largely due to Dhawan (52 off 36 balls) and Rahul's (54 off 36 balls) opening stand of 97 in little less than 11 overs.

Shardul Thakur (21 not out off 8 balls) used his long handle to a good effect and Manish Pandey (31 off 18 balls) hardly showed any rustiness adding 37 runs in final 2.2 overs to take the score past 200-run mark.

In reply, Sri Lanka managed only 123 runs in 15.5 overs as there was simply no resistance from the islanders with the gulf in class being so evident in a lopsided contest. Eight Sri Lankan batsmen failed to reach double figures with Dhananjaya De Silva (51) and Angelo Mathews (31) adding 68 for the fifth wicket.

They lost four wickets in the Powerplay overs and there was no coming back from that position. It was primarily due to the pace and bounce generated by Jasprit Bumrah (1/5 in 2 overs), Shardul Thakur (2/19 in 3 overs) and the ever-improving Navdeep Saini (3/28 in 3.5 overs), who again bowled an unplayable yorker to get Kusal Perera out.

In fact, skipper Virat Kohli could be lauded for promoting Sanju Samson (6) and Pandey, who have been benched for the longest time. While Samson fluffed his lines, Pandey did his case no harm with a useful knock towards the end.

""One thing was always in the back of my head that down the line somewhere I will get a game and I was ready for it. That's what the coaches told me also. Got my chance today, had a good partnership with Shardul,"" Pandey said after the match.

""I was batting well in the domestic season and the nets, so I knew I had to be ready when I got my chances. I had to deliver. You keep working on yourself.""

Put into bat, Dhawan, who has been under pressure for some time smashed seven boundaries and a six in his 97-run opening stand with the in-form Rahul who also hit an over boundary along with five fours.

However, the hosts suffered a middle-order collapse with Sri Lankan wrist spinners Wanidu Hasaranga (1-27) and chinaman Lakshan Sandakan (3-35) spun their web around the batsmen on a flat track.

But Pandey, playing his first game of the tournament and Thakur once again revelling in his role as a lower-order pinch-hitter (22 not out off 8 balls; 1x4, 2x6) ensured that the hosts crossed 200-run mark.

Rahul set the tone playing a cut shot off rival skipper Lasith Malinga for his first boundary. Dhawan got an early 'life', when Dasun Shanaka dropped one at deep square leg. Rahul, then hit two consecutive boundaries, both drives, off Angelo Mathews as India raced to 22/0.

The visitors introduced off-spinner Dhananjaya De Silva in the fourth over, but Dhawan welcomed him with a four over long-on. Rahul then dispatched a Silva full-toss over long leg for a maximum as India amassed 13 runs in it.

Dhawan changed his gears as he hammered two boundaries in fifth over as India reached team total of 50.

Making optimum use of the life, Dhawan smashed back-to-back fours, slashing one over backward point and another through extra cover off pacer Lahiru Kumara. The duo was coasting along well as India after 9 overs were 82/0.

After two quiet overs, Dhawan smashed Hasaranga over deep mid-wicket for a six.

Soon after completing his 10th T20I fifty, Dhawan perished after giving a sitter to Dhanushka Gunathilika off Sandakan at deep mid-wicket. However his innings certainly will make Virat Kohli's choice of Rohit Sharma's partner difficult for the upcoming Australia series.

Sanju Samson (6) got his much-awaited chance as he was promoted at No 3 and smashed a six on the first ball but was trapped in the front by Hasaranga as India slumped to 106/2.

Sandakan then pegged back the hosts by removing Rahul and Shreyas Iyer (4) in the 13th over as the hosts were in spot of bother at 122/4. While Rahul was stumped, Shreyas gave a return return catch to Sandakan.

However, then skipper Kohli (26 off 17 balls, 2x4; 1x6) and Pandey tried to rally the innings before Kohli and Washington Sundar (0) were dismissed in the 18th over. But Shardul's slogging got India past par-score mark.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-round-india-thrash-sri-lanka-by-78-runs-to-win-series-2-0-2020-01-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/all-round-india-thrash-sri-lanka-by-78-runs-to-win-series-2-0-all-round-india-thrash-sri-lanka-by-78-runs-to-win-series-2-0.html
