0,08-4-20,Diplomacy is the key,"Surgical strikes after Uri and at Balakot have not ended terrorism and infiltration has increased despite lockdown. The post-COVID-19 environment may provide a window to restart process

For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the use of surgical strikes has become the new-normal in resolving intractable problems like cross-border terrorism, black money and Jammu & Kashmir. After Balakot, the airstrikes appear to have turned the page in terrorism but in real terms, little has changed. Black money has altered the “colour” and “terrorism” is just on “pause.” The new invisible enemy is COVID-19. Not even a nuclear strike will conquer this pandemic, which only time, more human lives and a vaccine can cure. Preliminary studies are showing how Coronavirus will change the way we live and cohabit. One can only hope that our existential difficulties with Pakistan will ease and end.

The Government and the Indian Air Force (IAF) celebrated February 26 as the first anniversary of Balakot. Exaggerated claims were made to perpetuate the ones made last year without new evidence and factoring the Pakistani perspective. It is too early to begin rewriting the doctrine and call the airstrikes as “game-changer.” Claims on behalf of the IAF have been made mainly by former Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, through interviews and parts of an internal IAF report that were leaked to the media. His successor, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, simply reinforced Dhanoa’s claims through the same medium at a public event titled, ‘Air Power in No War No Peace Scenario,’ organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies, which was presided by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

The Pakistan Air Force (PAF)’s perspective came from a conference held at the University of Lahore, which was jointly organised by the Centre for Security Strategy and Policy Research and the Centre for Aerospace and Security Studies (CASS). The event was attended by former PAF Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Kaleem Saadat. A report was published in the British Air Force magazine by Alan Warnes through his interviews with retired PAF officers. The PAF’s response to the IAF air strikes was called “Operation Swift Retort.”

On the most provocative, emotional and in India even anti-national question of hitting the target, the IAF has stuck to its claim that it hit the target, though the Crystal Maze 142M missile, which was to produce battle damage assessment, could not be fired. Last year, among others who expressed doubts whether the IAF missiles were on target, was Ashley Tellis of the US’s Carnegie Endowment and Christine Fair of Johns Hopkins University. The Air Force magazine was more direct: Bombs aimed at a religious boarding school at Balakot…hit wooded area a few hundred metres away…all bombs overshot their targets. The CASS report refers to the mishit as “tactical error and technical inadequacy.” Even so, this was the first time after the 1971 war that the IAF bombed Pakistan at Balakot. Perhaps carried away, Bhadauria described the bombings as “the most significant air action of the IAF in over four decades.” That was a bit unkind to the IAF veterans, who took part supporting the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka for 22 months, and the sterling precision IAF bombings at Kargil for over three months.

Bhadauria further said that Balakot has shown that you can use the IAF and still have “escalation control.” He was backed by Army Chief, Gen MM Naravane, who said: “For years we were told that if and when air (force) crosses the International Border (IB), it would escalate to a full-fledged war. Balakot demonstrated that if you play the escalatory game with skill, military ascendancy can be established in short cycles of conflict that do not necessarily lead to war.” Elementary, my dear Watson?

In his paper on air escalation control circulated by the US’ Stimson Centre in 2003 after Operation Parakram, IAF’s Air Commode, Ramesh Phadke, argued that limited air operations against Pakistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) were possible with minimal escalation. Reason: IAF to PAF air balance ratio at that time was nearly 2.5 to 1. Today, that ratio has declined to less than 1.3 to 1 (IAF 28 squadrons versus PAF 21 squadrons). The CASS report further says that the probability of crisis recurrence between India and Pakistan is high and during a crisis, neither side will be able to guarantee controlling or dominating the escalation ladder.

PAF Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan told the Air Force magazine that one lesson for India is not to use air power “flippantly.” He said Operation Swift Retort was inevitable to demonstrate both the resolve and restraint and was designed to de-escalate. Pakistan has found wriggle room in explaining its nuclear bluff being called. The CASS report titled, “Deconstructing Balakot” reads: “Pakistan’s carefully calibrated response strategy served well in dampening the fears in policy analysis that portray that any attack inside Pakistan’s territory would invoke Pakistan’s nuclear threshold. However, Pakistan, through its retaliation, Operation Swift Retort after Indian strikes in Balakot, demonstrated that it has valid conventional means of deterrence to raise the cost of aggression.”

As someone who has studied Pakistan’s military and strategic thought, I do not recall Pakistan seriously threatening the use of nuclear weapons against an enemy airstrike. The four conditions for that were clearly codified by Lt Gen Khalid Kidwai, the intellectual custodian of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal. He had said — and that has not changed till date — that Pakistan would use its nuclear weapons as weapons of ultimate resort in four eventualities: Loss of large territory, especially in Punjab; crippling military attrition; economic blockade; and largescale political destabilisation. None of these conditions was violated by the Balakot airstrikes.

One year on, AFM has said that PAF will be outnumbered but will innovate to outmanoeuvre the IAF. It does not matter what technology the IAF gets, the PAF will have the capacity to defeat it. CASS has said that for the foreseeable future, it will be in retaliatory mode but the threat of the use of force is essential when Pakistan’s support for Kashmir will go beyond political, diplomatic and moral paradigm. Kashmir has been made central to crisis and conflict.

Balakot airstrikes had the potential to escalate and spin out of control. One single factor that enabled the daring and risky operation was a strategic surprise. This is not likely to be replicated. Airstrikes are not the new-normal but a one-off like the ground surgical strikes. Surgical strikes after Uri and at Balakot have not ended terrorism. Infiltration has increased despite lockdown and unprecedented troop density in Jammu & Kashmir.

Pakistan’s support for Kashmir will not cease and despite the internal constitutional changes in Jammu & Kashmir, the dispute will ultimately have to be resolved politically. The post-COVID-19 environment may provide a window to restart the process.

1,08-4-20,Tiger gets it,"Wildlife parks across India have been told to keep a close watch on tiger clusters and report any abnormal behaviour

As if the human dimension of the crisis was not enough, turns out the zoonotic Coronavirus is now affecting the animal world and is jumping from its human host. Sometime ago, Hong Kong had reported the case of a dog owner passing on the virus to his pet which died. But reports were contradictory, claiming that the dog could have also died of old age. Be that as it may, the virus strain, which has been traced genetically to a pangolin at a wildlife market in China, is now jumping from humans to other animals. Following reports that a tiger at Bronx Zoo in New York tested COVID-19 positive because of his asymptomatic handler, India, too, has kept its zoos, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves on the “highest” alert, asking authorities to watch the big cats on a 24x7 basis for any abnormal behaviour and take “immediate preventive measures to stop transmission and spread of the virus from human to animals and vice versa.” With 2,967 tigers, India is currently home to 75 per cent of the global tiger population. Of course, the national lockdown has meant that there is no tourist traffic at our sanctuaries but forest and zoo staff would have to be particularly careful about not spreading the virus in case one among them is remotely affected. Just two days ago, there were reports of how inmates of the Delhi zoo were feeling spirited and free without human spectators. Reports have come in of how penguins had been let loose to meet their other aquatic friends at a US water park. Perhaps, this is a reminder for us that we need to leave the animals in the wild as our proximity to them now is threatening their existence. In fact, the rapid inter-species jump of the virus in such a short time indicates how lethal it can become in threatening existence as we knew it.

This news has predictably sent alarm bells ringing across the globe, especially among pet owners, wondering if they should stay away from their furry friends in case of an infection. The standard distancing protocols hold good for animals as well. But then there is another fear of pets getting infected somehow externally and transmitting the virus to their owners, which has already resulted in a lot of pet abandonment in the US. The Bronx zoo went so far as to say that there is “no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people other than the initial event in the Wuhan market, and no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.” The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also claimed that there is no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person, a fact corroborated by the World Health Organisation (WHO), too. The outbreaks happening now are the result of people passing the virus to one another. Also, various pets have reacted differently to an infection of their owners. Turns out it was in Hong Kong again that one pet was infected by his owner but another dog living in the same home didn’t. More pet cats have been affected though. In fact, they might be more susceptible to COVID-19 than dogs, according to one study conducted in China. As part of experiments, researchers placed infected domestic cats next to cats that were not infected. The researchers later found that one of the previously healthy cats caught the virus after being near the infected felines, most likely through respiratory droplets. Dogs in the study, on the other hand, seemed to be more resistant to the virus and did not pass it to one another. There was no evidence that the cats shed enough of the virus to give it to people. But the study has not been reviewed and had a very limited sample size. Besides, they were given high doses of the virus and all the human-transmitted cases of pets have shown a weakened strain. These are not real life scenarios, according to virologists. At the moment, it is only us who are posing a threat to the animal world. Looks like the animals we claimed and confined on our terms need to be freed from ourselves.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tiger-gets-it-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/tiger-gets-it.html
2,08-4-20,The lion must roar,"Until now, the flagship ‘Make in India’ programme has been a great marketing slogan but will the virus change that?

At the start of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, several Indian companies were extremely concerned as factories began to shut down across swathes of China’s industrial heartland and Indian imports from Chinese companies were growing at a fast pace. Indian imports included not just smartphones or consumer electronics, as most suspect, but everything — from toys to batteries and even fuel-injectors, needed to meet the new stricter BS-VI emission norms for vehicles. Then, of course, there was the worry surrounding the pharmaceutical industry as most of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), required for key drugs, came from China. Indian drug-makers import around 70 per cent of their total bulk drug requirements from China. As supply chains broke, Indian companies began to worry. So even those firms, which until now made ‘Make in India’ a huge success with their export-orientation, were left dependent on Chinese parts, ones that might be small in size and value but were critical. The aftermath of the pandemic will force large economies across the world to realise the fact that while such dependence is a result of a globalised world, so much reliance on China may not be a good thing. Ergo, the US asking India for supply of hydroxychloroquine instead of China is a result of just that. Can Indian policy-makers and diplomats leverage India’s position as a reliable and democratic nation to promote ‘Make in India’ once the world recovers from the pandemic? One certainly hopes so.

However, initially, the Chinese problem for Indian industry might become worse. As factories in China reopen while Indian manufacturing hubs remain closed, there is a lurking fear that once our country reopens, Chinese manufacturers will dump their products on us. It will take weeks, possibly months, for Indian manufacturers to get back their speed even with the reduced demand in the aftermath of the pandemic. Protecting Indian manufacturers from dumping has to be the Commerce Ministry’s number one priority. It must then use this as a pivot to boost manufacturing in India for the rest of the world. India should use its leverage with the White House, no matter what US President Donald Trump said, to get more preferential access to American markets and crucially attract more manufacturing. India should sell itself more aggressively to the rest of the world as well and also ease not just land acquisition but also permissions to establish manufacturing units. The entire global economy has taken a hit over the past three months and 2020 might be a “lost year” economically. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is right, India must look at this as an opportunity rather than an economic disaster. The entire world will be in a state of flux for the next few quarters. India will suffer as well but we are to emerge stronger and more powerful. We can do that only if we take the right steps first.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-lion-must-roar-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-lion-must-roar.html

4,08-4-20,Waqf Boards prohibit graveyards for namaz on Shabe Barat,"



|

Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board and UP Shia Central Waqf Board in separate statements, directed trustees and managing committees of graveyards registered with them to not allow those seeking to offer prayers for Shab-e-Barat on April 9 and instead ask them to pray at their homes.

Shab-e-Barat in Islamic faith means ‘Night of Forgiveness’ or ‘Day of Atonement’ and is considered that the Almighty forgives sinners if they pray on the day.

Muslim clerics also appealed to Muslims to not visit graveyards on Shab-e-Barat in view of the lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus and advised people to remain home and pray for their loved ones.

“In view of the lockdown, the Waqf Board had earlier closed down its mosques for namaz. We have now directed all concerned to ensure that graveyards are not open for common people on Shab-e-Barat on April 9. Employees residing inside graveyard premises have been asked to clean graves and light a lamp at every grave on the particular day,” UP Shia Central Waqf Board chairman Syed Waseem Rizvi said on Tuesday.

UP Sunni Central Waqf Board also urged people not to walk out on the occasion.

“We have directed all employees to prevent people from coming to graveyards due to the lockdown. People should be asked to pray from their homes so that the lockdown is not violated,” said Chief Executive Officer of Sunni Central Waqf Board, SM Shoeb.

Meanwhile, Minority Welfare Minister Mohsin Raza also appealed to Muslims to avoid going to graveyards and shrines for offering tributes to their forefathers on Shab-e-Barat on April 8-9. Raza said that social distancing should be maintained at any cost to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

‘Pray at your house with your family under strict social distancing during Shab-e-Baraat, rather than going to cemetery or shrines,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/waqf-boards-prohibit-graveyards-for-namaz-on-shabe-barat.html
5,08-4-20,Shooter announces reward for Jamaat chief Saad’s arrest,"



|

Acclaimed shooter Vartika Singh had a brush with controversy when she announced a reward of Rs 51,000 for anyone helping in the arrest of absconding Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Mohammad Saad Kandhalvi.

In a video message posted on the social media, Singh asked the government to book the cleric for sedition as he had endangered the lives of millions by hosting a congregation at Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin markaz in Delhi in the midst of coronavirus spread.

“The Tablighi Jamaat chief has thrown the nation into a crisis. Number of coronavirus positive cases have spiked in the country after the Jamaat meet. This man should be arrested without delay. I have announced the reward so that people come forward with inputs on his whereabouts,” she said

Controversy is not new to Vartika Singh. In December last year, she wrote a letter in blood to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, demanding that the four convicts in Nirbhaya gang-rape case be executed by a woman.

Earlier in September 2019, Babri case plaintiff, Iqbal Ansari had alleged that he was attacked by Singh in his house. “She came to my house with a male companion, introduced herself and said that she wanted to speak to me. As I let them in, she started discussing issues like triple talaq and Ram temple. But suddenly, she started hurling charges at me and blamed me for the delay in temple construction. She became aggressive and got into a scuffle with me. My security personnel helped me get away and inform the police,” Ansari had told reporters in Ayodhya and later lodged an FIR at Ram Janmabhoomi police station.

Singh was subsequently taken to Mahila police station in Ayodhya and questioned about the incident.

Meanwhile, Hindu Mahasabha general secretary Puja Shakun Pandey was booked by Aligarh police on Monday for allegedly making inflammatory comments targeting Tablighi Jamaat markaz in Delhi.

An FIR was registered against Pandey on the basis of a complaint filed by former Samajwadi Party MLA from Aligarh, Haji Zameer Ullah Khan.

She was charged with sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc), and 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity hatred or ill-will among classes) of the Indian Penal Code.

Elsewhere in Auraiya, a person claiming to be a journalist was arrested and sent to jail for spreading rumours on social media and obstructing official work on Tuesday.

Shailendra Singh of Anantram Sarai area posted on social media that 4-5 Jamaat members had come from Delhi, were holed up in his neighbourhood but later disappeared on April 5. The post sent shock waves and soon went viral. A complaint about the post was made by Ashfaq Khan of Anantram area after which the police probed the claim but found it to be untrue. Later, the police reached Shailendra’s place only to find him running his tailoring and cosmetic shop despite the lockdown. On being questioned on this score and also the post, he tried to bully the cops, claiming himself to be a journalist.

The police said that the man carried a card of a news channel which expired on November 22, 2019. On cross-checking with information officer, it surfaced that no journalist by that name was registered.

The accused was arrested and sent to jail on charges of spreading rumours on social media, obstructing official work, violating prohibitory orders, negligence and strengthening the possibility of spread of coronavirus by opening shop illegally.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shooter-announces-reward-for-jamaat-chief-saad---s-arrest.html
6,08-4-20,Situation was under control until Jamaat members came: Minister,"



|

Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh is the most sought after man with the dreaded coronavirus trying to spread its tentacles in Uttar Pradesh but he does not really know where the next challenge would come from. When everyone thought that the situation was under control in UP, the spurt in cases among Tablighi Jamaat members turned the situation upside down. Then there was demand of personal protection and tests kits which made the situation difficult for the government.

In a freewheeling interview, the health minister answered questions of The Pioneer and spoke at length on to how the Jamaat members changed the scenario and made the fight against coronavirus tougher.

Excerpts of the interview.

The Pioneer: Uttar Pradesh seems to be grappling to contain the coronavirus which has now spread to many parts of the state. Do you believe that the government was caught napping?



Health Minister: This is a new virus which has afflicted the entire world. No country got enough time to defend itself from the pandemic. India and Uttar Pradesh were no different. Yet, from January 27, we started making arrangements. Gradually, isolation wards were set up in each district and people were quarantined. We identified two COVID hospitals in each district and 10,000 to 12,000 beds were made available in medical colleges.



Pioneer: Experts say that the best weapon is testing and this is very low compared to our population, be it in India or in Uttar Pradesh.



Minister: People do not know but it is a fact that initially all cases used to go to NIV (National Institute of Virology) in Pune for testing. Initially our medical universities were not authorised to make confirmatory tests. In the first phase, that right was given to our medical universities. Then, testing labs came up in Meerut, Gorakhpur, Agra, SGPGI, Lucknow and Aligarh. Initially testing was limited but with opening of new centres, the facility was expanded. Each testing lab has its own capacity and suspects are being tested as per the capacity.



Pioneer: But there are complaints of delay in reports.



Minister: There is no delay. All sampling is done as per chronological order. Generally it takes more than 24 hours as it is a routine. Positive cases are sent for isolation or quarantine as required and effective treatment is started immediately.



Pioneer: Do we have enough protective kits like masks, PPE (personal protection equipment)?



Minister: Initially there was scarcity of PPE and other equipment but the scarcity is not limited to UP alone, it is national and even global. Now, we are preparing PPEs and masks at our own levels. Production has started in India. When epidemic of such a magnitude hits the country, the whole nation gears up to fight against it. We did not depend on others but have started mobilising our resources. So, the paucity of kits is no longer an issue and kits are now being sent to all district hospitals.



Pioneer: Have you identified the hotspots where these kits are most required?



Minister: Yes, we have done that. There are four districts which are hot spots and we are sending equipment there on a priority. There are areas which are less endemic and equipment are on a standby. Besides, we are training doctors and paramedics. This way we have succeeded in controlling the pandemic.



Pioneer: The number of positive cases has all of a sudden gone up, Were you ready for that.



Minister: Recently, the number of cases spiked due to members of Tablighi Jamaat. Before that the situation was under control. Over 50 per cent of positive cases are because of these Jamaat people. Once we identify them, things will start levelling out. Today (Tuesday morning) out of 314 cases, 164 are Jamaat members.



Pioneer: Has this spurt put additional pressure on hospitals and doctors. Experts do not know how high this number can go.



Minister: Yes, it has. We are ready for any eventuality. We have research labs ready. COVID hospitals are ready in each districts. We are going for additional protection equipment. The government has identified many positive cases among Jamaat members and is mapping them. We are trying to identify those whom these people have met. We are putting extra vigil on Jamaat because the spurt is not that high in other cases. We hope it will settle down with time.



Pioneer: As health minister do you foresee that the lockdown can be extended after April 14.



Minister: See, this decision has to be taken by the prime minister. If experts in Delhi feel that the graph is levelling out, then lockdown can be lifted in a phased manner. Districts which have turned into hotspots could be put under lockdown for some more time and it (lockdown) could be lifted from the rest of the state. The call has to be taken by the prime minister, and the Government of India and Government of UP will decide accordingly.



Pioneer: Complaints are pouring in from paramedics and ambulance drivers about non-payment. Has it…



Minister: Look, the strike by a section of ambulance staff has nothing to do with the government. The operation of ambulances is maintained by a private company and their salary is released well in time. The service provider is supposed to pay salary to ambulance staff. About nurses, in some cases like Agra, where the number of COVID-19 positive cases went up, we are giving protection equipment to them. We are redressing problems as soon as we come to know of them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/situation-was-under-control-until-jamaat-members-came--minister.html
7,08-4-20,Don’t demonise a community,"Switch on the TV and all you will hear are reports about the spike in the number of Coronavirus cases. These are being linked to the congregation in Nizamuddin

A rather disconcerting communal atmosphere seems to have enveloped the entire country at a critical juncture when we all should be displaying common sense, unity and the resolve to contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19. We were on top of things till a week or two ago but now the virus seems to be spreading at a faster pace. Till now we have 4,858 confirmed cases and the deaths have spiked to 136. However, we still seem to be doing better than the developed nations with better healthcare infrastructure than us. For instance, the US has 3,67,650 cases and nearly 10,000 fatalities while Spain has 1,36,675 cases and 13,341 deaths and Italy is battling with 1,32,547 cases and has seen 16,523 deaths so far.

If we were to compare ourselves to all these nations, their population density to ours and the number of cases they have, we would realise that till now we have not done so badly.

Yet, switch on the television and all you will hear are alarming reports about the exponential rise in the number of positive cases in the last two weeks. Worryingly, these are being linked to the congregation at the Markaz Tablighi Jamaat at Hazrat Nizamuddin.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, too, is certain that criminal proceedings must be initiated against the maulana of the Markaz. The discourse has become so distorted and warped that it has now assumed a communal hue. The hawkish rhetoric directed against the minority community continues unabated. Compounding this trend are news reports that there have been instances of stone pelting by the community in question against the healthcare professionals and the law enforcement authorities who were urging citizens to get tested. Many videos of these alleged incidents are also doing the rounds on social media. This only galvanises the situation and the social context.

A closer look at the chronology of events portrays a different picture. Were events of this kind held across the country in the days that followed the fateful gathering? The answer is an unequivocal “yes.” On March 16, the Hindu Mahasabha conducted a gau mutra (cow urine) party to “cure” Coronavirus in which thousands of people assembled. The revered town of Tirupati hosted close to 40,000 people on March 18. It closed only the following day. When the “Janta (people’s) curfew” was announced on March 22, we all saw the throng of humanity erupting in ebullient cheers minutes after it ended and thronging the streets. The instructions were clearly articulated earlier. Stand on your respective balconies and praise the diligence of healthcare professionals, the media, the armed forces, police force, essential commodity providers, the sanitation workers and so on, who are on the frontline battling the Coronavirus by going above and beyond their call of duty in these trying times. What did people do instead? They gathered in disturbing numbers, banged plates and distributed sweets. They pranced around the streets in different parts of India. When the people were given a four-hour notice by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the country went into a 21-day lockdown, millions desperately took to the streets to procure vital rations and groceries. The norms of social distancing were conveniently forgotten.

The following day, amid the nationwide lockdown, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath conducted the Ram Lalla movement event. It did receive a lot of flak by the Opposition, the media and on social media and other platforms but the story slowly fell into oblivion and is now far removed from public consciousness.

Migrants who are scattered across the country embarked on an arduous journey home; in large numbers. Could the lockdown have been better planned? Perhaps yes. Was there an acute failure in implementing public policy? Most certainly. Why could not the Centre have foreseen the situation arising and the States not have been cautioned that such a mass migration would take place. The Union Government and the States should have worked together to prevent the humanitarian crisis that eventually unfolded and also increased the risk of a spike in Coronavirus cases across the country. The Centre and States should have planned to have the necessary infrastructure, transport and medical equipment in place to facilitate a smooth transition instead of the chaos which ensued? We are a nation where rural-urban migration is a reality and has been the subject of numerous studies. So could this not have been foreseen?

So is Arvind Kejriwal correct in his assessment in implementing criminal proceedings against the maulana of the centre? After all, the assembly was a flagrant violation of the norms. Should the debate assume a communal context? No. This debate is not about which community conducted a gathering and which conformed to the norms of “social distancing” which mind you was emphasised only recently after the Prime Minister announced the first nationwide lockdown on March 22. The gathering had a number of international visitors which can partially explain the spread of the virus.

But what is disquieting is the lopsided nature of the debate. It is immoral and unfair to attribute the exponential rise in the number of detected cases to one community. This is because there were other leakages in the system and with time we will begin to understand and identify the causations and patterns. We all need to take collective responsibility because the virus, as stated innumerable times, does not discriminate. You could be Prince Charles or Boris Johnson. It will not see your lineage or blue blood before striking you. The Nizamuddin event was a matter of chance with things taking a deadly turn. The debate needs to be more realistic and balanced. However, that said, it is also incumbent upon the community in question to ask its people to behave in a more respectful and cooperative manner with those who are looking after them in quarantine. Reports of roaming around in the nude to harass the women healthcare workers and spitting on people will embarrass and silence even the most neutral of observers.

As it is, there have been so many misconceptions about the virus that even the so-called “educated” people in society have become susceptible to rumours. When my sister-in-law returned from the United Kingdom (UK) on March 9, the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) members demanded to see her travel documents. They did not heed the fact that testing was being conducted at airports and she was anyways adhering to self-quarantine norms. Much to her consternation, the situation was only defused after the intervention of relevant authorities.

There is another unnerving trend which seems to be gripping India. The Nizamuddin episode seems to have polarised the country. At home we have a large live-in staff. At night, post dinner, they all sit upstairs in their bedroom and watch television. Every day the conversations are invariably about how India will descend into chaos and anarchy and Muslims are the ones to be blamed for this mayhem. I try to reason with them and apprise them about similar developments around the country but they appear obstinate and are determined to pursue a chain of thought. I wonder what the broader ramifications of such a thought process will be for the entire nation. What if we have more illiterate people who are being brainwashed and subscribe to this same propaganda? It could have a cascading effect, which could arrest the harmonious progress of a pluralistic nation like ours. After all, this is a once in a lifetime occurrence for many of us and if a certain community is portrayed in poor light then it will take a lot to erase the scars and the pervasive prejudice.

In such uncertain times, when a lot of negative publicity is being hurled at us, it is vitally important that we are circumspect and unbiased in our appraisal of the situation on the ground. Let’s not make this global calamity about a community and isolate them. This is a time to shed grudges and imagine a new world; a world where we all can take a common stand and tread a path together. And hopefully we will be able to surmount this malaise which affected one and all, so that we can once again see each other as human beings who share the same needs and have the same vulnerabilities. The boundaries of caste and creed are only imagined because when tragedy strikes it knows no distinctions.

8,08-4-20,Need infectious disease hospitals,"Given the advances in design and architecture, it is possible to create a hospital within a hospital that can be used during outbreaks

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of multiple global strategies on prevention, containment and management of the disease. Tactical and strategic systemic approaches that nations have evolved include testing, strict lockdowns and contact tracing with a majority adopting a hybrid model of all of these approaches.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been espousing identification, isolation, testing, tracking and treatment as its stratagem for effective handling of national and cross-border outbreaks since the beginning of the crisis. While most nations adopt this approach, a critical unsettled debate revolves around hospital allocation and infrastructure division for Covid versus non-covid patients.

Given the precipitous spread across borders, most national health systems were coming to grips with the pandemic by utilising all available resources to control the outbreak. Hospitals were asked to prepare Covid-19 wards, train staff and buffer up inventories. As in any disaster management protocol, it was important to use all levers to manage the crisis given the geographic spread of the disease. However, a critical differentiator between other disasters and this infectious disease variant was the risk posed to staff and “normal” patients.

The influx in most disaster management cases does not pose a direct and significant threat to the well-being of others in the physical proximity of the relief site. Infectious diseases turn that logic on its head. Not only does the disease hold catastrophic potential for a section of those infected, it also poses consequential risks for others. This has been tragically witnessed in the current outbreak with a large number of health workers having contracted the disease in the line of their work.

The use of personal protective equipment, preventive procedures and physical segregation are foremost in our defence against infectious diseases but they do have their limitations. Additionally, the exposure to positive cases necessitated the protective quarantine of a large number of health workers, just as they were required to be rendering care in the face of the rising numbers.

Second, the risk posed to those seeking care for other ailments poses moral and ethical questions. Already at a higher degree of risk because of their underlying condition, the potential exposure in hospitals treating both covid and non-covid patients can be catastrophic. This risk is further complicated by the fact that lockdowns and the unavailability of hospital beds for non-covid patients become a compromised reality in a pandemic. The need to protect these patients and ensure that an adequate number of precious health workers are available make the case for dedicated covid/infectious disease hospitals stronger.

One approach to circumvent the problem above has been to take any patient at the hospital as a potential covid-positive case. This has an enormous cost attached towards it, in both clinical and monetary terms. Given that global supply lines, even of invaluable medical stock and equipment, remain stressed, the judicious use of preventive goods cannot be adequately underlined.

Given these multitudinous complexities that health systems are only just coming to terms with, there is a major need to find solutions for this and future pandemics. The need for dedicated infectious disease blocks within hospitals and dedicated hospitals themselves is a possible way forward.

Given the advances in hospital design and architecture, it is possible to create modular health infrastructure — a hospital in hospital model — that can be efficiently “turned on” in times of outbreaks. This will help safeguard health resources — manpower, material and beds — and enable better allocation on the basis of the burden of the outbreak and peacetime healthcare needs.

Second, the creation of dedicated hospitals that are used to treat infectious diseases needs to be part of the health systems policy. These institutions would need specialised manpower, equipment and hard infrastructure to adequately manage future outbreaks. The risk pooling of infectious disease loads will help in ensuring that during outbreaks the entire health system machinery is not thrown into existential peril. In peace times, these institutions could double up as research institutes and also carry out outpatients or ambulatory care, which can be relocated in times of acute need.

This approach, though capital intensive, is a dawning reality that systems across the world need to assess, engender and adopt in order to do equitable justice to those who acquire an infectious disease and those who do not, but remain vulnerable due to the state of their health.

9,08-4-20,Religious leaders have a vital role in COVID war,"In India, where religion plays a major role, even in politics, the word of a religious leader will go a long way to help contain the pandemic. It is a welcome measure that they have joined the fight against the virus along with their followers

What is the impact of Coronavirus on religion? As the well-known German philosopher and economist Karl Marx said, “Religion is the opium of the people.” For believers, world over it provides psychological, emotional as well as moral support. However, the Novel Coronavirus is a pandemic, which threatens believers and atheists alike. And it respects no religion.

But the fact remains that Coronavirus or no Coronavirus, worldwide religious leaders have a major moral hold over millions of believers. And irrespective of the faith they belong to, almost all of them have risen to the occasion to contain the Coronavirus pandemic. From Mecca to the Vatican, the doors are shut to the public.

This is quite a commendable achievement for the Church in particular, as Christians are observing the Holy month of Lent that ends on the eve of Good Friday. The number of Christians attending services around the world swells exponentially during this time. But now all services and prayer meetings during the Lenten season are being held online, live streamed or pre-recorded to keep the faithful confined to their homes and help stop the spread of the contagion. Even the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem was closed after a Coronavirus case was confirmed in the area.

However, Pope Francis has urged the priests to “have the courage to get out. Going to the sick to bring them the comfort of God,” after taking due precautions and support the healthcare workers, too. Many countries like Japan, Israel, South Korea and Iran have also shut their religious institutions. In an unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia has temporarily suspended Umrah (the non-mandatory lesser pilgrimage made by Muslims to Mecca). Riyadh also briefly shut the Great Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina.

India, which believes in religion, spirituality, gurus and godmen, has also followed suit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon the religious leaders in the country to take the lead and ask their communities to adhere to the Government’s guidelines to contain the pandemic. Roping in Chief Ministers, too, Modi asked them to convene a meeting of religious leaders across all faiths and urge them to convince their people to adhere to social distancing guidelines.

Significantly, Modi’s appeal came in the wake of the recent religious gathering in Nizamuddin in violation of Government guidelines, which had turned into a major hotspot for spreading the Coronavirus. Nearly 2,100 people were evacuated from Markaz Nizamuddin, the Delhi headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat group and over 1,100 are now quarantined in different parts of the city near the religious centre.

Prior to that, at least 15,000 people might have caught the virus from a Sikh spiritual guru who had returned from Europe and went about preaching in more than a dozen villages in Punjab. He later died of the Covid-19. All the 15,000 attendees are now under quarantine. It was indeed fortunate that communal clashes did not follow this event.

So, how have the religious leaders and institutions responded to Modi’s appeal? For many religious leaders, the decision to shut the doors of their institutions was difficult but they had realised the severity of the pandemic had responded positively. The Christian community in India closed all churches and even held its services on Palm Sunday, which herald the beginning of the Holy Week leading up to Good Friday, services online in keeping with the Prime Minister’s plea for social distancing.

This was a significant move, as with Good Friday, Easter, Ramzan and other festivals approaching it is imperative that communities recognise the need for preventing large gatherings, even after the lockdown is lifted. Thus, despite the belief across all faiths in the country that people need God more in times of trouble, the religious leaders have heeded Modi’s call.

In an unprecedented manner, several temples in India have also closed darshan (viewing) for the devotees. These include the Siddi Vinayakswamy temple, Kamakhya temple, Tirupathi Balaji temple and Puri Jagannath temple among others. Even the Ganga aarti (worship) at the ghats of Varanasi and the Garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of Kashi Vishwanath temple

have been made off-limits to the public.

Setting aside their differences and responding to the Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s appeal, the religious leaders in the State, including Cardinals, Bishops, Muslim religious leaders and leaders of Hindu communities issued a joint statement on March 20, asking the people to “stand together with determination and to overcome the trauma caused by the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus.”

Hundreds of people from various religions came together in Patna to offer an all-religion prayer, to stop the outbreak of Covid-19. They offered prayers in their own ways on March 17 to seek divine intervention.

Spiritual gurus and godmen, who depend on huge political support, are also not lagging behind in their efforts to do the Government’s bidding. Spiritual leaders including Amritanandamayi, Jaggi Vasudev and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar have shut their ashrams and asked their followers not to congregate until the pandemic is over.

“The virus knows no caste, creed or religion. Let us beat the virus,” is their dictum to their followers.

They also offer remedies like yoga and meditation to their followers. They are gurus of the rich and the poor, alike. Many of them command huge following at home and abroad. Their followers include politicians, actors, sportsmen and bureaucrats. Many like the Baba Ramdev are also successful entrepreneurs and run massive business empires.

Hence, the role that spiritual leaders can play in getting the word out about public health measures is considerable.

In India, where religion plays a major role, even in politics, the word of a religious leader will go a long way to help contain the pandemic. It is a welcome measure that they have joined the fight against the virus along with their followers.

After all India is home to innumerable gurus and god-men — both genuine and fake.

13,08-4-20,Bokaro Zoo on alert after tiger tests COVID +ve in New York,"Bokaro Zoo at Jawaharlal Nehru Biological Park (JNB) on high alert after a tiger in a New York zoo tasted positive of Coronavirus infection. The Zoo (JNB) is maintained by Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) management.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Biological Park of Bokaro spread over 127 acres of land having more than 437 animals and birds with more than 75,000 trees and medicinal plants was set up on 14 January 1989 with an objective of education, conservation, captive breeding, research including entertainment.

On Monday the Central Zoo Authority issued a directive to all the zoological parks across the country to keep a 24x7 watch on animals through CCTV and report any abnormal behaviour amid reports of the spread of the Coronavirus from humans to animals, informed a zoo authority.

The Centre also issued an alert across for national parks of the country to step up vigil to stop the spread of COVID-19 among wild animals, he said.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests also issued directives to national parks, sanctuaries and tiger reserves to reduce the human-wildlife interface and restrict the movement of people as part of preventive measures to stop the spread of the virus. The Central Zoo Authority said mammals, especially cats, ferrets and primates, need to be carefully monitored and fortnightly samples of suspected cases should be sent to designated animal health institutes for Covid-19 testing, stated in the directive. “Sick animals should be isolated and quarantined,” it added.

The samples can be sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease in Bhopal, the National Research Centre on Equines in Haryana’s Hisar and the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, it stated.

It further instructed that no keeper at any zoo should be permitted to be in close proximity to the animals without wearing personal protective equipment and should maintain minimal contact with animals while feeding them.

All zoological parks are to follow the bio-containment and safety measures to contain the spread of the virus as per the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the letter said.

“Zoological parks are advised to coordinate with designated nodal agencies of the government for public health response and permit screening, testing and surveillance as and when required by the nodal agency,” authority added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bokaro-zoo-on-alert-after-tiger-tests-covid--ve-in-new-york.html
14,08-4-20,Pigeon pox has no history of affecting humans: Vet,"A case of Pigeon pox is claimed to have been found in Ranchi. However the biggest consolation at this time of coronavirus is that pigeon pox is no zoonotic, which means this disease is not transmitted to human beings.

A noted veterinary doctor Ajay Kumar of Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park Ormanjhi, said, “A couple of days back an acquaintance of mine sent me a photograph of a dead pigeon in Ranchi where signs of pigeon pox were too evident.”

Dr Ajay said, “I have not personally come across any such dead pigeon afflicted with pox so far and my opinion on pigeon pox was based on the tell tale symptoms/ signs that I found on the carcass of the pigeon whose photograph was sent to me.”

“Pigeon pox is a viral infection. It is contagious among its species. Its infection cannot jump to any human being at all. Its infection is only intra afflicting which means afflicting pigeons only,” said Kumar asking people not to imagine anything bad for human beings in the back drop of this pigeon pox.

Ajay said a pigeon pox has no distant connection with any bird flu at all.

“It is a lock down period. Bird watching has gone up. People have now more time to see, which bird has come and perched on their roofs. Had this been not the lock down phase no one would have cared to notice the death of this pigeon and taken pains to shoot it with camera for diagnosis of the disease,” added Kumar.

Pigeons are either feral or pet. A feral pigeon is all free and has no owner and if it gets down with pox this feral pigeon is to fend for itself. Its self cure mechanism is its tool to battle this pox reminded Ajay.

Pigeons are gregarious birds and tend to live in flock.

Ajay said as pigeons have a flock of its own and an infected pigeon has the potential to infect other pigeons.

About the pigeon pox Ajay said, “It is caused by pigeon pox virus. Mosquitoes are the villains. Dirty water which the pigeon drinks trebles the risk of its getting infected with pox”

Pigeon pox has no history of afflicting the two most common birds sparrow and crow reminded this vet doctor. The pigeon pox strikes face, mouth and feet of pigeon most.

Ajay Kumar has an advice for the roof top families. The advice is to keep fresh water in a flat utensil and dissolve any higher antibiotic in the water so when a pigeon comes no matter infected or not infected this water if it drinks will be a health cover for it.

About the disposal of infected carcass of the pigeon Ajay said, “ The best course is to burn it. If cremation is not done then bury it too deep so that no other animal digs it out.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pigeon-pox-has-no-history-of-affecting-humans--vet.html
15,08-4-20,Palamu fine-tunes preparations to combat medical emergencies,"Nearly 20 cases so far have tested negative in Plamu but DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahari says there is no room for any complacency and nobody, whether belonging to health sector or food sector, can afford to have even a minute’s leisure time.

Agrahari said, “We are planning to hold a mock drill to ensure that in the event of any medical exigency how best medical care can be made available to a case who tests positive in case and how best the human habitation of that locality is kept safe and at bay from this.”

The DC said there is QRT (quick response team) to take on the crisis if arises. “We have done a lot of meticulous brainstorming over how to go about if such an emergency arises but now we want to put on the ground to see how quick and how flawless we can handle such an emergency,” he said.

Containment and creating buffer zone are the first two important tools said the DC adding, “The containment length is 3 kms while a 7 km area is turned into a buffer zone with contiguous human population to be kept most strictly indoors.” Asked if Palamu administration will use drones to track down the flouters of the lock down, Agrahari said, “We may think of it later on.”

The DC has appealed to the minority community to have their Shabe Barat observed in their homes and not to throng the grave yards at all which will breach lock down.

About the people in home quarantine he said those who have completed its14 days without any issue of health will be back home while for people in isolation there will be more health care for them. Sources said there is adherence to lock down 86 to 87 per cent in Palamu district during peak hours like buying vegetables, moving from one end of the town to the other to buy fodder for cattle, bringing in medicines, milk while the same adherence goes up to 92 to 95 per cent after 8 at night here.

A car owner here had no qualms of conscience when he took out his car in the lock down saying if he does not do this his car battery will discharge.

Sources said the 100 per cent adherence to lock down here in Palamu is fractured mostly by the bikers despite detention of as many as 200 to 250 bikes in all these days of lock down around the district.

SP Ajay Linda said, “I have directed my officials to be strict with violators of lock down but with sensitivity not thrown to the wind.”

About mock drill which appears to be in the pipeline here Linda said cops are in total readiness for this.

DC also conceded that before going for this mock drill administration will make aware people that it is a pre exercise wherein the stake holders arethe case, civil official, police official and health official only and nothing like a real meeting with any health crisis. Preparedness requires exercise and the mock drill is just a precursor to it he added.

Sources said police administration here had used drones during the procession of Durga Puja festival at Chando, Bakoriya , Satbarwa, Haidernagar and Japla and here the drone effect was most tremendous since the people in procession feared they were being photographed from the sky.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu-fine-tunes-preparations-to-combat-medical-emergencies.html

18,08-4-20,UPCC chief notices to two dissidents Warns of actionv,"



|

After a two-month silence, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ reacted to his opponents by serving notices on two dissidents and asking them to reply within 24 hours or face action.

The two leaders were running a WhatsApp group by the name of ‘Shoshit Congress Savarn’ to attack the UPCC chief over his reported sidelining of upper caste leaders, especially Brahmins.

Interestingly, many senior Congress leaders were in the group, while some quit fearing action from the UPCC chief.

The UPCC chief got the notices served on Konark Diskhit and Gaurav Dikshit through UPCC disciplinary committee member Shyam Kishore Shukla on Monday night.

Shukla said that at a time when the country was facing the coronavirus threat and each Congressman was out to serve the needy, they (Konark, Gaurav) were still engaged in uploading incorrect and negative facts about the party and using derogatory and objectionable content against the UPCC chief.

“Their conduct amounts to indiscipline and hence they were served notices and given 24 hours’ time to reply to the charges failing which they will face disciplinary action and could be expelled from the Congress, “ Shukla said.

Reacting to the notice on Tuesday afternoon, Dikshit said that he received the notice through mail on Monday night but pointed out that he was given just 24 hours to reply instead of seven days as per the party’s constitution.

“It seems that the UP Congress chief has made up his mind to further harass upper caste leaders by removing them. Before the notice was served, I received calls from several leaders who told me that Rahul Gandhi was no more the Congress chief and that they could not meet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and hence it was better that we meet Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ and sink differences. But I decided against bowing to Lallu and will take the fight further in order to save the Congress,” Dikshit said.

Earlier, Lallu shot into controversy by giving 24 hours’ times to senior Congress leaders, some of them former ministers, before expelling them from the party. The fault of these leaders was that they convened a meeting in the house of a former Congress MP in Gomti Nagar to discuss how the party could be revived by balancing the participation of youngsters and veterans.

In another goof up, Lallu revoked the expulsion of former minister Ramkrishna Dwivedi, who was hospitalised in a critical state, saying that he was withdrawing the expulsion on “humanitarian grounds”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/upcc-chief-notices-to-two-dissidents--warns-of-actionv.html
19,08-4-20,Akhilesh laments farmers’ woes due to lockdown,"



|

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the farmers of the state were the worst victims of lockdown clamped to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

“First the farmers suffered huge losses due to unseasonal rains and hailstorm and now they are unable to harvest Rabi crop. Even if they manage to harvest the crop, there are no buyers as wheat procurement centres to be set up by the government are yet to start operation. This will force them to make distress sale to middleman and wholesale traders. The UP government must act as per its promise and ensure that the farmers are able to sell their produce at minimum support price announced by the government,” Akhilesh said in a statement issued in Lucknow on Tuesday..

The former chief minister of UP said that government purchase centres were not operational and roads for transport of harvested crop were closed.

“Farmers with over 50,000 quintals of wheat have somehow reached the mandis and they have been running from pillar to post to sell their produce,” he said.

The SP chief alleged that several farmers committed suicide in the past three years due to anti-farmer policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party government.

“On one hand, the BJP government announced that it would double farmers’ income by 2022 and provide one-and-half times the cost of produce, but on the ground the situation is in stark contrast to the announcement as farmers are not even getting minimum support price,” he alleged.

The SP chief demanded that the state government provide compensation to farmers for the loss of crops and clear cane dues immediately. He also said that purchase centres be immediately opened for farmers and facilities be provided to them for reaching these centres.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-laments-farmers----woes-due-to-lockdown.html
20,08-4-20,"UP govt to scrap LAD funds of legislators, slash salary by 30 pc","

|

Toeing the Central government line, the Uttar Pradesh government is likely to slash the salaries of legislators and minister by 30 per cent and scrap the legislature local area development fund for the next two fiscals.

A senior government official said that the state government was mulling to adopt the Union government’s formula and slash the salary of legislators and ministers by 30 per cent and suspend the legislator local area development fund for the next two years.

Legislators in the state get Rs 3 crore as Vidhayak Nidhi per year.

The government is expected to bring an ordinance in this regard for which a cabinet proposal will be approved through circulation soon and the money will be transferred to the Covid Care Fund set up by the chief minister

Opposition parties have supported the state government move but said that the process should be transparent and the government should make public the expenditure for prevention of COVID-19 virus in the state through this fund.

21,08-4-20,"UP to increase COVID-19 testing, start 14 new labs","



|

Aiming to intensify COVID-19 testing, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced that the Uttar Pradesh government would increase testing facilities by adding 14 more labs and setting up sample collection centres in all 75 district hospitals of the state.

He also said that the government would decide on lifting lockdown only after evaluating the ground situation on April 10 or 11.

Addressing media persons through video conferencing in Lucknow on Tuesday, Yogi said that the government had initiated all steps to secure the life of 23 crore people of the state and had launched the biggest campaign to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus in UP.

Expressing concern over the rising number of coronavirus positive cases in the state in the last five days, Yogi said that among these cases, more than 60 per cent were members of Tablighi Jamaat.

“It is a matter of concern and we are going through the tedious task of identifying all infected persons in the state and isolating them. Unfortunately, many of them are avoiding health officials. They should understand it is a disease and they should get treatment at the earliest. They are not only risking their lives but also those of others in society,” he said.

The chief minister said that when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the country, there was no testing lab in the state, but now 10 labs were fully functional.

“These labs will be upgraded to Level 3 to ensure research facilities there and it will help the state in the long term,” he said.

“We will set up Level 2 labs in 14 medical colleges of the state that are not operational till date. For this, a committee under principal secretary (medical and health) has been set up to expedite purchase of equipment and complete other formalities at the earliest,” the chief minister said.

Besides, Yogi said, COVID-19 sample collection centres would be set up at all district hospitals so that any sick person needing help could go there and get tested. He said officials had been authorised to start working on this line.

The chief minister said that the recently formed Covid Care Fund was getting funds from legislators, common man and even corporate houses.

“The money collected in the Covid Care Fund will be used on improving infrastructure of testing labs and COVID hospitals. We will also use this for manufacture of personal protection equipment (PPE), N95 masks, ventilators, infra and thermal anlysers,” he said.

Yogi also elaborated on the work of the 11 committees set up to deal with the coronavirus crisis and said that the officers had been asked to ensure that there was no shortage of food in the state.

“Principal secretary (horticulture) has been asked to ensure food and shelter facilities for animals. Dairy industry has also been asked to ensure supply of milk to the common man. Besides, officials have been asked to take care of stray animals like monkeys and dogs,” Yogi said.

“The police have been working to ensure effective lockdown but we need to protect them from the coronavirus. In the last few days, the police identified members of Tablighi Jamaat. Similarly, CM Helpline has done a tremendous job by connecting with gram pradhans and different departments. It has helped in identifying outsiders. The input was passed on to departments concerned. This system has helped us a lot,” the chief minister said.

“We are working to contain the spread of coronavirus and I am sure that we will succeed in our endeavour. The only treatment in the present circumstance is social distancing. Rumours should be avoided as some people feel that this disease cannot affect them. Whosoever violates precautionary measures will suffer,” Yogi said.

When asked about the scheduled lifting of the lockdown on April 15, Yogi said that it was too early to comment on the issue.

“We will take a call on this issue after April 10 or 11 and go by the directives of the Union government,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-to-increase-covid-19-testing--start-14-new-labs.html

40,08-4-20,‘Waive 3 months’ bank interest for MSMEs',"The EFCAI has urged the Union Finance Minister for waiver of three months' bank interests on Term Loans and Working Capital or to consider a moratorium of 6 months, after which the accumulated amount calculated at 50% of existing rate of interest can be paid in next 24 months.

The organisation thanked the Government for shifting MSMEs' EMIs and Bank interest by three months.

""Shifting of EMIs by three months could be a good idea but no interest should be charged on this amounts as it will be extremely difficult for MSMEs to service the Term Loan or Working Capital interests. What MSMEs also need is liquidity support,"" said EFCAI working chairperson Harendra N Mahapatra.

It said 50 per cent of the existing limit to a maximum of Rs 1 crore can be sanctioned as working capital for all MSMEs with GST registration and with a turn over not exceeding Rs 25 crore per annum.

44,08-4-20,"‘Steam, alcohol inhalation may prove better’","There is no specific treatment for disease caused by novel coronavirus or Covid-19. The virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally being declared as pandemic by the WHO.

Analysis of physicochemical parameters revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro polypeptide is 306 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 33,796.64?Da and a GRAVY score of -0.019, categorising the protein as a stable, hydrophilic molecule capable of establishing hydrogen bonds. These viruses are sensitive to UV rays and heat also can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents including ether (75 per cent), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform except for chlorhexidine.

Designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is difficult because viruses use the host's cells to replicate. This makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism's cells.

Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral drugs is due to viral variation.

A new study shows that moderate drinkers on average have lower risk of lung disease than non drinkers. Drinking alcohol moderately, of course not in a regular habit, may help lungs to breathe easy, says Dr Manas Ranjan Senapati, Dean, Science, BPUT, and Professor of Chemistry in Trident Academy of Technology, Bhubaneswar.

52,08-4-20,State fails to curb human-elephant conflicts: WSO,"While on Monday, four people were killed in three separate incidents of elephant attack within hours in Padampur of Bargarh, since April 1, four have perished in similar incidents.

Notably, on April 1, three of a family in Jujumora block of Sambalpur district were killed; and on April 4, a 60-year-old woman was killed in Hatadihi block in Keonjhar district.

The eight human deaths in just six days are ominous signs that this year may be worse than previous year which recorded the highest number of 115 human deaths caused by elephants ever in the State.

""Odisha’s Forest department has done precious little to contain the rise in conflict. They are clueless about mitigating the conflict. While previous mitigation plans provided by experts more than two decades ago remain on paper; more and more studies are carried out by external consultants. One private consultant body has been awarded a contract for Rs 3.67 crore to provide a wildlife conflict management plan but it has yet to submit his report though five years have passed.

The alarming casualty figures shows that Odisha’s control over human-elephant conflict is dismal though crores of rupees is being spent on mitigation measures, alleged the Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO).

The WSO first wrote to the IGF and Director (Project Elephant), Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on January 21, requesting for intervention to control the spiralling number of human casualties. A month later, on not getting a response and with more reports of human casualties, a reminder was sent to Project Elephant on February 24 reiterating that the situation in Odisha is extremely worrying and the mitigation measures being carried out in Odisha is hopelessly inadequate.

A request was made once again to immediately constitute an Expert Committee consisting of experienced elephant experts and conservationists to assess the situation, identify the reasons behind human kills, and, suggest short term and long term solutions. However, they have failed to take cognizance of the burning problem in Odisha, lamented WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty.

""The WSO has been specifically pointing out how illegal and rampant quarrying by night blasting, operation of crushers in forest areas and movement of thousands of trucks and tractors in Hindol and Sadar block of Dhenkanal have prevented easy elephant movement.

They are forced to nearby villages where they have killed humans. Similarly, lack of radio collaring of aggressive tuskers in Angul district that has large coal mines has prevented daily monitoring. Our repeated pleas since four years to the Forest Minister to review elephant conflict every month has gone unheeded so far,"" Mohanty added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-fails-to-curb-human-elephant-conflicts--wso.html

Cess has shown a marginal growth of 1.44 per cent with Rs 5722.58 crore collected in 2019-20 against Rs 5641.41 crore in 2018-19.

However, growth in IGST continues to show negative trend with a collection of Rs 8707.38 crore during 2019-20 against Rs 9006.15 crore collected in 2018-19. Thus, a negative growth rate of 3.32 per cent occurred.

The adverse impact of COVID-19 can be seen from the fact that f?in March 2020 the gross GST collection remained almost stagnant as a mere 0.27 per cent was recorded. However, the annual gross GST collection (CGST, IGST, SGST & Cess) during 2019-20 showed a positive growth of 10.11 per cent with total collection coming to Rs 29,677.26 crore against Rs 26,951.7 crore in preceding year.

The SGST annual growth rate of 24.46 per cent achieved by Odisha is the highest growth rate amongst the major States.

During 2019-20, as many as 49,249 new taxpayers were brought to the GST fold in Odisha. Amongst non-GST revenue sources, collection of VAT on petroleum products was Rs 5679.25 crore registering a growth of 0.18 per cent. Similarly, collection of VAT on alcohol for human consumption in 2019-20 was Rs 1,767.44 crore, collected at a growth rate of 8.37 per cent. The professional tax collection also showed a growth rate of 5.54 per cent with collection of Rs 215.10 Crore.

73,08-4-20,Social Media: Distinct mode of communication in social distancing,"The people of India were deeply influenced when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first addressed the nation about the scale of COVID-19 crisis and announced Janata Curfew which was later converted into 21-day nationwide lockdown in public interest. In his address to Nation whether on DD National or on Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio (AIR) he stressed on the need of social distancing as the main measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and also for better and healthy tomorrow.

Humans by their very nature are social. May be keeping this in mind the PM also urged people not to have emotional and human distancing while observing social distancing. A question which arises is how to reduce interpersonal distance while maintaining social distancing. One of the answers lies in prudent, proactive and purposeful use of social media as these days it has emerged more as an interpersonal mode of communication rather than a mere medium of information and entertainment.

People posting their pictures of “work from home” on Facebook, donation in Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF) #PMCARES is trending on Twitter, people cooking food and posting on Instagram and throwing “cooking challenge” to their friends on social media, various jokes on WhatsApp on lock down and last but not the least never ending web series have just shown all of us that how social media tools have kept us be in touch even though we are not actually touching each other. Facebook and You Tube were flooded with “Thaali & Taali Tribute” videos of people showing their solidarity towards people working to keep all of us safe at our homes risking their own lives. COVID-19 web application showing the status of present cases in India helping people to be informed in this era of less contact with outside world. YouTube and other social media platforms are flooded with workout videos and people are throwing “fitness challenge” to each other.

Video chat/call on Skype, WhatsApp and other platforms to know the wellbeing of family and friends has become normal in our lives. People are donating contributions in PM CARES fund and other governmental funds through digital payment and posting it on social media to inspire others too. This is yet another shining example of social bonding via social media platforms.

MyGov Corona Hub has become a one stop destination of authorised information and feedback. #IndiaFightsCorona is one of the hash tags that are trending on social media. MyGov Corona Hub also launched an online competition on its web portal for people to suggest possible solutions to tackle the problem of spread of COVID-19 and the possible solutions. The competition also had the provision of Rs one lakh cash prize.

Most of us have heard the caller tune while we were on mobile calls that informs us about preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19. This is an innovative and yet very timely initiative of the government that deserves a big round of applause. Even Facebook has also started COVID-19 Information Centre for latest updates. Keeping in mind the reach, access and penetration among masses of these social media platform this idea can contribute to a greater extent to keep people well informed and updated. People are posting dedicated display picture of “Stay home…Stay safe” to mark their solidarity with this lockdown process.

Radio has also emerged as a vital communication tool in present scenario. The PM in his video conference with noted radio anchors of the country had urged them to play an important role in spreading awareness through radio to stop the spread of COVID-19.

The instantaneous nature of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat, has created a new way for us to connect and share information. Today we interact, comment and share anything, anytime. According to a recent media report of Economic Times, mobile internet usage had increased around 10 per cent on average since the start of the lockdown, barring metros like Delhi and Mumbai which have seen as little as 3 per cent rise. The small telecom circles have recorded higher growth at 15 per cent.

Due to present lockdown people are compelled to stay at home and internet surfing has become one of the effective ways of engagement. At the same time when elderly, young persons and kids are together spending time at home which in all likelihood could enhance the level of digital literacy among who were till recently not very enthusiastic about using social media.

74,08-4-20,Every grain would be procured: CM assures farmers,"Amid apprehension by farmers on Wheat procurement ahead of the harvest, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday assured the farming community that every grain of their produce will be procured and purchase centres have been increased this time to allow “staggered” procurement in view of the lockdown.

Khattar said farmers who store their harvested wheat crop for longer durations may be given incentives.

For the procurement, which normally begins on April 1, the state government this time has said for wheat it will begin from April 20 and for mustard from April 15.

“We have written to Centre that farmers should be paid ''holding incentive'' for delaying bringing their produce to ’mandis’ (wholesale markets),” Khattar told reporters through video conference. He said as against 433 purchase centres and mandis last time, this season these have been increased to 2,000 to allow staggered procurement of wheat, which is likely to last over a month.

The chief minister said ''Arhitiyas'' will be involved in procurement process. The government will digitally transfer payments to them who in turn will pay it to the farmers for the crop procured, he said.

However, for mustard, farmers will be directly paid by the government, Khattar said. “For mustard we will make purchases from April 15 and for this, from 66 mandis earlier it will be 140 mandis this time… We are committed to procuring every single grain of farmers,” he said.

The chief minister said that in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, cloth masks will be made available to farmers when they come to mandis and purchase centres.

He appealed to farmers to voluntary donate at least the sum they would earn on 1-5 kg per quintal of their crop produce. He said that all sections of society, including state government employees, have made contributions towards

the Haryana COVID Relief Fund.

Khattar said that while all legislators had decided to donate their month's salary for the COVID Relief Fund, the governor, the deputy CM, assembly speaker, deputy speaker, ministers and him from their discretionary quota have contributed amount ranging between Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore towards the Consolidated Fund of India, making it total of Rs 51 crore.

On the farmers issue, he assured that despite the lockdown they will not be allowed to face any problem when it comes to movement of agricultural equipment, including tractors and combine harvesting machines.

With many migrant workers from the state having left for their hometown in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar over a week ago in the wake of lockdown, he said directions have been given in districts to make labourers under the MGNREGA.

He admitted that farmers will have to cooperate this time as availability of labour was going to be a problem.

On March 28 and 29, many migrant labourers who were present in Haryana or came from neighbouring states like Punjab crossed through the state to go to their hometowns in view of their apprehensions about the lockdown.

“Some left (for their native states) and some were stopped. Today, there are nearly 15,000 migrant labourers who have been accommodated in our relief camps. These 15,000, if they want to go their factory or state where they work, if they want to go in a safe manner, we can make efforts to send them back by following all norms pertaining to COVID-19 so that sufficient distance is maintained in buses, like in each bus 20-30 people can be accommodated and sent to their homes. During the past two days 1,000 such people have gone back,” he said.

Khattar also said that state government had taken steps to provide food and ration to poor sections including daily wagers and so far, 55 lakh food packets and 3.5 lakh ration packets have been distributed.

On the Haryana COVID Relief Fund, he said there was no coercion on employees, but so far 1.82 lakh employees have come forward on their own making healthy contributions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/every-grain-would-be-procured--cm-assures-farmers.html

80,08-4-20,U’khand faces shortage of PPE kits?,"With ever increasing number of COVID-19 patients in Uttarakhand, the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits could prove a big impediment for the authorities in their ongoing battle with the virus. The PPE kits are the basic requirement to safeguard the health and sanitation workers that are at forefront of the battle against the disease. Though the authorities here are tight-lipped about the demand of the PPEs in the state, it is learnt that the Government hospitals where the patients of the COVID-19 are admitted and where suspected patients of the disease are kept and examined are already facing difficulty in getting the PPE kits. Many private hospitals and clinics are not opening their OPDs for patients due to the shortage of the PPE kits. It is estimated that the state health department has about 8400 PPE kits in its store which is not enough to meet the ever increasing demand of the hospitals. It is pertinent to mention here that the PPE kit once used is discarded after some time which means the health workers treating the COVID -19 patients and suspected patients need regular supplies of PPE. The sanitation workers giving services in the wards where such patients are kept also need this protection. In the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital which is functioning as a dedicated centre for COVID-19 in Dehradun about 100 PPE kits are required daily. The hospital has 15 patients of the disease has many suspected patients.

Apart from PPEs, the increase in number of patients would also expose the shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facility and ventilators in the state. The department has about 455 beds in ICU and 318 ventilators at present.

The additional secretary, health and family welfare department, Yugal Kishore Pant said that the all the dedicated COVID hospitals have adequate supply of PPE kits and N-9 masks. He said that 8400 PPE kits, 29000 N- 95 masks and 6.23 lakh triple layer masks are at present available in the state.

The director general (DG) of state health services, Dr Amita Upreti said that the state has adequate number of PPE kits and more such kits would be made available when required.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/u---khand-faces-shortage-of-ppe-kits-.html

Briefing the media on Tuesday Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the “flower and paan cultivators have been facing tremendous hardship during the lockdown. So the Government has decided to open flower markets and paan shops from Wednesday.”

The police will not stop the vehicles bringing flowers and betel leaf, she maintained. Apart from this the Government has also decided to afford partial relief to the bidi industry specifying only those domestic units will run where not more than seven people are involved in making bidis.The bidi workers have been asked to make their products at home while agents have been allowed to collect the bundles maintaining social distance.

The “kishan Mandis” or the farmers’ markets will continue to function helping the farmers to deal in their products, she said reminding “extreme caution will have to be maintained while you are in the mandis.”

Banerjee’s decision came amid reports of the State Government identifying seven corona hotspots where “intense programme is being taken to curb the spread of the disease.” The Chief Minister said “we have identified seven areas of corona infections and we are working intensely to keep things under control.”

Amid mutual mud-slinging between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress over the way the crisis is being handled by the State Government with the saffron outfit accusing the Chief Minister of suppressing facts regarding the number of deaths, Banerjee on Tuesday said that “thus far there has been 5 Corona-related deaths and 69 cases of infections.”

She said while 13 people have been cured and that out of the 69 infected people 60 came from 9 families.

Expressing fear that there could be massive influx of migrant workers stuck up in different states should the lockdown was lifted suddenly the Chief Minister said that such workers will be quarantined in “safe houses” for the period when mandatory isolation is required.

“In case the lockdown is lifted suddenly there will be massive influx of workers who are stuck up in other States. Naturally social distancing will be violated and causing health hazards. Keeping this in view the State Government will keep them at quarantine centres,” Banerjee said adding however that she would “call these places ‘safe houses’ instead of quarantine centres.”

On adding the various expenditure heads, it is found that the total declared by the party is Rs 5.594 crore less than the actual amount. This reinforces our demand for proper scrutiny of the parties’ audited accounts by the I-T department,” the report stated.

The BJD reported the highest increase in its income of Rs 235.19 crore followed by YSR-C and TRS which declared a total increase of Rs 166.84 crore and Rs 161.44 crore respectively, between FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19.

With the fresh deaths, the total number of Covid-19 deaths has mounted to 64 ever since the pandemic claimed first life on March 17.

The total number of infected cases has climbed to 1018 in the state. One can deduce from the fact that a majority of persons who have tested positive for p*andemic during the last few days had no history of international travel that the pandemic has begun to spread through contacts in a big way.

In its daily bulletin, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said: “The rise in the cases is seen because of 55 patients are diagnosed amongst contacts in high risk containment area as a result of screening clinics and vigorous contact tracing efforts by the health teams of BMC and all high risks contact are given timely attention and tested. Also all the contacts who are tested positive are already being isolated, treated and followed up”.

Mumbai, which has borne the maximum brunt of the pandemic both in terms of deaths and infection, recorded a maximum of 116 cases on Tuesday, while as many as 18 persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Pune. Nagpur, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar reported three infected cases each, while Thane and Buldhana recorded two positive cases each. Satara, Sangli and Ratnagiri registered one positive case each.

130,08-4-20,"Sonia writes to PM, suggests five austerity steps to fight Covid-19","Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday once again wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this time suggesting the adoption of five austerity measures to generate financial resources as the nation fights the Covid-19 pandemic.

From suspending the ambitious Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project to completely banning Government and PSUs’ print and electronic media advertisements; from scaling down the Government’s expenditure budget by 30 percent to withholding all foreign trips of the PM, Ministers, CMs and government officials and lastly, transferring the money under the ‘PM-Cares’ fund to the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund, for reasons of transparency among others.

Suggesting that the Government immediately suspend the Rs 20,000-crore ‘Central Vista’ beautification and construction project, Sonia said: “At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnosis along with equipping our frontline workers with PPEs and better facilities.”

“I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained,” she said.

She also asked the Prime Minister to impose a complete ban on media advertisements by the government and PSUs for a period of two years, with advisories for issues relating to public health being the sole exception.

Sonia’s letter comes a day after the Modi government promulgated an ordinance to cut salaries of the MPs, Union ministers and the PM by 30% for a year. The government also announced to suspend the MP-LAD fund scheme for the next two years.

Welcoming the government’s decisions, Sonia demanded that the government scale down its own expenditure too. “It makes sense to order a proportionate reduction of 30 per cent in the expenditure budget (other than salaries, pensions and central government schemes) for the Government of India as well. This 30 per cent (i.e. Rs 2.5 lakh crores per year approximately) can then be allocated towards establishing an economic safety net for migrant workers, labourers, farmers, MSMSe and those in the unorganised sector,” she mentioned.

Sonia further demanded that all foreign visits including those of the Prime Minister, Union ministers, Chief Ministers, state ministers and bureaucrats be put on hold and the amount be utilised in measures to combat the crisis.

In her third letter to Modi since the nationwide lockdown was announced, the Congress chief referred to a conversation the PM had with her and sought suggestions from the party to tide over the coronavirus crisis. She had earlier written to the PM on the issues of helping the migrant workers and daily wage earners.

She also suggested transferring all money collected under the ‘PM CARES’ fund to the ‘Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund’ to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.

""It seems like a waste of effort and resources to have and create two separate entities for the distribution of funds. I understand that Rs 3,800 crores approximately are lying unutilised in the PMNRF (at the end of FY-2019).

These funds, plus the amount in the PM CARES fund, can be utilised to ensure an immediate food security net for those at the very margins of society,” Sonia said in her letter to the PM.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sonia-writes-to-pm--suggests-five-austerity-steps-to-fight-covid-19.html

133,08-4-20,Industry: Enough capacity in country to meet hydroxychloroquine demand,"Indian pharma industry on Tuesday said there is enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in the country, and drug firms are ready to ramp up the production to meet domestic as well as export requirements.

India has decided to partially lift the ban on the export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in sync with its global commitment to deal with coronavirus pandemic.

On March 25, India had banned the export of hydroxychloroquine in the midst of concerns that the drug could be used to fight COVID-19.

India is the largest exporter of the drug. Officials said India would export the drug on a case-by-case basis after meeting all the domestic requirements. “India manufactures 70 per cent of the world’s supply of hydroxychloroquine. Companies like Zydus Cadila and IPCA are the major manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine in the country,” Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain told PTI.

The production capacity is sufficient to meet the current demand. If the need arises, the companies are committed to ramp up production, he added.

“The Government has withdrawn the restrictions on 12 products and its formulations. Various scenarios are being assessed and it

will be the endeavour to meet both the domestic demand and export obligation for Paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine,” Jain said.

The objective is to minimise speculative buying and hoarding in these trying times and ensure balance in distribution for patients and segment who need them, he added.

India currently has an annual installed capacity of around 40 metric tonne of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of hydroxychloroquine.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/industry--enough-capacity--in-country-to-meet-hydroxychloroquine-demand.html
134,08-4-20,Lockdown not to impact farmers due to Govt measures: Niti Aayog member,"The Government has taken several measures to safeguard farmers from any adverse impact of the ongoing lockdown, and the farm sector is expected to report a growth of little more than 3 per cent in the just-ended financial year, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said on Tuesday.

In an interview with PTI, Chand said the Government has taken measures so that markets work normally during the lockdown period.

“The Government has responded to the situation. No restriction is put on farmers in going to field and undertaking agriculture operations. So, all those states which are following these guidelines, I do not think there will be any adverse impact on the farmers,” he said.

The country is under a 21-day lockdown as part of efforts to curb spreading of coronavirus infections.

On the first day of the countrywide lockdown, Chand said some reports came that farmers had to throw their perishable produce on the road.

“After states issuing order and the district administration allowing movement of machinery transport, etc, I see that after first day, we will not have any adverse impact on agriculture or farmers,” the Niti Aayog member said.

Replying to a question, Chand said that in the financial year 2019-20, the farm sector growth is likely to be reported at little more than 3 per cent. “I do not think there will be any impact (of lockdown) on this (farm sector) growth. We are expecting that growth rate of agriculture sector will be little more than 3 per cent. I can say if no shock happens, the long-term growth rate of Indian agriculture will be 3 per cent,” he said.

On fears that farmers may resort to distress sale due to lockdown, Chand said, “You see measures have been taken that markets works normally. Even in case of APMC Act, lots of relaxation has been commended”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lockdown-not-to-impact-farmers-due-to-govt-measures--niti-aayog-member.html

CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote to President Ramnath Kovind to immediately look into the plight of migrant labourers, economic consequences, shortage in medical supplies even as he accused the Centre of failing to deal the Covid crisis.

He also accused the BJP of communal polarisation during the pandemic crisis.

“As the custodian of the Constitution, I hope that you will not allow communal polarisation to grow in these trying times when the country needs to be united in its fight against an enemy that does not distinguish on the basis of identities of religion, caste, class etc. Please impress upon “your Government” that what is needed is human empathy not criminalisation,” said Yechury in his letter to the President.

In the backdrop of the Nizamudden East event where a gathering of the community has unwittingly caused a spike in coronavirus cases in National Capital and other states, Naqvi said almost all religious and social organisations have appealed to the Muslims to honestly follow the guidelines of lockdown and social distancing on Shab-e-Barat.

“All the State Waqf Boards, through the Central Waqf Council, have been directed to assist the local administration in implementation of lockdown completely” on the occasion.

“We should also pray at our homes to give strength to India and the entire world to eliminate challenges of Corona,” said Naqvi.

The Minister said the entire country is following the guidelines of lockdown and social distancing on the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Any type of carelessness can be harmful for us, our family, the society and the entire country”, Naqvi said and asked all to follow guidelines prescribed by the administration.

Social distancing has become the only and the most effective weapon against coronavirus. The three-week lockdown effected by the Government from the midnight of March 25 has precisely been designed to check the community spread of the virus across the country.

140,08-4-20,Coronavirus: SC seeks Centre's response,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought response from the Centre on a plea for immediate evacuation of all Indian students who are stranded in the United Kingdom (UK) amid the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The plea has said that governments of the UK and Germany have approached the Centre to facilitate return of their nationals stranded in India due to lockdown here and, as per media reports, flights would be operated in the near future from Mumbai and New Delhi for this purpose.

The petition, filed by Delhi-based advocate Madhurima Mridul, said that the Government should be directed to ensure that flights ferrying British nationals from India to the UK be used to evacuate Indian students who are stranded there and are willing to come back.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to take instructions on the issue and posted the matter for hearing on April 13.

Advocate Sunil Fernandes appeared for the petitioner during the hearing which was conducted through video-conferencing.

The plea has also sought a direction to the government to ensure that till requisite arrangements are made for evacuation, the students stranded in the UK are provided accommodation, adequate health and medical support, if needed, by the Indian High Commission in London.

It said that many of these students are exposed to greater risk of contracting COVID-19 as they are living in packed hostels with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities during the lockdown imposed in the UK, which has so far recorded over 2,300 deaths due to coronavirus.

The plea, filed by advocate Astha Sharma, said that the government should ensure that these students are quarantined and provided with all medical and health facilities as prescribed by the World Health Organisation.

It said that due to travel ban amid coronavirus pandemic, many Indian students, who had earlier booked tickets and reached various airports in the UK, were stranded and unable to take their journey to India.

""Surprisingly, India is probably the only country that has imposed an embargo on the return of its own citizens, and where other countries are making all possible efforts to repatriate their citizens stranded in various countries, India with its travel bans has made it impossible for its own citizens to come back home,"" it said.

The plea claimed that countries having more COVID-19 cases like China, Spain, Italy, Iran and the US have not imposed any embargo on the return of their nationals from foreign countries.

It said that Indian government could quarantine those who return from abroad and impose reasonable restrictions on their movement but to ""pass a blanket order of preventing an Indian citizen from returning back to his homeland is violative of the Constitutional rights"" guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality before law) and 21 (protection of life and personal liberty).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/coronavirus--sc-seeks-centre-s-response.html

It is against this backdrop that the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), an autonomous body under the Union Environment Ministry to monitor the big cats in the country, has now issued a circular, asking the States to be vigilant and to strengthen the patrolling services in the tiger habitats to keep a tab on any fire incident and take preventive steps accordingly.

There are around 4,000 big cats in the 50 tiger reserves across the States.

In an advisory issued to the States, NTCA DIG (Forest) Nishant Verma said that a few cases of forest fires in some tiger reserves have been reported on various forums during the ongoing lockdown period which is a matter of concern.

Since the forest staff and patrolling services have been included in the exempted list, it is important that they are deployed effectively to monitor the activities in the forests.

“It is kindly Informed that a considerable financial assistance under the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger has been provided for preventive control for forest fire protection in the tiger reserves based on reserve specific Annual Plans of Operations.

“I am directed to request that the fire protection measures are implemented on war footing in view of the sensitivity or vulnerability of the reserves, particularly keeping in mind the skeletal presence of field personnel in these times (lockdown period),” said Verma.

The country’s forest policy encourages a zero forest fire approach for its protected landscapes.

The installed UV light in the booth disinfects the chamber after each patient leaves. The UV light installed has a wavelength of 254 nm with a 15 watts rating, which effectively removes most of the viral load within 3 minutes of exposure, said Muraleedharan CV, one of the brains behind the innovation.

A pair of gloves provided in the examination booth allows the patient’s physical examination. Additionally, an entry tunnel on the side frame is provided to pass a Stethoscope within the chamber. This feature would help the doctor to place stethoscope on the patient and listen to heart and breath sounds.

After the examination, the patient is requested to vacate the chamber, and UV light will be turned on for 3 minutes. When UV exposure in the chamber is completed, the next patient is examined, and the sequence is repeated.

""Providing the highest standards of safety to the doctors and the front-line medical workers while interacting with the carriers of a highly contagious virus is clearly a critical priority. A thoughtfully designed protective booth with clinician inputs is a good step in that direction”, explained Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.

The other innovators include Ramesh Babu V, D S. Nagesh, Saurabh S. Nair, Arvind Kumar Prajapati, Dr. Sivakumar KGV and the team of Artificial Internal Organ (AIO) and Division Of Extra Corporeal Devices (ECD), SCTIMST.

TCS was the top loser in the Sensex pack, falling over 3 per cent, followed by Titan, ICICI Bank, SBI, ITC and Bharti Airtel.

On the other hand, Sun Pharma, NTPC, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance were among the top gainers.

According to Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Stock Broking, volatility in the markets was on account of speculation that the central government was mulling lockdown extension beyond April 14.

Further, traders said Indian markets moved in sync with global benchmarks as worries over the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Seoul ended in the red, while Tokyo closed on a positive note.

146,08-4-20,"Britain set for 66,000, most in Europe: Study","Britain could see as many as 66,000 COVID-19 deaths during the first wave of the current pandemic, new research showed Tuesday, making the outbreak there by far the deadliest in Europe.

Modelling conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine showed that approximately 151,680 people were likely to die from the virus across the continent.

While the novel coronavirus emerged in China and was initially focussed in east Asia, the World Health Organization now says the pandemic is centred in western Europe, with Spain, Italy and France experiencing devastating death tolls.

Most European nations have introduced strict social distancing measures to try to stem the virus spread.

More than 5,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Britain, fewer than in Spain, Italy and France. But Britain’s epidemic lags behind the rest of the continent by several days, and its death toll trajectory is already steeper than other nations. Using local and international data on case numbers, as well as age mortality breakdowns from Italy, China and the US, the team at IHME modelled the expected death toll on a country-by-country basis. A key consideration was an individual nation’s intensive care bed capacity.

It found that Britain could experience 66,000 COVID-19 deaths by July, far more than Italy, the next most severely impacted, with around 20,000. Spain and France were next, with 19,000 and 15,000 predicted deaths, respectively. “We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,” said IHME Director Christopher Murray. “It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.” On Sunday the institute predicted just over 80,000 US COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic’s first wave. The modelling suggests that outbreaks in Italy and Spain, where hundreds of deaths have been reported daily for weeks, may be past their peak.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/britain-set-for-66-000--most-in-europe--study.html
147,08-4-20,Italy ponders how to exit crippling lockdown,"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte consulted top scientists on Tuesday about ways to safely end a month-long lockdown aimed at stemming a pandemic that has killed thousands and left millions unemployed.

Conte’s videoconference with the Government’s scientific committee came one week before Italy’s economically-crippling closure of most businesses and factories is set to expire. Few expect it will.

The shutdown and an accompanying ban on almost all outdoor activity have helped slow the spread of a novel coronavirus that has officially claimed a world-topping 17,127 lives.

The daily reported toll reached 969 on March 27 and has since levelled off. There were 604 new fatalities on Tuesday and the rise in infections fell to a new low of just 2.3 per cent.

But health officials warn that the outbreak appears to have peaked only because of the various closures and bans. They insist on keeping the containment rules in place as long as possible — perhaps until a vaccine is developed or some reliable tests can show who has immunity against the new disease.

“We are far from the end,” the scientific committee’s head Domenico Arcuri told reporters before entering the talks with Conte. “The number of men and women who will die from the virus will continue to rise.”

Italian businesses counter that they cannot afford to stand idle much longer. A study released on Tuesday by the Confcooperative small business lobby said the economy was being subjected

to an “epochal shock” that would take at least two years to overcome.

It estimated that more than half of Italy’s 1.3 million construction workers and over a third of the 11.4 million services sector employees were now furloughed.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italy-ponders-how-to-exit-crippling-lockdown.html

Civil Protection authorities said Tuesday there were 3,039 new cases in a 24-hour period. Italy hasn’t seen such a low daily number since the early weeks of the outbreak.

150,08-4-20,Spain daily death toll spikes to 743 after drop,"Spain’s daily coronavirus death toll shot up to 743 on Tuesday after falling for four straight days, bringing the total to 13,798, the Health Ministry said.

However, it emphasised that the rise was due to weekend deaths being tallied and that the overall “downward trend” is continuing.

The new figure represents a 5.7 per cent increase over the 637 deaths recorded on Monday, the lowest number of fatalities since March 24 in the world’s second hardest-hit country after Italy in terms of fatal outcomes. The number of new infections also grew at a faster pace, rising 4.1 per cent to 140,510, the health ministry said. The number of new cases rose 3.3 per cent on Monday.

The “slight” rise was due largely to the fact that many deaths and new infections which occur over the weekend are only now being recorded, said Maria Jose Sierra of the health ministry’s emergencies coordination unit.

“In reality the downward trend is what we continue to observe in the reports we have received in recent days,” she told a daily news conference on the figures. Spain had seen the number of new infections and deaths drop each day since it recorded a record 950 fatalities on Thursday.

The percentage increase in the number of deaths is far lower than the 32.63 per cent leap recorded as recently as March 21. The number of people in hospital intensive care units also continues to fall, Maria Jose Sierra added.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/spain-daily-death-toll-spikes-to-743-after-drop.html
151,08-4-20,"New MERS vaccine may block coronavirus infections, study shows","A novel vaccine fully protects mice against a lethal dose of MERS, a close cousin of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, scientists said on Tuesday. The vaccine uses a harmless virus to deliver a MERS coronavirus protein into cells to generate an immune response, said the researchers from researchers at the University of Iowa and the University of Georgia in the US.

It may hold promise for developing vaccines against other coronaviruses diseases, including COVID-19, they said. The team tested the MERS vaccine candidate in mice engineered to be susceptible to the MERS coronavirus.

The vaccine is an innocuous parainfluenza virus (PIV5) carrying the “spike” protein that MERS uses to infect cells. All the vaccinated mice survived a lethal dose of the MERS coronavirus, according to the results published in the journal mBio.

“Our new study indicates that PIV5 may be a useful vaccine platform for emerging coronavirus diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Paul McCray, a professor the University of Iowa. “Using the same strategy, vaccine candidates based on PIV5 expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been generated,” McCray said.

The researchers are planning more studies in animals to test the ability of PIV5-based vaccines in preventing disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and COVID-19 are both caused by coronaviruses.

MERS is deadlier and is fatal in about one third of known cases, but there have been only 2,494 cases since 2012, when the virus first emerged, the researchers said.

In contrast, there have been over 1.25 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide since it first emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and almost 70,000 people have died from the disease, they said.

The study found that just one, relatively low dose of the vaccine given to the mice intranasally — inhaled through the nose — was sufficient to fully protect all the treated mice from a lethal dose of MERS coronavirus.

When the researchers analysed the immune responses generated by the vaccine, they found that both antibodies and protective T cells were produced.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/new-mers-vaccine-may-block-coronavirus-infections--study-shows.html
152,08-4-20,no new deaths in China first time,"China will open-up the epicentre of its coronavirus pandemic Wuhan on Wednesday for outbound travel for the first time since the January 23 lockdown, as the country reported no new deaths from COVID-19, attaining a new milestone in the battle against the disease.

Just as China started opening-up the epicentre, concerns of rebound of COVID-19 was on the rise in the country as imported infections increased to 983 with 32 new confirmed cases, the National Health Commission said.

Also, 30 new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were reported on the mainland on Monday. The NHC said 1,033 asymptomatic cases were still under medical observation.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptoms and have the potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections. Last week, China began disclosing the number of asymptomatic cases for the first time, after growing public concerns over the potential of “silent” carriers to spread the disease.

Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported in December last year and then spread like wildfire to other parts of the world, would start flights and railway services on Wednesday, restoring a semblance of normalcy for its 11 million people who bore the brunt of the virus outbreak.

Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital has already started outbound travel services. For local residents, April 8 will see the resumption of normal life after more than two months of isolation, even as epidemiologists warned that it is not the time to completely lower the guard and ease on full-scale restrictions, especially for community-based epidemic control work, considering the looming asymptomatic patients and possible rebound in infections, official media reported.

While lifting harsh restrictions after the 76-day lockdown, officials asked local people to continue carrying out strict community-based monitoring and management, making sure that a rebound in new infections won’t occur following the traffic resumption.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/no-new-deaths-in-china-first-time.html

European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help countries with weak healthcare systems tackle the impact of COVID-19 and also aid their long-term economic recovery.

Beating the pandemic in Europe alone is not enough, officials say, pointing out that if coronavirus continues to rage elsewhere in the world, it will simply return in time.

“We will only win this battle with a coordinated global response,” von der Leyen said in a video posted on Twitter.

“This is why the European Union is securing more than 15 billion euros to help our partners worldwide to fight coronavirus.” The brief video did not give details of where the money would come from nor which countries would benefit.

But officials have previously identified Africa as a concern because of its links to Europe and the poor state of healthcare in many of its countries. A senior EU official last week warned it would be “completely useless” to defeat coronavirus in Europe if it simply re-emerged from nearby countries struggling to contain it.

“Africa could experience the same problems that we are facing in Europe in a matter of weeks,” von der Leyen said in her video on Tuesday.

“They need our help to slow down the spread of the virus as we needed help in this crisis.” Europe has been the epicentre of the virus in recent weeks but last week the EU’s diplomatic chief Josep Borrell warned the virus could “get out of control very rapidly” in Africa.

154,08-4-20,China becomes world’s top patent filer: UN,"China last year became the world leader in international patent filings, unseating the United States which had held the top spot for more than four decades, the UN said Tuesday. A record 265,800 international patent applications were filed last year, a hike of 5.2-percent from 2018, the World Intellectual Property Organisation said in its annual report. WIPO’s complex system of registering international patents involves multiple categories. In the main category — the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT — China topped the ranking for the first time, with 58,990 applications. It thus overtook the United States, which filed 57,840 applications, and which has topped the PCT ranking since the system took effect in 1978. China and the United States were followed by Japan, Germany and South Korea as the world’s top patent application filers, WIPO found.

“China’s rapid growth to become the top filer of international patent applications via WIPO underlines a long-term shift in the locus of innovation towards the East, with Asia-based applicants now accounting for more than half of all PCT applications,” WIPO Director General Francis Gurry said in a statement.

“They’re currently retracting many of their articles and their figures and studies have not been very correct,” she said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. “With what we know of their scientific studies...

159,08-4-20,New York records more deaths from virus than 9,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that the COVID-19 deaths in the state hit a new one-day peak, with 731 people dead in the largest single-day increase in fatalities since the coronavirus crisis engulfed the state, the epicentre of the pandemic in the US.

‘The bad news is 5,489 New Yorkers have lost their lives to this virus. That is up from 4,758, the largest single day increase. That’s 731 people who we lost. Behind every one of those numbers is an individual, is a family, is a mother, is a father…,” Cuomo said.

The state has a total of 1,38,836 coronavirus cases and as of Tuesday 5,489 people have died, up by 731 from Monday morning. Cuomo said the number of newly hospitalised patients is also up from Monday. In what he described as “good news”, Cuomo said daily ICU admissions and daily intubations numbers are down.

“And right now we’re projecting that we are reaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations and you can see the growth… is starting to flatten. Again this is a projection. It still depends on what we do and what we do will affect those numbers. This is not an act of God that we’re looking at. It’s an act of what society actually does,” he said in his daily media briefing.

The Governor said he is coordinating with Governors of New Jersey and Connecticut on plans to restart the economy and daily life. “We’re not there yet. But this is not a light switch that we can just flick one day, and everything goes back to normal. We’re going to have to restart that economy, we’re going to have to restart a lot of systems that we shut down abruptly. And we need to start to plan for that,” he said.

He said he has spoken to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont about “coming up with a regional metropolitan tri-state approach” to restart the economy and get everything up and running as quickly as possible.

Cuomo’s grim announcement on the increase in COVID-19 deaths came after the state witnessed an “effectively flat” death toll for two days and saw drop in number of hospitalisations and ICU admissions, which the Governor has said could be “good signs” of a “possible flattening” of the coronavirus curve in the state.

On Monday, Cuomo had offered a slight glimmer of hope when he said the death toll in the state has been “effectively flat for two days.” In the 24 hours since April 4, the death toll grew to “all-time increase” of 630. But on both Sunday and Monday, fewer than 600 deaths from the virus were reported in New York - 594 on Sunday, 599 on Monday. In New York City, the number of cases had reached 68,766 and the death toll was 2,738.

Cuomo has said while the death toll is not good news, “the possible flattening of the curve is better than the increases that we have seen.”

His aide Jim Malatras had said based on the earliest projections, it was estimated that the pandemic peak in the state would come at the end of April and would require around 1,10,000 beds just for COVID19 patients.

Cuomo earlier announced the state is increasing the maximum fine for violations of the state’s social distancing protocol from USD 500 to USD 1,000 to help address the lack of adherence to social distancing protocols.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/new-york-records-more-deaths-from-virus-than-9-11.html
160,08-4-20,"Japan declares state of emergency, ramping up virus battle","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a monthlong state of emergency for Tokyo and six other prefectures on Tuesday to ramp up defenses against the spread of the coronavirus as the number of infections surges. But the move came in the form of a stay-at-home request — not an order — and violators will not be penalised.

The COVID-19 outbreak is now rampant and rapidly spreading, threatening people’s health, their daily lives and the economy, Abe said.

The state of emergency, which is until May 6, will only permit Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike and heads of the six other prefectures to do more to reinforce calls for social distancing. “The most important thing is for each one of us to change our activity,” Abe told a government task force. He urged everyone to cut contacts with others by 70-80% for one month, calling the coronavirus pandemic “the biggest postwar crisis.”

The announcement follows surges in new cases in Tokyo, including consecutive rises exceeding 100 over the weekend. By Tuesday there were 1,196 confirmed cases in the metropolitan region of 14 million people. Nationwide, Japan has reported 91 deaths from COVID-19 and 3,906 confirmed cases, plus another 712 cases and 11 fatalities from a cruise ship that was quarantined earlier at Yokohama port near Tokyo.

Abe has been under pressure to declare a state of emergency to get better compliance with calls for social distancing amid rising alarm over the number of cases without any known contact with other patients. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike welcomed the emergency measures, saying she expects they “will prevail widely and deeply among the people.” She said her immediate request under the state of emergency is “stay home.”

Japan’s limits on official action during a state of emergency stem from its experience with repression and disasters stemming from fascist governments before and during World War II. The public is doubly wary due to the push by Abe’s ultra-conservative ruling party and its supporters for a constitutional amendment to include a state of emergency clause for disaster and wartime contingencies. Abe’s Government is thought to have delayed declaring a state of emergency out of fear of how it might hurt the economy. But as fear of the pandemic has grown, the public and medical experts have increasingly supported taking more drastic action.

The state of emergency includes a stay-at-home request; guidance to schools on temporary closures and requests to close nonessential businesses and stores and to cancel or postpone events and exhibits. Violators cannot be penalized unless they fail to comply with orders on providing or storing emergency relief goods, such as surgical masks and medical equipment.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/japan-declares-state-of-emergency--ramping-up-virus-battle.html

163,08-4-20,How to clear competitive exams,"Due to Coronavirus lockdown many exams have been postponed giving aspirants extra days for prep. Akhand Swaroop Pandit shares tips that one can follow

The initial move towards your groundwork for any competitive exam is to comprehend the pre-requirements of the exam. You should also well-rehearsed with the syllabus (you get that easily on the Internet). Other than the syllabus, you should make a note of the weightage of various subjects so that you can plan your preparations like wise. Looking over previous years' question papers assists in getting well acquainted with the exam pattern. Here are six steps that you can follow to prepare for any competitive exam:

Understanding the syllabus: First thing first, you should always put all your mind and heart in understanding the syllabus of the exam and the level of questions asked. It is very important for you to understand what to prepare.

Preparing a time table: After you have decided on what to prepare it is your turn to plan how to prepare. Prepare a time table including your short term and long term goals; this in turn will help you in timely preparation for the exam. A good time table is most likely to help you in better preparation and avoids haphazardness.

Study smartly: Working hard is always important but smart study never goes out of fashion. Going through previous years question papers gives you an edge and also you can analyse the kind of questions being asked, including heavy weightage topic. Your major focus should be on qualitative studying rather than quantitative studying.

Revise regularly: Every candidate should have a regular revision strategy in handy. It takes at least four times of regular revision to actually remember something for long-term. Whatever you study should be revised on the third day then on the sixth day then on twelfth day and after than on twenty first day. A good revision cycle is definitely going to help you ace the exam.

Take breaks: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, as rightly emphasised by the proverb, it is equally important to take breaks. Rather than studying for long durations divided your slots and take a break in between, go out for a walk, take a nap or just listen you're your favorite track.

Keep yourself motivated: The last and the most important thing is to keep yourself motivated. Motivation to achieve your goal is the key to success. If you are preparing for any exam and if you lack motivation then even a single failure is going to affect you badly. To qualify any exam we should have a strong desire to clear it and it should be maintained on a regular basis.

Belief' is a very powerful tool. You must believe in yourself and your preparation. Ensure that you study the same way throughout the year, to avoid last minute rush and stress. Spend 10-15 minutes before going off to sleep to quickly recap all that you learnt throughout the day.

Also, a bit of physical activity and meditation helps to improve concentration. Do not take stress throughout the entire preparation time and stay away from stressful people. Each and every moment you must tell yourself: “I Can, I Will.” And you will be able to do it.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-to-clear--competitive-exams-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/how-to-clear--competitive-exams.html
164,08-4-20,MindIT,"Do you have to be really affluent to be able to purchase the new model of the iphone? Maybe, maybe not! We are living in a time where there is no dearth of disposable income amongst middle class Indians; the pleasure-seeking principle has modified the lens through which an individual explores the possibilities open to him.

There is an explosion in the demand for hedonistic attributes of products/services associated with essential necessities- for example, savoury taste in food, a rising demand in distinct cuisines of the world, designer labels in clothing and accessories, tasteful home décor, the greater demand for interior designers, home stylists, fashion designers. The mushrooming of SMEs (small and medium scale enterprises) brought on by an increasing trend towards entrepreneurship, has led to a greater demand for graphic and communication designers to design their web pages and develop out-of-the-box communication design strategies for their promotional content on social media.

A growing demand for designers: In almost all major disciplines of design — spatial design, architecture, communication design, graphic designing and fashion designing. Having a flair for design is an essential attribute but it needs to be backed by a sound technical education in that particular discipline. You need to have a conceptual understanding of the dictums of that pedagogy, along with a study of what has worked in the past, what has not, and knowledge of evolving global and local trends. A qualification from an institute of repute is not just an option but has become mandatory to enable one to penetrate the design community.

Immersing oneself for a few years through the rigours of a design college, delivering outcomes under the pressure of project deadlines and working in teams, imparts the requisite skill-set and training for entering the design ecosystem.

During the tenure of your studies, you will get several opportunities to volunteer and participate in seminars, lectures, workshops, events and master classes. Never forfeit these opportunities to network with industry professionals. You can leverage them to your advantage by making contacts with professionals to procure projects and find mentorship.

Freelance projects: After you have understood the fundamentals of design in the first year and assessed your own designing sensibilities, you will be able to take on freelancing projects by the time you enter second year. These will help build portfolio and be a point of connect with the design industry before you get absorbed finally.

Internships: An opportunity to intern with a good design studio can lay the brickwork towards a rewarding career. Ensure that you add significantly to your design portfolio during your internship. Displaying your talents and dedication to your internship project can result in the much coveted offer from the company, after you graduate.

Academia: All those of you who are passionate about teaching, can enter the world of academia by gaining an in-depth industry exposure of 6 to 10 years as a professional or as an entrepreneur. After having worked for a decade or so, you will come to understand the nuts and bolts of the industry and its workings.

Getting the required exposure: There are many design exhibitions and art fairs held in the various metropolises of India, each year. India Art Fair is conducted in Delhi each year; it features both veterans and upcoming artists. India Interior Retailing - Conference, Awards and Exhibition is another exciting event, usually held in October in Delhi.

Try to optimise opportunities that present themselves and attend as many events as possible. Such kind of exposure will stretch imagination beyond the confines of the college walls and enable you to come up with ingenious yet commercially viable ideas.

Students who are worried about the future as they will enter a precarious job market after the coronavirus scare will end. We would suggest they should start preparing early for final papers and exams and take advantage of videoconferencing tools to conduct group study sessions and feel less isolated. Offering online learning, virtual learning platforms, or other education practices can help institutes to connect with students without any potential health risks.

Due to coronavirus pandemic, more than 85 countries have closed universities nationwide, impacting more than 776 million students. The education space since then, has undergone a scale from stoppage to continuity in online mode not only in India but also around the world. Despite the shutdown of colleges and universities, many students are willing to study and the best way for both students and teachers is therefore, to rise to the occasion, migrate to teaching — learning through digital platforms like AWS Educate, Google classroom and WebE. At IIIT Naya Raipur, our faculty members have adopted Google classroom to help in maintaining the continuity of education. Yet, problems arise when it comes to evaluation and examination of assignments using online platforms but then, the teachers must choose the best platform to provide online education to the students, this will help the students stay at home safely without hampering their studies and precious time.

— Dr Pradeep Kumar Sinha, Vice Chancellor & Director, IIIT Naya Raipur

At a time when students cannot go to their classes because of the nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, classes can actually come to them. Unknowingly, this virus has somehow paved the way for making the ed-tech scenario in India robust. Slowly, India is shifting to online learning. The Kerala Government, one of the severely affected states of India, has even announced to provide extra bandwidth across the state for online learning. This process of learning has its own benefits but it is necessary it is done with full concentration. It is important to assign a dedicated study place for this where nobody can disturb you. Although the Universities are still contemplating this option, it is the need of the hour to flatten the curve and minimise the spread of this pandemic without running a shining future of students.

— Dr Pankaj Gupta, President, IIHMR University

The adverse effects of COVID-19 has been all-encompassing, and higher education cannot be an exception. Enrollment slowdown or stoppage, resulting out of lack of mobility owing to a nationwide lockdown, would negatively impact universities and other education institutions as well as students. To combat this, many uiversities are planning to implement on-line learning services for their students to ensure most minimal interruption in their learning process and assessments and examinations can be conducted maintaining academic standards. Being used to teaching face-to-face, we need to take into cognizance that many teachers may not be geared enough in the first instance, to deliver the learning in this new method. It is imperative, therefore, that the entire teaching faculty is trained on how to prepare online content as well as how to deliver them, so that there is uniformity in the treatment of the learning delivery from the institute. Similarly, many students may not be in a position to receive such online education, depending on their own competency levels and access to technology. Students should, therefore, be similarly trained on how to absorb such learning.

170,08-4-20,E-learning to rescue,"There are certain perennial issues that still plague e-learning including the digital divide in the country. It would require a lot of efforts to bridge this gap, says Nimisha bansal

The sudden lockdown can be a testing time for the students but due to the various exams being postponed what it offers is time. The isolation can be a gift for all students if they use it to their advantage by working towards their goal with utmost dedication. Online learning is a saviour in these testing times and by choosing to learn from the most qualified teachers at the cheapest of prices students can make the most of the time that they have in their hand.

Having said that, there are certain perennial issues that still plague e-learning. First & foremost is the digital divide in the country and there are still many efforts from the Government’s end that need to be taken to bridge this gap. And while there have been inevitable teething problems, one can simply not deny that online courses represent the future. The recent outbreak has left many experts wondering the course of events in future and online learning is the only thing right now which can save our life from coming to a complete standstill.

In these testing circumstances due to impromptu closure, the biggest benefactors and the blessings in disguise are the online learning platforms. Also known as e-learning this online learning method can cater to the growing demands of the students in the most efficient manner. The online learning platforms have seen a spike in the number of students who are enrolling in the plethora of courses they offer. From courses on various Government sector exams, technical courses to activities like painting and even dancing there is a never-ending list that is available to you at the most affordable price. The preparation for Government jobs, in particular, has put many students in a quandary as still even in these modern times they prefer a traditional brick and mortar kind of setting. The reason for that is the physical presence of the educators and the learning atmosphere with the students of similar interests in these offline courses. However, the recent advancements in technologies have taken the education industry by storm.

India is not new to eLearning, for instance, Coursera, an American learning platform founded in 2012 has over 35 million users and India is second only to America when it comes to a number of people who are taking the courses. The major advantage that online learning has over offline is its flexibility. Student can learn from anywhere in the world at his convenience. Furthermore, students in our country are generally more cautious when it comes to spending and the traveling time, cost of traveling and exorbitant offline course fees only add to the woes in their otherwise busy schedule. The more technological advancement will only lead to more attraction for students and it is expected that by 2021 our e-learning will be worth a staggering $2 billion.

Online learning has covered a lot of ground in the recent times and the interface is more user friendly and on top of that a student gets a classroom experience by sitting in the corners of their rooms. There are facilities for communicating with your educators and the students of the same course. The biggest trump card is its flexible timescale. Students can get a resolution to their problems not only during the mundane hours of the class but also during the time while they are studying themselves via email or through an online chat system. The exams are mostly conducted online today due to its efficient mechanism and due to the tests, which are designed in the online format, e-learning makes students accustomed to an almost exact exam atmosphere and thus increases their chances of success.

With the availability of various courses by an endless number of educators with demos and refund policies, the student’s satisfaction is always given a priority. An educator in online learning keeps on improvising to impart better education in comparison to their peers in order to survive in this humongous platform which enhances the experience of the users and help in their overall development.

178,08-4-20,La Liga look for May return,"La Liga could return to action as early as next month, its president Javier Tebas said on Tuesday, as the league awaits a chance to restart following the coronavirus shutdown.

Tebas also warned Spanish clubs could lose as much as one billion euros ($1.1 billion) if the season is not completed, pushing football bosses in the country to search for a late finish to the current campaign.

“The different scenarios we have been looking at with UEFA to go back to competing are most probably starting on the May 28-29, June 6-7 or June 28-29,” Tebas said.

“We’re not just looking at what happens in Spain... the job is to get all our calendars (in Europe) in line so all the competitions are able to finish together.”

But Tebas said no team training could take place until after the state of emergency ends in Spain — currently set until April 26. Should that end date be pushed back the chances of restarting in May would likely vanish.

Tebas said “it is not an option” to cancel the season given the massive hit to revenue Spain’s top clubs would have to absorb, with 150 million euros gone even if La Liga finishes the season with fans at matches.

“We are not considering at all that we will not get back to playing matches,” he said.

“It is not just league revenues, it is league revenues plus all the other revenue from the Champions League that teams wouldn’t receive.

179,08-4-20,Mueller extends Bayern stay,"Thomas Mueller looks set to spend his entire career at Bayern Munich, who he describes as his ‘passion’, after signing a contract extension until 2023, the reigning Bundesliga champions announced on Tuesday.

The 30-year-old joined the club as a schoolboy in 2000, making his debut for the Bavarians eight years later and has since racked up more than 500 appearances.

“I am really pleased that I have extended with Bayern Munich... and will continue to give everything for my club,” the 2014 World Cup winner said on Twitter.

“Because this club is not just an employer for me — it is a passion.”

Having risen up through the youth ranks, Mueller is a club icon who has won eight league titles, five German Cups and the 2013 Champions League.

“I’m happy that we’ve reached agreement with Thomas. Thomas is a special player for us, a figurehead for the club and our fans, a leader who shows the way on the pitch and has achieved a lot with FC Bayern,” sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mueller-extends-bayern-stay.html
180,08-4-20,Not enough role models in current India team: Yuvraj,"There are not many role models in the current Indian cricket set up other than Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and the seniors do not command much respect from the youngsters, feels former flamboyant all-rounder Yuvraj Singh.

In a live Instagram Live question and answer session, deputy skipper Rohit asked Yuvraj about the difference between the current team and the players who played alongside the left-hander.

“When I came into the team or when you (Rohit) came into the team, our seniors were very disciplined. Obviously there was no social media so there were no distractions,” said Yuvraj.

“There was a certain behaviour that we boys had to carry, how they talk to people, how they talk to media. Because they were the ambassadors of the game and India.”

But it is not the same anymore, feels Yuvraj.

“So that is what I had told you guys. After playing for India, you have to be more careful about your image. But I feel the third generation. There are only you two seniors, Virat and you, who are playing all the formats, rest of the guys are coming and going.

“I just feel there are very fewer guys to look up to and I feel that a sense of respect towards seniors, that has become a thin line now. Koi bhee kisiko kuch bhee keh deta hain (anyone can say anything to anyone,” said Yuvraj.

Yuvraj, one of the best cricketers the world cricket has seen, said the players during his time were conscious of whatever they did.

“I think juniors, because of social media, party scenes, these things, we could not even think about that in our time. Because we had that fear that if we do some mistake our senior will tell us that do not do this, this is not right,” he said.

Commenting the infamous incident involving Hardik Pandya and K L Rahul, who were suspended for their loose talk on women on a chat show, Yuvraj added: “That incident could not have happened in our time.”

Rohit on his part said the atmosphere in the team is “very light” at the moment.

“When I came into the team, there were so many seniors. I think I was the only youngster alongside Piyush Chawla and Suresh Raina. The atmosphere is light now. I keep talking to the youngsters, the five-six of them.

“I speak to Rishabh a lot. There was so much scrutiny on him and he got worked up. Media should also think before writing about him. But scrutiny will be there as long as you are playing for India.”

On the mindset of the younger generation, Yuvraj said most of them only want to play limited overs cricket.

“Sachin paaji told me once ‘if you perform on field, everything else will follow’. I was at National Cricket Acadmey (NCA) once and I interacted with the younger lot. I felt most of them did not want to play Test cricket which is real cricket. They are happy playing one-day cricket.

“I feel even the players who have already played for India should play domestic cricket when they are not national duty. It would give them valuable experience of playing on different surfaces around the country,” the former Indian all-rounder added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-enough-role-models-in-current-india-team--yuvraj-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-enough-role-models-in-current-india-team--yuvraj.html
181,08-4-20,COVID-19: Away from,"He is missing the ""carnage of IPL"" but former New Zealand captain and Kolkata Knight Riders coach Brendon McCullum says it is also comforting to be at home as the world battles a pandemic, which has made isolation the new normal.

McCullum, who was named head coach of KKR for the currently-suspended IPL, said the situation demands that everyone stays at home and maintains social distancing, the only way to curb the spread of the virus, which has caused thousands of deaths worldwide.

""Spot on, it's a far cry from the carnage of the IPL and also in India but it's quite nice and comforting to be at home under these circumstances. I was quite busy in the last three years,"" the former wicket-keeper batsman told 'tvnz.co.nz'.

McCullum had shifted base to Matamata, a town in the shadow of the Kaimai Range Mountains on New Zealand's North Island after his retirement in 2016 to look after his horse syndicate business, Vermair.

He is happy to have got time to work on his passion.

Besides taking care of horses, McCullum revealed that he is also trying his hands in brewing.

""Racing here in New Zealand has stopped which is a bit disappointing but it's the right decision. Over in Australia it's still going on and they think they will be able to operate in safe surrounds and that's good for our point of view.""

""I have 12 horses in the property, probably little more than I need to,"" he said.

""Little bit of extra curricular activities at home.""

McCullum, however, rubbished reports that he went to an Irish pub during the lockdown period.

""I definitely wasn't there. I prefer to drink in the comforts of my home. I invite very very special people to taste my home-brewed stuff,"" he said.

182,08-4-20,IPL 2020 is 100 per cent possible if normalcy returns by October: Nehra,"Former India left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra believes there is a possibility of the IPL taking place in the last quarter of the year, provided the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control worldwide by the month of October.

The IPL 2020, which was scheduled to be played from March 29, has been suspended till April 15 with no clarity yet on whether it would go ahead at all.

""Even if the IPL doesn't happen in August, (because) there are a lot of places in India that witness rains during that month and there are high chances that lots of matches will get cancelled,"" Nehra told on Star Sports 1 Hindi show 'Cricket Connected'.

""If things go back to normal around the world by October, we'll have a 100 per cent clearance,"" he reckoned.

With the spike in coronavirus cases and deaths showing no signs of relenting across the world, there are slim chances of the IPL happening this year.

The deadly contagion has claimed nearly 150 Indian lives apart from causing more than 80,000 global deaths which has forced countries, including India, to go under lockdown in their bid to flatten the curve.

Meanwhile, Nehra feels former star all-aounder Yuvraj Singh has always excelled while playing under Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy.

""Yuvraj has played well under MS Dhoni, as far as I have seen Yuvraj's career, the way he has batted in 2007 and 2008 onwards it has been impeccable and in 2011 we saw how he braved his sickness and played brilliantly under Dhoni.

""I feel every player has their own choice of a favourite captain when they play for 16 years and Yuvraj played well under Dhoni according to me,"" he said.

183,08-4-20,Aussies didn’t sledge Kohli & Co to protect IPL deals: Clarke,"Australian cricketers were so keen on protecting their lucrative IPL deals that they felt “scared” of sledging India captain Virat Kohli and his teammates during a particular period and instead “sucked up” to them, former skipper Michael Clarke has claimed.

India and Australia have had some memorable bilateral duels but Clarke felt that whenever the Australians would face India, their eyes would be trained on the cash-rich league which is played in April-May every year.

“Everybody knows how powerful India are in regards to the financial part of the game, internationally or domestically with the IPL,” Clarke told Big Sports Breakfast.

“I feel that Australian cricket, and probably every other team over a little period, went the opposite and actually sucked up to India. They were too scared to sledge Kohli or the other Indian players because they had to play with them in April,” the World Cup winning Australian skipper said dropping a bombshell.

Clarke believes that some of Australia’s ruthless on-field character got compromised because the top-10 draws at the IPL auctions gave an impression that they would never sledge Kohli.

“Name a list of ten players and they are bidding for these Australian players to get into their IPL team,” he said.

“The players were like: ‘I’m not going to sledge Kohli, I want him to pick me for Bangalore so I can make my $1 million for my six weeks’.

“I feel like that’s where Australia went through that little phase where our cricket become a little bit softer or not as hard as we’re accustomed to seeing,” Clarke said about the time after the ball-tampering scandal when terms like Elite honesty were propagated.

India and Australia have always enjoyed a fiery on-field chemistry with the two teams engaging in many verbal wars in the past, which include the tours of Down Under in 2007-08 and 2018.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aussies-didn---t-sledge-kohli---co-to-protect-ipl-deals--clarke.html
184,08-4-20,Bhajji fine with IPL in empty stadiums,"Veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh says he won’t mind an IPL played in empty stadiums but the event should go ahead when the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control as several livelihoods are dependent on the it.

“Spectators are important, but if the situation arises, I don’t mind playing without them. Yes, as a player I won’t get the vibe, but this will ensure that every fan will get to watch IPL on their TV,” Harbhajan, who plays for Chennai Super Kings, told Star Sports Cricket Connected.

“We will have to be cautious about everything and should prioritise players’ safety by ensuring that the match venues, team hotels, flights are properly sanitized. A lot of lives are on line so we should organise IPL when everything is fine,” he added.

“I miss matches the most, was hoping that I would get to play 17 matches (including finals) after a year’s gap,” Harbhajan said.

Harbhajan said he is keeping himself fit for the league as and when it happens.

185,08-4-20,Unusual batting stance is method to limit ways of getting out: Smith,"His unorthodox batting stance has left many befuddled but Australian run-machine Steve Smith says though it depends on number of factors, he generally positions himself outside the off-stump to limit ways in which he can be dismissed.

Smith, the world number 1 Test batsman, has amassed 7227 runs in 73 Tests and 4162 runs in ODIs with an unconventional technique, which most have failed to decode.

During a podcast organised by inaugural IPL champions Rajasthan Royals, Smith opened up about his unusual technique to New Zealand spinner Ish Sodhi.

Talking about his open batting stance, Smith, the former Rajasthan Royals captain, said: “It depends on who’s bowling, how is the wicket playing, how I gonna score and stuff like that or how people are trying to get me out, probably that determines how open I am or otherwise how closed I am.

“But my general stance where my back foot is going to almost off stump, or may be even outside at stages, I know that anything outside my eyeline isn’t hitting the stumps,” he said.

“For me, you shouldn’t get out if the ball is not hitting the stumps, so that is just a trick from me when I first started doing it, just limiting the ways I get out,” he explained.

The 30-year-old said his off-stump stance helps him to leave the ball which are outside his line of sight.

“Sometimes, I get trapped in front but I’m okay with that at stages, knowing that if it is outside my eyeline, I don’t need to try and play the ball, I can just leave that,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/unusual-batting-stance-is-method-to-limit-ways-of-getting-out--smith.html

But he has to be more professional like Ronaldo and Messi, who live for football,” Zico told Gazzetta Dello Sport. “Ney has too many thoughts that distract him. I spoke to him recently and asked him to be more professional. He is 28 years old now and there is a good team at PSG. They can win the Champions League.”

187,08-4-20,Uthappa eyeing India return as finisher,"Out of the Indian team since 2015, dashing Karnataka batsman Robin Uthappa is eying a comeback in the T20 format as a finisher and believes he still has another “World Cup left” in him.

Uthappa, who was a member of the 2007 ODI World Cup team and the inaugural T20 World Cup-winning squad, last played for senior team in July 2015 during Zimbabwe tour.

The 34-year-old batsman has featured in just eight ODIs and four T20 matches since October 2011.

“Right now I want to be competitive. I still have that fire burning in me, I really want to compete and do well. I honestly believe I have a World Cup left in me, so I’m pursuing that, especially the shortest format,” Uthappa was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.com.

He, however, understands that for that to happen, he needs a bit of luck as well.

“The blessings of Lady Luck or God or whatever you call it, plays a massive factor. Especially in India, it becomes so much more evident. I don’t think it is as evident when you’re playing cricket outside of India,” Uthappa said.

“But in the subcontinent and India especially, with the amount of talent that we do have in our country, all of those aspects become evident.”

Insisting that he has not yet given up hope, Uthappa said he won’t hang up his boots till he realises his dreams.

“You can never write yourself off. You would be unfair to yourself if you write yourself off. Especially if you believe you have the ability and you know that there is an outside chance. So I still believe in that outside chance.

“I still believe that things can go my way and I probably can be a part of a World Cup-winning team and play an integral role in that as well. Those dreams are still alive and I think I’ll keep playing cricket till that is alive,” he said.

Even though he prefers to bat up the order, Uthappa said he is now eyeing the role of a finisher in the Indian team and has already stated his training at home.

“What I’ve been trying to do is to make sure that I’m well prepared. Opening the batting is something I can do at any point of time. I’m trying to make sure I’m well equipped to bat in the middle order as well,” he said.

“One of the things that we need today in Indian cricket is a good finisher, and that’s something that I’m pursuing and working hard on. It’s something I’m looking forward to improving on a day to day basis.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/uthappa-eyeing-india-return-as-finisher.html
188,08-4-20,Buttler hopes there is way to schedule IPL later in the year,"IPL is “massive” in terms of stature and it is a “big shame” that it cannot be held at the moment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said star England batsman Jos Buttler, who is expecting the cash-rich event to be slotted later in the year.

Buttler, who plays for Rajasthan Royals, underlined the importance of a tournament like IPL.

“I don’t know any more than you know about when IPL would be played or people talking about whether it can be pushed back. At the moment, everything is quite indefinite as no one knows how long it will last. So it can’t be decided at the moment when it could or could not happen,” Buttler was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

Buttler, who made massive strides as a white ball player after a few seasons of IPL, spoke about the impact of not having an IPL and the effect it could have on revenue.

“As for the stature of the tournament, it’s a massive, massive tournament. Revenue that is involved in IPL is massive. It is a very important competition to cricket and it’s a big shame that it’s not going ahead or whether it does have the way to push it in the schedule and allow it,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/buttler-hopes-there-is-way-to-schedule-ipl-later-in-the-year.html

191,08-4-20,Govt mulls lockdown extension,"Call likely on States’ exhortation as studies show 21-day model insufficient

With chorus growing from States to extend the ongoing lockdown to effectively fight the outbreak of coronavirus, the Centre may also move in the same direction and keep the country in a state of lockdown beyond April 14.

Various studies have shown that the 21-day lockdown model is not a foolproof way to contain the coronavirus outbreak and the disease could return when the lockdown ends. However, the Government has to also make sure that tens of thousands of daily-wage earners are fed and sheltered during the extension of lockdown. It has to also take into account the terrible state of economy due to shutdown of production across every section of industries, except pharma sector.

Several States such as Telangana, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh Assam, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are reported to be in favour of extending the current phase of lockdown after it ends on April 14. These States have contributed more than a third of the positive cases in India.

“A lot of State Governments as well as experts are requesting the Central Government to extend the lockdown. The Union Government is thinking in this direction,” Tweeted Prasar Bharati News Services citing “Government sources” after a crucial GoM meeting.

The development comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked countrymen to be ready for a long battle against the coronavirus pandemic, and exhorted people not to feel tired or defeated while expressing confidence the country will emerge victorious in its fight.

During the day, the Group of Ministers headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is learnt to have also discussed the States’ suggestion for extension of the lockdown. Modi is expected to take a call on this regard based on the GoM’s suggestions.

The GoM meeting was attended by Union Ministers Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, Ramvilas Paswan, Piyush Goyal and Prakash Javadekar also analysed the ways to open the lockdown from April 15.

The meeting is reported to have discussed suggestion of opening up the lockdown in staggered or phased manner with stringent rules to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

The Karnataka Government said it will take a decision on the continuation of the 21 days lockdown that ends on April 14, after examining the report by a panel of health experts who have been tasked with devising an exit strategy, which is likely to be submitted in couple of days.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said a decision on the coronavirus-enforced lockdown will be taken at an appropriate time after a review amid hints it may continue in the State beyond April 14.

Thackeray chaired a meeting of the Cabinet, the first through video conferencing due to the outbreak, in which the situation prevailing in the State, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country, and available medical infrastructure were discussed, officials said.

The ongoing lockdown, which is in place in view of coronavirus outbreak, might be extended in Madhya Pradesh if needed, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said. “We will take a decision after analysing the situation. Lives of people are more important. We can resurrect the economy later on but can’t be able to bring back lives of people,” Chouhan said in a video statement.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-mulls-lockdown-extension-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-mulls-lockdown-extension.html
192,08-4-20,India lifts HCQ export ban after Trump’s threat,"India on Tuesday partially lifted the ban on export of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the US after President Donald Trump hinted at “retaliation” if India does not remove restrictions on the anti-malaria drug, which he has often claimed is the “game changer” in fighting coronavirus pandemic there. The Congress, the TMC and the Left parties have slammed both Trump and the Modi Government over the issue.

The US President’s threat led to an upheaval in the social media here with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi saying life-saving medicines should be first made available to Indians and remarked “friendship is not about retaliation.” He also said India must help all nations in their hour of need.

Announcing the decision on Tuesday to partially lift curbs on export enforced on March 25, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the anti-malaria drug would be supplied to “some countries” which are “badly affected” by COVID-19.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi expressed his objection to the Government U-turn on the issue, saying, “life saving” drug should be made available to the country first.

He tweeted, “Friendship isn’t about retaliation. India must help all nations in their hour of need but lifesaving medicines should be made available to Indians in ample quantities first.”

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor also criticised Trump saying, “Never in my decades of experience in world affairs have I heard a Head of State or Government openly threatening another like this. What makes Indian Hydroxychloroquine “our supply”, Mr President? It only becomes your supply when India decides to sell it to you.” (sic)

Rubbing into the Modi Government, Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said, “It is embarrassing for the entire country that Donald Trump threatens retaliation if the Indian Government did not allow the supply of medicines. PM Narendra Modi who wasted one full month and Rs 100 crore for ‘’Namaste Trump’’, has now meekly surrendered and has revoked the ban on exports of medicines.”

Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra was not so subtle in her criticism of Modi. “56 inches used to bully Opposition at home. Use it to stand up to those who bully India. We and we alone decide when and how much to sell - please make this clear #Modiji . We’re with you on this,” Moitra tweeted.

On his part the MEA spokesperson said that like any responsible Government, India’s first obligation is to ensure that there are adequate stocks of medicines for the requirement of its own people. “In order to ensure this, some temporary steps were taken to restrict exports of a number of pharmaceutical products. In the meanwhile, a comprehensive assessment was made of possible requirements under different scenarios,” Srivastava said, adding “we would therefore discourage any speculation in this regard or any attempts to politicise the matter.”

Srivastava said the restrictions have been largely lifted after confirming the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies. “The DGFT (Directorate General Foreign Trade) has notified lifting restrictions on 14 drugs yesterday (Monday). With regard to paracetamol and Hydroxychloroquine, they will be kept in a licensed category and their demand position would be continuously monitored. However, stock position could allow our companies to meet the export commitments they had contracted,” he said.

India is one of the biggest produces of these generic medicines.

On Monday, during a media briefing at the White House, Trump said he would be “surprised” if New Delhi does not send Hydroxychloroquine after his phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week.

Reiterating that India has been taking advantage of the US for many years in connection with trade, Trump said, “I didn’t hear that was his (Modi) decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries I spoke to him yesterday, very very good talk, and we’ll see whether or not that stays I wouldn’t be surprised if he would you know because India’s does very well with the United States.”

“So, I would be surprised if that were his decision. He’d have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said we’d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn’t allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course, there may be retaliation. Why wouldn’t there be?”

Meanwhile, accusing US President of arm-twisting India, CPI(M) Politburo on Tuesday urged the Modi Government to consider only the safety and welfare of the people of India. “Trump’s threat to India is in tune with the obnoxious attempts to secure drugs and other pandemic related material and in diverting supplies meant for other countries in pure self interest,” said Politburo.

The US President has over the last few days described Hydroxychloroquine as a “game-changer” though it is yet to be established as an effective cure for COVID-19.

Last month, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had recommended the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating healthcare workers serving coronavirus patients.

In a notification on March 25, the Government announced a hold on the medicine’s export, adding that it would be allowed only on “case-to case basis” on humanitarian grounds.

Hydroxychloroquine tablets are recognised as a prophylactic for those on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 - doctors, nurses, paramedics, and first responders - and can be used to treat patients.

194,08-4-20,"Cases cross 5,000 mark, Maha at top’","India crossed the 5,000 mark of positive coronavirus cases on Tuesday with Maharashtra becoming the first State in the country to go near 1,000 count. As per tallies from States, the total count of positive cases stood at 5,200 at 9 pm with 150 casualties. The country added more than 400 new cases during the day and the States were still reporting.

Mahasrashtra, which has emerged as the biggest hotspot in the country, added 150 new cases on Tuesday and reported as many as 60 deaths. Tamil Nadu registered 67 new cases, which took its count to 690, followed by Delhi, Telangana, Kerala Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

A day after tea vendor operating near Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s private residence “Matoshri” at Kalanagar, Bandra (east) in north-west Mumbai, tested positive for Covid-19, as many as 170 security personnel, including State reserve personnel, were on Tuesday quarantined at a building in the neighbourhood, as a precautionary measure.

The tea vendor, who had tested positive, is currently being treated at the HBT Medical College and Dr RN Cooper Hospital at Juhu in north-west Mumbai.

What caused anxiety was the fact that the security personnel attached to the CM used to frequent the affected vendor’s stall to have tea.

Not wanting to take any chances, the Brihanmumbnai Municipal Corporation (BMC) decided to shift 170 security personnel to the nearby the Uttar Bhartiya Sangh building in Mumbai’s Bandra (East), where they have been quarantined.

Meanwhile, the Government has put in place three-layered mechanism for identification of the appropriate Covid-19 dedicated facility depending on the severity of the virus infected patient.

The available data in India suggests that nearly 70 per cent of the Covid-19 cases either exhibit mild or very mild symptoms.

Such cases may not require admission to Covid-19 blocks/dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.

The guidance document on appropriate management of suspect/confirmed cases of Covid-19 released by the Union Health Ministry on Tuesday focused on three types of Covid-19 dedicated facilities --- dedicated COVID Care Centre, dedicated COVID Health Centre and dedicated COVID hospitals.

Patients will also be categorised into three groups and managed in the respective Covid hospitals.

Under the first layer, critical care under which all Covid patients would be sent to HDU (High Dependence Units) and ICU at Government medical colleges while at level 2 health centres will cater to patients with “mild symptoms” admitted in isolation facilities.

“Level 3 care centres will cover patients with ‘very mild symptoms’,” said Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal at a Press briefing here.

The standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the Government aims to provide care to all Covid-19 patients. Cases continue to surge across the States with Maharashtra reporting to be the worst-hit at 868 total confirmed cases and 52 deaths so far, followed by Tamil Nadu at 621 and Delhi at 523.

The SOP will ensure that the available hospital beds are used only for moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 and also specify the different types of facilities to be set up for various categories of Covid-19 cases, as per the document posted on the Ministry’s website.

All the three types will have separate earmarked areas for suspect and confirmed cases. Suspect and confirmed cases should not be allowed to mix under any circumstances.

All suspect cases (irrespective of severity of their disease) will be tested for Covid-19. Further management of these cases will depend on their clinical status and result of Covid-19 testing, as per the Government guidelines.

The Covid Care Centres (CCC) which will be makeshift facilities will offer care only for cases that have been clinically assigned as mild or very mild cases or Covid-19 suspect cases.

These may be set up in hostels, hotels, schools, stadiums, lodges etc, both public and private. If need be, existing quarantine facilities could also be converted into Covid Care Centres. Functional hospitals like CHCs, etc, which may be handling regular, non-Covid cases, should be designated as Covid Care Centres as a last resort.

Wherever a Covid Care Centre is designated for admitting both the confirmed and the suspected cases, these facilities must have separate areas for suspected and confirmed cases with preferably separate entry and exit. Suspect and confirmed cases must not be allowed to mix under any circumstances, as per the document.

As far as possible, wherever suspect cases are admitted to the Covid Care Centre, preferably individual rooms should be assigned for such cases.

The next in line is the Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC), which are hospitals that shall offer care for all cases that have been clinically assigned as moderate. These should either be a full hospital or a separate block in a hospital with preferably separate entry/exit/zoning.

Private hospitals may also be designated as Covid Dedicated Health Centres, according to the document. These hospitals would have beds with assured oxygen support.

The Dedicated COVID hospitals are hospitals that shall offer comprehensive care primarily for those who have been clinically assigned as severe.

The States/UTs may identify hospitals with dedicated and separate space and set up fever clinics in such hospitals. The fever clinics may also be set up in CHCs, in rural areas subject to availability of sufficient space to minimise the risk of cross infections.

In urban areas, the civil general hospitals, urban CHCs and municipal hospitals may also be designated as fever clinics. These could be set up preferably near the main entrance for triage and referral to appropriate Covid-19 dedicated facility. Wherever space allows, a temporary make shift arrangement outside the facility may be arranged for this triaging.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cases-cross-5-000-mark--maha-at-top----2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cases-cross-5-000-mark--maha-at-top---.html
195,08-4-20,WhatsApp limits forwards to ‘one at a time’ to curb corona canards,"With a view to limit the circulation of fake news and misinformation through its platform amid the spread of coronavirus, WhatsApp is reducing its limits on message forwarding even further. It will now allow users to share frequently forwarded messages to only one chat at a time.

Increased forwards of fake information on symptoms, cures, Government advisories and lockdown extension on WhatsApp have added to panic among people. The existing limit allowing users to forward a message for up to five times will continue as the new restriction is only for the frequently forwarded messages.

“In effect, these messages are less personal compared to typical messages sent on WhatsApp. We are now introducing a limit so that these messages can only be forwarded to one chat at a time. “We know many users forward helpful information, as well as funny videos, memes, and reflections or prayers they find meaningful,” said WhatsApp in a blog on Tuesday.

“In recent weeks, people have also used WhatsApp to organise public moments of support for frontline health workers. However, we’ve seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. We believe it’s important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation,” it said.

“The limits on forwarded messages led to a 25 per cent decrease in message forwards globally at the time,” it said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/whatsapp-limits-forwards-to----one-at-a-time----to-curb-corona-canards.html
196,08-4-20,Patient can infect 406 in 30 days if lockdown not followed: ICMR,"Union Health Ministry on Tuesday cited a study by ICMR to claim that one COVID-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if s/he does not follow lockdown measures, implying that spread of the infection in the country cannot be curbed without strictly adhering to social distancing recommendations.

“The affected person can infect more than 400 people in 30 days. The analysis is based on a mathematical model of coronavirus transmission done by the ICMR. In medical terms — this phenomenon is known as R-naught or R0, a virus’s basic reproductive number — an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness of infectious agents,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said at a routine Press briefing here.

“If we follow the proper measures and social distancing, the infection rate can be cut down to just 2.5 people per patient in 30 days,” Agarwal said.

Lockdown is a very important intervention in terms of management of COVID19, he said on the day India entered the third week of the lockdown.

The official, however, refused to comment on a query that whether the Government plans to extend or end the lockdown.

Agarwal said the Government’s cluster containment strategy to tackle Covid-19 has yielded good results. “The strategy for cluster containment which are amenable to management and adopted by the Government are showing positive results, especially in Agra, Gautam Buddh Nagar (Uttar Pradesh), Pathanamthitta (Kerala), Bhilwara (Rajasthan) and East Delhi. The same strategy has been adopted in Mumbai and other districts also,” he said.

He also said the Smart Cities are ensuring collaborated efforts to monitor the suspected cases of COVID-19.

Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, Chief Scientist of ICMR, said 107,006 tests have been conducted so far. “As many as 11,795 tests have been conducted in 24 hours, of which 2,530 have been done in private labs. As many as 136 Government labs are working and 59 private labs have been given permission,” Gangakhedkar said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/patient-can-infect-406-in-30-days-if-lockdown-not-followed--icmr-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/patient-can-infect-406-in-30-days-if-lockdown-not-followed--icmr.html
197,08-4-20,"NBA slams Sonia for asking PM to stop Govt, PSUs’ ads to media","Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut down media advertisements, among other measures, to meet the financial demands to fight corona pandemic. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) deplored the suggestion, which it said came at a time when journalists risked their lives to cover the pandemic.

In a letter to the PM, Sonia urged the PM to impose a complete ban on media advertisements by the Government and PSUs for a period of two years, with advisories for issues relating to public health being the sole exception.

“At a time when media personnel, without fearing for their lives, are doing their national duty, by disseminating news on the pandemic, a statement like this from the Congress president is highly demoralising, ‘the NBA said in a statement.

“On one hand there has been a slump in advertisement revenues of electronic media due to recession, on the other hand it is suffering from financial blows due to nationwide lockdown of all industries and businesses. Moreover, news channels are spending heavily on providing safety to their reporters and production staff. To suggest a “complete ban” on Government and PSU advertisements is not only ill-timed, but highly arbitrary,” it added.

198,08-4-20,"Invoke stringent law against those hoarding, black marketing essentials: MHA to states","The Centre has asked the states and the union territories to invoke a stringent law to punish those indulging in hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, saying such acts can't be ruled out due to the loss of production and labour crisis in the wake of the nationwide lockdown.

In a communication to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), under the Disaster Management Act, has allowed manufacture or production, transport and other related supply-chain activities in respect of essential goods like foodstuff, medicines and medical equipment during the 21-day lockdown.

However, there are reports of loss of production due to various factors, especially because of the reduction in labour supply.

""In this situation, the possibility of inventory building/hoarding and black marketing, profiteering, and speculative trading, and the resulting price rise of essential goods cannot be ruled out,"" he said.

Bhalla asked the state governments and the UT administrations to take urgent steps to ensure availability of these essential goods, by invoking provisions of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955.

These measures include fixing of stock limits, capping of prices, enhancing production, inspection of accounts of dealers and other such actions, he said.

""Offences under EC Act are criminal offences and may result in imprisonment of 7 years or fine or both.

""State/Union Territory Governments may also consider detention of offenders under the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980,"" Bhalla said..

The home secretary said the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, is authorising the states and the union territories to notify orders under the EC Act, 1955 by relaxing the requirement or prior concurrence of the central government up to June 30, 2020.

""I would urge you to personally take urgent steps to ensure availability of these commodities at fair prices for public at large,"" he said.

The country-wide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 in a bid to combat the coronavirus threat.

On Tuesday, Delhi Police's Crime Branch lodged an FIR against seven people, including the cleric, on a complaint by SHO Nizamuddin for holding a religious congregation here allegedly in violation of the lockdown orders and not maintaining social distancing to contain the spread of coronavirus.

The Delhi Police's Crime Branch wrote to Saad and others on Wednesday, seeking the details under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

""Saad is currently under self quarantine and will join investigation once the period of 14 days gets over,"" his advocate, Tauseef Khan, told PTI.

According to the FIR, the Delhi Police contacted the authorities of Markaz on March 21 and reminded them of the government order that prohibited any political or religious gathering of more than 50 people.

However, no one paid any heed to the police's direction, it said.

Moreover, an audio recording purportedly of Saad was found in circulation on WhatsApp on March 21, in which he was heard asking his followers to defy the lockdown and social distancing and to attend the religious gathering of the Markaz.

On March 24, the government ordered 21-day nationwide lockdown and restricted any social, political or religious gathering.

The same day a meeting was held at Hazarat Nizamuddin police station between SHO and officer bearers of Markaz. The meeting was attended by Saad, Mohammad Ashraf, Mohammad Salman, Yunus, Mursaleen Saifi, Jishan and Mufti Shehzad and they were informed about lockdown orders.

It was found that despite repeated efforts, they did not inform the Health Department or any other government agency about the huge gathering inside the Markaz and deliberately disobeyed government orders.

205,08-4-20,Boris stable in ICU with coronavirus,"Boris Johnson who was hospitalised with persistent coronavirus symptoms is stable in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a London hospital and has not required ventilator support for breathing, Downing Street said in a health update on the British Prime Minister on Tuesday.

“The PM has been stable overnight and remains in good spirits. He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and is breathing without any other assistance. He has not required mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.

Johnson spent the Monday night in the ICU at a London hospital in a move Downing Street said was a “precaution” should the British prime minister require ventilation to aid his recovery from COVID-19.

Johnson, 55, was taken to St Thomas’ Hospital in London, a specialist infectious diseases National Health Service (NHS) facility, on Sunday night for “routine tests” after persistent coronavirus symptoms including a high temperature and a cough. His condition “worsened” during the course of Monday when his doctors decided to shift him to ICU.

“The Prime Minister is not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support and one of the reasons of being in intensive care is to ensure that whatever support the medical team consider to be appropriate can be provided,” said UK Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove on Tuesday morning.

Johnson had tested positive for coronavirus 12 days ago and had continued to lead the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic via video conferencing from his Downing Street home.

On Monday night, he asked his First Secretary of State, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, to step in for him and the minister will be chairing his second daily COVID-19 meeting in place of the UK PM on Tuesday.

“The government’s business will continue. The Prime Minister is in safe hands with that brilliant team at St Thomas’ hospital, and the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister’s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward,” said Raab, who would be deputising for Johnson “where necessary” while he is in hospital.

“There’s an incredibly strong team spirit behind the Prime Minister, and making sure that we get all of the plans the Prime Minister’s instructed us to deliver, to get them implemented as soon as possible. And that’s the way it will bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge that we face right now,” said the senior Cabinet minister.

The team spirit was on display as ministers of Johnson’s top team took to social media to wish him a speedy recovery and support to his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds.

“My love and thoughts are with Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds and the Prime Ministers family. Praying for you and thinking of you,” said UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in her Twitter message, alongside an image of her alongside Johnson at a temple in London on the campaign trail from the past year.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/boris-stable-in-icu-with-coronavirus.html
206,08-4-20,Boris Johnson's condition stable; spends second night in intensive care,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a second night in intensive care and he was ""stable"" and ""in good spirits"" while receiving treatment for coronavirus, a senior health official said on Wednesday.

Johnson, 55, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the St Thomas' Hospital here on Sunday ""for close monitoring"" after his condition worsened.

The Prime Minister is ""comfortable, he's stable, he's in good spirits"", Edward Argar, serving as the minister of state for health, told the BBC on Wednesday.

The Prime Minister's office also suggested the first review into whether the coronavirus lockdown could be eased would not go ahead as planned on Monday next week, the report said.

Asked on BBC Breakfast when the measures might be lifted, Argar said the scientific evidence ""isn't yet there to allow us to make us a decision"".

""We have to be over that peak before we can think about making changes,"" he said, adding: ""It's too early to say when we will reach that peak.""

A ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the closure of shops selling non-essential goods were among the series of restrictions announced by Johnson on March 23 to tackle the spread of coronavirus.

He had said a relaxation of the rules would be considered in three weeks, which would be on April 13.

But on Tuesday, Downing Street suggested that the review would not go ahead on the scheduled date and would instead take place after the three-week mark.

On Wednesday, health minister Argar said: ""We need to start seeing the numbers coming down and that's when you're in the negative.

""That's when you have a sense when that's sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that. We're not there yet and I don't exactly know when we will be.""

He urged people to stay at home ""however lovely the weather this Easter weekend"".

""If we are, as the statistics appear to show, making a little bit of progress, now's the time to hold to it,"" he said.

His comments came as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK rose to 6,159 on Tuesday - a record increase of 786 in a day, the Department of Health and Social Care said, compared with 439 on Monday.

The country also had over 55,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Johnson, said on Tuesday he was ""confident"" Johnson would recover from this illness, describing him as a ""fighter"".

Raab said Johnson was receiving standard oxygen treatment and was breathing without any assistance, such as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support.

The prime minister was originally admitted to St Thomas' on Sunday, on the advice of his doctor, after continuing to display symptoms of cough and high temperature 10 days after testing positive for the virus.

Raab said the prime minister was being monitored closely in critical care.

""And I'm confident he'll pull through, because if there's one thing I know about this prime minister, he's a fighter. And he'll be back at the helm, leading us through this crisis in short order,"" Raab added.

The Queen and other senior royals sent messages to Johnson's family and his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, saying they were thinking of them, and wished the Prime Minister a full and speedy recovery.

208,08-4-20,Kylie Jenner is world's youngest self-made billionaire 2nd year in a row,"Reality TV star and make-up czarina Kylie Jenner becomes the youngest self-made billionaire in the world for the second year in a row.



Forbes released the annual World's Billionaires list, and Jenner remains the youngest self-made billionaire.



Jenner first made it onto the billionaires list in March 2019, then further cemented her spot in November, when she agreed to sell 51 per cent of her Kylie Cosmetics to beauty giant Coty Inc. for $600 million.



The deal, which closed in January, values her business at about $1.2 billion. The cash from the sale and her remaining 49 per cent share of the company make Jenner one of just 2,095 people in the world with a ten-digit fortune, reports forbes.com.



""I didn't expect anything. I did not foresee the future,"" Jenner had previously told Forbes, adding: ""But (the recognition) feels really good. That's a nice pat on the back.""



Jenner started her cosmetics empire in 2014. She turned her social media following into a dedicated customer base by using about $250,000 of modeling earnings to pay an outside company to produce Kylie-branded lip kits --$29 packages of lipstick with matching lip liner. The first batch of 15,000 lip kits sold out within the first minute. She soon expanded, releasing 500,000 kits in six shades a few months later.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kylie-jenner-is-world-s-youngest-self-made-billionaire-2nd-year-in-a-row-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/kylie-jenner-is-world-s-youngest-self-made-billionaire-2nd-year-in-a-row.html

210,08-4-20,Plan for 1L Covid rapid tests in Delhi hotspots,"Govt may take over pvt hospitals, hotel rooms if required for quarantine

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced a five-point action plan to tackle coronavirus spread in the national Capital and said one lakh random rapid COVID-19 tests will be conducted in city’s hotspots.

While addressing a Press conference via video link, the CM said the Delhi Government will take over private hospitals and 12,000 rooms of hotels in a phased manner if coronavirus cases constantly rise and reach up to active 30,000 cases in the city. Delhi has 525 corona positive cases as on Tuesday night.

The CM said the Government has earmarked 410 beds in Max Saket (318 beds), Apollo (50 beds) and Gangaram Colemet (42 beds). He said the Government-run LNJP (1,500 beds), GB Pant (500), Rajiv Gandhi Hospital (450) have been declared COVID-19 dedicated hospitals.

“At present, there are 2,950 beds reserved for COVID-19 cases. If the number of patients crosses 3000, we will use 1500 beds at GTB hospital following which we will have arrangements for 4,500 cases,” Kejriwal said.

Thee CM said, “There is a worldwide coronavirus outbreak and we have to formulate a strategy on how to deal with the pandemic by learning from other nations. All these things have certainly taught us that we have to be there steps ahead of corona or else we will not be able to contain it. All the nations who have managed to be a step ahead of corona, have managed to control it. I have been in touch with various experts and doctors through the course of the last few days. We have formulated a five-point plan to be able to deal with the situation in Delhi.”

Elaborating on the five-point action plan, the CM said, “It includes five Ts -- testing, tracing, treatment, team-work and tracking -- and monitoring.”

Kejriwal said, “We have observed that the nations where testing was not done were not able to contain the outbreak of corona. Maximum testing enables us to know the actual stats of people affected by corona. South Korea, for instance, increased its testing capacity so that it can quarantine and treat infected people, and control further spread of the virus. Just as South Korea, we will be testing on a larger scale. We had a deficiency in the number of testing kits until now, but now we are able to increase the testing capacity. We have ordered testing for around 50,000 people, and we have also ordered rapid testing rounds for one lakh people which will begin from Friday. Through rapid testing, we will be able to identify the hotspot areas of the COVID-19 outbreak and take necessary action.”

“The second T is tracing, which involves identifying and self-quarantining people who have come in contact with an infected person in the 14-day period, through an efficient mechanism with the help of our doctors. We have also started taking the help of the police who will trace whether the people who have been advised to self-quarantine themselves have actually done it or not. For this, we have given 27,702 contact numbers to the police, through which they will be able to trace their movement. Through this, we will also be able to monitor the movements of the people who were taken out of Markaz. The places visited by these people will then be sealed based on their movements around. We will be able to quarantine, seal and monitor people based on tracing.”

Kejriwal said apart from increasing beds in the existing hospitals, 12,000 beds in hotels have been prepared and banquets and dharamshalas have also been included for setting up isolation facilities.

“We have mapped these requirements up to 30,000 active patients in Delhi, wherein we will have 8,000 hospital beds and 12,000 beds in hotels, and 10,000 patients will be placed in banquets and dharamshalas. Serious patients who are suffering from heart diseases etc, and patients above 50 years will be isolated in hospitals and the rest with minor symptoms will be kept in isolation in hotels and dharamshalas. We will need 400 ventilators and 1,200 oxygen kits for 30,000 patients. For now, the shortage of PPE kits that we were facing will be resolved, since the Union government has helped us by giving us 27,000 PPE kits,” he said.

“The 4th T is teamwork. None can work on containing corona alone. It requires teamwork and a collective effort to do that, and I am happy that all the State Governments and the Central Government are fighting together against it. All the State Governments must learn from each other, and work towards eliminating corona. We should be happy with each other’s successes. We should work together as one family. Doctors and nurses are an essential part of this family. We have to save their lives because they are our warriors. Also, I would like to appeal to the people to stay inside and maintain social distancing. I am happy that people who have resources are coming forward to help the needy. Organisations are donating food to the people, and all parties, whether opposition or not, are working together in this crisis. A few days back, I had interacted with the BJP Delhi MLAs, and I will be interacting with all MPs tomorrow to deliberate on the situation,” said Kejriwal.

“It is my responsibility to ensure that all these measures are in place and all the systems are functioning smoothly. I am tracking and monitoring all these things 24x7,” Kejriwal concluded.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/plan-for-1l-covid-rapid-tests-in-delhi-hotspots-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/plan-for-1l-covid-rapid-tests-in-delhi-hotspots.html
211,08-4-20,Tamannaah: There are a lot of misconceptions about me,"Actress Tamannaah Bhatia tells you that she prefers to prove her versatility as an actor across different film industries as opposed to finding space only in Bollywood. She adds that people tend to think she is ""out of work"" because she is not visible enough in Bollywood.

Tamannaah is a phenomenal star in the southern industries with several successful films including ""Kandein Kadhalai"", ""100% Love"", the ""Baahubali"" franchise, ""Ayan"" and ""Paiyaa"", but she is yet to leave an impact in Bollywood.

""I have been making a conscious effort of multitasking between genres within the South Indian film industry. I have been away from Bollywood actively to ensure there's more versatility in my creative kitty and to ensure I'm not stereotyped into any particular genre. Versatility is the key to survival. I've always been passionate about cinema and I never wanted to limit myself to any one industry. There a lot of misconceptions about me, to be honest,"" she told IANS.

""The most bizarre piece of news I read recently was that I am out of employment! There are other stories of me not having a bright future in Bollywood, versus Tollywood. Just to clear the air, I'm working 365 days a year and hence I can't shuffle between multiple industries. I'm not part of the rat race and I don't want to prove a point to anyone. I want to make my mark on my own terms. For me it was only about acting, and not about the industry,"" Tamannaah claimed.

She also feels somehow her luck has favoured her in the south than in Bollywood, and language was never a barrier for her.

""My thirst for excellence had to be quenched and the South accepted me. As an actor, I will always play my part with full dedication but the results are not in my hands,"" said Tamannaah.

The actress will be seen playing a Kabaddi coach in the upcoming Telugu film ""Seetimaar"".

Being a girl who never played any sport before, Tamannaah said that the challenge kicked her to take up the role.

Sharing an insight into her preparation for the role, she said: ""I play the coach of the Telangana kabaddi team while Gopichand plays the coach of an Andhra kabaddi team. It is a very challenging and inspiring role. It is a huge tribute to the unsung heroes in sports. I had to prepare and work very hard for this role and it constantly motivated me to give my best. It's my first sports drama and I'm very excited. I did everything I could to look the part. I never imagined that I would get to play kabaddi in my life, let alone in a film.""

She added: ""I have undergone a complete transformation for this particular role, right from language, technical knowledge of the game, maintaining a good fitness regime, special training sessions and more. Kabaddi is a very disciplined Indian sport. I learnt to be vigilant and focussed on physical and physiological aspects such as strength, endurance, flexibility and agility.""

While the actress maintained a special vegetarian, gluten-free diet, she also learnt a new dialect for the film.

""I had to get a hang of the Telangana dialect. I had to learn the Telangana slang. It's really challenging, but Sampath sir is helping me with the dialogue delivery,"" Tamannaah signed off.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tamannaah--there-are-a-lot-of-misconceptions-about-me-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/tamannaah--there-are-a-lot-of-misconceptions-about-me.html
212,08-4-20,Cary Joji Fukunaga rules out re-editing 'No Time To Die',"Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga has dismissed the suggestion that he should polish his upcoming project, James Bond movie No Time To Die , after it was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The film, which marks actor Daniel Craig's last outing as British spy 007, was set to release this month but in the wake of the global pandemic, the makers decided to push it till November.

Fukunaga, who came aboard as a director after the exit of Danny Boyle, was asked by a fan on Instagram about trimming and polishing the movie, given the extra time he now has before the film's debut.

In his reply, the director said the final cut of the film is great and there is no need to tinker with it.

Some people have asked me this and although time would have been lovely, we had to put our pencils down when we finished our post production window, which was thankfully before COVID shut down everything else, Fukunaga said.

The short answer is money. Although Bond is a big movie, we still have to weigh cost with value. And like anything, you could tinker endlessly. The movie is great as it is, hope ya'll will feel same too when it comes out, he added.

""No Time To Die"", which is 25th installment of the action spy franchise, has been plagued by multiple problems since the start.

Last year, Craig suffered an injury during the film's shooting in Jamaica, for which he underwent a minor surgery in the ankle.

The new film in the Bond franchise was previously set to be directed by Boyle and had a release date of November 8, 2019.

But the Oscar-winning filmmaker exited the project over ""creative differences"", along with frequent collaborator, screenwriter John Hodge. The film's release date was then moved to April 2020.

213,08-4-20,More than 29 million hydroxychloroquine doses bought by US have come from India: Trump,"A sizeable chunk of the 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine bought by the US to combat the coronavirus pandemic is from India, President Donald Trump has said as he acknowledged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""great"" when he sought his help to allow the sale of the anti-malaria drug to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients in America.

Trump and Prime Minister Modi spoke over the phone last week. During the call, Trump requested Modi to lift the hold on the American order of hydroxychloroquine, of which India is the major producer.

Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York. Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.

""I bought millions of doses (of hydroxychloroquine). More than 29 million. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, a lot of it (hydroxychloroquine) comes out of India. I asked him if he would release it? He was Great. He was really good,"" Trump told Sean Hannity of the Fox News on Monday night.

""You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India, Trump said responding to a question on the usage of hydroxychloroquine.

India on Tuesday allowed the export of hydroxychloroquine to the US, which has emerged as the global hotspot of COVID-19.

By Tuesday night, nearly four lakh Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus and the fatalities was more than 12,850. During the interview, Trump described hydroxychloroquine as a powerful malaria drug. The drug is being tested on hundreds of coronavirus patients in New York.

But there are a lot of good things coming from that, Trump said.

Lot of people are looking at it and saying, you know I don't hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don't hear anything where it is causing death, said the US President.

Hydroxychloroquine, an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria, is seen as a viable therapeutic solution by President Trump to coronavirus.

Last week Trump said he has sought help from Prime Minister Modi to allow the sale of hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in his country, hours after India banned the export of the anti-malarial drug.

India has received similar requests from several other countries including its immediate neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal. India has said that it is reviewing its export ban order.

Notably, India's decision to ban the exports of hydroxychloroquine is driven by its desire to take stock of the domestic requirements and ensure that the country has enough of the drug.

""I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States,"" Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House on Monday.

Trump and Modi enjoy a personal friendship as reflected in the president joining the prime minister at the ""Howdy, Modi!"" event in Houston last September.

This February, Trump made a rare India-specific solo trip to Ahmedabad and New Delhi.

India on Monday agreed to lift the ban on export of hydroxychloroquine to the US. Three Gujarat-based companies would export these tablets to the US, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Tuesday.

India manufactures 70 per cent of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine, according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary-general Sudarshan Jain.

The country has a production capacity of 40 tonnes of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) every month, implying 20 crore tablets of 200 mg each. And since the drug is also used to auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, manufacturers have good production capacities that can also be ramped up.

214,08-4-20,Young smokers less likely to give up smoking as adults,"The younger you start smoking, the more likely you are to smoke daily as an adult, even into your 40s, and the harder it will be to quit, warn researchers.

The study, published in the journal American Heart Association, focused on smoking at an early age, using information obtained directly from children and adolescents in the 1970s to 1980s and re-contacting many of them as recently as 2018.

""Based on our data coupled with a variety of other evidence, we found childhood smoking leads to adult smoking,"" said study lead author David Jacobs from the University of Minnesota in the US.

For the findings, the research team analysed smoking information on more than 6,600 people (57 per cent female) between the ages of 6-19 and during their 20s and 40s, from Finland, Australia and the US.

Participants were followed from childhood into middle age as part of the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort Consortium.

The study analysis found that adolescents who smoked the most and children who started smoking at younger ages were more likely to be daily smokers in their 20s and were less likely to quit smoking by their 40s.

Even children who only tried smoking at a very minimal level - a few cigarettes - were more likely to end up as a daily adult smoker.

The percentage of participants who smoked daily during their 20s was eight per cent for those who first tried smoking at age 18-19; 33 per cent for those who first tried smoking at age 15-17; 48 per cent for those who first tried smoking at age 13-14; and 50 per cent for those who first tried smoking during ages 6-12.

Only 2.6 per cent of participants who took up smoking for the first time after their 20s smoked in their 40s, the study said.

Although the current study was conducted in three developed nations, the researchers believe that the results likely apply more broadly.

""Even in low income and developing countries, the societal reinforcement of smoking, the basic addictive qualities of nicotine, and the maturation of children and children's judgment through adolescence are universal,"" said Jacobs.

""Cigarette smoking is an avoidable health risk, and its seeds are in childhood. Cigarette smoking, even experimentally, among children of any age should be strongly discouraged,"" Jacobs concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/young-smokers-less-likely-to-give-up-smoking-as-adults-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/young-smokers-less-likely-to-give-up-smoking-as-adults.html
215,08-4-20,Teachers Shouldn’t Be Too Dependent on Technology as a Teaching Strategy,"Teachers have to move towards modern strategies of teaching. Several online resources are available to expand learning and make it more fun. Teachers have to be creative in using these resources so that students will listen and engage. The good thing is that students respond well with the use of modern technology. They become more enticed to listen, and they’re easier to control.

Although the use of computers and mobile devices is a good thing, they also have some downsides. Younger learners shouldn't get exposed to these devices for a long time. They're not yet capable of processing the information found on their phones, and it's unhealthy for them. Overexposure to radiation could also pose health risks, including cancer and liver problems. The worst part is that children can easily get addicted to technology. They won't participate in other activities anymore if they get used to it. As such, teachers have to find creative ways to teach the class apart from using computers and other devices.

Go back to traditional visual aids

Back then, teachers have to use flashcards, write on the board, draw posters, and use board games. You can do the same thing. It helps if you try going back to these strategies. They will make the students feel more engaged, especially if they are yet to try those learning aids. They might be challenging to prepare, but the class activity could be fun and meaningful.

Student interaction is necessary

Another problem with online activities is that they’re mostly individual. Students face their screen all the time. Even if they have to compete with one another, they don’t need physical interaction. Everything happens virtually. As such, you need to try other activities requiring student interaction. You want them to move around the classroom or try to talk to each other. You can play charades, group quiz competitions, spelling challenges, and brainstorming sessions. You want the students to talk to each other more often in a fun and academic environment.

Encourage the use of EMF protection

The worst part about using computers all the time is the risk of radiation exposure. However, since you need to use the computer for some activities, the best option is to encourage the use of EMF protection. You want everyone to stay protected since this device blocks radiation from penetrating the body. Students can wear it or place it somewhere close to them. It would be difficult for radiation to enter the body and pose health threats with the use of EMF protection. You can also limit their exposure to the computer by properly designing the flow of your lessons.

Hopefully, you learn how to use modern technology appropriately. It makes teaching preparations easier, but it also has other risks. You want your students to learn in a fun, safe, and healthy environment. Always look for creative ways to achieve your objectives in class. It might take time and effort, but it would be worth it.",impact,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/teachers-shouldn---t-be-too-dependent-on-technology-as-a-teaching-strategy-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/impact/teachers-shouldn---t-be-too-dependent-on-technology-as-a-teaching-strategy.html
216,08-4-20,China lifts 73-day lockdown of Wuhan amid sharp increase in COVID-19 cases,"Tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, the origin point and epicentre for the coronavirus pandemic, began travelling out of the sprawling city on Wednesday as China lifted its 73-day lockdown, even as the number of fresh COVID-19 cases crossed 1,000 in the country and two new deaths heightened concerns of a rebound in infections.

The Chinese health authority said on Wednesday that 62 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, including 59 cases of people returning from abroad, taking the total tally to 1,042.

Three new domestic cases were reported, including two in Shandong Province and one in Guangdong Province, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.

Also on Tuesday, 137 new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were reported and 1,095 asymptomatic cases were still under medical observation, the NHC said.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptoms and have the potential to cause sporadic clusters of infections.

Two deaths were reported on Tuesday, with one in Shanghai and the other in Hubei Province, taking the overall death toll in the country to 3,333, it said.

On Monday, the NHC reported no deaths for the first time after it began publishing COVID-19 daily reports since January this year.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 81,802 by Tuesday, including 1,190 patients still being treated, 77,279 patients discharged after recovery, and 3,333 people died of the disease.

Wednesday is yet another landmark day in China as it lifted about the 73-day lockdown of Wuhan city of 11 million people, ending its painful isolation due to COVID-19 which was first detected there in December last year.

No new confirmed case of coronavirus was reported on Tuesday in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, but the province recorded one death.

Hubei has so far reported 67,803 confirmed COVID-19 cases in total, including 50,008 in Wuhan.

On January 23, Wuhan declared unprecedented traffic restrictions, including suspending the city's public transport and all outbound flights and trains, in an attempt to contain the epidemic.

The Wuhan lockdown was lifted even as epidemiologists warned that it is not the time to completely lower the guard and ease on full-scale restrictions, considering the looming asymptomatic patients and possible rebound in infections, the official media reported.

As the lockdown was lifted, tens of thousands of people from Wuhan began leaving the city on Wednesday. The government has lifted the ban on road, air and train travel for all the locals who have acquired health certificates.

Cars queued up at expressway toll gates and passengers prepared to board trains to leave Wuhan as the megacity started lifting outbound travel restrictions, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

At Fuhe toll gate in nothern Wuhan, cars honked and rushed out after barricades were removed at midnight.

Guo Lei, who ran a business in Wuhan, drove his car with six other people aboard to the toll gate at around 8:40 pm (local time) and waited for a homebound trip.

""I can't wait returning to my hometown,"" said Guo, a native of east China's Shandong Province.

""I have lived in Wuhan for eight years. During the Spring Festival holiday, my relatives came to the city and helped me deliver goods. We were all stranded here due to the epidemic,"" Guo said.

Big data from Wuhan traffic police forecast the expressways would see the peak of outbound vehicles on Wednesday.

As more enterprises resume their operations, Wuhan has seen an increase of nearly 400,000 vehicles in transit in the past half month, and the number is expected to reach 1.8 million after Wednesday, according to the city's traffic police.

Traffic police will release real-time traffic information through radio stations, online social platforms, and map apps.

At Wuchang Railway Station in the city, 442 passengers jumped on the train K81 early Wednesday, which is heading for Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.

More than 55,000 passengers are expected to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday, and about 40 per cent of them are going to the Pearl River Delta Region. Over 270 passenger trains will leave Wuhan for Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities, Xinhua report said.

The railway authorities required passengers to scan health codes and have temperatures checked when entering the stations and wear masks to reduce the risks of infection.

Workers have disinfected bullet trains, the entrance and exits, waiting halls and platforms of the railway stations in advance.

Wuhan Tianhe International Airport started resuming domestic passenger flights early Wednesday. The airport is expected to see more than 200 inbound and outbound flights on the day, according to the airport.

""The crew will wear goggles, masks, and gloves throughout the flight,"" said Guo Binxue, chief attendant of the flight MU2527. The first flight that is scheduled to depart from Wuhan at 7:25 am Wednesday since the city's lockdown was lifted.

""It will be very smooth because we have made much preparation for this flight,"" Guo said.

Flight attendants would provide masks for passengers if they had fever, cough and other symptoms, and record their personal information and contact history within 14 days, Guo said, adding: ""We have simplified the service process to better protect everyone's health"".

The central Hubei province has already lifted all the travel restrictions.

Over here on E Street, we are crushed by the loss of John Prine. John and I were ""New Dylans"" together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the lovliest guy in the world. A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages. We send our love and prayers to his family, Springsteen wrote in a post on Twitter.

While Musgraves posted, Heartbroken.

Raitt, who recorded Angel from Montgomery in the 1970s, said he is feeling crushed after learning about Prine's demise.

Words can't even come close. I'm crushed by the loss of my dear friend, John. My heart and love go out to Fiona and all the family. For all of us whose hearts are breaking, we will keep singing his songs and holding him near, he wrote.

218,08-4-20,I''d love to win a Test series in India: Smith,"Star Australian batsman Steve Smith believes India is one of the toughest places to play Test cricket and winning a five-day format series in the country is a major career goal for him.

""I would love to win a Test series in India,"" Smith told New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi during a podcast organised by inaugural IPL champions Rajasthan Royals.

""I think as an Australian cricketer we talk about like Ashes is always big, World Cup is big but I think now India is no.1 team in the world and it is a very difficult place to play Test cricket, so I would love to win a series there,"" he said.

Talking about his other targets, Smith, who is currently the world's number one Test batsman, said: ""Other then that I would not like to set too many goals, but take things day by day, series by series, just try to improve.

""It has been a pretty long year with the World Cup and Ashes, a few away one day tours. So this rest is not the worst thing but hopefully it is for a few weeks. I am pretty keen to get back to playing.""

Smith also heaped praise on India's spin all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, describing him as a difficult bowler to face in the subcontinent.

""Jadeja in the sub-continent... why he is so good because, he hits that good length and one ball skids on and one spins, and it just all looks same out of the hand. I think consistency in length is key and then having at least one variation,"" he said.

""So, I think for a leg-spinner, having a good googly, or a slider is crucial and for fingers spinners, being able to change the pace without changing the arms speed too much. I reckon there a few around the world who do that, Jadeja is one of them. He is very difficult to play.""

Smith took over the captaincy from Ajinkya Rahane mid-season in the last edition of the IPL and he is keen to lead the Rajasthan Royals from the beginning if the cash-rich event, which has been suspended till April 15 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is held later in the year.

""Plenty going on in the world at present, but hopefully we can get an IPL at some stage,"" said Smith, who has so far amassed 7227 runs in 73 Tests and 4162 runs in ODIs.

""The two seasons that I captained the Royals were both half seasons, Shane Watson gave me the captaincy in 2015 and then last year out of the blue, I took over at the back end of the season. Looking at having a crack at it full time and the Royals have a pretty good squad,"" he said.

Smith started his career as a spinner before emerging as one of the best batsmen in the world.

Talking about his career, the 30-year-old said: ""I was more of a batsman than a bowler. I played my first two Test matches as a specialist spinner which was strange. They were looking for a spinner after the Shane Warne era and I was one of the 12-13 spinners that got a go.

""I got dropped after that and for me it was about finding a way to get into Australian team and at that point of time I let my bowling slip and focussed only on my batting. But I bowl every now and then.""

With the coronavirus outbreak putting countries in lockdown mode across the globe, Smith too has been in isolation and he says he is trying to kill the boredom by playing tennis and spending time with family.

""It is not that strict yet here, so I have been able to go for a run, play tennis,"" he said.

""Getting a little bit bored at times. I have a home gym, getting a fair work there at the moment and obviously Netflix and chill, that is what is happening around the world at the moment.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i--d-love-to-win-a-test-series-in-india--smith-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/i--d-love-to-win-a-test-series-in-india--smith.html

The authorities conducted 42,159 test so far, including 3,076 in the last 24 hours.

The province and region wise data of cases was not available on the ministry's website as it was being updated.

However, private media and official sources reported that number of patients in Punjab has risen to 2,030, Sindh 986, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 527, Gilgit-Baltistan 212, Balochistan 206, Islamabad 83 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 28.

Pakistan was making frantic efforts to tackle the pandemic and Prime Minister Imran Khan once again warned the people to follow official guidelines on self-isolation or the virus would spread further.

At least 50 prisoners in worst-hit Punjab province have tested coronavirus positive.

Inspector General Prisons Shahid Baig told PTI that some 20 cases have been reported in the camp jail Lahore and the remaining in others.

Baig said the outbreak stemmed from a Pakistani citizen who was arrested over narcotics smuggling in Italy and handed over to Pakistan last month. He was diagnosed on March 23.

The government has extended partial lockdown till April 14 and constantly asking people to stay indoors and follow social distancing.

Meanwhile, Balochistan Young Doctors Association (YDA) in Balochistan province has announced to resume services after successful talks with the government.

The YDA was on strike due to lack of protective kits and against police brutality after their rally was baton-charged and several of their colleagues were taken in custody earlier this week.

Provincial Agriculture Minister Zamrak Khan Achakzai said an inquiry will be held against the persons who used violence against the protesting doctors.

220,08-4-20,"'Maska' is about family and bonding, which is very Indian: Jaaved Jaaferi","Actor Jaaved Jaaferi says a slice-of-life film like ""Maska"" is inspiring at a time when the importance of family system is gradually ""regressing"" in the society.

The Netflix film traces the journey of a confused, young millennial, Rumi (Prit Kamani) who sets out to fulfil his dream of becoming a movie star until a summer romance with a clear-headed girl helps him discover the fine line between dreams and delusions.

Jaaved plays Rustom, father to Rumi, who took on and carried the baton of 'Rustom Cafe' continuing the legacy of his family and forefathers, and wants his son to follow his calling.

The 56-year-old actor said he came on board the project, directed by debutant Neeraj Udhwani, as the script resonated deeply with him. The film also stars Manisha Koirala.

""Neeraj came with a good script, I loved it. That was the reason I did it. I identified a lot with the story as I grew up in Bandra where a lot of my Parsi friends lived. So I was very exposed to the Parsi culture.

""One of the producers, Seher Latif is a friend of mine, so I knew she'll do a good job with it. Also, Manisha was there, Netflix was presenting... all these factors encouraged me to join the project,"" Jaaved told PTI.

The actor said movies such as ""Maska"", which celebrates the famed Parsi culture, should be made more frequently.

""The film is inspiring in today's times when the value system is kind of regressing because of the western culture coming in. This speaks about family and bonding, which is very Indian. It's not like 'Parsi Parsi', it's very Indian,"" he said.

""These kinds of films should be made once in a while... they shake us up and remind us of what we were and the beauty of it,"" he added.

Also featuring Nikita Dutta and Shirley Setia, ""Maska"" is streaming on Netflix.

236,08-4-20,Do not label any community or area for spread of COVID-19: Govt,"The government on Wednesday issued an advisory to address the social stigma associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, urging people not to label any community or area for the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The advisory comes following a spurt in coronavirus cases after a Tablighi Jamaat meet at the group's headquarters in Nizamuddin here, and instances of people, especially on social media, blaming the Muslim community for the spread if disease.

Public health emergencies during an outbreak of communicable diseases may cause fear and anxiety leading to prejudices against people and communities, social isolation and stigma, said the government advisory posted on the health ministry website.

Such behaviour may culminate into increased hostility, chaos and unnecessary social disruptions, the advisory said.

The government also listed various dos and don'ts in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

""Do not target healthcare and sanitary workers or police. They are there to help you,"" the government urged the people amid cases of harassment and social stigmatization of healthcare and sanitation workers.

Cases have been reported of people affected with COVID-19 as well as healthcare workers, sanitary workers and police, who are in the frontline for management of the outbreak, facing discrimination on account of heightened fear and misinformation about the infection, the advisory said.

Even those who have recovered from COVID-19 face such discrimination, it noted.

Certain communities and areas are being labelled purely based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere, the advisory said.

There is an urgent need to counter such prejudices and to rise as a community that is empowered with health literacy and responds appropriately in the face of this adversity, it said.

237,08-4-20,"SC directs approved govt, pvt labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 tests","The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed that COVID-19 tests in approved government labs or private laboratories should be conducted free of cost and the Centre should immediately issue directions in this regard.

The top court said the private hospitals including laboratories have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis.

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat, which heard the matter via video conferencing, said that tests relating to COVID-19 or coronavirus must be carried out in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR.

“We, thus, issue following interim directions to the respondents: (i)The tests relating to COVID-19 whether in approved Government Laboratories or approved private Laboratories shall be free of cost. The respondents (Centre and other authorities) shall issue necessary direction in this regard immediately. (ii) Tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR,” the bench said.

The top court said that even before the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, it had spread in several countries and as of now, more than 200 countries are suffering from this pandemic.

“The number of patients suffering from COVID-19 is rapidly increasing Worldwide with death toll rising rapidly. In our country, in spite of various measures taken by the Government of India and different State Government/Union Territory the number of patients and death caused by it is increasing day by day,” the bench said, adding that India has a very large population.

The top court issued directions on a PIL filed by advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi seeking a direction to the Centre and authorities to provide free of cost testing facility for COVID-19 to all citizens in the country.

“We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private labs to charge Rs 4,500 for screening and confirmation test of COVID-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person be deprived to undergo the COVID-19 test due to non-payment of capped amount of Rs 4,500,” the bench said in its order.

It noted the Centre's submission that government laboratories are conducting the COVID-19 tests free of cost.

The top court said that the private hospitals including laboratories have an important role to play in containing the scale of pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis.

“We thus are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private Labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test,” the bench said.

It said that tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out in National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited Labs or any agencies approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

The bench, which issued notice to the Centre and sought its response in two weeks, clarified that the question as to whether the private laboratories carrying free of cost COVID-19 tests are entitled for any reimbursement of expenses incurred shall be considered later on.

It noted that the PIL also challenges the advisory dated March 17, issued by Indian Council of Medical Research Department of Health Research, by which it fixed Rs 4,500 for screening and confirming COVID-19.

The bench said the petitioner also prays that a direction be issued that all the tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out under NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-directs-approved-govt--pvt-labs-to-conduct-free-of-cost-covid-19-tests-2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/sc-directs-approved-govt--pvt-labs-to-conduct-free-of-cost-covid-19-tests.html

242,07-4-20,India’s super spreaders,"At a time when the Union and State Governments and institutions are working with the single determination to contain COVID-19, the Tablighi Jammat has turned out to be a spoiler

The latest estimates of the Union Health Ministry indicate that over 35 per cent of the COVID-19 cases that are springing up in the country have their origins in the conference organised by the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic evangelical movement, in New Delhi in the second half of March, which was in gross violation of State Government orders. At a time when the Union Government, State Governments and every national institution is working with single-minded determination and focus to contain the pandemic that has affected over a million patients globally and claimed over 50,000 lives, the Tablighi Jammat has turned out to be a spoiler.

Displaying gross irresponsibility by flouting the orders of the Delhi Government, the Jamaat held a conference of thousands of its members. The congregation continued even as devotees were barred entry in the most popular temples, including the Balaji Temple in Tirupati, the Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi, the Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer and the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. Lakhs of other temples, churches and religious places remained closed as per Government orders in their areas.

Also, it is said that probably for the first time after the birth of Christianity, churches around the world will be closed in the week leading up to Easter, which is regarded as the most spiritually enriching week for the faithful. Fr Filipe Neri Ferrao, the Archbishop of Goa, asked the clergy to use technology and livestream church services. It quoted him as saying: “The faithful are dispensed from the obligation of participating in the mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation. In order to prevent community transmission of the virus, the faithful are advised not to go for daily mass, unless it is strictly necessary.”

If this is so with other faiths, why did the Tablighi Jamaat defy the Government’s orders? What do we do with these Muslim clerics, who lack basic civic sense, violate the law and even throw a challenge to the authorities? Also, this writer has seen several videos of Muslims violating the lockdown orders and social distancing norms and congregating in large numbers in masjids in different regions in the country in the initial days of the lockdown. This happened because these mullahs pooh-poohed social distancing and virtually laughed at the world that was groaning under the Corona epidemic.

It is now almost two weeks since the authorities suspended prayers in Mecca and Medina. Similarly, several important mosques in India have remained closed. The Kerala Governor, Arif Mohammad Khan, was the other day reciting verses from the Quran in which Allah tells the believers not to go to the mosque but to pray from home, when the circumstances are not conducive.

Yet, none of this matters to some Muslim clerics in India, who are hell bent on challenging the system time and again on the specious ground that Islam is under threat (Islam khatre mein hai). In fact, this was the theme of the address of the chief of the Tablighi Jamaat, Maulana Muhammad Saad, to his audience at the headquarters of the Jamaat. As per an audio clip of his “sermon” that is in circulation, he asked Muslims to ignore the orders for closure of mosques because there was no better place to be than a mosque.

Second, this Coronavirus scare was a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from each other and to weaken Islam. They should, therefore, not fall a prey to this propaganda. Finally, he declared that there was no better place to die than a mosque. This is absolutely horrendous. It shows that despite his long years of Indian citizenship, nothing in the Indian Constitution, the nation’s democratic and fraternal traditions has rubbed off on him. He seems so maladjusted to the nation’s secular, liberal traditions that he renders himself unworthy of the citizenship of such a great democracy.

Every word that he has uttered does violence to the core values in the Constitution and to the deep and abiding faith that all of us have in the principles laid down by our nation’s founding fathers.

It is indeed ironical that this maulana, who delivered this chilling advice to his audience and even said no one can escape from the wrath of Allah, has in recent days gone into hiding. It is so sad that all this bombast does not equip him to face the mundane authorities of the Delhi Government.

Meanwhile, JP Nadda, the president of the BJP, rightly exhorted his party colleagues to ensure that the sins of the Tablighi are not pinned on the entire Muslim community. He has advised them to ensure that this does not become a communal flash point. This is very important. We must sift the wheat from the chaff. It is also important that Muslim political leaders must speak up. Unlike the Hindus, who have hordes of objectors in their ranks against fundamentalists and fringe elements, Muslim politicians hesitate to call out those who threaten the nation’s secular fabric. They must change tack if they wish to preserve the Constitution that enables politicians of all hues to be elected to public office.

There are trouble-makers like Maulana Saad and some other clerics. If we wish to preserve our Constitution and protect the health of 1,300 million citizens, such people must be dealt with in the most severe manner. Just when we thought we were getting to grips with COVID-19, the maulana and other leaders of the Tablighi have triggered a monumental spread of the disease. The Government must send out a strong message that those who play around with the lives of millions of citizens, will be made to pay.

The Indian Penal Code (Sections 168-170) deals with persons, who commit nuisance and spread epidemic diseases, but the punishments under these sections are too mild. The Government must go beyond this. Several States, including Delhi, have already invoked the powers vested in them under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.

The Delhi Government’s regulations required foreigners and persons with travel history to self-quarantine. On March 13, it prohibited assembly or 200 or more people. The Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, slashed this to 20 on March 19. Each of these orders and regulations have been violated by the Nizamuddin gathering.

But the punishments prescribed in these Acts and even in the National Security Act (NSA) are too inadequate for this dastardly and unpardonable sin. Those who violated the curfew, behaved irresponsibly, contracted the disease and spread it to others are one category. But those who are involved in the diabolical act of deliberately spreading this disease should be classified as mass murderers. What should be the punishment for endangering the lives of millions of people and ensuring the death of hundreds of them? The Indian State needs to ponder over this.

243,08-4-20,"773 new infections, 32 deaths due to COVID-19 in 24 hours: Health Ministry","The Union health ministry said on Wednesday that 32 people have died and 773 persons have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in India since Tuesday.

Joint Secretary at the health ministry Lav Agarwal said at the daily briefing that the total number of cases of coronavirus infections stand at 5,194 and the death toll at 149.

However, a PTI tally of the figures reported by various states as on Tuesday 9.45 pm showed at least 162 deaths in the country due to COVID-19.

As the number of cases of COVID-19 are rising in the country, the Centre's response and preparedness along with states is rising accordingly, Agarwal noted.

In hospitals, the focus is that infection prevention and control measures are followed so that health workers aren't infected by COVID-19, he said.

He said the Centre had told states to continue its focus on building hospitals and on surveillance and contact tracing.

He added that there is sufficient stock of hydroxychloroquine available in the country.

An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official said at the briefing that 1,21,271 tests for COVID-19 have been done in the country so far.

The COVID-19 death toll in India is too small to say that the number of deaths in Maharashtra is significantly high, the ICMR official said responding to a question.

248,08-4-20,'Which lung cells are susceptible to coronavirus infection decoded',"Scientists have discovered which cells of the lungs and bronchi are targets for novel coronavirus infection, findings that may aid in the development of novel drug candidates to treat COVID-19.

The study, published in The EMBO Journal, revealed that the receptor for the virus is abundantly expressed in the progenitor cells of the respiratory tract which have hair-like projections to sweep mucus and bacteria out of the lungs.

Researchers, including those from the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) in Germany, analysed samples of twelve lung cancer patients obtained from the Heidelberg Lung Biobank in Germany.

They also studied cells from the airways of healthy patients, which had been collected in a minimally invasive manner during a bronchoscopy examination performed to rule out lung cancer.

""I was convinced that the data we gathered from these non-coronavirus infected patients would provide important information for understanding the viral infection,"" said study co-author Roland Eils from BIH.

""We wanted to find out which specific cells the coronavirus attacks,"" explained Christian Conrad, who also works at the BIH.

The scientists said the virus' spike protein attaches to an ACE2 receptor on the cell surface.

In addition, they said the virus needs one or more co-factors for it to be able to penetrate cells.

Using single-cell sequencing technology, the researchers sequenced the genome of 60,000 cells.

""We then analysed a total of nearly 60,000 cells to determine whether they activated the gene for the receptor and potential co-factors, thus in principle allowing them to be infected by the coronavirus,"" said Soeren Lukassen, one of the lead authors of the study.

""We only found the gene transcripts for ACE2 and for the cofactor TMPRSS2 in very few cells, and only in very small numbers,"" Lukassen said.

The scientists discovered that certain progenitor cells in the bronchi are mainly responsible for producing the coronavirus receptors.

These progenitor cells, they said, normally develop into respiratory tract cells lined with hair-like projections called cilia that sweep mucus and bacteria out of the lungs.

""Armed with the knowledge of which cells are attacked, we can now develop targeted therapies,"" explained co-author Michael Kreuter from the Thorax Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany.

According to the study, the ACE2 receptor density on the cells increased with age, and was generally higher in men than in women.

""This was only a trend, but it could explain why SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women,"" Eils said.

However, the scientists said the sample sizes are too small to make conclusive statements, adding that the study needs to be repeated in larger patient cohorts.

""These results show us that the virus acts in a highly selective manner, and that it is dependent on certain human cells in order to spread and replicate,"" Eils explained.

""The better we understand the interaction between the virus and its host, the better we will be able to develop effective counterstrategies,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-which-lung-cells-are-susceptible-to-coronavirus-infection-decoded--2020-04-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/-which-lung-cells-are-susceptible-to-coronavirus-infection-decoded-.html
