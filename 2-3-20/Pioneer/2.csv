0,02-3-20,China's ‘trust’ deficit,"Once the threat of COVID-19 is contained, it would be in Beijing’s interest to introspect as to why it is distrusted by the rest of the world

The outbreak of Coronavirus that has stymied economic activity across China and the rest of the world, including neighbouring Southeast Asia, has gradually been brought under control, at least in Wuhan, its epicentre. The viral outbreak, now termed as “COVID-19” by the World Health Organisation (WHO), has disrupted manufacturing supply chains across the world, crippled tourism and trade industries and sharply reduced consumption of oil, gas and coal as economic activity has come to a shuddering halt. Weirdly enough, this may not be a bad thing indeed. However, there are a couple of threads that have emerged due to the spread of this virus. It relates to the way China has tackled COVID-19 back home. This will be worth exploring.

Its initial response was actually praiseworthy. Once the Chinese Central leadership was made aware of the ramifications and the impact of this virus on its population, it acted speedily and in a way that only a nation-State with such a centralised command structure can do. Information spread was controlled, medical workers and the armed forces mobilised in a way that frankly only China, which counts among the world’s largest nations, can do. Back in India, if we were to face such a situation, one can only imagine television anchors going hammer and tongs against the panelists. Political parties, too, would not desist from giving a communal angle to the viral outbreak. The speed at which it constructed hospitals and quarantine centres in the city of Wuhan and central Hubei province is noteworthy.

That said, the second issue is one that the Chinese leadership ought to be concerned about. Almost no nation on the planet trusted the statements/information coming out from China about the epidemic. Nor did anyone believe the statistics put out by it. Such fuss about a viral fever that has a low fatality rate. According to official data, Coronavirus infected less than a hundred thousand people in the four weeks it was around. Xinhua, the official press agency of the People’s Republic of China, put these statistics on Twitter. But it likely failed to see the irony of using a social network banned in China. More people have died from the common flu in the US in the past year than have officially died from the COVID-19 virus in China and the rest of the world.

Going by the average toll of 400 deaths per day, in the past month alone, more people must have died on Indian roads. As far as official statistics released by China, the infection and fatality rates are lower than previous major outbreaks, even other flu outbreaks in the past that have emerged such as SARS.

So why this panic and a near war-like emergency in cities across China to contain the outbreak? Is China hiding something? The Chinese authorities claim not to be hiding anything but then, why is everyone talking about the COVID-19 outbreak? People in India and across the world believe that China is hiding something. Is it true?

Videos, purportedly emerging from China, showed how authorities over there are forcibly detaining people and putting them into detention camps. The Chinese authorities were ham-fisted in the way they dealt with Li Wenliang, the doctor who first warned about the possibility of an outbreak and ultimately died of the new coronavirus. Some bloggers, too, have been documenting life in the worst-hit provinces. Supposed presentations by Chinese conglomerates have been leaked into the wild, which claim that the real number of deaths is many multiples of the official numbers, which at the last count stood at around 2,500 and the number of confirmed cases may possibly be in millions.

Here is the thing: All Governments lie — whether it is the Chinese or the Americans and even our own. Lies are propagated to cover up incompetence than to hide malafide intentions. Well, during the Cold War, the Americans and the Soviets lied with malafide intentions. But that’s another story for another day. Politicians and bureaucrats lie more often than not to cover up their incompetence and ineptitude.

The problem with lies, as almost everyone knows, is that the web just gets bigger and bigger. But when matters of public health and safety are involved, at least a degree of truth will be of help even if being economical with the truth is essential to maintain public order. It was, therefore, almost amusing to see how the Chinese Government suddenly sent its Ambassadors on a public relations offensive even as access to information was restricted not only for foreign correspondents but also for its own journalists.

Of course, coming back to the first point, the Chinese Government must be applauded for its initial response to the outbreak, once they realised the seriousness of it all, even if few Governments across the world have the necessary information about it, officially at least. But even with a new public relations outreach, it should be apparent to the Chinese Government that almost nobody, with the exception of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, trusts China. One suspects that in private, even he is skeptical of the Chinese stance.

What does this say about Chinese President Xi Jinping and China, a country that aspires to stand next to the US as a superpower? Forget other Governments, citizens in other countries have lost faith in China, a trend that seems to be accelerating over the past few years. The Communist Party of China (CPC) ought to introspect why this is the case and how the COVID-19 outbreak has made matters worse on the trust front.

There are lessons for other Governments as well, including India, because “trust” is important. Whether one likes the Press or not, engagement with both the local and global media is vital. We have moved ahead from an age of information to that of affirmation. It is important that this changes soon. Otherwise, we run the risk of a complete and total breakdown in “trust” with governance across the world, this contagion having being started by a real-life one.

1,02-3-20,Physics? Who cares?,"What happens when you make a two-tonne Sports Utility Vehicle and give it a motor that produces 625 horsepower? We travel to the southwestern United States and find out

The United States of America, the land of the free and the home of the brave. Or so ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ goes, but one thing that country does have is wide, open roads and thousands upon thousands of acres of pristine wilderness. It is that sort of country where the car has become a potent symbol of individual freedom and mobility. It is also a symbol of speed and power, this is after all, the country of the Great Salt Lake, a flat pan of mesozoic layers upon which countless speed records have been set. It is, therefore, odd that the US has some of the strangest speed limits in the world, given its culture and roads. It is even stranger that the United States is the leading market for German carmaker BMW’s M series, buying fully 30 per cent of the 2,00,000 full-fat, full-power M cars produced in 2019, because American Freeways and even local roads have the most bizarre speed limits.

And when it comes to BMW’s M division, the cars that mad scientists drop their crazy glitter on, can go very, very fast indeed. Take the BMW X5M Competition and X6M Competition that I was flown halfway around the world to drive. Both these Sports Utility Vehicles that weigh the wrong side of two and half tonnes and can get from 0-100 kilometres per hour in 3.8 seconds. I have been on even faster cars than these, but in these cars I am sitting four feet up above the road surface, lording over mere mortals in sedans. In all the other fast cars that I have driven, my rear-end is separated from the road surface by about four inches. These are big, heavy vehicles and luxurious as well. But they have a 4.4 litre turbocharged V8 engine up front that produces 625 horsepower, and even if you get the slightly less insane X5M and X6M, you still get 600 horsepower and a 0-100 time 3.9 seconds.

Sure, you might say, put a big enough motor and anything can go fast, even a bungalow. Believe me when I tell you that I really tried to behave because after all, it was not the speed that got to me. It was the sensational handling of the cars. You would expect that given the huge 315-track Michelin Pilots these cars were wearing, they would take a corner at speed. And the roads through the mountains of Maricopa County, Arizona, were beautiful with the right amount of twists, dips and straights. But in your average SUV, usually when you take a turn at speed, you are holding onto the steering for dear life as inertia throws you out of your seat. And inertia and momentum are usually your enemies because as one knows from secondary school physics, it takes a lot of force to change the momentum. Ergo, a light, sporty car takes corners well because the lighter the car and the lower the centre of gravity, the less force it takes to change direction. Those of you who have driven early-build Gypsys would know how much they hated taking turns at speed. If you remember what angular momentum was, you’d understand why one saw so many Gypsys lying sideways.

This is where these cars excel — cornering. I swear on my grandmother’s memory that there was no perceptible body roll. None. I really did not even feel my sides pushed into the seats, you could put a spirit level on the dashboard and it wouldn’t really move. You take the car faster and faster through the corner and still it didn’t protest, there was nary a sound from the tires. Honestly, I really don’t know how this is physically possible on a car of this heft. This was like a Sumo wrestler matching the sprinter Michael Johnson on the inside lane of a 400 m track. The sheer speed of the car might stretch physics, the handling of these cars defied physics. This should not be possible. Yet, BMW’s mad scientists have taken the physics textbook and torn it apart yet again. Thankfully, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department had very kindly closed off a section of road for us road testers to do our thing. Trust me when I tell you that I tried damn hard, even at the risk of running into a giant Saguaro cactus to push these cars. These cars could easily beat a sports coupe on a track, not just on a straight but through the corners and I really hope that I get to do that sometime.

Personally, between the two I would choose the X5M over the X6M simply because of the fact that the X5 is a slightly roomier car than the X6, rest everything else is the same. They’re both fast and they both defy physics. Come to think of it, maybe one should ask the M division guys to develop a time machine, I mean since they lord over physics anyway, maybe they can break it altogether.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/physics--who-cares--2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/physics--who-cares-.html
2,02-3-20,Scarred childhood,"Delhi may be picking up the pieces after a manic bout of violence but its children have been damaged forever

No matter how determinedly we pick up the pieces, we have failed our children by exposing them to Delhi’s worst communal riots in decades and numbing their potential forever. For all the happiness curriculum that has been the showpiece of the city’s schools as inculcating a holistic and value consciousness among them, it has taken mad fury and hate politics to demolish it in one go. We have ended up forcing a moral crisis upon them, one that we have implanted in their minds by attacking them in their homes, their schools and their playgrounds, stripping them of every comfort zone and emotion, leaving them unchaperoned and fearful in a world of adult mess. What do the visuals of the child, distraught and slumping over a father’s body, dead because he was hit by a wayward bullet, tell us? How do we tell students, who have grown up knowing that every school exam would take them closer to a better life, that they cannot attend school in the first place? Spare a thought for the boy who got hit by a stone while returning home after completing an exam, who doesn’t know when the next test schedule would be announced and finds it difficult to study in a home that is in sixes and sevens overnight. The violence outside scares him further into a ghetto of fear. Tuition and coaching classes aren’t safe, too, considering that a boy was shot at while returning from one at Jafrabad on February 25. He could have been saved but he did not get any medical aid or even an ambulance. Imagine the plight of board examinees, who are awaiting alternative dates and venues to clear the first crucial hurdle of student life, qualifying for a higher education. The Delhi High Court has asked the Government to sanitise convenient exam centres that aren’t too far away for students and announce new dates so that their anxieties are taken care of. Yet if the mangled fans and the trail of destruction at schools are any indication, then knowledge is a futile asset in a society which has found new qualifiers for a settled, peaceful life — religion, identity and conformity with a greater cause. Arun Modern Public School principal Jyoti Rani said that she had students of all communities. Now the riots have made them conscious of where they come from. Answer sheets of exams already conducted have been destroyed as have books and computers. Students had been locked up in another school, an inhuman confinement, like lambs to the slaughter. And when men in uniform, that could have been borrowed, stolen or even original, codify a simple citizenship test, on whether you can publicly sing the anthem or chant Vande Mataram or not, then you are telling the young to forget history lessons and learn the new safety bar codes. The divisive politics of the times have propagated a relearning of life as it should be and is turning our children into hunter-survivors than evolved humans. With families fleeing for good, some children will never return and will have to deal with displacement. The rioters have successfully created a deep disturbia to be inhabited by new citizens, who have already been infected and hardened at birth as children of conflict. That explains why so many teenagers were among the arsonists, carrying cricket bats and rods. When prejudice becomes political capital and children are denied their innocence, it is shuddering to think what we are bequeathing as civil society.

It takes no rocket science to understand how children and adolescents exposed to communal violence are deformed in the mind. Studies worldwide have found this group susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insecurity, faithlessness, fear, withdrawal and denial, all manifested through physical symptoms like repeated bouts of headaches and stomach aches. With all that they knew gone, the dulling emptiness is often frighteningly filled by memories of the past that will seek closure and result in either revenge or retaliation. The worst injustice we do to children, therefore, is by not punishing the perpetrators of violence. While the Government has detained and demonised protesters and dissenters, there has been no outrage over or action taken against its sympathisers and loyalists, who unleash their worst selves knowing they have the insurance cover as ideological warriors. The dossiers of the marauders at Jamia Millia and Jawaharlal Nehru University are common knowledge. Even their faces are known. But they roam free. In the darkest hour of this city, happiness has lost. And childhood has died.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/scarred-childhood-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/scarred-childhood.html
3,02-3-20,The earth is bleeding,"The appearance of ‘blood snow’ in Antarctica may not be sinister. But it is another sign that the ice is melting

The sudden discovery of red-tinged ice around Ukraine’s Vernadsky Research Base might have puzzled any casual observer but it is nothing more than an appearance of a select species of algae that thrive in near-freezing zones. So those, who see the emergence of this ice as a sign from God or something like that, can rest easy. However, this can actually be seen as a sign from earth. While the particular algae thrives in near-freezing conditions, there is a certain amount of warmth that it needs to survive. This is why climate scientists are getting concerned. Is the appearance of the red-ice yet another sign from the earth that climatic conditions are getting ever warmer and that we might be slipping past a point of no return? Facts are clear, the pack ice in the Antarctic is melting, with swathes of glaciers larger than the State of Goa breaking off. There are fears about the long-term survivability of the Emperor penguin, the isolated continent’s most iconic creature. Up at the North Pole, the disappearance of the polar bear has already become a potent symbol of the rapidly declining sea ice in the Arctic. The last few years have seen record-breaking temperatures. Previous three Januaries have consecutively broken records for the warmest month ever. The wildfires in Australia devastated that part of the planet. Coral reefs are dying, salinity in groundwater near coastal areas is rising as sea levels slowly but surely keep on climbing. The climate apocalypse may not be upon us as yet but we are heading there in a runaway train. And unlike the movie, there are no heroes who can stop it because our politicians are jetting around the world to bicker about who sacrifices how much and who pays how much.

The human race has always risen up to such challenges in the past. We managed to send a man to another celestial object. We can now fly half-way around the world in a single hop. And we have successfully eliminated killer diseases such as smallpox. But currently, we have a critical problem and we must step up to the plate and solve it. Time is running out. Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg is right: We cannot mess up the planet for future generations.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-earth-is-bleeding-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-earth-is-bleeding.html
4,02-3-20,Not a booster shot,"There is quite a slack in the pace of increase in the budgetary allocations for healthcare and will result in India finding it difficult to achieve some of its objectives

Public spending on healthcare in the country is among the lowest in the world at just a little over one per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hence, the healthcare system is beset with various problems that include shortage of workforce, infrastructure and dismal quality and availability of services.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a set of measures to stimulate and boost the healthcare sector as an industry in the Union Budget, 2020-21 and allocated Rs 69,000 crore for it, which also includes Rs 6,400 crore for the Ayushman Bharat-Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY). In the last Budget, the appropriation was Rs 62,659 crore. Though there has been an increase in the allotment, the fact remains that it is quite insignificant when adjusted to inflation. Moreover, Rs 69,000 crore amounts to barely one per cent of the GDP — a far cry from the National Health Policy’s much-talked about target of increasing the health budget to 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2025.

There is quite a slack in the pace of increase in the budgetary allocations for healthcare and will result in India finding it difficult to achieve some of its objectives, like reducing infant mortality. India ranks 12 out of the 52 lower-middle income countries with a high infant mortality rate. Even though there has been a gradual increase in allocation, the dismal percentage of the GDP spent on healthcare is a concern, and will remain so for a long time, unless the Government makes some drastic changes in the future.

However, Mission Indradhanush, covering 12 new diseases including five new vaccines, is definitely a boon as it will provide the people of the country the much-needed relief and care.

Setting up of hospitals on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, along with medical colleges to address the shortage of doctors and opening up DNB and FNB certificate courses is a step in the right direction. Large hospitals running Residency programmes will also provide a training platform for medical professionals.

However, private hospitals which venture into PPP projects should be assured of all help by the Government and reimbursement for patients treated in them must be done within a month of the treatment/completion. This is because long delays in reimbursement will affect the volume of work done by hospitals and will not encourage private hospitals to come forward and join this genuine attempt to help the needy.

With 2020 being celebrated as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Finance Minister’s announcement of bridge courses for nurses and other healthcare professionals to match international standards, by allotting Rs 3,000 crore for skill development, is a good incentive.

Skill development of Physician Assistants and paramedical personnel through courses should also be done and these courses must be recognised by regulatory bodies and other associations such as the Indian Medical Association, the Medical Council of India and so on. This is prevalent the world over but is still not implemented in the country and recognition of these courses will enhance the services provided by the healthcare sector immensely. Last year, the AB-PMJAY was able to cover over 6.9 million treatments. However, the world’s largest Government-funded health insurance scheme’s budgetary allocation for this year is the same as last year, i.e. Rs 6,400 crore. So are the allocations for the scheme this year sufficient to make AB-PMJAY a success? There is a possibility that the payments would be delayed, leading to insurance companies not being a part of it actively. Currently, over 20,000 hospitals are empanelled in this scheme. Many hospitals, especially in smaller towns, are yet to be covered. The plan to set up 150,000 health and wellness centres by 2022 and fund them through the budgetary allocation for AB-PMJAY seems to be insufficient in regards to achieving this initiative. In order to address the shortage of hospital beds and enhance healthcare accessibility through PPP, innovative business models will be crucial. Also, cognizance about preventive healthcare and the habit of routine screening and monitoring could really reduce the liability from the entire ecosystem.

Even in the present economic scenario, India imports over 70 per cent of its medical devices, with a fourth of them coming from the USA. While the intention to impose a five per cent health cess was to strategically redistribute such earnings to set up tier-II and tier-III healthcare facilities, it does not resolve to boost the local medical devices industry. A legitimate certification authority for such devices would aid in use and adoption of equipment and devices made in India. Sadly, start-ups in medical devices, indigenous research and innovative products such as bioprosthetic valves and ventricular assist devices are not being encouraged and the attitude of the regulatory bodies in this country has to be reviewed. We have just one medical science park in the country with Special Economic Zone approval. However, during the last eight years no progress has been made to start research units like in the Biopolis in Singapore. But, this is not due to the lack of talent in the country. Many attempts are being hindered by the attitude of financial institutions such as public sector banks and so on. Hence, loans for these intuitions should be at par with NABARD rates or the Government should give grants rather than taking the entrepreneurs to Debts Recovery Tribunals, the National Company Law Tribunal and so on. Also, medical research should be identified separately rather than clubbing it with commercial ventures.

While healthcare services are on the negative list of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for provision of services, the basic input costs of creating such services have had an upward tax implication with GST and hence increased the overall consumer cost of such services, with the inability of healthcare services to offset such costs through input credit. Clarification in this regard would have ideally balanced the cost outcome and kept rising costs in check. With a huge focus on the Internet-of-Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and analytics, it is believed that the Budget will provide a boost to the country’s digital economy. However a digital incentivisation plan is completely missing. While 2019 saw various frameworks initiated such as the National Digital Health Blueprint, guidance and adoption remains unaddressed and the fact remains that budgetary guidance for furtherance and utilisation can go a long way.

This being said, the fact remains that the Government has a holistic vision of healthcare that translates into wellness of citizens. The Finance Minister proposed a viability gap funding window for setting up hospitals which is a good move.

The Budget also declared that the generic medicine retail outlets Jan Aushadhi stores would be available through expansion to every district. Apart from medicines, these stores in particular would also stock up on more surgical necessities. Currently the Jan Aushadhi stores sell 154 surgical instruments, which will now be expanded to about 300. This will result in a positive outcome for both SME pharma manufacturers and small domestic medical devices makers. While a lot of schemes and policies have been initiated, there are no clear roadmaps to see these through till the end. Proper channels and information centres should be set up, where potential beneficiaries can seek details and make informed decisions. A system or a special task force should be set-up to monitor each scheme. A robust feedback mechanism from the masses about the same would also help in their realisation and improvement.

There is a dire need for the Government to stress on R&D in basic medical sciences and medical research, which will pave the way for growth and progress of indigenous technology. In addition, special provisions should be made under the ‘Make in India’ initiative for manufacturing, which will in turn contribute to India becoming a frontrunner in medical technology and innovation across the globe.

10,02-3-20,Muktimandap groups’ merger faces roadblock,"An attempt to unify the two parallel groups of the Muktimandap of the Jagannath Temple has suffered a setback after election of its president is now scheduled in April this year.

Though both the groups of priests namely Muktimandap and Muktimandap Pandit Sabha (MPS) unanimously resolved to merge into a single body, the president election of the Sabha has caused the trouble.

It had been decided in the meetings of both the bodies that the MPS founded in 1905 would merge into the Muktimandap to form a single unit. An attempt was underway how to unite the two parallel groups for the sake of pilgrims. With a common objective both bodies are operating independently and enjoying rights in the temple.

This besides, the Chayan Committee (empanelment board), which was to be constituted for selection of new members to the Muktimdap has yet not taken a shape even after three years of order. A decision in the temple administration was that as part of reform, a Chayan Committee would be formed through which the selection of new entrants would take place. Like the servitors, the members of the Muktimandap would be given identity cards on behalf of the temple administration. But that has not yet yielded any result with most members pointing a finger at the temple officials for nexus with dissident group of the Muktimandap.

Reportedly, the selection process would be conducted by Administrator (Niti) assisted by Officer In-Charge (OIC). However, a file signed by former Chief Administrator Pradapta Kumar Mohapatra has been pending at the OIC chamber without any movement.

The aspirants to enter Muktimadap complained that the dissidents scaring to be rejected by the Chayan Committee are putting trouble in selection process.

Notably, a tussle in the Muktimandap is on over the identity of some sitting members. Sources said that over 50 members possessing a seat here have no whereabouts of their ancestries who are living in the pilgrim city.

As per guidelines of the Muktimandap, a sitting member must have an ancestral house in the villages of Puri and enrol in the traditions of village lords. And they are the ones who are opposing the Chayan Committee and selection of new entrants, sources to the Muktimandap said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/muktimandap-groups----merger-faces-roadblock.html

12,02-3-20,Time to study the unspoken rules,"It is one of the gaps of sociological studies that social mores have rarely been subjected to scholastic scrutiny

Life is a profound yet subtle experience. The origins of norms, values and regulations are visible only at a certain level and in the context of certain experiences. For instance, consider the almost global feeling amongst Homo sapiens that taking human life is wrong, no matter what the colour of their skin, religion or caste. It doesn’t really matter if that person is from the jungles or the cities, or if he is literate or illiterate.

The list of such rules, social mores, customs and behaviours is endless. Consider the universal feeling of love, concern and care that parents have for their offspring. Like other such generic examples these sentiments need no codification. They are so universal that they have become an integral and spontaneous part of life. These may well be referred to as unspoken laws. However, the story doesn’t end there.

What has been said above is generic and global. Moving beyond it can be specific and regional, probably local.

Consider perhaps, the oldest surviving institution of mankind: Marriage. A man and woman commit themselves to each other and to a lifelong partnership. Sometimes this partnership is accompanied by rituals, on other occasions it has been known to be a private contract. When backed by law there is a whole template of prerequisites and consequences. In many cases it leads to procreation, however, all procreation, in biological terms, does not need the institution of marriage.

The purpose of these lines is not to explore the depth and the reach of this institution but to indicate that basically many patterns of marriage can and are covered by the umbrella of “unspoken rules.” References can be found to gandharva marriage (undisclosed but accepted physical relationship between two consenting adults).What can be legislated has its limitations.

To the universe of unstated rules one could add those that have to do with kindness, thoughtfulness, honesty, need for communication, sharing and more. As indicated above, there could be variations in these norms from region to region or indeed from one social unit to another. The bonding of these unstated rules creates a community. And the community can take the form of caste, creed and more.

There are people who believe that there is a certain type of topic selection which should and can be referred to as “girl talk.” Similarly, there can be and there is such a thing as “men’s talk.” Put simply, whether it is “girl talk” or “men’s talk”, exceptions apart, intruders across genders are not commonly invited or welcomed. Thus it is plausible to argue that unspoken rules govern widely and in course of time become inputs to defining culture.

In a man-woman relationship, whatever be its character and locale — office, society, extended family or causal relationship, the ground rules are mostly known. Illustratively, certain references are banned even with or without intimacy. There is always a discreet sense of privacy which is maintained, not only in dress but also in the choice of words or for that matter the subject of discussion.

Consider the question of hijab for example. Many followers of Islam, men and women alike, believe it is an essential part of a woman’s attire. The uniting thread is a belief in what they think their faith demands. Move from Islam to Christianity. The world view changes. Hijab is not intrinsic to Christianity and most Christian communities do not consider it necessary for women to wear a veil (except for nuns and while praying).

However, in some other religions, while wearing a veil all the time may not be necessary for women, covering the head is considered very desirable in the presence of elders and in situations requiring reverence, especially during worship. This is one more example of the unstated rules of life.

Why must one be “seeing off” the other person when that person is leaving? Surely, this is a part of a social ritual. It may be common but it is not universal. Similarly, why receive a guest at the door? Be that as it may, there are certain unspoken rules which have existed across centuries and certain unwritten rules which survived just a few generations, if even that. Consider the fact, that in certain cold, hilly communities in the world, rubbing of the nose was the accepted greeting and now after the emergence of the Coronavirus even shaking of the hands is being discouraged globally.

Perhaps it is one of the gaps of sociological studies that these unstated rules have rarely, if ever, been subjected to scholastic scrutiny. It is time the gauntlet was picked.

13,02-3-20,Understand sexual harassment to nip it,"Even though, environment is significantly responsible, what is of pressing concern is the reason why some people and not others, go on to exploit that permissive atmosphere and commit sexual crimes

The horrific mass molestation of students at Gargi College — where over 30 men forcibly entered the women’s college — is symptomatic of an atmosphere which is permissive of sexual intimidation. No doubt, sexual harassment is a universal phenomenon, though it may differ in its manifestation, depending upon how a society takes it. Sexual harassment of women in educational institutions is one of the most common and largely underreported forms of gender-based violence, often inflicted by male colleagues, teachers or perpetrators from outside. In a significant number of cases, women adopt a culture of silence as they have learnt to “ignore” certain forms of predatory behaviour of men, like passing lewd comments, wolf-whistling, staring and so on.

Sexual harassment infringes upon the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution, which includes the right to a safe working environment.

Before the Vishaka Guidelines came into existence in 1997, sexual harassment at the workplace was dealt with under Indian Penal Code Section 354, (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and Section 509, punishing the guilty for using a “word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.” However, the interpretation of the provisions on “outraging a woman’s modesty” was left to the police officer.

On the basis of the Vishaka Guidelines, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for them. Consistent with the Vishaka judgment, the Act provides a civil remedy to women and is in addition to other laws that are currently in force to pursue a criminal case. Consequently, any woman who wishes to report sexual harassment at the workplace has the right to take recourse to both civil and criminal proceedings.

While there is no denying the importance of legal protection against sexual harassment, its public health aspects and their therapeutic interventions are no less important. They need to be examined and addressed to restore the physical and mental health of the victim and go into the reasons for the deviant behaviour of the perpetrators. Even though, environment is significantly responsible, what is of pressing concern is the reason why some people and not others, go on to exploit that permissive atmosphere and commit sexual crimes.

By nature, some people are more hostile, authoritarian and sexist, which might make them more prone to becoming an aggressor. The complexity of the interaction between an aggrieved woman and the perpetrator needs to be understood and the personality profile of the aggressor requires to be examined in depth to evolve effective measures to prevent the occurrence and reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment at the workplace.

Psychological studies show that sexual predators lack a social conscience; they are callous about their social commitments and have a tendency to exaggerate the situation. They justify their misdeeds and legitimise their aggression, particularly against women when it is related to the endorsement of sexually- coercive behaviour.

Studies also show that the psychopathic traits of exploitation of others and lack of empathy, are both commonly associated with rapists, stalkers and molesters. When sexual harassment escalates, it poses a potential risk of a more serious sexual crime like rape. This link highlights the fact that sexual harassers are potential rapists and to prevent rapes, those indulging in harassment need to be treated for their deviant behaviour.

Sexual harassment not only results in strained interpersonal relations and an hostile working environment, it adversely affects the productivity of the organisation, leading to financial losses. But more than anything else, it affects the mindset of the victims, causing a wide range of mental health issues. And as physical health and emotional well-being are inter-related, victims often suffer loss of appetite, headaches, weight fluctuations and sleep disturbance. The commonly-reported negative effects included fear, concerns for safety, and post traumatic stress disorder.

No other form of discrimination has such a wide impact on the physical and mental health of the victims. Sexual harassment has emerged as a major public health problem with long-term physical and mental health consequences for the victims. However, the impact is not restricted to their health and seeps into the victim’s social and professional life. This aspect often gets ignored and victims mostly remain preoccupied with legal remedies. Clinicians have described case histories, symptom profiles, stress factors and attempts at intervention. Theoreticians working in the fields of women’s development, cognitive functioning and gender-based trauma have generated a parallel body of relevant information, applying their theories to the field of harassment.

Sexual harassment presents significant challenges to a victim’s internal and external stability. Primarily recognised as a legal or organisational management issue, it belongs to a clinical continuum with other gender-based abuses. If untreated, it can cause psychiatric illness and long-term negative changes in the victim’s internal perception of self, others, and the world and severely hinder her potential. Appropriate clinical interventions for both, the victims and the perpetrators, can provide an opportunity to assess the seriousness of the crisis and make the workplace free from sexual harassment.

14,02-3-20,Odisha first State to start nutrition budgeting,"At a time when Odisha is already viewed as a nutrition champion, the State has gone a step further to become the only one in the country to introduce a nutrition budget towards a new and empowered Odisha.

In a clear admission of the importance, the nutrition budget document states, “The Government of Odisha is the first State in India to initiate the concept of Nutrition Budgeting in the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21.”

The budget has made a distinction between Nutrition Specific (direct nutrition-centric) and Nutrition Sensitive (indirect nutrition centric) schemes and intervention, which follows the global nutrition framework.

While there is an increase of more than Rs 1,000 crore in Nutrition Specific scheme allocation for 2020-21, Nutrition Sensitive schemes have seen a jump of more than Rs 10,000 crore.

Associate Director at IPE Global,Neha Saigal said Odisha has established itself as a clear leader in matters of nutrition. “We would like to congratulate the Government of Odisha on this amazing initiative. The targeted focus on the most vulnerable communities like scheduled tribes (STs) is also an exemplary step. This will help the State in achieving key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as reduction of hunger and improvement in nutrition outcomes,” she said.

The IPE Global is a development sector organisation which helps design innovative and sustainable solutions for various stakeholders, including Governments.

The budget also introduced several new schemes for nutrition including the scheme on nutrition governance and a scheme to supply subsidised rice.

Executive Director, Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA)Subrat Das said that it is encouraging to see a State focusing on nutrition governance and trying to provide every community member access to nutrition services.

“We hope that an allocation of Rs 12 crore, even though a small amount, will not only fix responsibility but also ensure accountability from all levels of nutrition workers. It will now be interesting to know how the government uses this money to fix the governance issues that exist in this space,” he said.

In addition to these, Odisha Government ’s nutrition budget has increased the allocation for construction of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) by 25 times. AWCs are the first point of contact for community members who avail nutrition related Government services and schemes. It has gone up from Rs 4.53 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 113.29 crore in 2020-21.

Saigal said that the next exercise the Government needs to take up immediately is to map and identify the areas that require these AWCs urgently.

Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, the world’s largest scheme to improve the nutritional status of women and children in the country, has also seen a huge increase. Allocation for Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP) under the ICDS saw an increase of 25 per cent for the year 2020-21.

Thus, the State set an example for the whole country by making nutrition related matters an important part of the budget.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odisha-first-state-to-start-nutrition-budgeting.html
15,02-3-20,Japan to set up industrial townships across State,"With Japan eyeing to invest in Odisha, chances are bright for setting up of industrial townships across the State.

The Shinzo Abe Government of Japan has been identifying sites for setting up of industrial townships across the country in order to promote India’s infrastructure and domestic manufacturing as it has decided to double its investment.

As part of their initiative, Ambassador of Japan Satoshi Suzuki called on Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on February 27 led by Union Minister Steel Dharmendra Pradhan.

In fact, Japan has already identified 11 sites in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. As Japan is interested for steel hub in Odisha, it needs to re-identify more sites for industrial townships, which will serve as hubs of investment into the State.

Japan authorities are providing knowhow and industrial township advance soft skills and in other countries these projects have been able to attract huge investments.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very much interested for Japanese support for industrial township and Gujarat has offered Mandal Industrial Zone for development of a major industrial township.

Similarly, with Ministry of Steel coming up with first steel hub at Kalinga Nagar, it will offer a major attraction for Japanese authorities to go for an industrial township, officials feel.

In fact in the meeting with Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy, Tata BSL chief Manikant Naik had urged the State Government to develop industrial townships with infrastructure.

Idco CMD Sanjay Kumar Singh is also favorable for such an initiative as other corporate sector honchos are urging for the same.

Sources said the Idco chief was working out modalities for industrial townships so that those zones would serve as hubs of investment.

Some in the corporate sector also are asking for development of downstream parks for inviting investments, said Principal Secretary Sharma.

Vedanta Limited CEO Rahul Sharma pointed out that there was a requirement to develop downstream park at Jharsuguda. Major investors have harped on rail, road and air connectivity for which Chief Secretary Tripathy has assured them that the State Government would take necessary steps for these types of physical infrastructure required for industries.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/japan-to-set-up-industrial-townships-across-state.html

26,02-3-20,Sewage continues to affect UT’s forest,"Despite repeated reminders from the Chandigarh Administration, the neighbouring State Governments of Punjab and Haryana have failed to stop sewage flowing from their territories into forest areas of the city.

The critical issue pertains to sewage flowing from Naya Gaon and Kansal villages of Punjab and Saketri and Madadev Pur villages of Haryana into the forest areas of Chandigarh. The sewage flowing into Sukhna Lake forest reserve has been causing damage to the flora and fauna in the area and had earlier led to skin problems in a herd of Sambars inhabiting the area.

The Administration had taken up the matter with the Punjab and Haryana Governments during the meeting of Apex Committee for coordination of tricity held under Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore last month.

Apart from this, a letter was recently sent to the State Governments to draw their attention to the issue. The Administration, however, is yet to get any response from the State Governments.

Notably, the union territory of Chandigarh is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana.

In the letter written to the Additional Chief Secretary, Forests and Environment, Principal Secretary, Urban Local Bodies, Punjab, the Chief Conservator of Forests, Chandigarh stated, “There is no sewage treatment plant (STP) for the sewage of Naya Gaon and Kansal villages and all the sewage from Kansal area is entering into the forest area of Chandigarh in between Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake thereby damaging the ecology of forest area of the city. The Administration has intimated several times to the state of Punjab to construct and operationalize STPs for all such sewages so that there is no discharge of untreated sewage water in the forest area of Chandigarh.

In a separate letter to the Haryana Government, the UT Chief Conservator of Forests said, “The untreated water of Saketri and Madadev Pur villages which is adjoining Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary (SWLS) is coming into the Nepal Choe of Chandigarh as there is no sewage treatment plan (STP) for the sewage in these villages. It is requested that the discharge of untreated water may be stopped immediately in the Choe, so that the untreated sewage water may not mix in Sukhna Lake in the city.”

Debendra Dalia, UT Chief Conservator of Forests and Special Secretary (Forests) while talking to The Pioneer said, “We have taken up the matter with the Punjab and Haryana Governments on several occasions, but in vain.”

In the letters written to them, the State Governments have been requested to resolve the problem on priority basis. But no action as yet has been taken by the concerned authorities. Infact, they are yet to respond to the letter sent by Administration, he said.

During the meeting of Apex Committee for coordination of tricity held last month, the issue of sewage flowing to the forest area of Chandigarh was raised by the Administration. It was decided that a separate meeting would be convened with Punjab and Haryana on the issues related to Sukhna Lake, sewage problem and Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary, he added.

The Sukhna Lake reserve forest spread over an area of around 105.57 hectares starting from Punjab and Haryana High Court ends toward Kishangarh-Saketri road near Regulator End of Sukhna Lake.

A report compiled by UT Forest and Wildlife Department in 2016 had stated that the sewage flowing from Kansal village is causing damage to flora and fauna of Sukhna Lake reserve forest and polluting the Sukhna Lake as well. It had also pointed out that a herd of Sambars residing near Rock Garden are suffering from skin problems caused due to sewerage water.

To deal with the sewage water of Kansal and Naya Goan, the Administration had recently chalked out a proposal to construct a new sewage treatment plant at Kishangarh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sewage-continues-to-affect-ut---s-forest.html

29,02-3-20,CM announces Rs 1-cr for Bhuja Khia Pir,"One of the major religious places, a symbol of unity among Hindus and Muslims, the shrine of Baba Bhuja Khia Pir located at Sunhat village on Chandipur road would get a facelift after Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced Rs 1 crore for its improvement. The decision of the State Government has been hailed by one and all of the district.

The famous and prominent shrine of the district is one among the 23 religious places included in the list of renovation and improvement of the State Government.

There had been demands by the shrine committee for improvement of the religious place where hundreds of devotees of different faiths congregate on every Thursday and lakhs including those outside the State, visit during annual Urs which is observed each year during last week of March between Wednesday and Friday for three days.

The shrine was lacking a guest house for the outside visitors. Besides, it lacks a wider space for worship.

It is said that Hajrat Sawale Mohammad had come to India with six brothers from Arab countries. Among seven brothers, while four had settled in Baleswar, three others settled elsewhere in India. He sat underneath a neem tree and resolved problems of the people. Since he was only consuming bhuja, puffed rice, he is known as Bhuja Khia Pir Baba.

While people across all religions visit the shrine seeking fulfillment of their desires and mitigation of distress, in fact, Hindus outnumber the Muslims in the shrine during festive occasions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-announces-rs-1-cr-for-bhuja-khia-pir.html

36,02-3-20,Avatar — Descent of the Divine,"Avatar is stated to be the God in physical form. Instead of visualising Him in His immeasurable splendour, one can perceive the divine truth through the instrumentality of manhood. Though blissful in Himself, as an incarnation the God experiences anxieties, sorrows and joys of life, like any other living being

The metaphysical concept of avatar, or the incarnation of God, is an integral part of the Hindu theology. It is believed that when the life on earth is going through extremely challenging circumstances, God himself appears on earth in human or some other form. He manifests Himself to ensure preservation of the world and to protect it from evil.

Avatar is stated to be the God in physical form. Instead of visualising Him in His immeasurable splendour, one can perceive the divine truth through the instrumentality of manhood. Though blissful in Himself, as an incarnation the God experiences anxieties, sorrows and joys of life, like any other living being.

Out of the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva ; only Vishnu is known to have incarnated himself, from time to time. Krishna, the god of Gita, is stated to be his ninth incarnation.

The idea of incarnation has been elaborated in shlokas from 4.6 to 4.8 of Bhagavad Gita. It has been stated that though unborn, imperishable and the lord of all creations ; yet establishing Himself in His own nature, the Supreme Lord comes into being, through His own inner power (maya). Whenever there is decline in dharma (righteousness), and adharma (unrighteousness) starts rising ; He incarnates Himself. He comes into being from age to age for protecting the virtuous, annihilating the wicked ; and for the establishment of righteousness.

Though beyond the phenomenon of birth and death, the Divine has appeared on earth in the form of Krishna to fight against the forces of ignorance and viciousness. In the struggle between truth and falsehood, He stands with the truth. Manifestation of the Supreme Lord in the world is an assurance from the divine authority that dharma would always prevail. The truth shall conquer falsehood.

Krishna, as an avatar, is the upholder of dharma. He is the personification of wisdom and virtue. He works towards the smooth evolution of the world and for the establishment of a perfect moral order.

Whereas the embodiments of other beings are driven by nature, the Lord takes birth by His own free will. Out of His compassion for the mankind, He is born again and again. He descends to the level of man to enable him to ascend to the status of the Divine.

Being the God in human form, one can relate to the avatar as man to man. One can look upon Him for guidance and help in difficult times. He can be one’s friend, philosopher and guide.

As stated in shlokas 3.22 and 4.14, there is no need for the avatar to perform any duty anywhere in the universe. Yet He remains ever engaged in work. Actions do not defile Him, for He does not work for their results. Those who know this truth about Him, they are not bound by works.

The avatar is interested in the spiritual upliftment of all. His message is meant for whole of the mankind. His words carry more weight because He speaks with the authority of the Divine in Him. Through His teachings and personal example. He shows the right path to everyone. He presents Himsilf as a role model for a common man. He establishes certain ideals for the people to follow. He helps them in achieving their potential, in every sphere of life.

The avatar of Gita has not only highlighted the ultimate goal of human life i.e. union with the Absolute, but has also offered Himself to be the medium of grace through which one can attain such union. It has been assured that the one who worships Him constantly with unwavering and exclusive devotion of love, he transcends the modes of material nature and becomes eligible for being one with the Absolute (Shloka 14.26). In other words, when one loves Krishna, the incarnation of God, from the depths of his heart and is devoted to Him with whole of his being, he is fit for attaining the status of Brahman, which is nothing else but the Truth, the Consciousness and the Bliss (sat-chit-ananda).

The avatar has, thus, invited man to love Him and repose faith in Him. He would surely lead him to the knowledge of the Ultimate Reality.

As outwardly, the incarnation looks and lives like any other being, the people in general are not aware of His divine nature. They do not know His supreme state even though He may be living amidst them. Only the few endowed with pure intelligence can recognise Him to be the lord of all creations. It is stated in shloka 4.9 that he who knows in reality the divinity behind His birth and works, is not born again, after leaving his body. Instead, he goes to Him. It implies that by knowing the true nature of the avatar, one can rise to the status of the divine.

To conclude, the concept of avatar signifies that God is not a distant spectator but a constant companion. He stands up in support of mankind when grave danger arises to the cosmic or the moral order. In such situations, He appears on the earth and restores the equilibrium of life.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/avatar-----descent-of-the-divine.html

38,02-3-20,‘Govt aims at making India among top 3 world economies by 2025’,"Emphasising that the world has confidence in India and its economy, Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Sunday said the Central Government aims at making India among the top three global economies by 2025.

“India has become the world’s 5th largest economy and in the next five years, the target is to make India among the top three economies of the world,” the Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs said while addressing a press conference here after meeting stakeholders from various trades and industries during an interactive session organised by the Income Tax Department in collaboration with CII.

Thakur said various financial institutions, including IMF and RBI, have projected that India will once again attain fast growth.

“They (IMF, RBI) have said India is bound to grow in financial year 2020-21 at the rate of 6-6.5 per cent that clearly indicates that the world has confidence in India and Indian economy. And, the Central Government is taking all the steps in that direction,” he said.

“If you look at FDI inflows during the last five years into the country, they far exceed the FDI during the 10 years of UPA rule,” Thakur claimed, adding the country’s foreign exchange reserves (Forex) have swelled to all-time high of USD 476 billion.

The Union Minister said the fiscal deficit, which used to be at 5.2 per cent during the UPA regime, has come down to 3.3 per cent, though “this year it will be 3.8 percent and next year we will bring it down to 3.5 per cent.”

Thakur, who represents Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh as MP, said the Narendra Modi Government has shown what fiscal discipline is.

“Inflation, which used to be 12 per cent, came down to 4 per cent. All macro- economic indicators point that India is going ahead in the right direction,” he added.

He also touched upon the government’s recent initiative ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’, a scheme to settle disputes between the tax men and taxpayers.

Thakur said, “Addressing the legacy of disputes in the Indian Taxation System, the Centre has implemented one time ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme for resolution of pending tax disputes, which provides waiver from interest and penalty.

It is expected to resolve up to 90 per cent of the pending cases with the Department, he added. The objective of interaction here was to understand the views of the stakeholders and directly take their feedback on various policy and procedural issues faced by the traders and industry, Thakur said.

Terming the banking sector reforms as priority of the Government, the Union Minister said that since 2014, banks were in bad shape with poor asset quality, which has been reviewed and around Rs 63,000 crore recapitalisation out of the Rs 70,000 crore has already been undertaken, with the four Public Sector Banks to be soon out of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework.

Highlighting Government of India’s commitment to the MSMEs, Thakur said that the one-time settlement Policy has already been framed for the support of the MSMEs followed by extending the debt restructuring window for micro, small and medium enterprises by a year to March 31, 2021, in measures aimed at imparting thrust to the MSME sector.

Addressing the financing issues of the MSMEs, banks have been advised to conduct twice a month sessions with the industry to resolve their finance related issues, he added.

Lashing out at the Congress, he alleged that it was during the UPA rule that economy had been mismanaged.

“There were scams, real status of bank NPAs were hidden, inflation was high,” he said.

About the possible impact of outbreak of coronavirus in China on world economy, he said India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently held a meeting with industry to seek feedback in this regard.

“We are seeking feedback from the industry and Government will take appropriate steps,” he added.

Earlier at the interactive session, various representatives shared their views on the issues regarding GST return filing and other related matters. The Minister had also chaired an interactive session in Chandigarh on Saturday evening with eminent people from various walks of life like academia, industry, fine arts and media with endeavour to optimise the efforts for betterment of the people, the economy and society.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---govt-aims-at-making-india-among-top-3-world-economies-by-2025---.html
39,02-3-20,Punjab bans online FBOs with no or poor hygiene rating,"Food delivery business has turned sour for those with no or poor hygiene rating in Punjab. For, the Punjab Government has decided to impose one year ban on the online FBOs (food business operators) without or less than three marks hygiene rating.

Ban orders, which would come into effect from April 30, 2020, will also be applicable on those Online Food Supply Aggregators (OFSAs), like Zomato, Swiggy, Food Panda, Uber Eats, among others, which would supply food from the unrated FBOs.

Issuing prohibition orders, the State Food and Drug Administration Commissioner KS Pannu on Sunday said that exercising the powers conferred under section 30(2)(a) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, read with section 18(1)(a) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, in the interest of public health, the “distribution, supply or sale of articles of food through Online Food Supply Aggregators (OFSAs), related to those Food Business Operators (FBOs) who have not got their hygiene rating done, has been prohibited”.

The orders also prohibit OFSAs from sourcing the food from FBOs which are not hygienically rated and also where such rating is less than three marks out of five, said Pannu, adding that the prohibition orders would be effective in the entire State of Punjab for the period of one year with effect from April 30, 2020.

Pannu said as per the orders, in Punjab, information technology driven online food supply aggregators (OFSAs) such as M/s Uber Eats, M/s Swiggy, M/s Zomato, M/s Food Panda etc have been distributing, selling or supplying food to the consumers after sourcing the same from Food Business Operators (FBOs).

“This food delivery, through an IT-based platform, is a very recent phenomenon in which the direct and primary contact between the consumer of food articles and the manufacturers of food articles, especially the hot cooked food articles, has snapped,” said Pannu.

Pannu added the mechanism of distribution, sale or supply of food by OFSAs has obliterated the system of responsibility of maintaining the quality of food, which till now was being directly verified by the consumers from the food business operators at his counter.

With the introduction of mechanism of OFSAs, it has become important to ensure that these aggregators supply only the good quality and properly hygienic food articles to the consumers.

“Although, it is the moral responsibility of FBOs and OFSAs to ensure quality and hygiene of food delivered. However, the duty is also cast upon the State Authorities to ensure safe food to public under the Section 18(1)(a) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006,” said Pannu.

He said the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued instructions, vide which the system of hygiene rating of the food business operators has been introduced and the FSSAI has empanelled various agencies to conduct the hygiene rating of the FBOs.

Pannu informed that the office of Food and Drug Administration, Punjab, had advised all the OFSAs to ensure that the FBOs from where they are sourcing the food for distribution to consumers should be asked to get the hygiene rating of their business done and the OFSAs should source and supply the food from only those FBOs who secure at least three smilies out of a range of five smilies in the matter of hygiene rating.

The date of getting the hygiene rating of the FBOs done was extended till October 31, 2019.

However, it has been observed that even after creating awareness regarding the importance of hygiene rating, OFSAs have not taken the matter seriously, resulting in consumers continuously facing the potential of delivery of unsafe or unhygienic food.

Later, the department gave a notice on January 18, 2020, for seeking objections, if any, to the OFSAs as well as the FBOs and other stakeholders to show cause as to why not to prohibit the distribution, supply or sale of food through OFSAs related to those FBOs who have not got their hygiene rating done.

The objections were called to be filed on or before January 30, 2020. Since, no objection has been received from any stakeholder including OFSAs and FBOs, so the prohibition orders have been issued, said Pannu.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-bans-online-fbos-with-no-or-poor-hygiene-rating.html

Terming the Budget as “development-oriented”, Vij said it will take the Sstate forward on many fronts. Historic steps have been taken for the overall development of agricultural and education sectors. Interest-free loans will be provided to farmers adopting crop diversification. Apart from this, our Government has allocated around 15 per cent of the budget to the education sector. This Government is committed to the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, for effective implementation of various schemes regarding their socio-economic and educational development.

Excerpts from an interview:

You were present in the Assembly when CM was presenting his maiden budget for the State. What is your first reaction?

I congratulate Chief Minister for presenting best ever budget for the people of the State. It is growth-oriented and caters to service delivery. This budget has met all expectations of the common people. It is for the first time in the history of the State that the Budget was preceded by two-month-long detailed discussions with various stakeholders, including MPs, MLAs, industrialists, intellectuals, youth representatives and various sections of society. Out of 620 suggestions, 250 were incorporated in the Budget.

As children are our future so emphasis has been laid on education. 4,000 playway schools will be opened for children of 3 to 5 years. Our Government has allocated Rs 416.02 crore for employment department to generate employment for youth. Under Ayushman Bharat, 16,27,870 golden cards have been issued to benefit 5,84,487 families. The budget allocation has focus on sustainable farming. To check stubble-burning, parali procurement centres will be set up in every block of all affected districts. The Budget proposes to expand organic and natural farming to 1 lakh acres in the next three years. An allocation of Rs 8,770.18 crore has been made for Social Justice and Empowerment Department and Rs 519.34 crore for Welfare of Schedule Castes and Backward Classes Department. This Budget is bound to touch the lives of every person of the State. I am satisfied with the way efforts have been made to lend inclusiveness to every section of society through the budgeting exercise.

Unemployment is a big issue before the State. Opposition targets your Government on unemployment issue. What is special for youth in this Budget?

Special attention is laid on addressing youth’s concerns by adopting multi-pronged strategies. In this budget, Rs 416.02 crore has been allocated for employment department. To provide more employment opportunities to the competent youth in Government departments as well as private organisations, a special placement cell will also be set up for competent youth, which will create employment and skill opportunities for them. The Government will get a consolidated database of all the skilled youth, which can later be linked to the new employment portal. Provision has been made to increase employment opportunities as 2,000 modern sales centers will be set up at identified locations across the State on the lines of VITA and Hafed for the sale of food items along with packing and branding. Soil testing will be encouraged in all Government colleges and polytechnics to connect science with agriculture so that a society with a better scientific temperament is developed and more job opportunities are generated. To promote technical education and skill development, 24 new model industrial training institutes will be set up. To facilitate the students to secure jobs, their passport will be made free of cost. They will be able to secure learning driving license in the first year of college education.

Opposition terms this budget as directionless. How do you take on this criticism?

It is baseless criticism. Everyone, including political leaders should read the budget carefully. This is the best budget ever made in the State.

Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda says State’s debt has gone up to Rs 1.98 lakh crore. For the last five years, it has been increasing every year, which exposes the failures of this Government. Your comment.

Our Government has laid more emphasis on the creation of capital assets in the economy. We are spending extensively on capital investment to fuel the GDP of the State. This will bring development. If we stop taking loans, development will stop. So, deficit financing to sustain growth is not bad when these borrowings are within limits. Opposition leaders should also say what was State’s debt status when they were in power. Opposition has no right to say as we are today suffering due to their bad economic policies. I am repeatedly saying it is a progressive budget.

As an urban local bodies Minister, how much fund did you demand from the government? How much have you received?

In this budget, all the departments have been given sufficient fund. In comparison to last year, around 21 per cent additional budget has been allocated for urban local bodies. Our Government is determined to provide water at 135 liters per person per day. The target is to set up about 100 km of new sewer lines in the financial year 2020-21. We will soon develop a mobile application (App) to help people register complaints related to faulty streetlights, broken roads, a poor drainage system, garbage and houses without having proper drinking water facilities.

As a former sports Minister, how do you see fund allocation in sports sector in this Budget?

Lots of work was done in sports sector in the last five years. To motivate and encourage excellent sportspersons, provision has been made to increase their daily dose allowance from Rs 150 to 250, which will benefit 4,000 players. High Performance Training Center will be opened along with construction of sufficient number of hostels for the players.

Opposition raised the issue of increasing crime rate and drug peddling in the Vidhan Sabha. What is special in this budget for women and girls of their safety and security? What are steps being taken to check drug menace?

Government is committed to ensure safety and security of all citizens in the State. Continuous efforts are being made to check all type of crime. The universal helpline number ‘Dial 112’ will be made functional very soon for reaching to the police, fire brigade or ambulance services. With its implementation, police assistance to any needy person or women will be given in just 15-20 minutes. In this budget too, free travel up to 150 km for girl students from their residence to educational institutions and for this 36 buses are plying on 20 routes in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Ambala and Panchkula districts. Apart from this, 181 special bus services on 163 routes will be started for the convenience and safety of girls / women. ‘Operation prahar’ has been launched to check drug menace.

Complaints of Cyber crime are increasing day by day in the State. Have you received any grant to deal with it effectively?

Cyber crimes are posing new challenges to the police department. To curb the increasing incidents of cyber crime and ensure effective investigation, our Government has accorded sanction to the creation of 98 posts of police staff and IT professionals for the Cyber Crime Police Station and Cyber Forensic Lab functioning under the State Crime Branch at Panchkula.

How do you see economy of the State through this budget?

To make Haryana a preferred global investment destination, our Government has initiated major regulatory reforms through simplification of procedures, resulting in that Haryana today is ranked at the third position on All India level in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings and ranks first in North India. After studying the budget paper, you will find that State’s GDP would be Rs 8.31 lakh crore at current value which means that despite having 1.34 per cent geographical area and accounting for 2.09 per cent of the total population of the country, Haryana contributes 4 per cent to the national GDP. Similarly, during the year 2019-20 India’s economic growth rate will be 5 per cent on current value whereas Haryana’s economic growth rate will be 7.75 per cent. It is a matter of pride that today this small State of ours is proving to be a major engine for growth of India’s economy.

During Assembly session it was witnessed that many MLAs raised the issue of shortage of doctors, medical staff in their constituency. Does Government make any provision to address it in the Budget?

It is true that many MLAs raised the issue of shortage of doctors. I want to make it clear that we are taking steps to solve this issue. 447 doctors will be appointed in Government hospitals next month. We have also decided to appoint 342 more doctors on ad hoc basis, under which a MBBS graduate will be paid Rs 85,000 per month and specialists having three years experience will get Rs 1.5 lakh per month. To ensure availability of doctors, it has been decided that from upcoming academic session the MBBS students will have to sign an affidavit at the time of admission committing to two years of mandatory practice in Government hospitals.

As a Health Minister, what was your expectation from the budget? Whether your expectation met?

We are continuously working to provide better medical facilities. In this budget, sufficient fund has been allocated for health sector. Rs 6,533.75 crore will be spent for Health sector. MRI, CT scan, Cat Lab, chemotherapy and dialysis services will be provided in all district hospitals. Ultrasound facility will be provided at community health centre. Ventilator facilities for adults and children will be provided for all Government hospitals. A facility of 47 additional mobile medical units will be made. Free health check up for all the people will be provided which will be linked with family identity card. Online health card will be provided all the citizen of Haryana.

Haryana is an agriculture State. What are the facilities given to farmers in this budget? Your comment

For 2020-21, Rs 3,364 crore has been allocated for agriculture, Rs 1,157 crore for animal husbandry, Rs 492 crore for horticulture and Rs 122 crore for fisheries. The allocation has focus on sustainable farming and interest-free loan facility and provides facilities for women farmers. Through this budget, our Government has made it clear that we are committed to double farmers’ income.

Was it publicity stunt to present the Budget digitally? Your comment

Our Government has promised good governance to the people of the State. We are moving towards e-governance. As a part of it, every MLA this time was given a computer tablet that held the entire document for them to read.

It was for the first time anywhere in the country that tabs were given to legislators to read the Budget in digital form.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-budget-best-ever--focusing-on-health--education--anil-vij.html

44,02-3-20,Selja demands crop loss assessment exercise,"President Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja has demanded conduct of special assessment exercise of losses caused to crops due to rains and hailstorms, and extend compensation to farmers in the state within 20 days.

Selja said that more than 80 percent of wheat, mustard, vegetables and other crops have been damaged due to rain that took place on Saturday.

She said that the farmers have been suffering ever since the BJP Government has come into power at Centre and the State. During the last five years, sometimes GST is imposed on agricultural implements and sometimes their crops are not procured besides sometimes their crops are procured on very less price. Recently, a big paddy scam has also taken place in the state and in order to cover this scam, the protesting farmers were lathi-charged, she alleged.

The Congress leader said that farmers were already suffering due to anti-people policies of the Government and now, this natural disaster has added to their wounds. To provide relief to farmers, it is the need of hour to take effective steps with immediate effect, she said.

Selja said that the government should get conducted special girdawari and provide compensation to farmers within 20 days without leaving the farmers at the disposal of insurance companies under Fasal Bima Yojana because some farmers had not opted for this scheme and some farmers have still not received compensation of last year’s damage caused to crops.

She added now, the Central government will bear only 25 percent of the premium amount under Fasal Bima Yojana instead of 50 percent which clearly shows that anti-farmer ideology of this government.

The statistics shows that in last three years, the insurance companies charged premium to the tune of Rs 77,801 crore and earned profit of Rs 19,202 crore. This scheme is only for cheating the farmers and providing benefit to insurance companies, she added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/selja-demands-crop-loss-assessment-exercise.html

According to Pattnaik, Dr Samal asked him to admit his wife in his Kalyani Polly Clinic on December 9. His wife gave birth to a female child after a surgery.

49,02-3-20,Three festivals in yogaland,"It all began in the 1960s, when the Beatles arrived at Muni-ki-Reti, Rishikesh, looking for answers to life’s tough questions. They had everything going for them, fame, money, drugs, sex, in ample measure. Any yet, these phenomenally successful artistes, teenage symbols of youthful angst, were missing something.

Their sojourn to the banks of the Ganga would become the stuff of legend and forever altered the image of this obscure forest patch on the banks of the Ganga.

Beatles and the menagerie of cultural icons from the West, people like Mia Farrow, Prudence Farrow (commemorated in the famous Beatles song), and before them Timothy Leary and Bob Dylan, helped bring to Rishikesh the combination of Yoga, meditation, hash and babas or self-styled spiritual gurus.

Today, Rishikesh and more specifically, the areas of Muni-ki-Reti and Lakshman Jhula, are a strange mix of all these factors. The bottom line is that every summer thousands descend to these spots in order to battle their inner demons and to experience the vibe of what global seekers, influenced by Indian spirituality, do. Rishikesh is often touted as the Yoga Capital of the World.

Rishikesh has long been a spiritual center. It is said that sage Raibhya practiced severe penance here and as a reward, god appeared to him in the form of Hrishikesh, hence the name. Rishikesh has numerous ashrams, some internationally recognised as centers of philosophical studies, yoga and meditation.

In the first week of March, Rishikesh plays host to two huge events, the Yoga festivals. While one of them is a government sponsored jamboree with an impressive cast of babas with their devotees in tow, the other one is organised by Parmarth Ashram at Muni-Ki-Reti, with an equally impressive guest list.

The effort, in both cases, is to create world records in attendance and to outdo each other with their scale and grandeur. Both events are held on the same dates with many godmen paying visits to both events, creating a strange sense of competition that contradicts the very ethos these festivals seek to promote.

Jumping into the fray is another crowd funded event that has not only chosen a new site but also different dates to make a small beginning by bringing in music, art and heritage in a more participative format for the visitors.

The spot chosen to host the festival is Lakshman Jhula, where the exquisite setting on the fast-flowing Ganga, surrounded by forested hills, is conducive to meditation and mind expansion.

In the evening, an almost supernatural breeze blows down the valley, setting temple bells ringing as sadhus, pilgrims and tourists prepare for the evening Ganga Arti, the invocation to the river. Known as the Rishikesh Festival, the event is proposed as an annual event to be held for three days on the last weekend of March, with the holy Ganga forming the backdrop.

While the mornings will be dedicated to heritage walks, talks and painting, the evenings will feature concerts by visitors and artistes representing different genres. A free-to-enter festival, it will be dependent on voluntary contributions. The purpose of the event is to spread general well-being, love and respect for the spiritual tradition. The event will be completely waste and plastic free.

The purpose of the Rishikesh Festival is to focus on Ganga as the river eternal, to shift the focus subtly from the commercial, as espoused by the mushrooming ashrams and godmen, to the spiritual, inner quest, an emotion this divine space represents.

Governments and established ashrams must take a cue from this small festival that has just stepped out to invent itself. Rather than organise large events that invite freebooting multitudes, the events on the Ganga must sharply focus on presenting the authenticity of India’s culture in itself a reflection of the spiritual. Festivals here must focus on sending out the message of keeping the river clean and saving it ecologically. They must also dispel the prevalent idea that the river is a self-renewing entity that will clean up all the filth that we dump into it.

We are all aware that the Ganga is in grave danger and all our efforts to clean it are not yielding the expected results. The only way we can bring back the lost glory of the Ganga is to educate humans about the spiritual strength offered by this mother river that is crucial for the survival of millions of Indians.

Small festivals may only be a speck in the ocean, but they will definitely leave lasting impressions on pilgrims and visitors, as compared to mega-events.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/three-festivals-in-yogaland.html

Referring to the recent violence in Delhi, he termed the rioters as terrorists, adding that the riots were carried out with the backing of Pakistan sponsored terror groups.

Interacting with media persons here on Sunday, the ABAP president termed the rioters as terrorists, adding that Pakistan backed groups were behind the riots. Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said that this Act has not been made for Indian citizens. However, due to misconceptions, those who will not face any problem due to this act are doing wrongs.

The Government should deal strictly with people indulging in violence and disruption, he stressed. Regarding the Kumbh Mela area here, Giri said that the unauthorised occupation by the Irrigation department should be removed from the land of Niranjani Akhada situated at Tulsi Chowk.

He said that during the British colonial rule, this land was given to the Irrigation department to keep its equipment for the construction of Ganga canal. However, many years after the canal was constructed, the department is yet to vacate this land. He said that at the time of Kumbh Snan during the 2021 Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, the Sadhus will be requiring this land.

51,02-3-20,Haridwar councillors allege scam in sanitation works,"Local councillors have alleged major corruption in sanitation works carried out in the Municipal Corporation of Haridwar (MCH). Stating that the corporation is losing crores of rupees due to such corruption, they said that officials are also involved in the scam.

Addressing media persons at the Press Club, councilor Ankur Mehta said that the corporation officials in connivance with the KRL waste management company are orchestrating major corruption in the sanitation works. He said that despite garbage being lifted from the city by the company, trash is littered around in the city. He said that while the city struggles to get rid of garbage, officials are showing sanitation on the papers and indulging in major corruption.

Citing information received under Right To Information Act, Mehta said that the waste disposal plant was started in 2012 while the power connection at the plant was taken in 2017. He said that the plant has consumed 1048 to 3700 units of electricity from 2018 till date, which is equal to a domestic bill.

He said that the corporation officers have the right to pay up to Rs 6 lakh without the permission of the board, while the payment of more than Rs 30 lakh without the permission of the board is being made to the company. He said that the case should be investigated impartially and strict action should be taken against whoever is guilty in this scam.

Another councillor, Renu Arora said that the KRL company had to hand over 19 vehicles of the corporation to pick up the garbage. But later the corporation gave away 52 of its vehicles to them which is illegal. Not only this, these vehicles are not even insured and are not fit. Despite this, these vehicles are running.

Local BJP leader Chirag Arora alleged that the company is not registered with the labour department due to which those employed by it are being cheated. All the councillors and local leaders have demanded a thorough probe into the anomalies.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haridwar-councillors-allege-scam-in-sanitation-works.html
52,02-3-20,Govt failed on all fronts: PCC chief,"The Congress members staged a protest against the State Government accusing it of failing to work for the welfare of the people. The protesters raised issues like unemployment, the scam in forest guard recruitment exam and rising inflation, for which the said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government in the state is responsible.

While addressing the crowd, the Pradesh Congress Committee president Pritam Singh said that the BJP Government has broken the back of the common people with inflation. The Central Government is causing hardships to the citizens with its anti-public decisions.

He stated that the increase in the prices of LPG cylinders twice since the beginning of the year has proved that the current BJP Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not concerned about the interests of poor people.

Apart from holding the State Government responsible for inflation and unemployment in the State, Singh accused the State Government of being involved in the scam in the Forest Guard examination too. Singh said that the number of unemployed youths is increasing alarmingly and those who study hard for jobs and give examinations like Forest Guard exam are scammed by the Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC).

According to the members of Congress party, the State Government has failed on every front. The business of traders is wrecked, and the farmers are being forced to commit suicide.

Besides, to add to the woes of the common people, the Government has raised the fare of the transport corporation buses, hiked the prices of electricity, water, and cooking gas, said the PCC president.

53,02-3-20,Notices served to building owners,"The District Development Authority and Nainital Municipality have started issuing notices for eviction and demolition to owners of buildings built illegally after encroaching on the submerged area of the Sukhatal, the catchment area of the Naini lake in Nainital.

It is pertinent to mention here that local environmentalist Ajay Rawat had filed a PIL in the high court during 2012 against the illegal constructions encroaching on the banks of the Sukhatal lake. The court had then directed the authority and municipality to identify such constructions. During the tenure of the then Kumaon commissioner D Senthil Pandian in 2014, a team formed for this purpose had marked 44 buildings encroaching along the lake.

The municipality had demolished one illegal construction while the 43 remaining constructions are yet to be demolished. The district development authority junior engineer Kamal Kishore Joshi informed that the authority had issued notices to 16 persons asking them to vacate the buildings soon.

54,02-3-20,"‘Federalism demolished, democracy attacked’, says Congress on IT raids","The Congress has launched an attack on the Union Government over Income Tax raids in Chhattisgarh for the past 4 days and termed it as ""Coercive & Insecure Centrism"".

The Congress said Constitution has been trampled, federalism demolished and democracy attacked.

""Over the last four days, multiple raids on various locations have been carried out by the Income Tax Department in Chhattisgarh. Unfortunately, for the Modi Government, the clumsy method, manner and timing of these raids have exposed their mal-intentions and designs before the entire nation,"" alleged Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.

The meticulously planned raids began on February 27 early hours and were continued till date. Reports said that about 300 officers are engaged in the raids in which paramilitary CRPF troopers were deployed at the raid sites while state policemen were entirely kept out.

The raid was conducted on bigwigs linked to the state government. It began just a day after Congress-ruled state government’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) registered an FIR against former principal secretary Aman Singh, the long-time top associate of BJP leader and former chief minister Raman Singh.

Those prominent figures who have been raided include former chief secretary Vivek Dhand, who is presently chairman of Real Estate Regualtory Authority (RERA), tainted IAS officer Anil Tuteja, Raipur mayor Aijaz Dhebar, liquor baron Pappu Bhatia, former MLA Gurumukh Singh Hora and deputy secretary in CM’s secretariat Saumya Chaurasia.

Dhand, Tuteja, Chaurasia and others hold considerable clout in Chhattisgarh government and speculation was rife in state capital Raipur that raid was directly linked to Rs political funding’ though IT department has not made any statement so far.

Surjewala alleged that the Income Tax raids in Chhattisgarh were carried out after the Bhupesh Baghel government launched an investigation into irregularities of the previous BJP regime in the state.

""Is this a Cover-up Corruption exercise by Union BJP Govt? Can the Modi-Shah government share the basis on which these raids are being conducted?"" asked Surjewala.

""Unsurprisingly, and most importantly, the raids have begun only after the economic offences wing of the State Government launched an investigation into alleged acts of corruption that took place under the purview of the previous BJP Government. The persons targeted are also chosen to send a clear message to the State Leadership."" said Surjewala.

""We as a country, which have become familiar with these tactics over the last five and a half years. But Modi-Shah duo, in their zeal and desperation to intimidate, have done the Nation a huge disservice,"" alleged Surjwala.

""When we say that Constitution is a Federal Constitution, it means that the Provinces are as sovereign as the Centre. In other words, barring the provisions which permit the Centre to override any legislation that may be passed by the Provinces, which have a plenary authority to make any law for the peace, order and good government of that Province,"" the congress leader reminded.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---federalism-demolished--democracy-attacked-----says-congress-on-it-raids.html

62,02-3-20,Govt need not worry: SC,"In view of the strike called by the General-OBC employees starting on Monday regarding the issue of reservation in promotion, the members of Uttarakhand SC-ST Employees Federation said that the State Government need not be concerned due to the strike as the SC-ST employees will work hard day and night to make sure everything goes smoothly.

In a press conference held on Sunday, the office bearers of the federation said that it is unethical of the general-OBC employees to propose the strike from March 2 to cause hindrance in the Budget session of Vidhan Sabha beginning in Gairsain from March 3.

According to the regional head of the federation, Karam Ram, “The call for strike just before the Budget session is a very wrong and selfish decision of the general-OBC employees.

The Budget session is very important for the people and employees of the State but the announcement of the strike shows that they just like to think of themselves rather than seeing the bigger picture.

It appears that the stubbornness and audacity of these members is probably due to the influence of some political party.” He opined that the statement of one of the General -OBC employees’ leaders Deepak Joshi that Government should appoint a nodal officer for the budget session from SC-ST employees is quite insulting to the people of the federation as well as to the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

According to him, strict action must be taken against Joshi and his organisation by the government. However, he said that if the Government will ask them to do any job, the federation members will cooperate and work hard.

About reservation in promotion not being a fundamental right, Ram said, “As per Article 16 4(A) of Indian constitution, it is the fundamental right of SC-ST employees to get a reservation in the promotions. If the Government denies this to be a fundamental right, they will have to make it clear that that reject the Constitution of India too.”

According to the federation members, as long as the discrimination against the people belonging to SC-ST is prevalent in the State, the reservation will be relevant too. In the conference, the federation also proposed to increase the job reservation for OBCs from 14 per cent to 27 per cent besides the reservation in promotion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-need-not-worry--sc-st-employees.html

66,02-3-20,Relocation of Barasingha to Kanha one of remarkable feats of wildlife conservation,"The relocation of Barasingha to Kanha Tiger Reserve is acknowledged as one of the remarkable achievements of wildlife conservation in the world. The number of hard ground Barasingha had come down to just 66 in Kanha. Today the number has grown to around 800 due to the vigorous efforts of the management. This species is included in some of the world's most endangered wildlife species, owing to the poaching and destruction of habitats.

This state animal of Madhya Pradesh is now somewhat safe, but Kanha management, considering it not enough, is constantly moving ahead to achieve the management objectives of Barasingha conservation.

With an aim of increasing hard ground Barasingha population, left only in the world in Kanha Tiger Reserve, 7 Barsinghas to Van Vihar National Park, Bhopal and 46 to Satpura Tiger Reserve have been relocated in the recent years and increase in their population has been recorded at these places.

A total of three sub-species of Barasingha are found in India and Nepal in the whole world. In India, the three subspecies Rucervus Duvaucelii, Rucervus Duvaucelii Ranjitasinhi and Rucervus Duvaucelli Brendari are found in Dudhwa and Kaziranga National Parks, Manaas National Park and Kanha National Park respectively.

The habitat of Barasinghas found in Kanha is hard land, whereas the other two species found in the North East and North India live in marshy habitats. Kanha's Barasingha prefers somewhat swampy places. Hence it is also known as Swamp Dear.

Due to hundreds of years of gradual development and adaptation in Kanha, Barasinghas have accustomed itself to survive in the hard land of the central India. This deer loves water and swampy moist areas.

They eat only grass of selected species and have specific shelter, food and reproduction requirements. Their entire life depends on the grasslands. Keeping these characteristics in mind, the Kanha management has achieved tremendous success in increasing its number through its intense efforts.

The constant decline in bio-population of wildlife was worrying and to prevent this, effective speedy efforts were needed to increase the number of Barasingha.

Acting on the guidelines of Madhya Pradesh Forest Department, Project Tiger and the Government of India, the steps Kanha management took for conservation of Barasinghas are continuing till today. These efforts include construction of in-situ enclosures, continuous development of sheltering sites, water, marshy areas, preferred meadows as well as shifting to the historic habitat of Barasinghas and the monitoring of the entire biodiversity of the national park etc.

Presently, small population biology has become a recognised branch of science. According to this small number of adverse genetic and environmental factors continue to work in small numbers. Therefore, it is very important to have effective management and proper monitoring. Simultaneous death of some animals can also affect the entire bio-number for a long time. Kanha management has also sent some Barasinghas to Bhopal's National Forest Vihar and Satpura Tiger Reserve to avoid this situation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/relocation-of-barasingha-to-kanha-one-of-remarkable-feats-of-wildlife-conservation.html

81,02-3-20,Strict action should be taken against those involved in Delhi riots: Anurag Thakur,"Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Anurag Thakur on Sunday ducked questions pertaining to his controversial “shoot the traitors” slogan saying that the matter is sub-judice and media should have full facts.

Refuting that he has ever raised controversial “shoot the traitors” slogan during Delhi Assembly polls, Thakur told media, “You are lying. I think sometimes there is lack of information in the media too regarding the way some things are projected.”

The Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs was addressing a Press conference in Chandigarh after meeting stakeholders from various trades and industries during an interactive session organised by the Income Tax Department.

When asked again about his alleged hate speech, Thakur told the media to limit their questionnaire to his department and said, “The matter is sub-judice. You (media) should have full facts. Half-baked truth is dangerous — be it the propaganda of media or somebody else. I feel that you guys should have complete knowledge.”

“What clarification you want on this? Strict action should be taken against those who are accused of inciting the riots and were involved in riots in Delhi,” he said.

The communal riots in the national Capital have claimed more than 40 lives.

Evading further response on the issue, the Union Minister chose to talk about the country’s economy. “India should move forward. We have taken big steps on the economy and will do so in future too,” he said.

Thakur added, “From Monday, Parliament session will begin, questions are raised there also from economy to various other issues and on that platform (in Parliament), answers will be given on various matters.” “If you have questions on the economy, you should ask those,” he summed up.

Thakur had triggered a row after he raised slogans of “shoot the traitors” at an election rally in Delhi.

Notably, the Delhi High Court had recently expressed anguish over the Delhi Police’s failure to register FIRs against three BJP leaders over their alleged hate speeches in connection with the CAA-related violence and asked the police commissioner to take a “conscious decision” on it.

The Congress has said that it will raise the issue of the communal riots in Delhi during the second part of the budget session of Parliament starting on Monday and demand Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation over alleged police lapses in curbing the violence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/strict-action-should-be-taken-against-those-involved-in-delhi-riots--anurag-thakur.html
82,02-3-20,Explain where are missing tablets: SAD to Ministers,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday asked Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu to explain to Punjabis where are the five crore “missing” tablets of buprenorphine — a medicine used to treat narcotic addiction. At the same time, the party asked him why he was not resigning to let a fair probe into Rs 300 crore drug tablet scam if he was innocent?

“With issuing threats of filing a defamation suit against former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, the Health Minister is trying to divert the attention from the main issue of diverting five crore buprenorphine tablets to private de-addiction centers as well as providing shelter to the accused by indulging in a cover-up operation,” said senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra.

“He should first explain to Punjabis why a huge quantity of a drug tablet was gone missing? Being a Minster, he is directly responsible for this scam. He should immediately resign and let the Enforcement Directorate (ED) complete its probe in a fair and transparent matter,” he said adding that neither running away from probe nor issuing defamation threats would help Sidhu.

Speaking about the gravity of the crime committed by the Health Minister, Chandumajra said that Sidhu was not only responsible for the death of thousands of addicts due to diversion of buprenorphine tablets, but also for creating new addicts as the drug if not given under medical supervision could result in addiction.

“The Minister has indulged in corrupt practices of pushing thousands of youth into addiction,” he said, adding that he should be immediately dismissed and booked under the NDPS Act.

Asking Sidhu why he had obstructed the Health Secretary from doing his duty who had issued 12 showcause notices to private de-addiction center with details of missing tablets, Chandumajra said that Sidhu had tried to protect the accused with overruling the secretary’s decisions in this very sensitive case.

“This proves that Sidhu was hand in glove with the officials responsible for missing of drug tablet,” he said adding that earlier Sidhu was infamous for running a land mafia in the region which was indulged illegal land purchasing and other property-related frauds.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/explain-where-are-missing-tablets--sad-to-ministers.html

84,02-3-20,AAP doors open for Navjot Sidhu: Bhagwant Mann,"Even as cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu send across a message that he would stay in the Congress while sharing his picture with party chief Sonia Gandhi, Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann on Sunday maintained that the party doors for the former Cabinet Minister is open.

Making it clear that no talks have been held with Sidhu at any level so far, Mann said that it was he who is making offers to the firebrand leader. “If Sidhu decided to join the AAP, I would be the first to welcome him,” said Mann.

After AAP’s resounding victory in the recently-concluded Delhi assembly polls, speculations were rife that the party may now rope in Congress’ rebel leader Sidhu and project him as its chief ministerial candidate for 2022 polls.

“I have made the offer, but there have been no talks. Navjot Sidhu is a damn honest person…I was his huge fan during his cricketing days and used to switch off the TV whenever he got out. I am still his fan and will remain so in the future too. If he joins our party, I will be the first to welcome him,” said Mann.

The Sangrur MP said that the doors of the party were open to all those who work for the welfare of the State without any vested interest.

However, Mann evaded a direct reply when specifically asked if his party had approached Sidhu to join the outfit. Instead, he quipped, “Unemployment has been on the rise, prices have risen…farmers suicide is increasing…” to underline

that he should be asked about “Punjab’s issues” and not about individuals.

When asked if Sidhu could be offered the chief ministerial post in case he joins the AAP, Mann again evaded the reply and said, “Farmers suicides have increased, water table has gone down. You (media) should ask questions about Punjab’s issues.”

“Sidhu, Bhagwant Mann, these are not Punjab’s issues. Punjab’s issues are farmers’ suicides, our water table going down, issues pertaining to our youth, our economy, these are the issues and you should ask me about this,” he added.

The Congress MLA from Amritsar had been incommunicado ever since he resigned from the state cabinet last year. Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June last year.

However, a few days ago, Sidhu met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

In a statement later, Sidhu said that he was called by the “party high command” to Delhi and that he apprised the two senior leaders of a road map for the “revival” of the Congress-ruled state “to its pristine glory”.

Earlier, BJP’s youth leader Gurtej Pannu, along with his hundreds of supporters, joined AAP. Welcoming them, Mann declared that it was now time for the youth to work.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-doors-open-for-navjot-sidhu--bhagwant-mann.html
85,02-3-20,Perform or be prepared for suspension: CM to officials,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Sunday sent out a loud and clear warning to Government officials who neglect their duties and said that such officials should be prepared to face suspension. Addressing a gathering at Baijal Baba Mela in Godda, the Chief Minister sought the support of commoners in identifying such officials and helping the Government spot lacunae in the system.

“If work is delayed for no reason, then the concerned official should be prepared to face suspension. We will not tolerate lackadaisical approach of officials at any cost,” said Soren, adding that it was people’s responsibility to highlight the anomalies in the system and not settle for anything less than what they deserve.

Hinting a clampdown on Government officials, Soren said that raids are being conducted to catch corrupt officials across the State. “Corruption has to end. We will not spare any person even remotely involved in corrupt practices. Raids are being conducted on different locations. We have conducted raids even in police stations,” Soren said.

The Chief Minister added that surprise inspection of different departments was also an ongoing process in the Government and he was keeping a close watch on officials. Right from the officials at block level to the ones holding top positions in the Government, every person involved in the process was answerable in the current Government, he said.

Soren also encouraged the people of Jharkhand to support the Government in running all the welfare schemes and cooperate with officials who work for them. “While there will be no leniency on corrupt officials, we will also not spare the commoners who obstruct officials from doing their duties. If we want change, then we too will have to change,” he said.

The Government schemes, he said, were for the benefit of people, and it was the responsibility of common citizens to ensure that they are not deprived of any of the benefits under various Government schemes. “It is your duty to fight for your rights and get aware of your rights at the same time. You should not leave any benefit you are eligible for,” Soren said.

He said the Government plans to do work that gives long-lasting results and benefits all the generations to come. “This is only the beginning. We want to work not only for you all but also for the future generations,” said Soren, adding that his Government prioritizes serving the people of Jharkhand over everything else.

The idea behind ‘Hunar Haat’ was to encourage, promote and provide national and international exposure to artisans and craftsmen of minority community, said Naqvi on the occasion.

The Ministry has organised 21 Hunat Haats so far across India. After inaugurating the exhibition cum market, Munda said that the Tribal Affairs Ministry and Minority Affairs Ministry are working in coordination to provide international market, opportunities and recognition to India’s traditional art and crafts. ‘Hunar Haat’ is an effective mission which has been ensuring that the common people become a part of mainstream economic development, he added.

“Hunar Haat has been providing market and opportunity to India’s indigenous legacy of handmade art and crafts. “Hunar Haat” has proved to be platform to bring India’s rich cultural heritage under one roof,” said Munda.

Speaking on the occasion, Naqvi said that while on one hand, ‘Hunar Haat’ has ensured ‘Kaushal Ko Kaam’ (Work for Skill), on the other hand it has given international recognition to legacy of Indian art and crafts.

“Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s visit to Hunar Haat at India Gate in New Delhi, organised from February 13 to February 23, has given tremendous boost and encouragement to artisans, craftsmen especially women artisans from across the Country,” said Naqvi.

Naqvi said 125 stalls have been set up at ‘Hunar Haat’ in Ranchi where more than 250 artisans and craftsmen including women artisans from across the country are participating. “Artisans have brought with them rare handmade indigenous products from every corner of the Country. Visitors will also enjoy traditional delicacies of various states and cultural programmes to be held daily,” he added.

More than 3 lakh artisans, craftsmen, culinary experts and people associated with them including a large number of women artisans have been provided employment through ‘Hunar Haat’ in the last 3 years, said Naqvi.

The Union Minister for Tribal Affairs said that Union Minority Affairs Ministry has started process to register these artisans and their indigenous products on “GeM” (Government e Marketplace). “Several export promotion councils have shown interest in providing international markets on a large scale for handmade indigenous products of these artisans and craftsmen.

87,02-3-20,"Climate change can lead to poverty, malnourishment","The freak weather because of climate change can lead to a drop in foodgrain production, resulting in an increase in poverty and malnourishment among children, forcing the government to look for new options to counter the impact of climate change.

Severe winters followed by very hot summers and unpredictable rains can be detrimental for agriculture.

UP’s Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the impact of climate change and global warming could be felt in the state as there was a greater frequency of droughts and floods — the hallmarks of climate change.

Agriculture scientist Dr Aditya Shukla says crops have been affected due to rise and fall in temperature. “Untimely increase in the temperature destroys the growing flowers of crops, resulting in decrease in agricultural production and as there is change in direction of wind from west, it reduces the size and number of food grain resulting in low production,” he said.

“If our foodgrain production goes down, it will not only increase poverty but also push more children into malnutrition bracket because they will not have enough to eat,” Dr Shukla said.

“Today, we are not feeling the pinch because Uttar Pradesh is a foodgrain surplus state but its production is likely to go down fast if corrective measures are not taken in time,” the scientist added.

UP has been divided into nine agro climatic zones. Around 80 per cent population of the state is engaged in agricultural activities. Out of these, around 91 per cent are small farmers who solely depend on agriculture for their livelihood.

“The area of agriculture has worsened. There is prevailing situation of drought and flood due to the geophysical features of the state and natural calamities of last 10 years are indicating big crisis. Uncertainty in monsoon, changing pattern of flood, increasing durations of drought and flood, an increase in water crisis, violent storms etc. can be seen in the region,” said Dr Maninder Singh, who has carried out a study on agriculture and its pattern in UP in the last 10 years.

In eastern UP, which is chronically flood-prone, the very nature of flooding has changed, with a greater intensity of flash floods characterised by change in flooding patterns too. Crop damage is on the rise.

“Cropping patterns are changing. Pulses, once a major crop in the area and a major source of protein, are not grown due to the longer periods of waterlogging which disrupts the whole crop cycle and production, even in the rabi season, hitting production,” Dr Singh said.

The story is different in Bundelkhand where people have taken loans from private moneylenders but have failed to repay. “As this rugged area gets hot during summer, water becomes scare and they are forced to move out to earn a living,” he said.

The State of India’s Environment Report says that the biggest impact of climate change has been on human migration. With increasing intensity and frequency, natural disasters now affect more than half of India’s population, both in rural and urban areas.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority, 27 of the 37 states and Union Territories are disaster-prone. Some 68 per cent of the cultivated land is vulnerable to drought, 58.6 per cent landmass is prone to earthquakes, 12 per cent to floods, 5,700 km of the coastline is prone to cyclones and 15 per cent of the area is susceptible to landslides.

The 2011 Census shows that 405 million people (or 33 per cent of the country’s population) are on the move, with some 9.9 million people migrating from one state to another every year.

Experts believe that Uttar Pradesh is facing the brunt of weather change.

“We are sitting on the cusp of a change. The government needs to act fast otherwise it will be too late,” Dr Shukla said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/climate-change-can-lead-to--poverty--malnourishment.html

91,02-3-20,UPPCL to penalise firms issuing inflated power bills,"UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) will penalise private firms entrusted with the job of sending electricity bills to consumers if inflated bills are sent.

The UPPCL will lodge FIR against the erring firms and the officers of the power utility for the lapses causing hardship to the consumers and affecting revenue recovery.

Directions to this effect were issued by Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma while reviewing the progress of revenue recovery by the UPPCL and its four subsidiaries.

The minister had made a surprise inspection of one power sub-station and bill payment centre in Chinhat where several consumers complained of getting inflated bills. The consumers also complained that they had to run from pillar to post to get the bills corrected and make payment.

The minister also apologised to one elderly consumer who had visited the sub-station to get the bill corrected but had failed in his efforts.

The minister assured the consumers of action against those responsible for the inconvenience to them.

During the review meeting on Sunday, Sharma also directed the UPPCL officials to ensure that the benefit of the surcharge waiver reached the consumers so that maximum revenue collection became possible by the end of the fiscal 2019-20 on March 31.

For the relief of the power consumers, the UPPCL has launched compounding scheme under which the power consumers can pay the arrears in easy instalments.

The scheme is only for power consumers with connected load of 4 kW. The last date for availing of the benefit of the scheme after registration has been extended to March 31. The surcharge and penal interest will be waived for consumers availing the benefit.

A similar scheme has been launched for farmers having electricity connection for private tube well. The present cost of per unit electricity is Rs 7.35 while the cost for private tube wells is only Rs 1.21 per unit.

For the below poverty line (BPL) consumers, the power tariff is Rs 3 per unit for the first 100 units and while the tariff for rural domestic consumers is Rs 3.35 per unit on the consumption of 100 units.

The state government provides subsidy to the UPPCL on the loss incurred by the power utility in supply of power at low rates to private tube wells, BPL and rural unmetered power connections.

The energy minister said the government was committed for providing uninterrupted power to all categories of consumers and at the same time the UPPCL should collect revenue for the power supplied to the consumers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uppcl-to-penalise-firms--issuing-inflated-power-bills.html

93,02-3-20,Cane dues pile up,"Even as the Yogi Adityanath government has set a record of sorts by ensuring payment of close to Rs 90,000 crore to farmers during the last 35 months, cane arrears of more than Rs 8,100 crore have piled up in the cane 2019-20 crushing season.

Sugarcane crushing is going on in full steam in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s top sugar producer.

So far, all the 119 operational sugar mills have procured cane worth about Rs 19,250 crore from the farmers, of which they have made payment of Rs 11,100 crore, thus leaving more than 42 per cent or Rs 8,150 crore as outstanding.

Together with the current and the previous years’ outstanding, the net arrears on the UP sugar mills is to the tune of almost Rs 8,600 crore.

Meanwhile, the UP mills have produced 76 lakh MT of sugar after crushing nearly seven crore MT of sugarcane in the current season even as the state is expected to notch up sugar output of nearly 1.2 crore MT this season, thus retaining its position as India’s top sugar producer.

Of the 119 mills, 92 belong to the private sector, 24 to the public sector and three to cooperative.

Last year, the Yogi Adityanath government had filed police cases against the mills owned by the Bajaj Hindustan, Modi and Wave Groups owing to their failure to settle dues of the 2018-19 season. The FIRs were lodged under Section 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) 1955 and sections 420 and 120 (B) Indian Penal Code (IPC). Besides, recovery certificates were issued against a few others.

Recently, the chief minister had said his government was integrating the state sugar sector with ethanol to create a profitable and sustainable value chain for the sugarcane farmers.

Speaking in the legislative assembly, Yogi had claimed that owing to the proactive steps taken by the government, UP had emerged as the country’s top ethanol producer with annual capacity of more than 1,126 million litres.

The state has liberalised the licensing of khandsari (unprocessed sugar) units and is also promoting setting up of gur (jaggery) plants in the rural areas to provide alternative source of revenue to farmers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cane-dues-pile-up.html
94,02-3-20,"Spreading awareness on menstrual health, hygiene","Menstrual hygiene continues to remain a challenge in the society with young girls and women having limited access to menstrual education and basic sanitary care products. ‘Project Pavitra’ an initiative of the Ranchi district administration aims to sensitise adolescent girls, provide answers to their doubts and questions and also bust myths taboos and misconceptions related to menstruation.

The project launched in collaboration with the Art of Living Foundation, aims to educate as many girls in the district as possible on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). So far as many as 20,000 adolescent girls have been trained in Ranchi as a part of this mission. ‘Project Pavitra’ basically talks about the menstrual cycle through interactive sessions. The initiative targets girls from class V to class XII.

About 70 Government and Co-Ed schools with more than 25,000 students are expected to be a part of the third phase of the project which will begin in the second week of March.

The initiative also aims to sensitize boys about menstruation. It will also include sessions about using sustainable menstrual products which are both cost effective and environment friendly.

The teachers of these schools will also be trained as they are the primary caregivers in the schools.

“‘Project Pavitra’ has given the adolescent girls a platform to understand, ask questions and normalize the phenomenon of menstruation.

It is time we talk about Menstrual Hygiene Management with the children at a young age to help them make informed choices in the future. So far, the project has impacted more than 20,000 students across 57 government schools in Ranchi.

The district administration aims to cover students across all the government schools in the coming phases,” said Ranchi Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rai Mahimapat Ray.

The first phase of the initiative was rolled out in January 2019 across all the 13 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya in the State capital.

After the initial sessions the girls got answers not just on questions related to menstruation but a lot of other issues as well. In the first phase about 5,000 girls were trained. The training sessions also included practicing Yoga and Prayanama (breathing exercises) to relieve any discomfort.

In the second phase launched in July 2019, all the government schools in the district- about 44 in number spread across all the blocks were included.

Apart from the interactive session and exercises, during this segment, the focus was also on introducing the trainees about the various menstrual products available like sanitary napkins, reusable cloth pads and even menstrual cups.

95,02-3-20,Amba accuses BJP bigwigs of hatching RS 2016 conspiracy,"Congress MLA Amba Prasad on Sunday said that former Chief Minister, Raghubar Das, Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar were the main culprits in the 2016 Rajya Sabha horse-trading case. Suspended IPS officer Anurag Gupta was only a pawn, she added.

Former Minister and Amba’s father Yogendra Saw was allegedly pressurised to vote in favour of the BJP during the 2016 RS polls. Chief Minister Hemant Soren led State Government suspended Gupta on February 13. The IPS officer is accused of threatening former Minister Yogendra Saw for voting in favor of BJP during the Rajya Sabha elections in the year 2016 while being Additional Director General (ADG) posted at Special Branch of Jharkhand Police. In this case a First Information Report was also registered with Jaganathpur Police Station in 2018.

Addressing a press meet at Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) headquarter in the State Capital on Sunday, Amba said that the BJP used Gupta as a pawn to pressurize her father Yogendra Saw and her Mother then MLA from Barkagaon State Assembly Constituency Nirmala Devi. “During the Rajya Sabha election, the main roles were played by Raghubar Das, Union Minister Naqvi and Rajya Sabha MP Poddar in the conspiracy. They used Gupta to convey their messages to my parents at that time. When my parents refused to hear their demands they implicated them under false cases. My entire family was badly tortured and harassed by the former State Govt,” she added.

The MLA from Barkagaon State Assembly Constituency demanded that the entire case should be investigated by National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Special Investigation Team (SIT) so that her family could get justice. She said that she requested Chief Minister Hemant Soren in this regard and asked him to constitute a high level investigation team to probe the case.

Amba said that she has many evidences to show in the Court but she will not give it to any police officer. She doubted that how can a police officer investigate against a police officer. She said that she herself and her brother have been implicated in false case by misusing power during regime of former State Government.

Yogendra Saw won from Barkagaon State Assembly Constituency in 2009 as Congress candidate and became Minister in the State Government. In the State Assembly election of 2014, his wife Nirmala Devi contested as Congress candidate from the seat and won. In 2019, State Assembly elections Prasad won from the seat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amba-accuses-bjp-bigwigs-of-hatching-rs-2016-conspiracy.html
96,02-3-20,Prakash to take charge of BJP on March 4,"State BJP general secretary Deepak Prakash, designated to become the new State president, will take charge on March 4 at a grand function in BJP office. Senior BJP leaders including former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi, Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda, outgoing president Laxman Gilua and others will be present at the function where Prakash will take charge as new State president.

BJP State general secretary and Rajmahal MLA Anant Ojha said, “Apart from senior leaders, former Ministers MLAs and MPs will be present at the function.” Ojha said that for making the function a grand affair the BJP has started preparation. On February 25, the central leadership of the BJP promoted state general secretary Deepak Prakash as Jharkhand president of the party in what was seen as an attempt to win back the upper-caste votes.

Prakash enjoys a close relationship with JP Nadda right from the time the BJP national president’s father, NL Nadda, was vice-chancellor of Ranchi University from August 1978 to April 1980.

Prakash, apart from Nadda is also close to BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi, who became BJP legislative party leader on Monday. Sources said that his closeness with Marandi can be gauged from the fact that when the talks of Marandi planning to merge his party JVM with BJP started he was one of the few leaders in BJP who had information, but he kept the entire development a secret.

The appointment of Prakash also assumes importance as he eclipsed many leaders, who were in fray of becoming state president. Leaders such as BJP Rajmahal Anant Ojha, Chatra MP Sunil Singh, former state president Ravindra Rai and Rajya Sabha MP Samir Oroan were in fray for State president’s post.

The previous Jharkhand BJP president, Laxman Giluwa, who resigned after the Assembly election debacle, was considered close to Das.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/prakash-to-take-charge-of-bjp-on-march-4.html
97,02-3-20,Over 80% mental health patients don’t seek treatment: CIP Director,"More than 80 per cent of people suffering from some or the other mental illnesses do not seek treatment, Director of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) Dr D Ram said on Saturday, highlighting the stigma and lack of awareness related to mental health in the Indian society. Most of the patients do not even know that they are suffering from a mental illness and choose to keep it a secret either out of shame or the fear of social isolation and prejudices, he added.

“Over 80 per cent people suffering from mental disorders do not consult a doctor or a psychotherapist. Most of them do not even share their problems with friends or family and choose to suffer in silence,” said Dr Ram, adding that the deep-embedded belief among many people of avoiding any discussion about how they feel mentally was the greatest challenge in addressing mental health issues in India.

Depression, the most common form of mental illness that is said to be widespread in the urban society, has affected people from different age groups across the country, say doctors and researchers. While lack of awareness and poor education are among the major reasons that keep patients from seeking medical assistance, even many educated and aware residents of urban India do not share about their mental health concerns as they equate their condition with weakness and lack the courage to accept the fact that they need help, say doctors from leading psychiatry institutes.

“We often see that the ones who are in need of help are also the ones who defend themselves most aggressively when people ask them to seek help,” said Dr. Christoday Khess, senior doctor at CIP. Patients often distance themselves from their loved ones, avoid socializing and some even get overly-involved in their profession in an effort to paint a picture that proves that they are overworked and not depressed.

“Workaholics, who cut off from other aspects of their lives and try their level best to prove that they are only concerned about their profession, might be suffering from depression,” said Dr. Siddharth Sinha from Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (RINPAS). “They start finding purpose in their professional challenges and create new challenges when their work is done. They usually get stuck in this vicious cycle, where there is no purpose left in their life other than overcoming professional challenges,” he added.

According to a study conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 6.5 per cent of the Indian population suffers from some form of serious mental disorders, with no discernible rural-urban differences. Though there are effective measures and treatments, there is an extreme shortage of mental health workers like psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors. As reported latest in 2014, it was as low as ''one in 100,000 people'', says a leading Indian news portal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/over-80--mental-health-patients-don---t-seek-treatment--cip-director.html
98,02-3-20,State to get Apada Mitras for disaster response,"Young boys and girls in Jharkhand hinterland will soon undergo trainings on disaster response and work as Apada Mitras (Disaster Response Friends) in the far flung villages of the tribal State, Minister for Disaster Management Banna Gupta has said. These volunteers will not only come to the rescue of people affected by disasters, but also actively participate in relief works, he added.

A close associate of the Minister on Monday said that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has already trained many Apada Mitras in other States. The Government of Jharkhand is planning to impart similar trainings to the youths here with the support of the NDRF and appoint them as Apada Mitras he added.

“We will constitute a Disaster Management Commission, and it will be headed by the Chief Minister. The idea is to strengthen the entire disaster response system in the State, and it is crucial to have volunteers in the smallest of villages in order to strengthen the disaster response machinery from the root,” Gupta said.

Sources from Gupta’s team said that the volunteers will be paid honorarium every time they save a life or provide relief to survivors of a disaster. In rural Jharkhand, several people, especially children, drown in wells, ponds and rivers. The Apada Mitras will also be trained in rescuing people who drown. “The ones who already know how to swim will be preferred for the training of voluntary life guards,” said an aide of the Minister.

While the amount payable to the volunteers for their work is not decided yet, officials said that it may help many people in the rural areas eke out a living. Apart from coming to the rescue of people who are affected by disasters, these volunteers will also spread awareness about the ways to protect oneself in case of an emergency and the precautions to be taken for avoiding disasters caused by human folly.

In the recent past, the State has witnessed a series of fire incidents, and Gupta was prompt in taking cognizance. Last week, fire broke out at two shops on busy Mahatma Gandhi Road in Ranchi. Gupta rushed to the spot and sought details about the incidents. He also directed the fire fighting officials here to take help of NDRF if need be.

Deaths caused by lightning strikes are also a major concern in Jharkhand. According to State District Management Authority (SDMA), around 1,800 people have been killed by lightning in the last 12 years in Jharkhand. The SDMA data says that lightning kills a person every second day on an average in a year. Experts, however, say the numbers are much higher as several deaths in state’s remote areas go unreported. “We are working on new technologies to minimize the effect of lightning strikes on human habitats,” Gupta had earlier said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-get-apada-mitras-for-disaster-response.html

105,02-3-20,Elephant tramples 12-yr-old boy in Garhwa,"A 12-year-old boy was trampled to death by an elephant in Rodo village under Ramkanda police station of the district on Saturday night.

The deceased, Rosu Singh, son of Dhanpat Singh, was sleeping in a mud house in the village when the elephant attacked.

Agitated villagers took to streets in protest against the Forest department’s alleged failure in capturing a tusker.

Vehicular traffic between Medninagar and Ranka Road was disrupted for two hours. The protestors alleged that forest officials were not taking adequate steps to chase away the animal from the area.

On being informed, Forest Officer (South) Abhirup Sinha reached the spot and pacified the locals.

He assured the villagers that the elephant will soon be tranquilized and a team from West Bengal will come to the village for this purpose within two days. A compensation of Rs.4 lakh will be given to the family of the deceased as soon as all the formalities are done.

106,02-3-20,Now get mechanised uplas @ Rs 10,"Cow dung uplas or cakes, which are traditionally handmade in the rural parts are gradually being made mechanically. One such set up is at the Harmu Gaushala in the Capital city.

The cow dung cakes are being made here using machines for the past four months.

The uplas are being made of 100 per cent cow dung with a little quantity of hay also being added to it which acts as a binder. The mixture is then passed through the machine and compressed. It is later dried naturally. These loga are available at a price of Rs 10 per Kg at the Gaushala.

“This product is being publicized as cow dung logs in the market. It has multipurpose usage and can be used for cooking as well. Cow dung when burned with one teaspoon of ghee, can produce about one tonne of oxygen. Burning this also removes a substantial quantity of harmful bacteria present in the environment,” said Ranchi Gaushala Nyas Secretary, Jyoti Bajaj,Bajaj further stated that owning to its natural benefits, it is one of the chief commodities used in form of havan. In the near future it will also be available at the Harmu Muktidham (crematorium) where provisions to store it are being made.

“Earlier some trials were conducted which were very successful and since then this practice has been adopted. Since it has a high burning point as compared to wood, it also a better option which is both cost effective and environment friendly,” added Bajaj.

Presently, a small machine is in use at the premises. There are plans of ordering a bigger one as well in the near future. “A lot of farmers from Ranchi and its surrounding areas come to us to collect cow dung for farming. As per the requirement of these uplas, we will try to strike a balance to produce these mechanized cakes and also give manure to the farmers,” further stated the Secretary.

As compared to handmade cakes and machine made logs, these are more compact while the ones manually have some air. Hence, this stakes longer to burn out.

According to city based environmentalist Nitish Priyadarshi, using machine made uplas can go a long way in saving the environment.

“As compared to burning coal or wood, this does not have any harmful components like toxic dust particles and is a totally natural product.

This will also go a long way in saving fossil fuels which will also lead to a drastic reduction in the rising levels of pollution. In today’s time attempts should be made to take it to the masses and people should be encouraged to use it instead of burning wood or coal,” said Priyadarshi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/now-get-mechanised-uplas---rs-10-kg-in-city.html

Schools in the city have started taking kids closure to nature by organising adventure trips to nearby hills. In an effort to provide school-going children an opportunity for all-round development, the Adventure Club of Loyola School recently organised a camp for schoolchildren of class 4 and 5. The club led by the school teachers Priyanka Mayer Chauhan and Parvinder Dhanjal embarked the adventure trip to Dalma Hills.

At the send-off function, Father Michael Fernandes, Vice Principal, Loyola School and Vineeta F Ekka, Vice Principal of junior section of Loyola School extended their best wishes to the team.

“We took the children of our school for this adventure camp at Dalma because they can learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time. I feel such camps will help children on environmental studies. Moreover, camps like these also help in the over-all development of a child as it provides them a wider perspective of life which cannot be learnt in classrooms,” said a teacher. She informed that they have plans to organize more such trips for other classes too.

Savak Patel, treasurer of Loyola Alumni Association (LAA), who was part of the trip, said that the adventure camp offers children various types of sports like trekking and rock climbing. “We have no fixed itinerary for children who come for this adventure camp. They went up to Dalma Hill and on their way they learnt about the importance of team work, cleanliness and need of conservation of environment. They also learnt how to cook food for themselves at the time of need. The kids also participated in different activities aimed at building team work and fitness,” he informed.

Several other schools in the city are also organising such camps. “I feel that both trekking and mountaineering are ideal and ultimate tests of human endurance. It is the best place to discover one-self and it removes the entire ego. It is only when one meets with challenges and critical situations that one will exercise their brains to their maximum and also exert them fully physically,” said another school principal.

Even B-schools like XLRI offers leadership expedition for their students to expose them to life of hardship to help them understand the importance of team work and spirit of unity.

The programme has received overwhelming response in the campus. “We strive to encourage the students to realise a unique harmony not only with the outer environment but also with their inner-self. To unleash the love for nature among XLers and to bring out various out-door leadership and team building skills essential for all B-school students, a major endeavor of XLRI Adventure and Nature Club (XLANC) organises of adventure sports activities,” said an office bearer of the club.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/children-tryst-with-nature.html

Marandi later talking to media persons said that there is a larger conspiracy behind Lohardaga incident claiming that district administration failed to check the incident.

He said, “The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which had planned to take out procession in support of CAA, had submitted a letter on January 20 informing district administration about the procession but there was little preparations from administration’s end.” As the procession passed through various roads of city when it reached Amala Toli, stones were pelted. Marandi said, “Anti-social elements even pelted stones from the office of a political party indicating that members of political party too were behind the incident.” Marandi said that in the incident rioters attacked houses of members of a particular community and looted property.

Those who accompanied Marandi included Lohardaga MP and former union minister Sudarshan Bhagat, Chatra MP Sunil Singh, former minister Sukhdeo Bhagat, former MLA Gangotri Kujur, State BJP vice president Pradeep Sahu among others.

Curfew was imposed in the city following incidents of rioting, arson, loot and violent clashes, when a group of people allegedly pelted stones on a procession taken out by right wing groups in support of the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The BJP delegation said that even after passing of more than a month of riot the state government has not taken any cognizance and has not bothered to meet the victim’s family members.

The delegation members said that BJP with its demand to provide justice to family members will sit on dharna at Raj Bhavan.

The Janata Dal (United) chief's reaction came after election strategist and former party national vice-president Prashant Kishor and CPI's Kanhaiya Kumar flagged the issue of migration of youths from Bihar to other states and unemployment recently.

Recounting a conversation that he had with Raghunandan Lal Bhatia, who served as the governor of Bihar in 2008-09, Kumar said, ""He asked me why was it that Punjab had started getting so fewer migrant workers from Bihar. Similar was the observation of the then Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.""

He said, a fall in the number of migrant workers from Bihar was also the common refrain in Bhutan when he visited the Himalayan

kingdom.

""Those who are interested in knowing the facts can come to us. We will provide them with exact figures of the number of vacancies filled by the state public service commission and other bodies entrusted with recruitment of manpower. They will be also given an exact idea of how much things have changed since the preceding regimes,"" Kumar said.

He, however, also said ""ek gandi cheez shuru ho gayi hai migration ke naam se (a bad thing has started by way of this discourse over migration).""

126,02-3-20,Maha CM’s wife Rashmi takes over as Saamana editor,"Rashmi Thackeray, wife of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, replaced him as the editor of the Shiv Sena’s official mouth-piece “Saamana”, a Marathi daily newspaper, on Sunday.

The change in guard in “Saamana” set-up was expected as Uddhav had quit as the editor of the party’s official mouth-piece after taking over as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra three months ago.

Uddhav Thackeray had taken over as the Editor of “Saamana” after the death of Shiv Sena chief and his father Bal Thackeray on November 18, 2012. After having been its editor for eight years, Uddhav resigned as the editor of Saamana , before taking the oath as the Chief Minister on November 28, 2019. So much so that Uddhav’s name had disappeared from the print line of the

newspaper.

In a public notice issued in the newspaper by publisher of “Saamana” Madhukar Bhagwat under the Regulations of Newspapers on Sunday, Rashmi Thackeray was named as the Editor of the Sena’s official mouth-piece.

“Saamana” began its publication on January 23, 1988, with late Thackeray as its founding editor. 'Dopahar Ka Saamana', a Hindi afternoon edition of “Saamana” was launched by the Shiv Sena on February 23, 1993.

In her capacity as the editor of “Saamana”, Rashmi Thackeray will also be the Editor of 'Dopahar Ka Saamana'.

127,02-3-20,Maha Speaker supports demand for caste census,"Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Speaker Nana Patole on Sunday said he would support the demand of OBC leaders to boycott the exercise to conduct the General Census 2021 if a caste-based enumeration is not allowed.

Speaking at an event here, the Speaker said leaders cutting across the party lines had demanded that a delegation be sent to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for allowing the caste-based Census to find the population of people from Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

""OBC leaders have decided that if the caste Census is not conducted they would boycott the General Census (exercise) and I would support them.

""If a government does not follow the norms of the Constitution, then an individual has the freedom to boycott (any exercise mandated by the government). We will follow the mantra of Mahatma Gandhi,"" he said.

Patole said since the prime minister belongs to a backward community (OBC) he should understand the pains of the people.

The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on January 8 unanimously passed a resolution urging the Centre for a caste-based Census to find out the population of OBCs across the country.

The resolution was moved suo moto (""on its own"") by the Speaker. Referring to that resolution, Patole said the state government can examine if a separate Census exercise can be undertaken in Maharashtra like the demands made in Tamil Nadu and Bihar.

Patole also said a ""right"" decision would be taken on the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) in the state legislature which is currently in session.

Patole, a former BJP MP, had quit the saffron party following differences with the Prime Minister on agrarian issues, and rejoined the Congress in December 2017.

128,02-3-20,BJP 100% responsible for Delhi riots: Pawar,"Holding the BJP cent per cent responsible for the riots in Delhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday charged that having realised in the run-up to the recent Assembly polls it was not receiving public support and would not come to power, the ruling party at the Centre tried to derive political mileage by creating a communal divide in the national Capital.

Launching an all-out attack against the BJP at party workers at Somaya grounds at Chunnabatti north-central Mumbai, Pawar said: “The BJP is 100 per cent responsible for the recent riots in Delhi. The Narendra Modi government has miserably failed in preventing in riots in Delhi and in the process failed to maintain law and order fin the national Capital”.

Pawar also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former BJP president Amit Shah of fomenting communal tension during the Assembly polls in the national Capital through their vitriolic speeches.

“One could realise from the speeches of Narendra Modi, he was triggering controversies on religious issues. It was worrisome that Modi — as the Prime Minister of India —was resorting to this of electioneering. Instead of making effective use of power in hand at the hand for the benefit of people, the BJP leaders used ‘Goli maro” language in their speeches”.

“Having all lost all elections in the recent times, the BJP realised that the mood that was in its favour during the Lok Sabha polls was suddenly going against it. No wonder the BJP was creating a divide in the society in an effort to derive political mileage in the Delhi Assembly polls.

The speeches made by Modi, Shah, Union Ministers and party leaders in their election rally appeared to be breaking social and communal amity in the society,” the NCP chief said.

Underscoring the dire need to unseating the BJP from power at the Centre, Pawar said: “There is serious concern in all sections of the society across the country about what happened in the national capital. Apart from

preventing recurrence of the situation witnessed in Delhi in any other parts of the country, there is a need to keep all such forces which are threatening unity and integrity of the country. It time for us to think about alternatives (to the current Government at the

Centre)”.

Taking objection to language used by Modi in his public speeches, Pawar said: “Modi said that there was no need to investigate as to who were the opponents of the BJP and its Government at the Centre. This, he said, was because one could recognise the people by the headgears they were wearing. It is a matter of serious concern that the Prime Minister of the country was making such statements which drive a wedge in the society. The Rs Goli Maro..’ statement by a union minister was aimed at creating an atmosphere of terror in the society”.

Slamming the Modi government for the prevailing economic crisis in the country, Pawar said: “Our industry in dire straits. There is phenomenal rise in unemployment in the country. The government at the Centre does not seem to bother about the future of the country. A party (BJP) that won more 300 seats in the Lok Sabha polls is not in power in many states. The people are regretting as to why they re-elected BJP — a party that does not have the country's interest in the mind—to power at the Centre”.

Pawar said that the NCP would play prominent part in fighting the forces which were dividing the country on religious and casteist lines. “We have shove aside forces that whip up communal passion and engineer riots in their diabolic design to win elections,” he said.

Dismissing speculation about the possibility of collapse of MVA government in Maharashtra, Pawar said: “The MVA government is committed to resolving the issues of the people. This Government will complete its full five-year term”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-100--responsible-for-delhi-riots--pawar.html

According to sources, JD(S) leadership is even considering issuing notice to G T Devegowda for his recent actions and it is likely to be followed by expulsion.

JD(S) state President H K Kumaraswamy on Saturday said, he will warn G T Devegowda.

""If he (GTD) wants to remain loyal to the party, he can stayhis certain statements have embarrassed the party.

Let him take a clear stand, let him not stay here and speak in favour of someone else,"" he said, adding that we are watching his conduct some of which amounts to indiscipline, we are yet to issue him any notice.

He had also allegedly voted in favour of BJP during the recent legislative council bypolls, despite JD(S) legislature party in its meeting deciding not to take part in voting.

132,02-3-20,Central force used for political vendetta: Cong,"The Congress has claimed that the Central force was being used for “political vendetta” like other investigative agencies.

Describing CRPF-assisted Income Tax raids in Chhattisgarh as retaliatory measure to the State Government’s probe into alleged corruption under the previous BJP Government , the Congress on Sunday claimed that the central force was being used for ""political vendetta"" like other investigative agencies.

Describing it as ""coercive and insecure centrism"", Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that ""fly-by-night midnight operations"" and ""cover-up corruption"" raids were being conducted in Chhattisgarh to destabilise the ongoing investigations in corruption cases.

The I-T teams were assisted by central paramilitary force in the raids in Raipur and a few other locations.

Over the last few days, the Income Tax department conducted searches at multiple locations linked to Chhattisgarh government officials and others. The searches are being conducted to probe charges of alleged tax evasion by these people who include the family of a senior IAS officer in Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in the state.

""The Modi Government’s so called alliance with central investigative agencies in non-BJP states has now been extended to include the CRPF,"" Surjewala said.

He said that the way in which I-T department and the CRPF carried out raids in the last four days, without informing the police and the democratic government in the state, shows that the Centre is running scared.

""A PDS scam worth Rs 36,000 crore broke out in Chhattisgarh earlier. The diary that came into police possession by chance, which gave information about the scam has been put forth in front of the media by Congress party leaders like Bhupesh Baghel, T S Singh Deo and myself,"" he said.

Surjewala said that the raids have been conducted in a clandestine, cloak-and -dagger manner without any information being provided to the state government or to the state police.

""This deployment of a central force to assist in motivated income tax raids undermines almost every line of Dr Ambedkar’s caveat and the constitutional scheme laid out in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution which places law and order under the state’s exclusive remit,"" he said.

Surjewala also said that it is not surprising that the raids began only after the economic offences wing of the state government launched an investigation into alleged acts of corruption that took place under the purview of the previous BJP Government.

The Congress leader stated that the Congress Government of Chhattisgarh will take this as a ""sign of encouragement"" that their own investigations are proceeding in the right direction.

a ""We as a country have become familiar with these tactics over the alast five and a half years.

But Modi-Shah duo, in their zeal and desperation to intimidate, have done the nation a huge disservice,"" alleged Surjewala.

""When we say that Constitution is a federal Constitution, it means that the Provinces are as sovereign as the Centre. In other words, barring the provisions which permit the Centre to override any legislation that may be passed by the Provinces, which have a plenary authority

to make any law for the peace, order and good government of that Province,"" the Congress leader said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/central-force-used-for-political-vendetta--cong.html
133,02-3-20,Western disturbance to cause rainfall,"The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said a formation of fresh western disturbance is likely to affect Western Himalayan Region from the night of March 3, and plains of northwest India from March 4. This will cause widespread rainfall and snowfall accompanies by thunderstorm and lightning over western Himalayan region and over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh between March 5 and 7.

The IMD said that due to convergence in easterlies, light rain at isolated places with isolated thunderstorm likely over Southern Karnataka and Kerala next 2 days.

According to the IMD, the soaring mercury levels are touching new highs as February 2020 is recorded as one of the hottest second months in the last decade.

In February 2020, the average minimum temperature has been recorded at 14.2 degrees Celsius. In the past 10 years, according to the IMD data, the highest minimum average temperature was recorded in 2010 at 14.7 degrees Celsius.

In 2013 the minimum average temperature was recorded at 14.3 degrees Celsius, and in 2016 it was 14.6 degrees Celsius.

According to Skymet Weather, a private weather broadcaster, an upper Trough which currently lies over Madhya Pradesh would be shifting east/northeastwards and start affecting the eastern parts of the country. ""Thus, during the next 24 to 36 hours, a light spell of rain and thundershowers along with gusty winds may occur in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Odisha and in one or two parts of West Bengal. Places like Gaya, Aurangabad, Patna, Daltonganj, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, etc, are likely to witness rainfall activities,"" it said.

""Due to increased moisture levels along with the formation of a Cyclonic Circulation over Sub Himalayan West Bengal and adjoining region, the rainfall activities may increase in the northeastern states for the next few days. These weather activities are expected to be more in Arunachal Pradesh as compared to other states of Northeast India,"" Skymet said.

Meanwhile, the IMD’s early early trends suggest, the summer months of March, April and May are likely to be warmer than normal across most parts of India. Forecasts suggest warmer-than-normal temperatures over northwest, west and central India and some subdivisions from southern India from March to May 2020. Moreover, the seasonal average mean temperatures are expected to remain more than 1°C over few northwestern parts like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and west Rajasthan, resulting in a sweltering summer this year.

Average seasonal temperatures of 1°C above normal can mean a rise of several degrees above normal on extremely hot days of the season. For temperatures, the normal value is considered to be the average of temperature values from 1981 to 2010. As per the IMD forecast, both maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain 0.5 to 1°C warmer than the long period average across western coast, northwest as well as central parts of India this summer.

Tewari said that governments irrespective of their political colour have been ""completely inept"" at taking any initiative in this regard.

""The government may strongly resist any such proposal to set up a permanent Standing Committee. There is also a huge vested interest, ably led by the bureaucracy, that will go to any length to stymie any such effort,"" Tewari said.

135,02-3-20,"Need to prepare strategies, set agenda for next year: CRPF DG","The CRPF, the lead counter-terrorism and anti-insurgency paramilitary, has embarked on a mission to prepare a doctrine of the Force and codify a Unique selling proposition so as to capitalise on the strengths and replicate the same for repetition of successes in different operational areas.

Director General of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) AP Maheshwari has articulated to senior officials of the Force that there is a need to prepare strategies and set agenda for the next year and where the paramilitary wants to see itself in the next two-three years.

While operating in multiple operational theatres, the CRPF has recorded a fair share of success stories and Maheshwari has sought a systematic study of the achievements to bring out the USP of the paramilitary, identify inadequacies, if any and measures to overcome them.

""The findings should be documented, duly codified, so that we can capitalize on strengths of the organization and replicate then to pave the way for repetition of such success stories,"" reads an order issued by the CRPF recently.

The CRPF is not only the largest paramilitary with over 300 operational battalions but also the oldest Force in the country and is engaged in counter-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir and anti-insurgency roles in the Northeast as also fighting the Naxals in the affected States. The anti-Naxal force Combat Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) has in the last few months recorded significant achievements against the ultra-Left extremists, officials said.

Maheshwari has served in the CRPF as Inspector General (Operations) in the past and the move is aimed at streamlining the professional approach to minimize casualties in the operations, officials said.

As part of the proposed overhaul, there is a need to revive the existing training procedure by incorporating the latest equipment and technology.

The aim of the formulating the doctrine of the Force is to enhance operational synergy, revitalize organisational structure and combat preparedness.

The last vision document of the CRPF was prepared over two-decades back.

While Standard Operating Procedure of the Union Home Ministry has laid down that the paramilitary forces will chalk out their own operational strategies but the same is often ignored by the CRPF officers on the ground and they follow the deployment strategy of the local police, a senior paramilitary official said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/need-to-prepare-strategies--set-agenda-for-next-year--crpf-dg.html
136,02-3-20,Water insecurity rising in Hindu Kush Himalayan region: Study,"Rapidly changing climate and inadequate urban planning is causing water insecurity in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, a new study said on Sunday.

The study covering 13 towns across four countries - Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan shows that the interlinkages of water availability, water supply systems, rapid urbanisation, and consequent increase in water demand (both daily and seasonal) are leading to increasing water insecurity in towns in the HKH region.

""This water insecurity is attributed to poor water governance, lack of urban planning, poor tourism management during peak season, and climate-related risks and challenges,"" said the study conducted by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental knowledge and learning centre, based in Kathmandu, working on behalf of the people of the HKH region.

The study said that communities are coping through short-term strategies such as groundwater extraction, which is proving to be unsustainable.

""There is a lack of long-term strategies for water sustainability in urban centres, and this requires the special attention of planners and local governments,"" it said.

""Urbanisation has pulled people from rural areas in the HKH region into nearby urban centres. Although only three per cent of the total HKH population lives in larger cities and 8 per cent in smaller towns, projections show that more than 50 per cent of the population will be living in cities by 2050,"" it said.

This will naturally place tremendous stress on water availability, it added.

The study shows that the water demand-supply gap in eight of the surveyed towns is 20-70 per cent.

""There is a high dependence on springs (ranging between 50 and 100 per cent) for water supply in three-fourths of the urban areas.

Under current trends, the demand-supply gap may double by 2050,"" the study said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/water-insecurity-rising-in-hindu-kush-himalayan-region--study.html
137,02-3-20,SC to consider curative plea of 4th death row convict Pawan today,"The Supreme Court will on Monday consider ‘in chamber’ the curative plea of one of the four death row convicts, Pawan Kumar Gupta, in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, a day before their scheduled hanging.

The curative petition will be considered by a bench of justices NV Ramana, Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan in the chamber of Justice Ramana.

Pawan, 25, against whom the death warrant has been issued for execution on March 3 along with the three other condemned prisoners, has claimed juvenility to seek commutation of sentence to life imprisonment.

He has filed the curative plea through lawyer A P Singh seeking setting aside of the apex court’s earlier verdicts on appeals and review petitions in the case.

Advocate A P Singh said he has filed an application in the apex court registry on Sunday seeking an oral hearing on Pawan’s curative plea in the open court.

Pawan is the last death row convict in the case to move the top court with his curative plea, the final legal remedy available to a person.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died a fortnight later.

Pawan and another convict Akshay Singh also moved a trial court here on Saturday seeking stay on the execution of death warrants. The trial court has issued notice to Tihar Jail authorities on the pleas, directing the officials to file their response by Monday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-to-consider-curative-plea-of-4th-death-row-convict-pawan-today.html
138,02-3-20,"NDA united in Bihar, will win over 200 seats in Assembly polls: Nitish","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday asserted that the ruling NDA is and will remain united in the State, dispelling ""confusions"" that had arisen in the wake of his recent meeting with RJD's Tejashwi Yadav followed by some opposition Grand Alliance leaders beckoning him to cross over.

Addressing a 'karyakarta sammelan' of the Janata Dal (United), of which he is the national president, Kumar exhorted party workers to strive towards ensuring the NDA's win in ""more than 200 seats"" when elections to the 243-member Bihar Assembly are held this year.

Disapproving of political ""controversies"" around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which his party had supported in Parliament, Kumar called for ""patience"" as the matter was sub judice.

Anxieties in some sections of society, particularly among the minorities, have been addressed with a resolution passed by the Bihar assembly against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and insertion of contentious clauses in National Population Register (NPR) forms, he said.

The JD(U) chief also reiterated his commitment towards ensuring justice and welfare of all, including minorities, and slammed the opposition Congress-RJD combine, which keeps attacking him over his alliance with the BJP, by recalling the Bhagalpur riots of 1989 that had claimed over 1,000 lives.

""It is well known who was in power when the riots took place and how justice eluded the victims for 15 years thereafter. We brought the guilty to book and justice was ensured to the victims. I am more concerned about working for the minorities than getting their votes,"" said Kumar as he highlighted the various schemes being run by his Government for minority communities.

The chief minister, who spoke for close to an hour and a half, also dwelt at length on his Government's accomplishments with regard to improving law and order, and bringing in all round development.

Kumar asked party workers to apprise the common people about the same and debunk the opposition's propaganda.

On allegations of deterioration in law and order levelled by opposition parties and the concern expressed of late by ally Chirag Paswan, who heads the Lok Janshakti Party, the chief minister quoted National Crime Records Bureau statistics to suggest that the crime rate in Bihar, when taken into account in proportion to the population, was among the lowest in the country.

Sore over widespread criticism of the poor health and education scenario in the state, Kumar highlighted his government's success in reducing school dropout rates and mentioned the adulation from Microsoft founder Bill Gates who, during his visit to Patna last year, had praised the state's efforts towards ""fighting poverty and disease"".

The chief minister, who will aim at a fourth consecutive term in power in the assembly elections due by November, urged his party's workers to draw inspiration from the NDA's stupendous performance in the Lok Sabha polls last year when the BJP, the JD(U) and the LJP had together won 39 out of the 40 seats in Bihar. Indirectly referring to his one-to-one meeting with Tejashwi Yadav inside his chamber at the Bihar Assembly complex, which had prompted Grand Alliance leaders like former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi to ""welcome"" him to the opposition formation, Kumar said, ""There is no scope for confusions. We met over the NPR and the NRC debate, and the matter has been settled with a unanimous resolution passed by the assembly"".

""Now there should be dhairya (patience) as the CAA is before the court. Stirring a controversy is not proper,"" said the JD(U) chief in a veiled admonition to the opposition.

He also pointed out that the law providing for citizenship to refugees fleeing adjoining countries out of religious persecution was conceptualised when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister.

Flaying the RJD-Congress combine for their agitations over the citizenship law, Kumar said, ""I was a member of Parliament then. And, what I am saying can be verified from the records of the proceedings of the time. Leaders like Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh and Lalu Prasad all were in favour of such a legislation back then.""

He also spoke of the ""Jal Jeevan Hariyali"" campaign which aims at combating climate change through environment preservation and expressed delight over the enthusiastic public participation in the human chain that was formed in its support in January.

Kumar also asserted that prohibition, brought in force four years ago, has had many positive social and economic efforts and reiterated his commitment to securing special category status for Bihar which, he holds, is necessary for accelerated development of a state that has been historically backward.

The Chief Minister paid tributes to Valmiki Nagar MP Baidya Nath Prasad Mahto, who died in Delhi earlier this week. Condoling his death before he commenced his speech, Kumar winded up his address by making the crowds observe silence in the memory of the departed leader.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nda-united-in-bihar--will-win-over-200-seats-in-assembly-polls--nitish.html
139,02-3-20,"Bengal better off without hatred, TMC tells Shah","The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal on Sunday slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah for attacking the State Government over law and order situation, saying instead of preaching he should apologise for failing to save innocent lives during the Delhi violence.

Senior TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee also said West Bengal is better off without bigotry and hatred that, he alleged, the BJP “is trying to spread”.

“Rather than coming and preaching #Bengal @AmitShah you should have explained and apologised for failing to save more than 50 innocent lives in #DelhiViolence right under your nose,” Abhishek, nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said in a tweet.

At least 42 people were killed and over 200 injured as frenzied groups of people torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump, and pelted local people and police personnel with stones earlier this week, the worst riots in Delhi in over three decades.

Delhi Police is under the Union Ministry of Home.

“Mr Shah, Bengal is better off without bigotry and hatred that BJP is trying to spread,” Abhishek said in the tweet.

Shah, who was in the city to address a rally, exuded confidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will form the next government in the State with two-third majority after the 2021 Assembly polls and expressed anguish over the “worsening” law and order situation in Bengal.

With an eye on 2021 Assembly polls in the state, Shah also launched the BJP's 'Aar Noi Annay' (no more injustice) campaign and accused the TMC Government of not allowing “central welfare policies to be implemented in the state”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bengal-better-off-without-hatred--tmc-tells-shah.html

He was speaking to reporters here.”After the formation of the (Ram temple) trust by the Centre, the process of building the grand temple has begun. I feel that the basic structure of the temple will be built before the 2024 elections,” he said.

“Sixty-seven acres of land at the birth place of Lord Ram campus will prove to be inadequate as it would be the biggest temple in the world and an international tourist place as well,” he added.

“It is possible that the government-formed trust will have to acquire more land from around for building the grand temple,” the former BJP MP said.

Vedanti reiterated that as per the wishes of the saints and seers, the temple should be 1,111-feet high.

“The Ram temple in Ayodhya should be so high that it is visible in Islamabad, Colombo and Kathmandu. In consonance with our wish, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the Ram temple will be sky-high,” he added.

Asked why leaders associated with the Ram temple movement have not found a place in the trust, he said that those against whom cases are being heard in courts and who had fought elections on party lines have been kept out of it.

“I had myself fought Lok Sabha elections twice,” he added.”The trust set up by the government is good. The people who represent it want to get the temple built as per our wish,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---basic-structure-to-be-ready-before-2024-polls-.html

The farmers have been demanding that their lands be acquired as per the amended Land Acquisition Act and compensation awarded accordingly.

They had first held the 'Zameen Samadhi Satyagrah' in January but called off the protest after four days as the state government assured them that it would address their concerns within 50 days.

“Twenty-one farmers, including five women, have taken Zameen Samadhi on Sunday. The protest will escalate on Monday with 51 farmers taking the Samadhi. We will continue to protest till farmers get their rights,” Nagendra Singh Shekhawata, a leader of the Nindar Bachao Yuva Kisan Sangarsh Samiti, said.

The farmers had also held a protest in October 2017 against the acquisition of more than 1,300 bighas of land by the JDA, with some of them even going on a hunger strike.

The JDA has taken possession of 600 bighas of land so far and deposited Rs 60 crore in a local court as compensation. The villagers have refused to accept the amount, claiming that it is not commensurate with the prevailing market rates.

148,02-3-20,"Left, Naxals misleading people destabilising country, says Patil","Amidst protests against the new Citizenship law, Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Sunday accused the “Leftists, urban and rural Naxals” of trying to destabilise the country and mislead people over different

issues.

The former Maharashtra Minister also said that as the Government has crushed the Naxals in the last five years, “silent Naxalism” has started and misleading people was part of it.

He said the Congress, NCP and the Muslim community should realise that the Leftists were trying to disturb the country's peace and push their own agenda.

Patil was addressing a press conference during his visit to the Saibaba Samadhi in Shirdi town in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra.

“Muslims in the country, Congress and NCP are not able to understand that Leftists, Maoists, urban Naxals and rural Naxals, who are on the rise, want to destabilise the country. Urban Naxals are trying to mislead the people on various issues,” he said in response to a query on the forces behind the anti-CAA protests.

“I appeal to our opponents Congress and NCP that elections and running a Government are different things. Sometimes you win, sometimes we. But they should take note of the incidents that are destabilising the country,” he added.

Patil said members of the Muslim community should tell in a debate what their problems are (concerning the CAA).

“It is being fed in your mind that you have a problem. Anywhere it is being said that (PM Narendra) Modiji is going to build a jail in Delhi and Muslims from across the country will be put there. Is it possible? So how does this get into the minds of Muslims?” he added.

“In this, Muslims are harming themselves...Disturbing the long-established brotherhood. This disturbance will make life difficult. They don't realise that they are being trapped.

“Congress, NCP don't realise that they are opposing the CAA in favour of Muslims, but the Leftists are benefiting from it. They want to disturb the country. It is not about any political party. It is all the agenda of the Leftists,” he said.

“For years, despite using guns, they did not get success through rural Naxals. The government completely drove them away. In five years, the Naxals were finished. Now 'silent Naxalism' has started and misleading people is part of it,” he alleged.

When asked whether the use of abusive language allegedly by BJP leader Narayan Rane and his politician sons against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut suits the party's culture, Patil said he hasn't noticed anything like

this.

“The BJP believes in culture, but it does not mean that we are cowards. Everyone has a different personality. If anyone says anything wrong, then the party will act against it. I have not noticed anything like it,” he said.

“If Shiv Sena does whatever it wants, and if Raut writes whatever he wants in the editorial of 'Saamana' (Sena mouthpiece)...Does it suit their culture?” he asked.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/left--naxals-misleading-people-destabilising-country--says-patil.html
149,02-3-20,TN on way to communal polarisation,"The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the root cause of the Delhi riots, is having a major impact in Tamil Nadu. A shocking development of the Act is not the resentment against the Government of India but the communal polarisation that has set in the State, known for communal harmony and revolutionary social justice.

The rallies and demonstrations staged against the CAA by members of the Muslim community are being sponsored by extremist Islamic organisations like the Socialist Democratic Party of India (SDPI), Popular Front of India (PFI) and Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaat (TNTJ). “There are 23 Islamic organizations in Tamil Nadu which finance and lead the rallies staged in regular intervals. What is causing concern is the kind of slogans raised during these gatherings. We can understand the kind of sloganeering against the CAA and the Government of India. But most of the slogans are provocative and inflammatory. They are all against one particular community,” said an intelligence official.

Kolakala Srenivasan, author and columnist, said a line of divide is clearly visible in the relations between Hindus and Muslims in Tamil Nadu. “This is the first time we are seeing a demarcation between the two communities. The anger against the CAA has led to communal polarization,” said Srenivasan.

Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram, districts with considerable Muslim population substantiate fear expressed by Srenivasan. The social gatherings which used to feature both communities have become a thing of the past. The ‘we’ and ‘they’ divide is clearly visible. T Palanivelu, a businessman based in Chennai who has commercial interests in these districts says that members of the Muslim community are showing apprehension in dealing with Hindus. “I blame the political parties for the same. This is not the way to fight any kind of draconian laws,” said Palanivelu.

Krishna Pillai a farmer from Tirunelveli says the division is complete in his district as well as in Kanyakumari. “We have decided to boycott shops owned by Muslim community. The Islamic hardliners are encouraging their community members not to have any kind of dealings with Hindus. What else do you expect from us?” asked Pillai.

Even as Hindus have launched an un-declared social and business boycott of the Muslim community, the Sangh Parivar organizations are in the process of setting up small kirana shops in areas where the Hindus do not have any provision stores or super markets. “In course of time, we will have our own super market chains too,” said Arjun Sampath, president, Hindu People Party.

Sampath said this is a reaction to the “blockade” enforced by the Muslim community on the Hindus.

Though the Centre claims that Delhi riots have subsided and the region is limping back to normalcy, situation in Tamil Nadu is in the reverse process. “Till now the agitations remained peaceful. But what next is a major question,” said Malan, political commentator.

Indications are that the agitations against CAA would continue in Tamil Nadu in days to come. Thamimun Ansari, Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi, an extremist Islamic organization in the forefront of the agitation declared at Coimbatore that the agitation would continue till the Centre repeals the CAA.

“If the Centre and the Tamil Nadu Government continue to ignore us, we will launch a jail bharo agitation across the State,” said Gulam Dasthakir leader, Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tn-on-way-to-communal-polarisation.html
150,02-3-20,"CAA BJP’s ploy to implement divide and rule, says Teesta","The country is facing a huge challenge with the negative politics being played out by the ruling BJP at the Centre and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a ploy to implement their agenda of divide and rule, noted human rights activist Teesta Setalvad said on Sunday.

Delivering a speech on the topic 'Understanding our times: People's struggle and State response,' organised by the Citizens Forum for Mangaluru Development and 'We the People,' she said there was an urgent need to break away from the vicious politics of the ruling party.

Setalvad said it was wrong to assume that the CAA would affect only Muslims.

The amended law would adversely affect the interests of dalits, advivasis, tribes, migrant labourers and other sections of society.

The attempt to target a community to reap political gains has been happening in the country for long, she alleged.

The people have now descended on the streets as the BJP's hidden agenda has been exposed.

This is a welcome trend, she said adding the protests should be held in a systematic way to fetch desired results.

She accused the government of using brute force to crush peaceful anti-CAA demonstrations at many places, which was a “clear violation” of human rights.

A large section of people would be denied the right to vote if citizenship was given based on documents under the proposed NRC as happened in Assam.

They also would not get benefits under government welfare schemes which would amount to a civil death, she claimed.

While one cannot oppose the census process which is required to count the total population, the new columns for parents' addresses are meant to create a divide by portraying refugees as 'infiltrators' which is objectionable.

Setalvad said the entire NRC exercise, if taken up, would cost the country dear as it would have to spend at least Rs 55,000 crore for the process.

The government was spending the money while failing to address the unemployment issue in the country.

People should continuously put pressure on elected representatives and the state governments through their protests against the CAA.

However, people have now realized that nothing of that sort is going to happen and the agitation has weakened, Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass told reporters here.

“An attempt was made to influence people emotionally and they got affected. A large number of people has asked me why we were trying to bring in Bangladeshis. Our people are very emotional,” he said.

Dass said he along with other top leaders of the party toured 12 constituencies of Upper Assam and met over 2,400 booth committee presidents and elected representatives.

“We asked them about their sentiment on the situation since December 10. We all know that a misinformation campaign was going on claiming that over one crore Bangladeshis would come and attack the culture, language and identity of the Assamese people,” the BJP leader said.

Dass said he asked the booth presidents how many Bangladeshis have come and they replied that none has reached there.

“They confessed that people were made emotional, but now they have understood the situation. There is no impact of anti-CAA campaign and the agitaion has been weakened,” he added.

Opposition parties and various organisations started agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill from Decenber 10, a day after it was passed in the Lok Sabha. The Bill seeks to grant Indian citizenship to minority community people of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who fled religious persecution and entered India before December 31, 2014.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp--emotionally-influenced-people-launched-anti-caa-stir-in-assam.html
152,02-3-20,"No need for resolution against CAA, NPR in Maha House: Ajit","Maharashtra deputy Chief Minister And senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar on Sunday said the new citizenship law, the proposed NRC and the NPR will not take away anybody's citizenship and flagged “misinformation” on the issue.

Addressing the convention of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) here, he also ruled out any need to bring a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the state Legislative Assembly.

“The CAA, NRC and NPR will not take away anyone's citizenship,” he said. “It is unnecessary to pass a resolution against the CAA and the NPR in the Maharashtra Assembly,” the deputy CM said.

He said some people were spreading “false information” about the CAA, NRC and NPR by referring to a resolution passed in Bihar, and called for more awareness on this issue.

The Bihar Legislative Assembly last month unanimously resolved that there was no need of NRC in the state and that the NPR exercise be done strictly according to the 2010 format.

Notably, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had said in last December that like eight other states, Maharashtra should also refuse implementation of the new citizenship law, which he feared would hurt the religious and social harmony of India.

NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik had last month said the NRC will not be implemented in Maharashtra.

The Congress, another constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government, had demanded that a resolution against the NPR and the CAA be brought in the Assembly.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi last month, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that no one needs to fear about the CAA. He had also said that the NPR was not going to throw anyone out of the

country.

Earlier, Thackeray had said that his government will not allow the proposed NRC to be implemented as it would impact people of all religions.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-need-for-resolution-against-caa--npr-in-maha-house--ajit.html
153,02-3-20,JMC biggest ‘temporay’ job providers to Rohingyas in Jammu,"In smart city Jammu contractors engaged by the BJP- ruled, Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) are turning out to be one of the biggest “job providers” (on temporary basis) for Rohingyas, illegal immigrants from Myanmar.

According to Rinku Gill, President of the Safai Karamchari Union, Jammu Municipal Corporation, “an estimated number of around 200 Rohingyas have been engaged by the contractors to clean big and small drains across the municipal limits of Jammu city”.

In return for their day-long labour, these illegal immigrants are paid `400 per head to run their kitchen fires.

In contrast to this, local sanitation workers/sweepers engaged by the contractors of Jammu Municipal Corporation are paid a paltry sum of `225 per head. The glaring disparity is already causing lot of friction among the work force.

Not only this, JMC contractors have also deployed a fleet of transport vehicles on ground zero to ferry these workers at work in time. Before heading to work, these workers mark their attendance in the office of local JMC

supervisor.

Ironically, local State BJP leaders and even the top brass of the ruling party in centre never shy away from making loud statements claiming they remain committed to identify and deport Rohingyas to their country as per the international law.

Most recently, Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh has said that Rohingyas living in Jammu & Kashmir will be deported since they do not benefit under the Citizenship Amendment Act enacted by the Centre in November last year. He also added that the Rohingyas will not be able to secure citizenship by “any means”.

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of a three-day workshop on General Financial rules in Jammu on January 3, Singh said there were “no ifs and buts” over CAA’s implementation in the Union Territory.

“Its immediate implication would be in relation to Rohingyas here. We have a sizeable population of Rohingyas here. They have to go,” Singh said.

In the last one year,Union Home Minister Amit Shah has repeatedly made these statements at election rallies and also clarified stand of the Union Government on the floor of the house inside Parliament. Responding to the question in the Rajya Sabha on July 17, 2019, Amit Shah said that it was the NRC based on which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

“It is a very good question. The NRC is part of the Assam Accord and was also in (BJP's) election manifesto based on which the Government has come to power. The Government will identify illegal immigrants living on every inch of the country's soil and will deport them as per the international law,” Amit Shah said.

Referring to the statements of Union leaders, Rinku Gill maintained on one hand the government says, these Rohingyas pose a security threat and on the other hand they have been roped in by the JMC ignoring local work force”. He demanded local workers should be engaged first and provided with the opportunity to earn their livelihood than these illegal immigrants.

When contacted, Mayor of Jammu Municipal Corporation Chander Mohan Gupta said, “after the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Parliament, the entire country is witnessing chaos. The way union government remain committed to deport Rohingyas and all other illegal immigrants, we are also going to deport them from

Jammu”.

JMC, Mayor also claimed we have not engaged any Rohingya as daily wager to carry out works. We check credentials of workers and even NGO's engaged by JMC keep record of their workforce.According to a Home department report tabled in the state assembly on February 2, 2018, “a total number of 6523 Rohingyas were found camping across 39 different locations spread across five districts of Jammu and Kashmir”.

According to the Home department report, “6461 Rohingyas were staying in Jammu division and 62 in Kashmir division.

However, local activists and politicians, spearheading a campaign in support of their deportation often contest these figures claiming large number of these illegal immigrants are scattered and even their bio metrics have not been collected by the security

personnel",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/jmc-biggest----temporay----job-providers-to-rohingyas-in-jammu.html
154,02-3-20,Nagaland women commission organises night-walk to promote women safety,"Along with the rest of the country, Nagaland State Commission for Women (NSCW) on Sunday organised a “Night-Walk campaign” to popularise and promote women safety.

Thousands of women from different walks of life and tribes participated in the night-walk that started from TCP Gate junction.

The march culminated at Old MLA Hostel junction.The participants comprising women, children and young ladies from different Naga tribes and non-Naga inhabitants of the state capital held placards during the march.

Some placards read - “keep your sisters/girl child/mothers safe everywhere”, “mutual respect emits women safety” and “safety isn't expensive, it's priceless”.

The main objective of the walk was to emphasize on safe environment for women at public places sans time and to normalise women's visibility in public places, the Chairperson of NSCW, Khrienuo Tache, said, while addressing the campaigners.

The safety of women 24x7 in public spaces is essential and important for wholesome growth of societies across the world, she said.

155,02-3-20,‘Test checks' on AGR-hit telcos' dues assessment may start this week: DoT sources,"The ""test checks"" as promised by the Government on AGR-hit telecom companies' dues assessment could start this week for large telcos, according to a senior DoT official.

The government also wants Vodafone Idea to expedite its self-assessment, and Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash is believed to have communicated DoT's views in this regard to VIL, CEO and MD Ravinder Takkar during a recent meeting on Friday evening.

A DoT official said that ""test checks"" of AGR calculation for a sample year would commence shortly and it could be as early as this week at least for large telecom companies.

On Saturday, telecom operator Bharti Airtel said it has made payment of Rs 8,004 crore towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues to the government, an amount over and above Rs 10,000 crore it has already paid.

The amount of Rs 8,004 crore includes Rs 3,004 crore towards full and final settlement on AGR dues based on self assessment, and a deposit of buffer Rs 5,000 crore to cover DoT's reconciliation differences.

""Based on the aforesaid payment we have now complied with AGR judgement and the directions in the order of the Supreme Court dated October 24, 2019,"" Airtel said in a regulatory filing.

According to the Department of Telecom (DoT) estimates, however, Airtel owes nearly Rs 35,000 crore.

DoT is also asking three telecom companies Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices to provide substantiating documents to support their claims on AGR arithmetic.

Once substantiating documents are filed by the companies, the telecom department will initiate random 'test checks' on the AGR calculation in a time-bound manner.

The 'test check' will be done for any one year (of telcos' dues) to examine the deviation between telecom companies' assessment and the government's own calculation of AGR liabilities.

In all, 15 entities owe the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore in unpaid statutory dues — Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea account for about 60 per cent.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme last month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for extension in the payment schedule and asked companies to deposit their past dues for spectrum and licences.

Since then, telecom firms and the telecom ministry had been doing separate maths on the actual dues.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---test-checks--on-agr-hit-telcos--dues-assessment-may-start-this-week--dot-sources.html
156,02-3-20,Markets gloom to be short-lived as fiscal measures expected,"The gloom in the Indian equity markets might be short-lived as a number of global and domestic stimulus inducing factors are expected to give a boost to investors' sentiments. Supporting such a move is a technical fact that FIIs have net shorted 156,261 futures contracts on the Nifty.

A similar movement was seen in September 2019 when a slump was followed by a spurt, however, with a lag of some 20-30 days.

If the overall pattern repeats itself, then an up move is imminent.

""We witnessed short rollovers from the February series and further shorting was seen on the first trading session of the March series. FIIs aggressively shorted index futures in the last couple of weeks and as a result, their 'Long Short Ratio' in index futures reached to below 13 per cent, which is lowest since April 2018,"" said Jay Purohit, technical and derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

""Technically, strong support for Nifty is placed in the zone of 11,000-11,100 points. The overall data clearly indicates that the market is hovering in oversold territory and a bounce towards 11,450-11,500 levels cannot be ruled out in coming weeks. However, sustenance at higher level would be a challenge for the Bulls,"" Purohit added.

According to Edelweiss Professional Investor Research's Chief Market Strategist Sahil Kapoor, reversal signs such as the US Fed's signals of an upcoming rate cut along with the EU's expected fiscal supporting measures might give the much needed boost to the global and Indian markets.

On last Friday, fears of widespread disruption to economic activities due to coronavirus caused a massive stock market crash. Dalal Street mirrored global stocks and headed for its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

The benchmark Sensex lost 1,448 points in a broad based sell-off which saw none except FMCG major ITC withstanding the carnage. The 'Fear Index' or volatility index jumped by 30 per cent to settle at 22.87 as fresh cases of coronavirus infection surged outside China. Domestic investors were also cautious ahead of the 3Q FY2019-20 GDP data release on that day. The growth rate remained subdued.

Nifty Metal index plummeted 7 per cent, the most among the 11 Nifty sectoral indices. It was followed by IT, media and PSU Bank index. The pivotal banking and financial service sectors index closed over 3 per cent lower.

The Wall Street's benchmark index Dow Jones Industrial Average closed (down 4 per cent) with record losses on Thursday. China's Shanghai SE Composite Index was trading 3.71 per cent lower while Japan's Topix tumbled 3.6 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plummeted over 3 per cent.

159,02-3-20,Bill to bring cooperative banks under RBI to get Parl nod,"In a bid to address weaknesses in cooperative banking sector, the Parliament is likely to clear a Bill to amend Banking Regulation Act to bring multi-state cooperative banks under effective regulation of RBI during the Budget Session.

The proposed legislation will help prevent a repeat of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank-like crisis, sources said.

There are 1,540 cooperative banks with a depositor base of 8.60 crore having total savings of about Rs 5 lakh crore.

The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month gave approval to amend Banking Regulation Act.

The Bill in this regard is likely to be passed during the second leg of Budget session starting Monday. The session ends on April 3.

Having undertaken a slew of measures, including clean up of public sector banks (PSBs), private sector banks, financial institution like IL&FS, non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs), housing finance corporations (HFCs), auditors, rating agencies, this is the last step in making the entire financial ecosystem almost impossible to be gamed, with security of depositors' money being paramount.

To further bolster the confidence of customers, the Government has increased deposit insurance cover by five-fold to Rs 5 lakh to ensure security of public money in banks.

In the last couple of years, the Department of Financial Services has taken several steps to promote responsive and responsible banking.

As part of clean banking initiative, project cash flows were ring-fenced, enforcement of terms of loan agreements and prior validation of backward and forward linkages were made integral to lending processes.

Besides, the number of banks in loan consortium was capped, reducing borrowers' ability to play one lender off against another.

This was accompanied by data driven risk scoring and scrutiny, comprehensive diligence across data sources and strengthened credit assessment.

To ensure financial health of public sector banks (PSBs), recapitalization of Rs 4 lakh crore was undertaken in the last five years.

According to a study by CIEL HR Services, that focused on the latest trends in Indian talent market, companies are now resorting to recruiting companies for quality talent acquisition across junior, mid and senior-level positions.

Titled, 'CIELWorks 2020: Latest Trends in Indian Talent Market 2020' the study noted that social media platforms and job sites were still relevant at hiring candidates, however, an increasing number of companies now prefer to go through employment agencies.

""The main reason behind companies shifting gradually to recruiting companies is because these firms are cutting down their work and time by screening and selecting relevant and quality talent,"" Aditya Narayan Mishra of CIEL HR Services said.

The study that covered over 200 senior to mid level executives across sectors from December 2019 till January 2020, noted that though job opportunities were robust but securing quality talent remained a challenge during 2019.

It further noted that entry-level roles were filled in less than 30 days, mid-level in less than 60 days and senior-level jobs roles saw positions fill in more slowly at around 180 days.

The key factors that attracted candidates and retained them at the junior level were salaries and career development, while at the mid-level the trend was dominated by designation, job security, salary and development opportunities.

At the senior-level, the key factors that drove employee hiring and retention were centered on the role within the organisation, the variable pay, the study noted.

Other major factors that influence senior-level hiring include financial health of the company, work culture, employer brand and long term vision of the organisation, it noted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-inc-gradually-shifting-to-recruiting-firms-for-quality-talent--says-study-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-inc-gradually-shifting-to-recruiting-firms-for-quality-talent--says-study.html

The collection from Goods and Services Tax (GST) in February was, however, lower than the Rs 1.10 lakh crore collected in January 2020.

""The gross GST revenue collected in the month of February, 2020 is Rs 1,05,366 crore of which CGST is Rs 20,569 crore, SGST is Rs 27,348 crore, IGST is Rs 48,503 crore and Cess is Rs 8,947 crore,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The total number of GSTR 3B returns filed for the month of January up to February 29 stood at 83 lakh — same as last month.

The government has settled Rs 22,586 crore to CGST and Rs 16,553 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement.

""The total revenue earned by Central Government and the State Governments after regular settlement in the month of February, 2020 is Rs 43,155 crore for CGST and Rs 43,901 crore for the SGST,"" the statement added.

The GST revenues during the month of February from domestic transactions has shown a growth of 12 per cent over the same month last year.

Meanwhile, Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said with the monthly collections now stabilising at over Rs 1 trillion per month, the GST authorities would now go all out to enhance the March collections so that the deficit is reduced to the extent possible.

""These numbers indicate that the GST collections are becoming stable, with new changes like e-invoicing and new returns slated for next month, more stability is expected in future,"" he said.

EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said one possible significant reason linked to reasonable collections is the differential liabilities discharged by businesses in reference to the observations in GST Annual returns and audit for FY 2017-18, which was due in January 2020.

PwC India Partner & Leader Indirect Tax Pratik Jain said while the GST collection again looks impressive considering the overall economic scenario, one will have to see how much of it is due to restriction and blockage of input credits which has been happening in the last three months or so.

""The issue of blockage of input credit from the backend (on account of alleged difference between credit claimed and that disclosed by vendors) is becoming a concern for the industry and the GST Council should look into this.

Speaking at a function here to mark the 44th Civil Accounts Day, she said there is so much more to be accomplished and officers need to be responsive to the changes.

The minister further said the officers are not only competent accounts persons, but also competent technology professionals.

""Even as we are talking of technology, that itself is a challenge. Everyday it changes, newer versions come in, rapid changes are happening and therefore to keep on top of it is a big exercise. You have to constantly keep changing the milepost, bring in more and more efficiency and adaptive technology,"" Sitharaman said.

She also said that they have ""revolutionised"" technology-driven PFMS and it has empowered India to be accountable, responsive and transparent.

""Today all over the world DBT (direct benefit transfer) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) are being talked about as one of the silent revolution that democracy can show off to the world,"" the minister added.

She said the officers have shown that public finance is not opaque, but efficient and responsive to the public.

""This is biggest revolution. The Rs 1 lakh crore you have saved through DBT, these are not just symbolic. The Rs 1 lakh crore being saved for the public (is) by efficient use of technology without making anyone feel sorry,"" she said.

Through efficient use of technology, this service has proven that corruption and wrongdoing can be removed from the system, she added.

PFMS is designed to help the Government agencies for processing payments, tracking, monitoring, accounting and reconciliation.

It tracks funds disbursement and ensures that state treasuries are integrated with the Centre to ensure money is sent as and when required.

Speaking at the function, Expenditure Secretary T V Somanathan said integration of PFMS with railways, defence and postal service needs to be taken forward and the officers should expeditiously implement further ongoing initiatives so that it realises its full potential.

""I would like to draw your attention to huge volumes of data PFMS have within it which can be effectively use to improve the quality of expenditure,"" he said.

He added greater attention is required to ensure timely payments.

""...Because of the unforeseeable challenges on the parts-supply from China, our BS VI ramp-up has been affected,"" Veejay Ram Nakra, Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd said in a statement.

This has resulted in high de-growth in billing volume for February and dealer inventory is now under 10 days, he said.

""Going into March, we anticipate the challenge on parts-supply to continue for another few weeks, before we get back to normalcy,"" he added.

Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors Ltd said the outbreak of Covid-19 in China and a recent fire incident at one of its strategic vendors affected the vehicle production and wholesale volumes.

MG Motor India too reported lower retail sales of 1,376 units in February, hit by component supply constraints from China and other locations.

""The MG ZS EV has received a stupendous response in its debut month, with over 150 units delivered to our customers already,"" MG Motor India Director - Sales Rakesh Sidana said in a statement.

The unforeseen coronavirus outbreak has severely affected the company's European and Chinese supply chains, disrupting its production and impacting sales in February, he added.

The disruption in sales will continue through March, Sidana said.

""We are working towards stabilising the situation and are hopeful that reasonable normalcy will be restored by the end of March,"" he added.

However, major automobile manufacturers Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Toyota Kirloskar Motor do not see any immediate impact on their production schedules due to disruption in supply of components from plants located in China.

Whitty said medical workers were still investigating the cause of that one infection.

172,02-3-20,Death toll in Iran climbs to 54,"Iran’s health ministry raised on Sunday the nationwide death toll from the new coronavirus to 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978 people.

The ministry’s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran’s most important Shiite shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region.

Calls by Iran’s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open.

The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and a whopping 385 new cases of infections. The new numbers, however, bring down the percentage of deaths to infections from 20 per cent to around 5.5 per cent. Still, that is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections may also be much higher. Jahanpour said in his daily briefing that the number of cases is “still inclining” across Iran. Also on Sunday, Iran’s state broadcaster said all flights to the city of Rasht, the capital of nothern Gilan province, had been suspended.

174,02-3-20,Mahathir seeks Parl vote as new Malaysian PM sworn in,"Mahathir Mohamad called Sunday for an urgent sitting of Malaysia’s Parliament to contest the appointment of a former ally as prime minister under a Malay-majority coalition that could further split the nation following the collapse of Mahathir’s multiracial reformist alliance.

Muhyiddin Yassin, a seasoned politician who once famously quipped that he is Malay first and Malaysian second, was sworn in as the new leader at the palace Sunday after getting the support of several opposition parties.

Among the supporters was the corruption-tainted United Malays National Organization, which was ousted by Mahathir’s Alliance of Hope in a historic vote in 2018.

Muhyiddin, 72, pulled his Bersatu party out of the alliance on Monday, triggering its collapse. Mahathir resigned as prime minister in protest of the plan that would bring UMNO back to power. After a week of political turmoil, the king said Saturday that he believed Muhyiddin had the majority support of lawmakers and named him the new leader.

But Mahathir’s camp has contested that assertion, saying the 94-year-old two-time prime minister has the backing of 114 lawmakers to return as premier for a third time, surpassing the 112 votes needed for a simple majority. Mahathir said Sunday that the palace had refused to hear him out.

He called for an urgent sitting of the lower house of Parliament to test Muhyiddin’s claim of majority support. The house is due to resume March 9, but Mahathir said it could be delayed. “People on our side may be offered to be ministers. They may be offered other things,” he said. “We feel we have 114, but after the actions taken by these very rich and very powerful people, we may not have the 114,” he said.

“So the test of the pudding is in the eating; hold the Parliament sitting now.”

Already, two of the lawmakers among the 114 have denied supporting Mahathir.

Mahathir said he felt betrayed by Muhyiddin’s move and warned that UMNO leaders including ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is facing trial on corruption charges, may get off the hook. UMNO is the biggest party in Muhyiddin’s new coalition. “The court may find it embarrassing to take action against the government,” Mahathir said.

“We have seen this happen before during Najib’s time when he was able to manipulate the court, change the charges and to a certain extent, influence the decision of the court. I believe if the new government is installed now with Najib in it, this is what is going to happen.”

Attorney General Tommy Thomas, who oversaw a slew of graft charges against Najib, his wife, Rosmah Mansor, and several UMNO leaders after his appointment by Mahathir, has quit.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/mahathir-seeks-parl-vote-as-new-malaysian-pm-sworn-in.html
175,02-3-20,Sanders says he raised $46.5M in Feb alone,"Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign said Sunday that it raised more than USD 46.5 million in February, a show of financial strength after the Vermont senator finished a distant second behind Joe Biden in South Carolina’s primary.

Sanders’ team also announced that it was making television ad buys in nine more states: Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Washington, which vote on March 10, and Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, which vote a week later. The campaign said it is “currently on the air in 12 out of the 14 states” that are voting on Super Tuesday, in two days.

“The senator’s multi-generational, multiracial working class coalition keeps fuelling his campaign for transformational change a few bucks at a time,” Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. He said that, of the more than 2 million donations received this month, more than 1.4 million were from voters in Super Tuesday states.

The eye-popping haul follows an already impressive January that raised more than 25 million. Sanders’ campaign immediately said it would use the January funds to purchase USD 5.5 million in television and digital advertising in 10 Super Tuesday states.

That investment could still be paying off at a time when some rivals in a Democratic field that remains crowded may struggle to raise money after disappointing finishes in early states. Most other White House hopefuls haven’t yet released updated fundraising totals, but Massachusetts Sen.

Elizabeth Warren announced Sunday that she collected USD 29 million in February — potentially softening the blow of her fifth-place finish in South Carolina.

176,02-3-20,Afghan peace deal hits first snag over prisoner releases,"Afghanistan’s president on Sunday said he will not free thousands of Taliban prisoners ahead of all-Afghan power-sharing talks set for next week, publicly disagreeing with a timetable for a speedy prisoner release laid out just a day earlier in a US-Taliban peace agreement.

President Ashraf Ghani’s comments pointed to the first hitch in implementing the fragile deal, which is aimed at ending America’s longest war after more than 18 years and getting rival Afghan factions to agree on their country’s future.

Still, the US has said a planned US troop withdrawal over the next 14 months is linked to the Taliban’s counter-terrorism performance, not to progress in intra-Afghan talks.

Washington’s Peace Envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as America’s first ambassador to Afghanistan after the 2001 U.S. Invasion, spent the past 17 months running on-again, off-again talks with the Taliban to hammer out the agreement.

The US-Taliban deal signed on Saturday in the Middle Eastern State of Qatar envisions the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners by the Afghan government ahead of talks between Afghan factions meant to begin March 10 in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. The Taliban would release up to 1,000 prisoners.

Ghani told a news conference in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday that this wasn’t a promise the United States could make. He said the release of any prisoners was a decision for his government to take and that he wasn’t ready to release prisoners before the start of negotiations.

“The request has been made by the United States for the release of prisoners and it can be part of the negotiations but it cannot be a precondition,” Ghani said.

The US-Taliban deal is seen as a historic opportunity to extricate the United States from Afghanistan, a nation convulsed by conflict since the Soviet invasion in December 1979.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/afghan-peace-deal-hits-first-snag-over-prisoner-releases.html
177,02-3-20,Fitch Solutions cuts India's economic growth forecast to 4.9% for FY20,"Fitch Solutions on Monday cut its forecast for India's economic growth to 4.9 per cent in the current fiscal that ends March 31, saying manufacturing could come under pressure from weak domestic demand and supply chain disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The GDP growth is forecast to recover slightly to 5.4 per cent in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021), it said.

""We at Fitch Solutions are revising down our forecast for India's real GDP growth to 4.9 per cent in FY2019/20, from 5.1 per cent previously, and 5.4 per cent in FY2020/21, from 5.9 per cent previously,"" the agency said in its outlook for the country.

India's real GDP growth decelerated to 4.7 per cent in the third quarter (October-December) from an upwardly revised 5.1 per cent in the second quarter owing to slower government consumption, a steeper contraction in gross fixed capital formation and a smaller net exports contribution.

""A failure of the FY2020/21 Union Budget to provide support to the industry will also bring little reprieve for a sluggish industry already coming under heavy pressure from a credit squeeze following the collapse of several key Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs),"" it said.

NBFCs are a key channel in which consumers obtain loans for vehicle and housing purchases.

""Our revision is due to our view for disruption in the automotive and electronics supply chain from the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak in China to weigh on India's export manufacturing sector, and for this to have negative knock-on effects on the broad services sector,"" Fitch Solutions said.

It expected a mild pick-up in growth in the next fiscal assuming an easing of the virus spread from June, which should see a broad-based improvement in the economic activity.

""We expect manufacturing activity to come under further pressure from weak domestic demand and also supply chain disruptions due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which started in China. Weak manufacturing activity would also have a knock-on impact on slowing services growth,"" it said.

It expected manufacturing and services to pick up in FY2020/21. ""We also expect economic activity to be supported by an improvement in the agriculture sector through better harvest prospects and fiscal support announced in the FY2020/21 Union Budget.""

The growth deceleration in the third quarter was mainly due to a collapse in gross fixed capital growth, which contracted by 4.5 per cent, and slowdown in government consumption growth to 11.8 per cent from 13.2 per cent in the second quarter.

""We expect manufacturing (14 per cent of GDP) growth to remain weak over the near term,"" it said noting that the contraction in manufacturing eased slightly to 0.2 per cent in Q3, from 0.4 per cent in Q2.

Also, a continued contraction in total vehicle sales, suggests that the outlook for the automotive industry remains weak, Fitch Solutions said forecasting that the total vehicle demand would remain weak over the coming months, which should also see production remain in contraction.

Auto industry contributes 7.5 per cent to the total GDP and accounts for half of the manufacturing GDP.

On the external front, supply chain disruptions due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which began in China, will also severely curtail manufacturing activity across automotive and electronics due to a shortage of parts.

The coronavirus outbreak in China has prompted the Chinese authorities to implement varying degrees of lockdowns on many cities nationwide.

""Extended factory work stoppages after the Lunar New Year holiday in January, domestic restrictions travel, and labour shortages even as the Chinese government attempts to get factories to resume operations have severely disrupted supply lines across the world,"" it said.

China supplies between 10-30 per cent of automotive components used in India's automotive manufacturing, with the proportion supplied being two to three times higher for the electric vehicle segment.

For the Indian electronics manufacturing sector, China accounts for 75 per cent of the total value of components used in televisions and 85 per cent in smartphones, supplying parts from mobile displays, printed circuit boards, memory and LED chips to air conditioner compressors and washing machine motors.

Also, services (52 per cent of GDP) growth will also come under intense headwinds over the near term owing to likely work stoppages in manufacturing following a lack of inputs.

""We forecast real GDP growth to recover slightly to 5.4 per cent in FY2020/21, with the pick-up to be broad-based. Our forecast assumes that the Covid-19 outbreak will be contained by H1FY2020/21, although we stress that there remains significant downside risks to this forecast as there is still limited visibility on the virus spread in developing markets,"" Fitch Solutions said.

Expecting agriculture to benefit from strong fiscal support announced during the FY2020/21 Union Budget, it said a normal monsoon, as forecast by Skymet in January should also see a significant improvement in the 2020 summer harvest versus 2019.

A likely ramping up of manufacturing activity to clear backlogged export orders would also support stronger growth in the sector.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fitch-solutions-cuts-india-s-economic-growth-forecast-to-4-9--for-fy20-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch-solutions-cuts-india-s-economic-growth-forecast-to-4-9--for-fy20.html

180,02-3-20,No major impact on Indian fertiliser sector,"While many sectors are under pressure due to the spread of coronavirus, the impact on Indian fertiliser players is expected to be soft even as a major portion of raw materials for phosphatic fertilisers are imported, according to a report.

The Hubei province is a major centre for production of phosphoric acid and phosphatic fertilisers.

“Even though the production is down in the province, the overall fertiliser market remains well supplied due to the build-up of inventories at the producer’s end in China as international prices remained weak,” ICRA group head and senior vice president K Ravichandran said.

The fertiliser sector is not expected to witness any major impact on the global front as production in China remains low during January every year following Chinese New Year holidays, the report stated.

As per ICRA’s analysis, the domestic industry imports a major portion of the raw materials for phosphatic fertilisers, mainly phosphoric acid and finished fertilisers — mainly DAP (47 per cent of total imports in FY2019) from China.

The Indian fertiliser industry, with the markets currently remaining well supplied and the fourth quarter of the financial year being an off-season period for the industry, the impact of the Chinese shutdown is expected to be muted, Ravichandran said.

“Also, the global urea markets have remained well supplied in recent years with new capacities coming online in Africa, the Middle-East and Africa. With the downward trend in Chinese exports continuing for the last couple of years, the impact of the Chinese urea industry on the global market has reduced,” he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-major-impact-on-indian-fertiliser-sector.html

The National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports of 573 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection and 35 deaths on Saturday from the Chinese mainland.

Among the deaths, 34 were in Hubei and one in Henan Province.

COVID-19, which at one time started spreading rapidly all over China, showed a declining trend with three new confirmed cases reported outside Hubei on Saturday.

The border at Chaman in Balochistan will remain closed for seven days from March 2 “in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus on both sides of the border in the best interest of the people of the brotherly countries”, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Interior.

“During the period, necessary measures will be taken to safeguard the health of the people of both countries,” it said.

The authorities have shut schools in the southern province of Sindh, including in Karachi where the first case was reported, and the southwestern province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran, The Express Tribune reported.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pak-to-close-border-with-afghan-for-7-days.html

The virus has spread to more than 60 countries around the globe — killing nearly 3,000 people and sickening 87,000 — prompting the World Health Organization to raise its risk assessment to its highest level.

The decision to airlift the trapped South Africans came after President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday directed the repatriation of those who have asked to return home.

“We were asked by the president to start the process immediately — (so) within seven to 10 days (the evacuation team) must have completed the task,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said.

The minister told a news conference at the country’s main OR Tambo International airport that there were 201 South Africans in Wuhan — the epicentre of the virus, and that “151 have indicated they want to be repatriated”.

The group will be kept in quarantine for 21 days at a site authorities have refused to disclose.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/south-africa-to-airlift-151-from-virus-infected-china-within-days.html

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s decision to open his country’s borders with Europe made good on a longstanding threat to let refugees into the continent. His announcement marked a dramatic departure from the current policy and an apparent attempt to pressure Europe.

The UN’s International Organization for Migration said Sunday that by the previous evening, its staff working along the land border “had observed at least 13,000 people gathered at the formal border crossing points at Pazarkule and Ipsala and multiple informal border crossings, in groups of between several dozen and more than 3,000.”

Greek authorities fired tear gas and stun grenades through Saturday to prevent repeated attempts by a crowd of more than 4,000 people massed at the border crossing in Kastanies to cross, and fought a cat-and-mouse game with groups cutting holes in a border fence along the border to crawl through.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/un-says-13k-migrants-mass-at-turkey---s-border-with-greece.html
185,02-3-20,Create a positive environment,"We don’t realise the inconvenience and harassment caused by strikes to millions. Such an atmosphere even dilutes law and order. The only solution to end them is through yoga, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Social turbulence is now a chronic condition in India like many other parts of the world.

On one hand, our government has been trying hard to sell its idea of a “New India” to the world while on the other there are disturbing instances of strikes due to a communal riot, Bharat bandh and what not. For example, Mumbai, the financial, commercial and entertainment capital witnessed a strike by private cab drivers for drop in incentives by cab aggregators. Similarly, the whole nation saw students and parents coming out on roads to protest against re-examination due to paper leak. Next in the series was great commotion by the employees of essential services which held people of Mumbai to ransom. The strike by municipal employees just added to the chaos. One can see that anger and cry for justice is common in all the events.

We must understand that through prolonged strikes and rebellious attitude, violent situations are created. It is seen as the only way to grab attention and seek answers. And that is what the whole nation saw when young students were lathi charged. Imagine how such situations are perceived globally. India has been trying to position itself as a growth-oriented country but all these seem to shatter its image.

We don’t realise the inconvenience and harassment these strikes must have caused to millions. Such an atmosphere dilutes law and order. People defy all authorities and even children go on strikes if they are not heard. There is tension everywhere and the nation even suffers huge economic loss. A developing nation like India, cannot afford to waste its energies on avoidable conflicts. According to the government sources, the strikes in Mumbai have led to a loss of around `1,000 crore and as per a leading economic weekly of Mumbai, it is `2,000 crore. And this then, leads to rise in prices of commodities. As a result, even if the employee get a pay-hike they do not benefit from it.

One wonders if there is no peaceful method of resolving such disputes. The most effective non-violent method which does not create turbulence in the society is through yoga. No society has tried these methods and yet, one may, therefore, feel skeptical about adopting this. But the very rationale behind the whole idea of yoga will convince people that it is the only method that can bring silence in the desired direction, satisfying all sections of the society and ending all strikes and turbulence.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/create-a-positive-environment-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/create-a-positive-environment.html
186,02-3-20,Sow the seed,"That orange seed you just spit out? Grow a tree

What a waste,” I was thinking this morning as I spat out a seed from an orange. That seed could have grown into a whole orange tree. Growing an orange tree or any citrus tree from a seed is no more difficult than growing a bean plant from seed. In fact, tangerine seedlings have shared a pot with a houseplant near my rocking chair, evidently “planted” casually as someone ate the fruit while sitting in the chair. And it’s not unusual to find an overenthusiastic grapefruit seed sprouting while still inside the fruit.

SEEDS ARE EASY

There’s only one secret to growing citrus from seed: Don’t let the seed dry out. Helpful, though not critical, would be to soak the seed for a couple of hours before planting it, to leach out any sprouting inhibitors that might be present. After all, the seeds don’t usually sprout inside the fruits, so something — perhaps an inhibitor — in or near the seeds must be preventing sprouting. Another possibility is that the seeds are held back by low oxygen levels within the fruit.

Once the seed has been soaked, plant it like a bean seed, about three-quarters of an inch deep. Do this in a pot filled with the same potting soil you would use for houseplants or any other seed.

Being tropical (again like a bean plant), citrus seeds need warmth to sprout. A minimum of 60 degrees fahrenheit is good enough but 80 degrees would be ideal. Once the seed sprouts, which should not take longer than a few weeks, move the developing seedling to a sunny window.

BUT WILL IT TASTE GOOD?

To end up with a good-tasting fruit from a tree grown from seed has always been a tenuous proposition. All apple, pear, plum and peach varieties are clones, propagated by grafting or cuttings.

A tree grown from seed will bear fruits different from — and probably worse — than the tree that bore the fruits that bore the seeds. That’s because plants grown from seeds, in contrast to plants propagated by grafting or cuttings from stems, leaves, and roots, represent the commingling and shuffling around of genes of the parent tree and whatever other variety pollinated the flower that preceded the fruit.

However, citrus has the quirk, known as apomixis, of frequently producing seeds that are not the result of pollination, but that develop from the same kind of cells that make up the rest of the plant. Bingo! A seed that is genetically identical to its mother and hence, will bear identical fruit when grown into a tree.

BUT WILL IT BEAR FRUIT?

Sorry, a few hurdles still stand in the way. For one thing, not all the seeds even in a single fruit are necessarily apomictic, although sometimes it is possible to identify those produced by pollination by their weaker growth.

Second, citrus, like other plants, must go through a juvenile phase before becoming old enough to bear fruit. This phase, marked in the case of citrus by thorny branches, can last many years.

And finally, even after a citrus tree gets old enough to potentially bear fruit, it won’t do so except under good growing conditions, which are difficult to achieve unless you garden in a subtropical or tropical climate. When growing citrus in a pot, which is necessary in cold climates, more attention must be paid to providing sufficient food, water and light.

With that said, even a barren citrus tree is worth growing for its glossy, vibrantly green leaves. Growing a citrus tree from a seed is an especially nice long-term project for a child. The plants are fast-growing and if interest begins to wane, just crush a leaf. The aroma offers a mouth-watering hint of the taste of fruit possibly to come.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sow-the-seed-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/sow-the-seed.html
187,02-3-20,"Ind need to get balance right, caution is required more in NZ: Chappell","Australian great Ian Chappell on Sunday reckoned Indian batsmen need to strike a balance between caution and aggression, his views coming in the wake of their struggles in the Test series in New Zealand’s testing conditions.

Chappell’s opinion was in contrast to the view shared by Virat Kohli after the drubbing in the first Test. The India captain had said, in part, “I don’t think being cautious or wary will help because you might stop playing your shots.”

Known for his sharp cricketing mind, Chappell’s line of thinking is a bit different from that of Kohli.

“New Zealand, much like England’s seaming surfaces, is a place where caution is required more often than in Australia, where most pitches are extremely true,” Chappell wrote in ESPNcricinfo.

“Whatever the cause, at the Basin Reserve it was an abysmal batting effort from the No. 1-ranked Test team, who failed to reach 200 in either innings,” he added.

“Placing a batting order is not playing a game of ""pin the tail on the donkey”. It’s important to get the balance right and to place players in positions where they are comfortable and hence more likely to succeed.”

While he defended the obdurate Cheteshwar Pujara, who had the lowest strike rate in Wellington, Chappell said he should be careful about not going into a shell.

“It’s hard to be critical of a No. 3 who was heavily involved in India beating Australia in 2018-19 with some lengthy stays at the crease anchoring the innings.

“Pujara normally bats behind (Rohit) Sharma and Mayank Agarwal and ahead of Kohli. That’s an adequate amount of strokeplay surrounding Pujara, and as a judicious shot maker he’s ideal at No. 3 for balance.

“Mind you, Pujara needs to be careful he doesn’t slip into net-practice mode and forget that the object in a match is to score runs regularly.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ind-need-to-get-balance-right--caution-is-required-more-in-nz--chappell.html
188,02-3-20,Sri Lanka whitewash Windies in ODI series,"Angelo Mathews held his nerve with the ball to help Sri Lanka clinch a tense six-run win over West Indies in the third one-day international and sweep the series 3-0 on Sunday.

Mathews claimed four wickets and denied West Indies 13 runs in the last over, restricting the tourists to 301 for nine in their chase of 308 in Pallekele.

Fabian Allen smashed 37 off 15 balls to close in on the West Indies target but fell to Mathews while going for a six in the second ball of the 50th over.

Kusal Mendis top-scored with 55 in Sri Lanka’s 307 all out after electing to bat first and then took a crucial catch at deep mid-wicket to send back Allen.

Valiant knocks from Shai Hope (72), Sunil Ambris (60), Nicholas Pooran (50) and skipper Kieron Pollard (49) also kept West Indies in the hunt till the last over.

Mathews returned figures of 4-59 in his 10 overs of medium-pace bowling.

Earlier West Indies paceman Alzarri Joseph claimed four wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out in 50 overs.

Avishka Fernando and skipper Dimuth Karunaratne gave the hosts a brisk start with a 60-run opening stand before the West Indies struck.

The in-form Mendis, who hit a century in his team’s 161-run thrashing of West Indies on Wednesday, completed his 17th ODI fifty before falling to Joseph.

189,02-3-20,Klaasen century sets up Proteas win,"A maiden international century by Heinrich Klaasen set up a 74-run win for South Africa in the first one-day international against Australia at Boland Park.

Klaasen hit 123 not out in a South African total of 291 for seven. Australia were on target midway through their reply but lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs to be bowled out for 217 on Saturday.

Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne put on 84 for Australia’s third wicket after the early loss of opening batsman Aaron Finch and David Warner, both dismissed by Lungi Ngidi, who finished with three for 30.

Smith (76) and Labuschagne (41) hit only three boundaries between them as scoring proved difficult on a slow pitch and a big outfield.

When they tried to accelerate Labuschagne was caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.

Mitchell Marsh helped Smith add 41 for the fourth wicket but Marsh was bowled by Ngidi and three balls later Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Anrich Nortje.

It was always going to be difficult for new batsmen to get established and the innings subsided.

By contrast Klaasen and David Miller (64) put on 149 for South Africa’s fifth wicket and were not parted until Miller was out in the 49th over.

Klaasen said he felt “pure emotion” when he reached his century after a difficult recent period when he lost his place in the team and had to fight his way back. He gave credit to Miller and new cap Kyle Verreynne, who made 48 and helped Klaasen add 78 for the fourth wicket after South Africa had been 48 for three after winning the toss.

Verreynne, 22, made an impressive debut which included three catches in the outfield by a player who keeps wicket in domestic cricket. Two of Verreynne’s catches were spectacular, one to dismiss Warner when he dived forward from point and late in the innings when he ran in from long-on and dived to take a steepling catch from Pat Cummins.

Quinton de Kock was phlegmatic after a topsy-turvy few weeks when South Africa have had good wins interspersed by heavy defeats. “It’s a matter of being consistent in what we do and then we will be alright going forward,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/klaasen-century-sets-up-proteas-win.html

Proteas captain Dane van Niekerk won the toss and opted to bat on a slow track at Sydney Showgrounds, with her team making a competitive 136 for six, boosted by Wolvaardt’s late fireworks.

In reply Pakistan, missing captain Bismah Maroof who was ruled out of the tournament on Saturday with a broken thumb, could only manage 119 for five.

England, 2009 champions and runners up at the last tournament, secured their place with a comfortable 46-run win over the West Indies, courtesy of fine bowling and a battling 57 from Natalie Sciver.

The dangerous Lizelle Lee, who smashed a century against Thailand, immediately went on the attack as she opened the South African innings.

But pace spearhead Diana Baig bowled a beautiful outswinger and she got an edge to Sidra Nawaz behind the stumps in a big breakthrough for Pakistan.

Baig struck again with van Niekerk gone for three to leave South Africa at 17 for two.

Mignon du Preez (17) and Marizanne Kapp (31) steaded the ship, then Wolvaardt played what proved to be a critical knock. She carved out a high-quality 53 from 36 balls, including fours off the final three deliveries.

Pakistan made a brisk start, whacking a quick 18 before Shabnim Ismail removed Muneeba Ali in a rare T20 wicket-maiden.

Omaima Sohail lasted just three balls before being run out in a comical mix-up with stand-in skipper Javeria Khan, then the dangerous Nida Dar departed for three.

A desperately unlucky Khan was batting beautifully in her 100th T20 when she was run out for 31.

Needing 58 off the last five overs, Aliya Riaz (39 not out) and Iram Javed (17 not out) did their best but were denied by tight bowling.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sa--eng-power-into-t20-wc-semis.html

After Majumdar’s 149 not out propelled Bengal to 312 after being down at 67 for 6 at one stage, the 21-year-old Porel snared 5 for 39 as the three-pronged Bengal pace attack dismissed the batting-heavy Karnataka for a paltry 122 in 36.2 overs, their lowest total this season.

India opener Rahul, who was adjudged man-of-the-series in their 5-0 T20I whitewash of New Zealand recently, looked out of sorts and scored a forgettable 67-ball 26 (2x4s).

Spinner Krishnappa Gowtham (31) top-scored for Karnataka in a quick 56-run (46 balls) eighth-wicket stand with Abhimanyu Mithun (24) to help Karnataka avoid the follow-on but only to concede a massive 190-run first innings lead.

A total of 15 wickets tumbled on day two as Bengal were 72 for 4 at stumps with Sudip Chatterjee (40 not out) giving Majumdar (1 not out) company, extending the hosts’ overall lead to a sizeable 262-run.

Saurashtra on top

Rajkot: Sheldon Jackson struck a gritty hundred before the bowlers shone as Saurashtra gained the upper hand on the second day of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against Gujarat here on Sunday.

Jackson's knock of 103 helped Saurashtra post 304 and then the home team bowlers wreaked havoc on Gujarat's batting line-up to reduce them to 119 for six.

Resuming on overnight 217 for five, through Sheldon Jackson and Chirag Jani (29), Saurashtra negated the early challenge posed by the opposition bowlers.

Jackson got a reprieve on 82 when skipper Parthiv Patel dropped a catch off pacer Arzan Nagwaswalla. He made the most of this by notching up his 19th first-class hundred and third this season.

Jackson and Jani were looking good before Gujarat bounced back with medium-pacer Roosh Kalaria sending both the batsmen back to the pavilion.

He first trapped Jani in front of the wicket and then got Jackson to edge to Parthiv as Saurashtra slipped to 266 for seven.

Jackson and Jani added 103 run wicket for the sixth wicket.

Prerak Mankad (15) and Dharmendrasinh Jadeja (15) ensured the hosts didn't lose any further wicket till lunch. Saurashtra took lunch at 290 for seven.

After lunch, Gujarat bowlers wrapped up the tail as Saurashtra lost three wickets for seven runs.

Pacer Arzan Nagaswalla (5/81) grabbed a five-for, while Axar Patel took three wickets and Roosh Kalaria bagged two.

However, Saurashtra pacers reduced Gujarat to one for 2 after Unadkat sent Priyank Panchal (0) in the first over and in the second over Chetan Sakariya cleaned up Samit Gohel (1).

Then, Dhruv Raval (35) and Bhargav Merai (13) tried to steady the ship, but the latter was dismissed when he offered a sitter to Jackson off Prerak Mankad, as the visitors slipped to 37 for three.

Raval, too, was unable to convert his start as he became Unadkat's second victim with Gujarat in deep trouble at 58 for four.

Dharmendrasinh Jadeja then struck twice and got the prize wicket of Parthiv (27) as Gujarat had lost half the side for 95. It soon became 97 for six when Jadeja sent back Chirag Gandhi for a zero.

192,02-3-20,Turkish forces down Syrian planes over Idlib: monitor,"Turkish forces downed two Syrian war planes over northwest Syria Sunday, a war monitor said, after Ankara announced a cross-border military operation there.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the two Sukhoi jets fell in regime-held territory, likely after being targeted by Turkish F-16 planes.

Syrian state news agency SANA said Turkish forces “targeted” two of its planes over northwest Syria.

Since December, Russia-backed regime forces have led a military offensive against the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib, where Turkey supports some rebel groups.

Turkey’s defence ministry also reported the downings Sunday, but did not confirm who was responsible.

“Two SU-24 regime planes that were attacking our aircraft have been downed,” it said.

Youssef Hammoud, a spokesman for the National Syrian Army — a pro-Turkish group — said two Sukhoi 24 planes were brought down, also without saying who was responsible.

194,02-3-20,"Peace, but not at our cost: Afghan women fear Taliban return","As US troops prepare to leave Afghanistan, opening the door for a potential Taliban comeback, women across the war-torn country are nervous about losing their hard-won freedoms in the pursuit of peace.

The militants were in power for around five years until the US invasion of 2001. They ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist that turned women into virtual prisoners under a strict interpretation of sharia law.

The Taliban’s fall transformed women’s lives, much more so in urban areas like Kabul than in conservative rural Afghanistan.

But across the country, women remain wary of the insurgents, desperate to see an end to the violence, but fearful of paying a heavy price.

Under the Taliban, women were barred from seeking education or work -- rights that Afghan female professionals are fiercely protective of today.

In the western city of Herat, saleswoman Setara Akrimi, 32, told AFP: “I will be very happy if peace comes and the Taliban stop killing our people.” “But if the Taliban come back to power... With their old mentality, it is a matter of concern for me,” the divorced mother of three added.

“If they tell me to sit at home, I will not be able to support my family,” she said.

“There are thousands of women like me in Afghanistan, we are all worried.”

Akrimi’s anxieties are echoed by Kabul-based veterinarian Tahera Rezai, who believes “the arrival of the Taliban will affect women’s right to work, freedom and independence”. “There has been no change in their mentality,” the 30-year-old told AFP. Passionate about her career, Rezai said she was pessimistic about her prospects if the insurgents return to government, even in a truncated capacity.

“Looking at their history, I feel less hopeful... I believe the situation will get harder for working women like me,” she said. In the run-up to the US deal, the militants made a vague commitment to respect women’s rights in line with “Islamic values”, prompting warnings from activists that the pledge was mere lip service and open to broad interpretation.

The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and while they now allow girls to attend primary school in some areas, occasional reports of floggings and even the public stoning of women persist, fuelling fears they will turn back the clock if they return to power.

Many ordinary Afghans are struggling to balance their desire for peace with their dread of the insurgents.

“Every family here is grieving because they have lost their children, sons, husbands, brothers in the war,” government official Torpekay Shinwari told AFP in eastern Nangarhar province, which witnessed fierce battles between the Taliban and the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate.

The 46-year-old said she was praying for peace, but was increasingly concerned that “women would be looked upon as the second sex and suppressed” if the militants gain ground. But in Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, schoolgirl Parwana Hussaini struck a rare optimistic note.

“I am not worried. Who are the Taliban? They are our brothers,” the 17-year-old told AFP.

“We are all Afghans and want peace.”

Furthermore, she added: “The young generation has changed, and will not allow the Taliban to enforce their old ideology upon us.”

For those who bore the brunt of the insurgents’ merciless rule, however, there is little doubt that a Taliban comeback will bring anything other than a repeat of “dark and painful memories”. Factory worker Uzra, from the mainly Shiite Hazara ethnic minority, sobbed as she recounted life as a young mother, alone at home with her children when the Sunni-fundamentalist Taliban arrived in her village.

“I still vividly remember the day... They massacred all the men, and then came to my house,” the 40-year-old said, too frightened to give her full name.

The militants threatened to behead her then three-year-old daughter, she told AFP from her home in central Bamiyan province. The family survived and fled to Pakistan, but her husband was disabled and traumatised by the brutal beatings he suffered. “To this day, when the word ‘Taliban’ comes up, he starts crying,” she said. “Everybody wants peace, but not if the Taliban returns. I don’t want this so-called peace.” AFP",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/peace--but-not-at-our-cost--afghan-women-fear-taliban-return.html
195,02-3-20,"No, it’s not normal","Actor Taapsee Pannu says that Thappad will show you things that are taken for granted in a relationship. By Team Viva

Bas ek thappad, lekin nahi maar sakta.” (only one slap, but he cannot beat me) This line from the film Thappad questions the normalisation of such instances in our society.

Domestic violence — physical, sexual, verbal and emotional — cannot be justified. But a significant population of women often find themselves at its receiving end. One might question why do they continue with such toxic relationships, but the answers are certainly too complex to understand.

What made you go for the role?

As an actor, some characters set you free and some suffocate you. It was latter for me with Amrita, my character in Thappad. Her righteousness and maturity to handle every situation helped me grow as a person and an actor but a determination deep inside and an infectious calmness on the outside was suffocating at times.

Your films have mostly been upfront about women’s safety. How challenging it is to work on such issues that openly challenge patriarchy?

I have understood the meaning of the word “patriarchy” in recent years. For instance, if your father says you cannot go out, you don’t question that. Your mother may agree with you but she is just running the house and it does not matter much to her. You have to be in the house by 8 pm because guys can’t control themselves, so you have to take charge of being safe from them.

When a film is made on such a topic, people listen to you, they may agree or disagree but atleast listen. In this fast-paced life people usually don’t have the time to address such issues. So if you have been given that kind of power, then you should use it in the right direction.

How do you think the film explores the grey areas of a relationship?

Thappad will make you see things that are taken for granted in a relationship. There is a dialogue in the film which says “I can suddenly see all the unfair things which I did not notice earlier.” So it gives you a trigger initially and then you notice things that were taken for granted.

Usually, what happens is, there is an abusive husband and a wife who tolerates this abuse valiantly because at the end, it is all about getting a meethi, adrak waali chai from him. He might get drunk and thrash her at night but in the morning everything gets back to normal with a “sorry” because it wasn’t done consciously.

In the trailer, it can be seen that the mother and mother-in-law of your character do not approve the idea of divorce... What’s your take on this?

I don’t have a take on this.

Usually, such violence (ek thappad) are normalised in our society. Why do you think people ignore it? Or even if they try to take it seriously, a small act of love is looked at as compensation.

Women are often told to “tolerate” and are expected to behave more patiently than men in a given situation. But violence is violence and you shouldn’t tolerate it at all. Staying in a toxic relationship isn’t acceptable.

As much as your roles have been versatile, they have been standalone in giving a strong message...How do you choose your scripts?

I only choose scripts that I feel will emerge as hits. I always look at a film from the perspective of the audience. I ask myself, will the audience feel that this particular film is worth their money and time? If I feel positive about it, only then I sign it.

Do you think artistes have a responsibility towards society? How?

Yes, an artiste should be responsible when it comes to portraying various roles on screen. The impact a film makes on the audience should not be taken lightly. The audience response reflects the mindset of the society at large.

Do you feel the pressure of putting across the right content on social media as you have evolved as a youth icon?

I want to better myself for myself and not because I will get more likes on Instagram. I’ve heard horror stories of girls trying to ape an actress’ picture just to get more likes. For some people, it is all about the number of likes they get.

Despite making a mark with varied roles in films such as Kalyug, Traffic Signal, Go Goa Gone and now Malang, actor Kunal Kemmu says he mostly gets offers to do comedy, thanks to his roles in the Golmaal series. The actor says he has much more to offer as a performer.

“I can’t say that I am underrated, but I am underutilised for sure as an actor. I know that I am capable of doing so much as a performer. I have so much to offer. I have more potential than what the audience has seen in the films that I have done so far. Or maybe my fans who like my work believe that I am versatile as an actor. But that is not how the filmmakers and casting directors are seeing me,” he said.

Currently, the actor is busy shooting the new season of the ZEE5 web series Abhay 2.

‘As an actor, I am quite instinctive and do not over-prepare before shooting. When it comes to Neeraj (Pandey), there is a blind faith. I know that I am in good hands. From the script to character graph, everything is designed by him. He is clear with exactly what he wants from an actor and later how he will utilise it during editing, to create a magical narrative out of the material. I just follow his instructions.’

—Divya Dutta

Actor Isha Koppikar has bagged the lead role opposite Neil Nitin Mukesh in the forthcoming, yet to be titled, web show. She will be seen playing the role of an inspector.

“It's a cat and mouse game where there is an intellectually stimulating chase equally juggled between the protagonist and the antagonist, both of whom are equally intelligent. The content is captivating and has many layers to it. Somehow the thriller genre has always excited me and the cop role is something that comes very naturally to me,” she said.

Daniel won’t play Harry Potter again

Actor Daniel Radcliffe continues to take up projects that give him a chance to move away from Hogwarts. He has now opened up on why he won’t be reprising his role as the young wizard, Harry Potter, anytime soon.

Asked if he would return as Harry Potter in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them films, Radcliffe said, “I don’t think so. I don’t like to say no to things but it’s not something that I’m rushing to do. I feel like those films have moved on and they’re doing just fine without us. I’m happy to keep it that way. I like what my life is now.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-03-02.html

198,02-3-20,Just do it,"Pankaj Kumar Singh shares a few tips that can help students fight exam stress

Being a part of the educational sector, you come across thousands of students who appear for board examination. Only some pass it with flying colours and a few with the feeling of satisfaction. As you move ahead in life and become more experienced, the count of these examinations keeps on increasing. However, there is one thing that stays constant in most of students — the fear of board and competitive examination. Parents, relatives, neighbours and even teachers have already made a fuss about it. These exams have always been a self-proclaimed ‘acid test’ for students to prove their mettle. So it is very natural to have the element of fear. It’s just an emotion like any other. But they cannot let this feeling overpower their minds, which later, can affect their results. It’s a fact that even extraordinary students perform badly if they are under pressure. Students may not acknowledge it but exams can trigger stress, which stops them from putting their best foot forward. Hence, it’s important to address the issue and get it back under control. But the question is that ‘How can they overcome the fear?’ Well, here are a few tips which can help fight the exam fever:

Talk: Students must talk about their fear with family and friends. Ask them how did they do it, how did they manage? They will tell you their experiences, which can help you in reducing the fear factor. Spending good time with them can make you relaxed.

Listen to music: They say music is an expressive therapeutic tool that can help students improve their physical and mental health. It relaxes the mind and has a functional effect on the brain. So take time out and listen to your favourite song.

Do activities: Exam doesn’t mean that you stop doing your favourite activity. Dance on the beats you want to, cook if you like, play your favourite game or start doodling. Doing things you love are the best stress busters. But don’t get too involved.

Minimise the usage of Mobile phone: Phones keep you busy for longer hours. Children are addicted to their phones. Parents must monitor the usage. Sacrificing your phone for a few days will not harm you. Experts suggest no screens for at least one hour before bedtime, so consider having your child turn in their phone in the evening.

Practise: You panic when you don’t know things. So try to learn before hand and revise. Practise last five year question papers. They give you a clear vision about the pattern of the exam paper and the weightage of each chapter. Practice them thoroughly and the board exams will not be a shock for you.

Motivate Yourself: “Nothing is impossible, even the word impossible says ‘I m possible’. Keep this quote in mind and you can touch the skies. Put motivating play cards and posters in your room or near you study table. Whenever your eyes will go through it, you will be filled with positivity. And yes, this actually works.

Don’t let expectations exert pressure: Your parents or your well wishers always want you to do your best. They want a bright future for you. But don’t let these expectations to turn in unwanted pressure. Do things at your pace.

Balanced Diet: Diet also becomes an important aspect during exams. Eating more sweets and oily things will make you sleepy and can also lead to acidity. It can make you restless. So eat right and stay fit. Drink some herbal tea or a hot chocolate. It’s a well known fact that hot drinks are known to soothe the soul (avoid too much caffeine).

Don’t worry about the results: Results are important but it does not decide your future. While preparing for exams never think about the results. Just concentrate on your preparation process. Scoring good or low marks can never give you the assurance of success.

Last Day, Last Minute: Don’t read new things at the last moment instead revise the ones on which you have good command already. Make short notes and write important formulas on a paper and just quickly go through it before the exam. Always try and reach before time on the day of exam.

Remember, this is not the first exam you have given and it wouldn’t be the last one. Chris Hardwick has once said, “No human ever became interesting by not failing. The more you fail and recover and improve, the better you are as a person. Ever meet someone who’s always had everything work out for them with zero struggle? They usually have the depth of a puddle. Or they don’t exist.” So, it does not matter if you fail, all that matters is the courage of trying.

199,02-3-20,B'desh beat Zim by record margin,"A century from Liton Das and a clinical bowling effort helped Bangladesh thrash Zimbabwe by 169 runs in the first ODI between the two sides on Sunday. Liton’s 126 off 105 balls helped Bangladesh set up a total of 321/6. In response, Zimbabwe folded for 152 in 39.1 overs in Sylhet.

The visitors lost their first wicket in the second over with Mohammad Saifuddin bowling over Zimbabwe opener Tinashe Kamumhunkamwe. They lost a total of four wickets within the first 15 overs after which Wesley Madhevere and Sikandar Raza held the hosts off for nearly 10 overs. Their fifth wicket stand of 35 was the highest for Zimbabwe and was broken when Raza got a top edge to a short delivery from Mustafizuir Rahman that flew straight into the hands of Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza.

Zimbabwe’s last four wickets added 48 runs which helped them reach 150.

Earlier, opener Liton led the way with his second ODI ton as the Bangladesh top order got the hosts off to a flier. However, the humidity eventually got to him and he had to eventually retire hurt at 126 in the 37th over.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/b-desh-beat-zim-by-record-margin.html
200,02-3-20,Will show them when they come to India: Kohli to teammates,"India skipper Virat Kohli is always in the news, be it for his swashbuckling batting or his on-field antics. And this time round he has been heard telling his teammates that they will show the Kiwis their place when they tour India.

With New Zealand looking comfortable while chasing India's total on the third morning, the Indian skipper was heard shouting to his teammates: ""Jab India mein yeh log aayengey, tab dikha doonga (When they will come to India, we will show them).""

The statement sparked controversey as fans felt it was not a true gesture as a sportsman.

Kohli also had a fiery exchange with a journalist who asked him to tone down his aggression following India's crushing defeat in the second and final Test at the Hagley Oval.

India lost the Christchurch Test by seven wickets on Monday, thus suffering from their first-ever whitewash under Kohli and in the post-match presser, the Indian skipper was asked about his on-field antics during the match which didn't go down too well with the 31-year-old cricketer.

Kohli was seen giving an angry send-off to Kiwi batters and animatedly celebrating the fall of wickets during the first two sessions on the second day. On one particular instance, Kohli was even seen using an expletive towards the crowd.

One of the journalists asked Kohli: ""Virat, what's your reaction to your behaviour on the field, swearing at (Kane) Williamson when he got out, swearing at the crowd. As an Indian captain, don't you think you should set a better example on the field?""

The Indian skipper got riled up with the question and told the reporter: ""I am asking you the answer.""

""You need to find out exactly what happened and then come up with a better question, I have spoken with the match referee, you cannot come here with half knowledge. Thank you.""

This was not the first time that Kohli lost his cool in press conferences after India defeats.

After the first Test as well where India lost by 10 wickets in Wellington, Kohli -- while replying about India's batting failures -- had said that there are a lot of people who want to get into their head knowing they are a side ""who can beat anyone anywhere"" by making ""too much out of"" loss at the Basin Reserve.

In 2018, he had lashed out at a journalist after the 1-4 Test series defeat in England.

201,02-3-20,Dhoni gets rousing reception in CSK's first training session,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday received a rousing reception at the the M A Chidambaram Stadium here during his first training session with Chennai Super Kings ahead of his much-anticipated return to action in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Dhoni returned to training amid never-ending speculation on his career, which has been on hold since last year''s ODI World Cup.

Chants of ""Dhoni, Dhoni...."" were heard as he entered the M A Chidambaram Stadium and he obliged his fans with some big hits during the net session.

A few hundred fans gathered to watch the CSK players as they began practice for the forthcoming IPL, which begins on March 29.

The talismanic 38-year-old wicket-keeper batsman, who led India to two world titles, got down to work with some other team members. CSK's full camp will begin on March 19.

After jogging around for a while and doing some stretching, Dhoni put on his pads and launched a few big hits in his trademark style.

Dhoni has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand last year and has maintained a stoic silence on what his next move would be. He was dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players in January.

Among other CSK players who were part of the training on Monday were Ambati Rayudu, Murali Vijay, new recruit Piyush Chawla, Karn Sharma and local boys R Sai Kishore and N Jagadeesan.

This year's IPL begins with CSK taking on defending champions Mumbai Indians in Mumbai on March 29.

The three-time IPL champions had picked up veteran leggie Chawla, Australian pacer Josh Hazelwood, England all-rounder Sam Curran and left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore during the players' auction held in December last year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-gets-rousing-reception-in-csk-s-first-training-session-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-gets-rousing-reception-in-csk-s-first-training-session.html

203,02-3-20,No reasons to refer Article 370 matter to larger seven-judge bench: SC,"New Delhi, Mar 2 (PTI) The Supreme Court Monday declined to refer to a larger 7-judge bench a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Centre's decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 on August 5 last year.

A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said there were no reasons to refer the matter to a larger bench.

NGO, People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association and an intervenor had sought referring of the matter to a larger bench on the ground that two judgements of the apex court -- Prem Nath Kaul versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1959 and Sampat Prakash versus Jammu and Kashmir in 1970 -- which dealt with the issue of Article 370 were conflicted each other and therefore, the current bench of five judges could not hear the issue.

Disagreeing with the petitioners, the bench, also comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said it was of the opinion that ""there is no conflict between the judgements"".

""The plea of the counsel (of PUCL, the bar association and the intervenor) to refer the present matter to a larger bench on this ground is, therefore, rejected,"" the top court.

The apex court also did not agree with the contention that judgement in the Prem Nath Kaul case was not considered by the top court in its subsequent verdict in the Sampat Prakash matter.

The petitioners had contended that as decision in the Kaul case was not considered in the subsequent judgement, the latter verdict was ""per incuriam"" or wrongly decided.

The bench said, ""At the cost of repetition, we note that the rule of per incuriam being an exception to the doctrine of precedents is only applicable to the ratio of the judgment. The same having an impact on the stability of the legal precedents must be applied sparingly, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the opinions of two co-­ordinate benches.

""However, as indicated above there are no contrary observations made in the Sampat Prakash case to that of Prem Nath Kaul, accordingly, the case of Sampat Prakash is not per incuriam.""

The apex court further said that ""in light of the aforesaid discussion, we do not see any reason to refer these petitions to a larger bench on the questions considered"".

A number of petitions have been filed in the apex court including those of private individuals, lawyers, activists and political parties and they have also challenged the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which splits J&K into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

After the order was pronounced, some of the lawyers appearing in the matter requested the bench to fix a date for hearing of the main matter.

The bench said that schedule of hearing on the batch of petitions challenging the validity of abrogation of provision of Article 370 would depend on the hearing by a 9-judge bench in the Sabarimala case, which is expected to start after the Holi break.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-reasons-to-refer-article-370-matter-to-larger-seven-judge-bench--sc-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/no-reasons-to-refer-article-370-matter-to-larger-seven-judge-bench--sc.html

207,02-3-20,India lose initiative,"India’s top-order frittered away a golden chance with another shoddy batting show as New Zealand regained complete control of the second Test after Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah’s hostile fast-bowling spell had given the visitors a slender first-innings lead here on Sunday.

Shami (4/81 in 23.1 overs) and Bumrah (3/62 in 22 overs) were brilliant in their execution, dismissing New Zealand for 235 in 73.1 overs as they showed why they are one of deadliest fast bowling pair in Test match cricket.

However, India’s top-order failed miserably once again as New Zealand bounced back, reducing India to 90 for six in their second innings at stumps on day two as a third day finish is on the cards.

India is now effectively 97 runs ahead with only four wickets in hand and it will take a herculean effort to avert another series whitewash after the ODIs.

Trent Boult (3/12 in 9 overs) got Mayank Agarwal (3) and Cheteshwar Pujara (24) with conventional inswingers that tails into right-handers.

Prithvi Shaw (14) was out in familiar fashion, fending a short ball from Tim Southee, while skipper Virat Kohli's (14) indecisive footwork brought his downfall once again.

Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, who was hit on the helmet, paid the price for an ugly shot, while Umesh Yadav expectedly didn’t survive a rampaging Boult after he was inexplicably sent in as nightwatchman when nearly half an hour was left.

A target of 250 in the fourth innings could well be a challenge for the Black Caps as there is still something in the track for the speed merchants despite batsmen getting a value for their shots.

India would have ideally hoped that skipper Kohli would end his dreadful tour of New Zealand with one big knock but it was not to be as Colin de Grandhomme trapped him leg before with an off-cutter.

No wonder Trent Boult was happy having kept Kohli quiet.

In the morning, the first two sessions belonged to Shami and Bumrah, who were nothing short of brilliant with their precision length, sideways movement and an occasional heavy ball that was slipped in between.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-lose-initiative.html
208,02-3-20,Bengaluru eke out narrow win,"Defending champions Bengaluru FC registered a narrow 1-0 win over ATK in the first leg of their Hero Indian Super League semi-final clash at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Sunday.

Deshorn Brown's opportunistic strike (31st minute) proved to be the difference in what was a closely-fought first leg battle.

ATK’s dangerous duo, Roy Krishna and David Williams, combined well to put the ball into the net in the 17th minute. Krishna found his teammate with a well-timed lob in behind the Blues defence. Williams handled the ball as he brought it down and struck it brilliantly past Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, but the goal was eventually disallowed due to the handball.

The hosts continued to put pressure on the ATK defence and their effort bore fruit a minute after the half an hour mark.

Gurpreet’s punt from his own half ended up at the feet of Juanan whose shot from inside the box was hit straight at Arindam Bhattacharya. The ATK custodian messed up the save and spilt the ball into the path of Deshorn Brown, who broke the deadlock.

Bengaluru suffered a late blow when Nishu Kumar was sent off for a tug on Krishna. The Fijian striker was brought down outside the box by the full-back and the latter's last-man challenge was punished by the referee.

ATK, however, were unable to force an equaliser and now have to come from behind in the reverse leg in Kolkata next Sunday",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bengaluru-eke-out-narrow-win.html
209,02-3-20,Three times 7,"Duvan Zapata scored a hat-trick as Atalanta destroyed lowly Lecce 7-2 on Sunday to strengthen their grip on the Champions League spots in a Serie A weekend ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak.

Eleven days after they thrashed Valencia in their last match Gian Pier Gasperini’s side showed why they are considered one of the most exciting teams in Europe with a breathtaking second half display that blitzed their promoted opponents.

The teams went into the break level as Lecce defender Giulio Donati made it 2-2 in the 40th minute.

However the second period was one-way traffic once Josip Ilicic classily slotted home his side’s third, and Zapata — who headed home Atalanta’s second midway through the first half — completed his treble with two goals in eight minutes to seal the three points.

Luis Muriel then made it six with three minutes left when he scored on the rebound after his own shot bounced out off the post, and Ruslan Malinovskyi completed the rout in stoppage time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/three-times-7.html
210,02-3-20,City retain League Cup,"Manchester City won their fifth EFL Cup in the past seven seasons with a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday.

Sergio Aguero’s goal got the defending champions up and running, with Rodri heading in a controversial second from a corner that should not have been given.

Mbwana Samatta’s diving header got Villa back in the contest ahead of the break but City dominated the second half before surviving an almighty late scare.

Having been on the back foot, Villa came close to a last-gasp leveller as Bjorn Engels forced Claudio Bravo into a fine save, tipping his header onto the post as City won the trophy for a third year in a row.

This trophy formed part of a historic domestic treble in the last campaign and City’s hopes of FA Cup success are still alive, even if their Premier League title defence has been left in tatters by a Liverpool side who suffered a shock loss to Watford on Saturday.

If City are to collect another hat-trick of trophies it will also require a maiden Champions League success, with Wednesday’s stunning 2-1 win at Real Madrid raising hopes on that front.

It was eyebrows that were raised when Guardiola's team was announced, showing eight changes from that midweek starting line-up, with Kevin De Bruyne the headline name on the bench.

Villa, who have won the competition five times but not since 1996, made a bright start and Anwar El Ghazi headed narrowly over from Ahmed delivery.

With City having won seven of the last eight matches against Villa, scoring nine goals in this season’s two league fixtures, it was little surprise to see them grow into the contest and Aguero looped a header onto the roof of the net.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/city-retain-league-cup.html
211,02-3-20,Hornets halt Reds run,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp warned his side the Premier League title is not won yet after a 44-game run without defeat in the league came to a crashing end as Watford beat the European champions 3-0 on Saturday.

Klopp's men still enjoy a 22-point lead at the top of the table, but their sluggish return from a two-week winter break earlier this month was finally punished.

Ismaila Sarr's quickfire double and Troy Deeney's strike 18 minutes from time ended Liverpool's hopes of romping to a first league title in 30 years with an unbeaten season.

""What the boys did so far is exceptional but it is not over,"" said Klopp.

""We did not expect the number of games we won. It was never easy and it will never be easy, so now let's carry on.""

After single-goal victories over struggling Norwich and West Ham either side of a Champions League defeat at Atletico Madrid, Liverpool were comprehensively beaten at Vicarage Road.

A 55-point gap separated the sides before kick-off, but the out-of-sorts visitors failed to muster even a single effort on goal in the first 45 minutes.

Watford's bright start threatened to be blown off course when Gerard Deulofeu had to stretchered off with a nasty looking knee injury that seems certain to end his season.

Andy Robertson's driven effort finally forced Ben Foster into a save early in the second half, but just as Liverpool were beginning to build up a head of steam, they were stung by two quick strikes by Sarr.

Firstly, the Senegalese beat Robertson to Abdoulaye Doucoure's low cross to stab home at the near post.

Six minutes later, Sarr had too much pace for a flat-footed Liverpool defence as he raced onto Deeney's through ball and showed fantastic composure to lift the ball over the advancing Alisson Becker.

Sarr also had a big part to play in Watford's third as he pounced on a short passback and had the vision to pick out Deeney, who lofted the ball nonchalantly over Alisson to make it 3-0.

""It's not acceptable we lose 3-0 here,"" said Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk. ""We want to strike back straight away.""

WOLVES COMEBACK

Raul Jimenez boosted Wolves' bid to qualify for the Champions League as his late winner capped the visitors' dramatic fightback in their 3-2 victory at Tottenham on Sunday.

Nuno Espirito Santo's side trailed twice in north London, but hit back from 2-1 down thanks to second half goals from Diogo Jota and Jimenez.

Wolves moved two points above Tottenham into sixth place in the Premier League.

As it stands, finishing fifth could lead to a Champions League place, owing to second placed Manchester City's European ban, against which they are appealing.

Sitting level on points with fifth placed Manchester United and just three behind fourth placed Chelsea, Wolves are firmly in the hunt for an unexpected berth in Europe's elite club competition.

They fell behind to Steven Bergwijn's first half opener, but Matt Doherty equalised and even Serge Aurier restoring Tottenham's lead couldn't knock Wolves out of their stride.

It was a bitter blow for injury-hit Tottenham, who suffered three consecutive defeats in all competitions for the first time this season.

Elsewhere at Goodison Park, Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti was sent off after approaching the referee as yet more VAR controversy contributed to a fiery finish in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United.

Goalkeeping errors by both United's David De Gea and Everton's Jordan Pickford were central to the outcome.

But Everton thought they had won the game in stoppage time when a shot from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who had opened the scoring, deflected off United's Harry Maguire and into the net.

The goal, however, was ruled out by the video assistant referee with the offside Gylfi Sigurdsson, lying in the path of De Gea, deemed to have obstructed the view of the keeper.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hornets-halt-reds-run-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hornets-halt-reds-run.html
212,02-3-20,Siriwardena shines on Sri Lanka swansong,"Shashikala Siriwardena produced the perfect swansong to her international career by taking four wickets in Sri Lanka's ICC Women's T20 World Cup victory over Bangladesh here on Monday.

Siriwardena's World Cup best and Achini Kulasuriya's two for 19 saw Bangladesh slip up in their final match of the tournament.

Hasini Perera's 39 not out helped to seal Sri Lanka's first victory by nine wickets with 27 balls to spare.

Siriwardena's figures were the best in the tournament to date in her final international match, with her four for 16 a memorable farewell after 17 years of service to Sri Lankan cricket.

She started her swansong just as she would have hoped, removing Murshida Khatun for three when Hasini Perera caught the opener off a top edge.

Her replacement Sanjida Islam (13) didn't last long as Kulasuriya took a wicket on the first ball of her spell before trapping Ayasha Rahman (6) lbw to finish her first over with figures of two for two.

Held at 26 for three at the end of the Powerplay, Bangladesh struggled to find any rhythm with the bat as Nigar Sultana Joty (39) and Fargana Hoque Pinky (13) could only take the score on the board to 39 by the midway point.

Sri Lanka continued to bowl economical overs, with Kavisha Dilhari conceding two from her first over before taking her first wicket as she removed Fargana lbw for 13.

Siriwardena took her second scalp of the afternoon when Udeskika Prabodani caught Rumana Ahmed at short fine leg for a duck and added a third when Ritu Moni was caught in the ring by Sugandika Kumari for eight.

Fahima Khatun was dismissed in the same fashion in the penultimate over for one, while Nigar Sultana was run out by Chamari Athapaththu having scored five boundaries in Bangladesh's 91 for eight.

A wicket maiden from captain Salma Khatun in the first over started Bangladesh off well but they were left rueing a crucial wicket when Fargana dropped Athapaththu at mid-off in the second over.

And the skipper's 51-run opening partnership with Hasini Perera set Sri Lanka well on their way in the 92-run chase, both batters finding two boundaries - and Athapaththu a six - in the Powerplay.

The captain looked to be finding her groove when she blasted another six over Rumana at the boundary in the eighth but was removed on the next ball when stumped off Nahida Akter.

That scalp proved the perfect 20th-birthday present for Nahida, who became the youngest female bowler to 50 T20I wickets.

After their flying start Sri Lanka were slowed by Bangladesh's bowlers but Perera's 39 not out sealed the nine-wicket victory as they bowed out on a high.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/siriwardena-shines-on-sri-lanka-swansong-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/siriwardena-shines-on-sri-lanka-swansong.html
213,02-3-20,Sandhu finishes 37th in NZ Open,"Australia's Brad Kennedy returned to winning ways with a stunning eight-under-par 63 while Indian golfer Ajeetesh Sandhu finished Tied-37th in the New Zealand Open here.

Kennedy won New Zealand's prestigious National Open in 2011 and he held aloft its prized trophy for the second time after overcoming a two-shot deficit to pip compatriot Lucas Herbert with a winning total of 21-under-par 264 at the Millbrook Resort on Sunday.

Sandhu finished with a brace of birdies on way to a three-under 68 that gave him a total of six-under and a T-37 finish, while colleague Viraj Madappa (73) had his third over par round in four days for a total of three-over and a finish of T-72.

Korean teenager Joohyung Kim could not find his putting touch on the final day and had to settle for outright fourth place after signing off with a 70.

Herbert, who won the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour in January, was seemingly in control of winning his second title in two months.

However, a costly double-bogey on 13 pegged him back momentarily before he battled back gallantly with three straight birdies from the 15th hole. Standing on the 18th tee, Herbert still had a chance to at least force a play-off with Kennedy but hit his shot into the water, which effectively cost him the title.

Herbert's closing bogey meant he would end the week in second place, two shots ahead of fellow countryman Nick Flanagan, who finished in third place.

Having started so promisingly and leading for three rounds, the 17-year-old Korean Joohyung marked his card with five birdies and four bogeys.

Thailand's Pavit Tangkamolprasert finished 11th after carding 69 on the final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sandhu-finishes-37th-in-nz-open-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sandhu-finishes-37th-in-nz-open.html
214,02-3-20,Nirbhaya case: SC dismisses curative petition of death row convict Pawan Gupta,"The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the curative petition filed by Pawan Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

A five-judge bench headed by Justice N V Ramana, which considered the curative plea in-chamber, also rejected Pawan's application seeking stay on the execution of death sentence which is scheduled for Tuesday.

""The application for oral hearing is rejected. The application for stay of execution of death sentence is also rejected. The curative petition is dismissed...,"" the bench, also comprising Justices Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan, said.

In his curative plea, Pawan had sought commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment.

He had also sought a stay on the execution of black warrant issued by the trial court for the hanging.

The trial court had on February 17 issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for Tuesday at 6 am for the four convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) -- in the case.

The mercy petitions of three convicts -- Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay -- have already been dismissed by the President.

The apex court had earlier dismissed separate pleas filed by Mukesh and Vinay challenging the rejection of their mercy petitions by the President.

While Akshay has not yet challenged the rejection of his mercy petition, Pawan has not yet filed a mercy plea before the President.

On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ''Nirbhaya'' (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana, while reserving judgement on Pawan's fresh plea to stay the death warrant for Tuesday morning, rapped the convict's lawyer for acting so late in filing the curative and mercy pleas.

Pawan's curative plea was rejected by the Supreme Court earlier in the day.

The court had earlier in the day dismissed Pawan's and Akshay Kumar Singh's applications for staying their death warrants.

However, Pawan's lawyer, A P Singh, said he has filed a mercy plea and execution ought to be stayed. The court, thereafter, asked him to come post lunch to argue his case.

In the post-lunch hearing, the court pulled up Singh saying, ""You are playing with fire, you should be cautious"" and added ""one wrong move by anybody, and you know the consequences"".

Tihar authorities, during the hearing, said the ball is in the government's court, after filing of the mercy petition, and the judge has no role for now.

They said the President will seek a status report from the jail on Pawan's mercy plea and when that happens, it will suo motu stay the execution.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--court-to-pronounce-order-shortly-on-pawan-s-plea-to-stay-execution-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--court-to-pronounce-order-shortly-on-pawan-s-plea-to-stay-execution.html

The opposition party's assertion came soon after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day. The House was earlier adjourned thrice with members from the BJP and the Congress pushing and shoving each other amid the Opposition's protests against last week's communal violence in Delhi, which has claimed over 40 lives.

The Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, said ""democracy was torn to shreds"" and alleged that a ruling party MP assaulted one of the Congress' Dalit women MPs in the Lok Sabha.

He said the Congress will continue to protest in Parliament and it is the party's duty to uncover the ""conspiracy"" behind the Delhi violence.

Earlier, the Rajya Sabha was also adjourned for the day on Monday following uproar by Opposition parties over the violence in the national capital, with members accusing the government of ""sleeping"" while Delhi burnt.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong-s-duty-to-uncover--conspiracy--behind-delhi-riots--adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cong-s-duty-to-uncover--conspiracy--behind-delhi-riots--adhir-ranjan-chowdhury.html
217,02-3-20,"Cong, BJP members scuffle in LS as Oppn protests against Delhi violence, demands Shah's resignation","BJP and Congress members pushed and shoved each other in Lok Sabha on Monday as opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah.

Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice till 4.30 pm amid continuing ruckus. Speaker Om Birla said that he was pained by what has happened during the day, before adjourning the House till Tuesday.

As soon as the House met at 2 pm, opposition members started raising slogans from the Well against the government.

They went into the area of treasury benches carrying a black banner, which demanded Shah's resignation, as Speaker Om Birla took up the listed business.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi condemned their ""unruly behaviour"" and asked the Speaker to continue with proceedings.

Joshi alleged that ""these are the people"" who have provoked the riots. ""They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no investigation. The priority is to restore peace... But they want to create tension,"" he said.

Seeking to restore normalcy in the House, Birla asked opposition members who were in the Well to take their seats even as they continued to shout ""we want justice"" and ""Amit Shah Murdabad"" (Down with Amit Shah).

They were also holding placards saying ""stop hate speech, save our India"".

Things took a turn for worse as Congress' Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu holding the black banner went to the Treasury benches where BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill.

BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, asked them to return to the Well.

Some Congress members tore papers and hurled them in the air.

The charge by the Congress MPs angered the BJP members, including many from back benches, who rushed towards the Congress members.

Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each other following which the proceedings were adjourned till 3 pm by the Speaker.

Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi were present in the House during the uproar.

When the House reassembled at 3 pm, some BJP members were seen blocking the way to their side of the Well.

Congress member Ramya Haridas complained about being manhandled by BJP members.

BJP's Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House again till 4 pm saying ""whatever you have done is wrong"".

But the ruckus continued when the House again met and it was adjourned till 4.30 pm by the Chair.

However, the slogan-shouting by the BJP members continued.

They chanted slogans like ""Desh ki raksha kaun karega, hum karenge hum karenge (Who will defend the nation, we will do it)"" and ""Mahatma Gandhi amar rahein, nakli Gandhi jail mein rahein (Long live Mahatma Gandhi, fake Gandhis stay in jail)"".

Some Opposition members placed a placard demanding Shah's resignation on the Speaker's table but it was swiftly removed by the staff.

Earlier, Birla asked leaders of oppositions parties to ensure that their members take their respective seats as the ""people of the country are watching (the proceedings)"".

""This is the temple of democracy. There are certain rules and tradition. You should not come to the Well,"" he said.

Birla also said ""as you are responsible representatives of people here, it is your collective responsibility to maintain peace and tranquility.""

As the House met at 4.30 pm, the Speaker said, ""We must maintain decorum in the House. It belongs to every member.

""I am personally pained at the developments in the House. You are not pained. I do not want to run proceedings under such circumstances.... Everybody should deliberate to ensure that the dignity of the House is maintained.""

He said senior members of the House should do their bit to ensure it runs smoothly.

Amid the din, two bills -- The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill and Mineral Laws Amendment Bill-- were introduced.

Also the Direct Tax Vivaad Se Vishwas Bill was moved for consideration and passing.

In the morning, Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm as a mark of respect for sitting JD(U) member Baidyanath Prasad Mahto from Valmiki Nagar in Bihar who died on February 28.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong--bjp-members-scuffle-in-ls-as-oppn-protests-against-delhi-violence--demands-shah-s-resignation-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cong--bjp-members-scuffle-in-ls-as-oppn-protests-against-delhi-violence--demands-shah-s-resignation.html

Around one-fifth of these calls on the emergency 100 and 112 numbers came from Shaheen Bagh in South East Delhi and nearby areas in South Delhi, they said on Monday.

Panic gripped residents across the national capital on Sunday evening following false rumours of violence but the police denied any incident and appealed for calm, days after riots in northeast Delhi claimed at least 42 lives.

""More than 3,000 emergency calls were received at the police control room (PCR) after rumours related to violence started doing rounds in Delhi on Sunday evening. 413 calls were from South East Delhi and 157 from South Delhi,"" a senior police officer said.

Besides the PCR calls, several people from within Delhi as well as outside called up police officials, including officers, directly to verify information about violence breaking out, the officer added.

The rumours prompted senior police officers to come on ground and quell the hoax while also taking to social media to control panic.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation also shut down the entry and exit gates of seven metro stations but did not give any reason. The stations were reopened later.

""Some unsubstantiated reports of tense situation in SouthEast & West District are being circulated on social media. It is to reiterate that these are all rumours. Don't pay attention to such rumours,"" the Delhi police tweeted.

223,02-3-20,Omar Abdullah detained under PSA considering his past conduct: J&K admin to SC,"Jammu and Kashmir administration informed the Supreme Court on Monday that National Conference leader Omar Abdullah has been detained under the Public Safety Act considering his ""past conduct"" and possibility of such conduct being repeated on his release, which may ""prejudice the public order"".

Terming Abdullah as ""a very vocal critic"" of abrogating Article 370, the J&K administration claimed that his acts squarely fell within the realm of public order as it was ""calculated to disturb public peace and tranquility"".

The District Magistrate of Srinagar has said this in his reply filed on a plea by Sara Abdullah Pilot, who has challenged the detention of her brother Omar Abdullah under the provision of the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA).

The J&K administration has said that in the history of independent India the existence and continuance of Article 370 of the Constitution, which used to give special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, has ""always remained a contentious and burning issue"".

""The detenu has been a very vocal critic of any possible abrogation of Article 370 prior to its abrogation on August 5, 2019. It is submitted that considering the very peculiar geo-political position of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and its geographical proximity with Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the concept of 'public order' needs to be examined contextually,"" it said.

It also said that Abdullah should have moved the Jammu and Kashmir High Court to avail his remedy before approaching the apex court.

The matter came up for hearing on Monday before a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for J&K administration, told the bench about the reply filed by the district magistrate.

The bench, which posted the matter for hearing on March 5, said the petitioner can file rejoinder, if any, to it.

In its reply, J&K administration has said that detention of Abdullah was ordered under section 8 of the PSA after being satisfied that it is necessary to detain him with a view ""to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order"".

It also dealt with submissions advanced in Pilot's plea which said that as Abdullah was already under detention since August 5 last year, there was no ground to come to a conclusion that he may act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.

""It is submitted that the said assertion is fallacious and ignores that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the grounds of detention and the dossier clearly indicate that there exists a live and proximate link in the events that occurred in the past, the activities of the detenu (Abdullah) and the possibility of such activities being prejudicial to maintenance of public order,"" it said.

""In light of the above, the deponent states and submits that there was ample material and grounds to issue the impugned order of detention against the detenu considering the past conduct and the possibility of such conduct being repeated on release and thereby prejudicing the public order in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,"" it said.

The reply further said, ""It may not be out of place to mention that so far since 1990, 41,866 persons have lost their lives in 71,038 incidents throughout the erstwhile state of J&K. This includes 14,038 civilians, 5,292 personnel of security forces and 22,536 terrorists.""

It said that J&K High Court is seized of over 350 habeas corpus petitions and pleas challenging the detention orders.

""It is further submitted that the high court is fully functional and has in fact quashed 68 detention orders since August 2019 while confirming 11 detention orders passed by the appropriate authority,"" it said, adding that the petitioner has failed to disclose the reason for not approaching the high court first.

""It is submitted that entertaining one petition would open flood gates of petitions which in absence of any special ground to make a departure, needs to be avoided,"" it said.

Seeking dismissal of the plea for ""bypassing the effective alternative remedy"" available under the PSA, the district magistrate said, ""The detenue has chosen not to file a representation before the advisory board"".

Grounds of detention were supplied to Abdullah to enable him to make an effective representation as stipulated in law, it said, adding that the advisory board had on February 24 observed that there was sufficient cause for his detention.

""It is submitted that the acts, which are easily available in public domain, on the part of the detenu squarely fell within the realm of public order, as it was calculated to disturb public peace and tranquility. It is needless to emphasise that the incitement of the public at large, pertains to public order,"" it said.

It said the detention order is ""not vague or without any material facts"" and such order based on subjective satisfaction of detaining authority cannot be a matter of judicial review.

""The deponent states and submits that invocation of jurisdiction of this court to issue high prerogative writ in the present case is unjustified and unwarranted in as much as the detention of the detenu was neither illegal nor unlawful as alleged in the petition,"" it said.

Pilot has approached the apex court claiming that the detention order was ""manifestly illegal"" and there was no question of him being a ""threat to the maintenance of public order"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-to-hear-on-mar-5-plea-against-detention-of-omar-abdullah-under-psa-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/omar-abdullah-detained-under-psa-considering-his-past-conduct--j-k-admin-to-sc.html

There was also no fresh incident of violence and there is a heavy deployment of security personnel in Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Chand Bagh, Shiv Vihar, Bhajanpura, Yamuna Vihar and Mustafabad.

Authorities maintained that the death toll remains at 42 even as four bodies were fished out of drains in northeast Delhi on Sunday.

Many students appeared for their board exams in northeast Delhi.

The CBSE on Sunday said any further delay in conducting board exams in violence-affected parts of North East Delhi may hamper chances of students in securing admission to professional courses like medical and engineering.

However, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is ready to conduct fresh exams for students who are not able to appear for the board exams as per schedule in view of the violence in northeast Delhi.

230,02-3-20,"HAL to build Apache-like copters, save Rs 4 lakh cr on import","In an ambitious project aimed at boosting self reliance in defence manufacturing, the public sector aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has worked out a detailed proposal to produce attack helicopter in the 10-12 tonne category by 2027, five years ahead of the Indian Air Force’s planned phase out of the bulk of the helicopter fleet comprising the Mi-17 by 2032.

The proposed copters when realised will be comparable to medium-lift military choppers like the Apache of the Boeing.

Chairman and Managing Director of HAL R Madhavan said the aim of the mega project is to stop import of military helicopters, worth over Rs 4 lakh crore, for the three services in the coming years.

This is the biggest project undertaken by the HAL after development of the Tejas military aircraft and the move is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to minimise dependence on import of military hardware.

In an interview to news agency PTI, Madhavan said the HAL has completed the preliminary design of the helicopter and that initial plan is to produce at least 500 units with the first prototype set to be ready by 2023 if the Government gives the go ahead to the project this year.

“One major project we are focusing on is to produce a helicopter in 10 to 12 tonnes category to replace the Mi-17 fleet. It will be an indigenous platform with the potential to manufacture around 500 helicopters. It will stop import of more than Rs 4 lakh crore worth of platforms from foreign countries,” he told the agency.

A fund of Rs 9,600 crore will be required for formulation of the design and production of the prototype of the helicopter, the HAL chief said.

“If we get the approval in 2020, we will be able to manufacture the first chopper by 2027. We are looking at producing at least 500 helicopters of the variant. It will be a major project we are working on,” Madhavan said.

“We have done the preliminary design. We have also been in discussion with the Air Force and the Navy. The 10-12 tonnes category will have two basic structures on similar platforms. The naval version will have different dimension compared to the one for the Army and the Air Force,” Madhavan revealed on the proposed project.

“Like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) we developed from the Dhruv platform, a similar variant of 10-12 tonnes category can be produced to make it an Apache equivalent,” said Madhavan.

The proposed helicopter will boast of twin engines and will feature blade folding option for ship deck operations. The planned roles for the helicopter will be to support aerial assault, air transport, combat logistics and combat search and rescue. The chopper will also have a superior weapons package as per the requirement of the stakeholders.

Once realised, the helicopter will have a huge potential for export, Madhavan said.

The Russian-origin Mi-17 helicopters are mainstay of the IAF’s helicopter fleet and these are planned to be phased out by 2032.

The HAL’s product range includes a number of helicopter like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) and multi-role ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter) and Chetak choppers.

India is one of the largest importers of arms and military platforms globally. The Government has been emphasising defence indigenisation by putting in place a number of reform initiatives including liberalising FDI in defence sector and opening the defence laboratories for conducting various types of tests by the private sector.

The IAF is procuring a total of 22 Apache Guardian attack helicopters from American aerospace major Boeing under a multi-billion dollar deal. The Army is also procuring six Apache helicopters along with weapons systems, a deal for which was inked during US President Donald Trump’s visit to India last week.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hal-to-build-apache-like-copters--save-rs-4-lakh-cr-on-import-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/hal-to-build-apache-like-copters--save-rs-4-lakh-cr-on-import.html
231,02-3-20,UN delegation on Palestine arrives in India to seek support on peaceful resolution of conflict,"A UN delegation on Palestine will visit New Delhi to seek India's political and diplomatic support for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

India, which shares good relations with both Palestine and Israel, believes in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.

The two-state solution envisions independent Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side peacefully. The Palestinians see East Jerusalem as their future capital.

The delegation of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) will meet External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials in the ministry, as well as political leaders and think tanks during the 2-day visit from Monday.

The delegation intends to engage India in looking for ways how it could play a more proactive role in the settling of the question of Palestine, an official statement said.

The visit would also focus to enhance the coordination of the Committee Bureau and India on capacity building projects for Palestine, including within the context of South-South and Triangular Cooperation, it said.

The focus of the visit is on enhancing the political and diplomatic support of India for a peaceful solution of the question of Palestine and engaging Indian counterparts on synergies in capacity building for staff and institutions of Palestine, the statement said.

The delegation will include UN ambassadors and representatives of Senegal (Committee Chair); Indonesia and Malaysia (Committee Members); and the State of Palestine (Committee Observer).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited Israel in July 2017 to commemorate 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, becoming the first Indian Premier to do so.

During his visit to Israel, Modi did not travel to Ramallah. His standalone visit to Israel had led many analysts to question the future of the Indo-Palestine ties.

In February 2018, Modi made a historic visit to Palestine and skipped Israel, in a clear message that India is de-hyphenating its ties with Israel and Palestine.

The CEIRPP was founded on November 10, 1975 by the United Nations General Assembly in order to formulate a programme to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination, to national independence and sovereignty, and the right of Palestine refugees to return.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-delegation-on-palestine-arrives-in-india-to-seek-support-on-peaceful-resolution-of-conflict-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/un-delegation-on-palestine-arrives-in-india-to-seek-support-on-peaceful-resolution-of-conflict.html

Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan cancelled their visits to India in December over prevailing situation following passage of the new citizenship bill.

Bangladesh was also apparently upset following the roll out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam even though India conveyed to it that the issue was an internal matter of the country.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had taken up the issue of NRC with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their bilateral meeting in New York in September.

233,02-3-20,Vegetarians enjoy better sex lives than meat eaters,"Going vegetarian or vegan is a new fad to lose weight and stay healthy but an interesting survey has revealed that vegetarians are best lovers and have more sex than meat eaters.

Not only this, the survey reported by UK-based Hucknall Dispatch said that non-vegetarians are ""selfish in bed and unhappy in their sex lives compared to vegetarians"".

The majority of vegetarians (57 per cent) said they make love three-four times a week compared to most meat eaters who only enjoyed the action between the sheets one-two times a week (49 per cent).

""Nearly 84 per cent of vegetarians report that they are satisfied in their sex lives, compared to only 59 per cent of meat eaters"".

Nearly 500 vegetarians -- of which 38 per cent were vegans -- and 500 non-vegetarian people were surveyed by UK's largest extra-marital portal IllicitEncounters.com to reach this conclusion.

""Vegetarians eat foods that are known for their aphrodisiac properties - Maca, fenugreek leaves, ginseng, aniseed. There is a host of different veggies that are natural aphrodisiacs that promote sexual excitement,"" IllicitEncounters.com's Jessica Leoni was quoted as saying in the report.

Interestingly, 95 per cent of the vegan participants said they were satisfied with their sex lives.

Vegetarians enjoy making out (92 per cent), foreplay (88 per cent) and dirty talk (48 per cent) -- way more than meat eaters (79 per cent, 68 per cent and and 35 per cent, respectively).

Least enjoyable for both vegetarians (26 per cent) and meat eaters (15 per cent) was bondage.

""I just thought it was an age-related thing. Now I'm on a plant based diet, I have more energy and I'm more open to trying out new things,"" Heather, 39, and a vegan was quoted as saying.

Plant-based foods are heavy in zinc and vitamins B, which can increase libido -- bananas, chickpeas and, avocados, in particular, are good for this.

Going vegan can also increase serotonin levels, which can both boost sex drive and increase happiness.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vegetarians-enjoy-better-sex-lives-than-meat-eaters-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/vegetarians-enjoy-better-sex-lives-than-meat-eaters.html
234,02-3-20,EU and UK begin talks on post-Brexit relationship,"With Brexit ""done"" as far as London is concerned, UK and EU negotiators on Monday begin talks aimed at forging a future relationship - while brandishing red lines that may yet prove to be irreconcilable.

The discussions covering trade and trading standards, agriculture, security, transport, energy, fisheries and police cooperation kick off in Brussels under teams run by Frenchman Michel Barnier for the EU and governmental advisor David Frost for Britain.

They take place just over a month since Britain ceased to be an EU member, and are meant to wrap up by the end of this year -- an exceedingly tight timeframe that few see as feasible for anything more than the barest of bare-bones accords.

The UK's current transition period, during which it trades like an EU member with no tariffs or other barriers, ends on December 31. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out extending it, though he has the option to do so.

The negotiations will be clouded by mistrust and weeks of chest-beating leading up to them. Each side has accused the other of shifting away from goals set out in a nonbinding political declaration struck late last year.

Rival mandates published last week highlighted the EU's aim of securing a ""level playing field"" to prevent Britain undercutting costly European standards on labour, tax, environment and state subsidies.

Meanwhile the UK is insisting on setting its own rules in the name of ""economic and political independence"".

Barnier, in an uncharacteristic display of podium-thumping, has told Britain to fully respect the binding Brexit withdrawal treaty.

That, notably, requires checks on British goods crossing the Irish Sea into the UK territory of Northern Ireland, which remains in the orbit of the EU single market.

Johnson has insisted those checks are unnecessary. But senior British ministers and officials confirm London will abide by the terms of the treaty.

Experts say they see a potential landing zone for an agreement on future relations based mainly on trade in goods, but only if both sides give up a little ground from their political rhetoric.

""Clearly, at the beginning of any negotiation, there's a bit of posturing. Both sides want to state the strongest possible case,"" said Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Centre.

The EU demand for parallel standards and the UK's insistence on legal autonomy could be bridged in ways both sides claim as wins, they say.

But fishing -- of relatively minor economic importance but of totemic significance to Britain and EU states such as France and Spain -- could be the flashpoint that scuppers a deal.

Barnier has emphasised that fishing is ""inextricably"" linked to the whole agreement. The EU is demanding its fishing boats continue to have access to British waters in return for British fishermen being able to sell their fresh catches to their biggest and closest market.

That hump has to be resolved by the end of June when both sides are to get together for a stock-taking of the talks, to decide whether it is worth continuing.

If no deal is reached, economic pain will be felt on both sides -- but especially in Britain and in Ireland, the EU member most dependent on trade with the UK.

UN economists calculate the trade hit would see the UK annually lose export revenues of up to 29 billion euros (USD 32 billion) in that case. The EU buys nearly half of all British exports.

Zuleeg said he was ""pessimistic"" about the outcome, because the UK was so strongly emphasising its desire to diverge from EU rules.

""It's very difficult to see where they could meet to make this work,"" he said. If the British government ""stick to their line there cannot be a deal"".

An EU official, speaking to AFP on condition anonymity, warned however that Brussels did not have an alternative negotiating line up its sleeve.

""There is only a Plan A, no Plan B. Because Plan B is to extend the negotiations and we know the British don't want that,"" the official said.

Another analyst, Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at think-tank The UK in a Changing Europe, said the fact that the EU is stressing there will be trade friction even if a deal is done, in the form of checks on goods entering the European single market, means ""the benefits aren't enormous"" for Britain.

Also, Johnson and his government appear ready for British businesses to bear the pain from a no-deal.

""What's very intriguing about this government, and what makes it so hard to judge, is that Johnson is apparently unwilling to take any account of business concerns,"" Rutter told AFP.

The main argument she sees in favour of a deal is that when Johnson decides he really wants to achieve a goal, he goes for it no matter his past positions.

""He's prepared to ditch prior commitments, and he's actually a very good sales person,"" she said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eu-and-uk-begin-talks-on-post-brexit-relationship-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/eu-and-uk-begin-talks-on-post-brexit-relationship.html

236,02-3-20,North Korea fires two unidentified projectiles: South's military,"North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles on Monday, the South's military said, weeks after Pyongyang declared its moratorium on long-range missile tests over.

The two devices were fired eastwards over the sea from the Wonsan area on the east coast, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.

""The military is monitoring for additional launches and maintaining readiness,"" the statement added.

The North carried out a series of weapons tests late last year, the last of them in November, often describing them as multiple launch rocket systems, although others called them ballistic missiles.

It also carried out static engine tests, most recently in December.

At a party meeting at the end of that month, leader Kim Jong Un declared that Pyongyang no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

The move came with nuclear negotiations with the US at a standstill and as a unilateral deadline Pyongyang set Washington to offer it fresh concessions on sanctions relief expired.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

It is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes from the United Nations Security Council, US, South and other bodies.

Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress was made.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north-korea-fires-two-unidentified-projectiles--south-s-military-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/north-korea-fires-two-unidentified-projectiles--south-s-military.html

240,02-3-20,NE Delhi peaceful but tense,"4 more bodies fished out from drains in riot-hit areas; 254 booked, 903 held’

A week after North-east Delhi’s deadly communal violence, the situation in riot-hit areas was peaceful but tense on Sunday as four more bodies were fished out from drains in Gokalpuri and Shiv Vihar and heavy police deployment continued. However, it is yet to be ascertained if they are linked to the riots and authorities have not updated the death toll figure.

The heavy presence of police in the riot-hit areas has helped in bolstering the confidence of residents and more people and vehicles were seen on main roads on Sunday.

In parts of North-east Delhi, people complained of cash crunch as several bank branches and ATMs have remained closed in the aftermath of the riots.

Delhi Police officials said they have registered 254 FIRs including 41 cases pertaining to Arms Act and have arrested 903 people till now. The police said they did not receive any PCR calls of rioting in the last four days. The two Special Investigation Teams (SITs) of the Crime Branch have fast tracked the probe and more people could be arrested, said sources.

“Autopsy on bodies of 32 of 38 bodies has been performed and bodies have been handed over to the family members. Three of the six bodies still remain unidentified,” a senior police official said.

Till Saturday, at least 42 people had lost their lives and more than 200 people have sustained serious injuries. Moreover, properties worth crores of rupees have been damaged in the communal violence.

While 38 deaths were reported at the GTB Hospital, three were reported at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital. At the GTB Hospital, 28 victims were brought dead while 10 died during treatment.

The GTB Hospital officials said it has admitted 271 injured patients since February 24, of which many were critical. “At present, only 40 victims remain at the hospital. Only 32 victims with minor injuries were brought to the hospital in the last 24 hours. Out of the 32 injured people that were admitted at the GTB hospital, 31 people have been discharged while one injured person is being treated,”, an official of the hospital said.

Meanwhile, acting Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava visited DCP Amit Sharma, undergoing treatment at a hospital in Patparganj after suffering serious injuries during the violence in Gokalpuri on February 24.

Also, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) deputed a fact-finding team to investigate the cases of violence. In a statement, the NHRC said it had asked its Director General (Investigation) to depute its fact-finding team for on-spot enquiries into violation of human rights during the violence.

Soon after taking charge on Saturday, acting Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava said his priority is to restore peace and ensure communal harmony in the national Capital, which earlier this week witnessed its worst riots in three decades. Shrivastava was given the additional charge of Delhi Police Commissioner with effect from Sunday, following Amulya Patnaik’s retirement.

Police have also started a massive outreach programme and senior officers have been meeting and speaking with people from every community in order to build confidence among them.

Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar visited some of the riots-hit areas, including Brahmapuri, and consoled the people disturbed by the worst violence in three decades in Delhi.

The situation in Shiv Vihar, among the worst hit areas, is yet to improve. Even days after the violence, the lanes in the area were deserted and almost all the houses locked. In Mustafabad, people were wary of stepping out of their homes in narrow bylanes.

“Though there is police presence, tension is lingering. We celebrated Eid, Holi, Diwali together. I have never faced such a situation in my life. There is grief, mistrust, disbelief. Those who indulged in violence did not belong to the area, they came from outside,” said Mohammad Yunus, 45.

Scores of workers marched down the streets towards Shaheed Minar, the venue of the rally, repeatedly shouting “desh ke gaddaron ko … goli maaro …” (shoot country’s traitors dead)” even as a helpless police force stood a mute spectator in absence of appropriate orders.

On his arrival at the airport on Sunday, Shah faced protest by the Opposition parties whose cadres greeted him with “go back” slogans. Hundreds of protesters of the Left Front and Congress, holding black flags and anti-CAA posters, demonstrated outside gate number 1 of the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport.

Addressing a well-attended BJP rally, Shah attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for misleading the people on the controversial Act. “It is a law to provide citizenship and not to take it away from any citizen. Mamata Didi is misleading the Muslim brothers and sisters that their citizenship will be taken away if this Act is implemented,” said Shah. Linking violent anti-CAA protests in Bengal and the Delhi riots that claimed 42 lives, Shah accused the Chief Minister for letting her State to burn for several days in the wake of the enactment of the CAA.

He said from today our workers will take part in “aar noy annyay” drive which will be a door-to-door outreach campaign to tell the people about our strong resolve that Bengal’s days of woes are coming to an end. Accusing the Chief Minister of “patronising” rioters who torched trains to oppose the controversial law in December last year, he said the Chief Minister instigated the violence and added “in spite of all her opposition the CAA cannot be stopped. It will not be taken back.”

Playing to the refugee gallery, Shah said lakhs of Hindus, particularly those from the Matua (SC) community who had to leave Bangladesh in the face of persecution will now get Indian citizenship. “Mamata Didi is trying to stall the effort of the Central Government to provide citizenship to the Matuas.

“I want to ask Mamata Didi — why are you hurting the interests of our refugees? You only care about infiltrators. Refugees are being misled and scared... Hindus who fled our neighbouring countries who were raped and threatened and killed... should they not get citizenship?” he asked.

Saying that the no one could stop the BJP from coming to power in Bengal in 2021, Shah said Mamata used to say that the BJP will not get single seat and it will even lose its deposit. But we got 18 out of 42 seats. Now I want to declare that the BJP will come to power in 2021 by getting absolute majority, he said.

He said from today our workers will take part in Aar noy Annyay drive which will be a door-to-door outreach campaign to tell the people about our strong resolve that Bengal’s days of woes are coming to an end…

“Aar noy (no more) tolabaji (extortion), Aar noy (no more) appeasement, Aar noy (no more) infiltration, Aar noy (no more) violence... this is the slogan that will change the Government of Bengal,” he said.

Launched along the lines of Trinamool Congress’ Didi ke bolo (tell it all to Didi) the BJP’s scheme will come with specific phone numbers.

Saying that the people of the State had given chances to CPI(M), TMC, Shah asked for “one chance for the BJP so that we can craft a golden Bengal for you.”

The State was “lagging behind in terms of development under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership and ‘Sonar Bangla’ cannot be formed under her watch,” said Shah.

Meanwhile, Left and the Congress leaders attacked the Chief Minister for allowing Shah to land in Kolkata saying “Mamata Banerjee has allowed a person whose hands are soaked in blood to land in Kolkata … and now we want her to arrest these people who raised the ‘goli maaro’ slogan or else the people of Bengal will understand that her anti-CAA and anti-communal campaign is nothing but a sham.

Though TMC MP and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee immediately tweeted, saying Bengal is better off without bigotry and hatred that BJP is trying to spread, CPI(M) central committee member and Left Legislature Party Leader Sujan Chakrabarty said, “Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that she will not allow Shah to land in Kolkata. But we saw her gossiping with him at Bhubaneshwar. Now his men are raising communal slogans in Kolkata and still the police are keeping silent. As the Chief Minister and Home Minister we expect herto get these people arrested.”

Congress MLA Manoj Chakrabarty asked the Government to “immediately identify these people from the video footages and arrest them or else this communal germ will spread in Bengal and burn it.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---goli-maaro--march-passes-by-shah-rally-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/---goli-maaro--march-passes-by-shah-rally.html
242,02-3-20,"Opp to raise Delhi riots, seek Shah’s resignation in LS","The second half of the Budget session of Parliament is expected to start on stormy note on Monday with the Opposition parties set to raise the issue of riots in Delhi and demand the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the “failure” to control the law and order in the Capital.

The Congress, Trinamool Congress, NCP, CPI(M), CPI leaders told media on Sunday that they will give adjournment notice demanding the debate on the communal violence which resulted in 42 deaths and lapses from police machinery.

Reacting to Opposition’s demand, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs said the Government is always for debates and it should not be used to “play politics.”

Congress’ leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party will strongly raise the issue of riot-torn Delhi and ask why the violence happened. “The Government has miserably failed to maintain law and order. I think there must be some sort of a nexus between the rioters and a section of police officials which resulted in gruesome killings and arson that has tarnished our image across the globe. This is a matter of serious concern for us,” he said.

“We will continue to raise the demand of Shah’s resignation on the floor of the House,” Chowdhury added.

Trinamool Congress as well as the CPI and the CPI(M) will also raise the issue in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and demand answers from the Home Minister. “Left parties will strengthen the voice of the Opposition in Parliament and raise the issue of Delhi violence in both the Houses. I have given a notice under Rule 267 to the Rajya Sabha chairman to discuss the issue in the House,” CPI(M) MP KK Ragesh said.

CPI general secretary D Raja said his party will demand that Shah answer for the “inaction” of the Delhi Police, which comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs . “The violence in Delhi will be raised in Parliament by our party. We will also reach out to other parties on the issue. We will also raise the issue of hate speeches by BJP leaders and question why they have not been arrested. Also, Shah needs to be held accountable,” he said.

Congress’ senior spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Abhishek Singhvi also said the Congress will take up in Parliament in the strongest possible terms the “wanton destruction of democratic values” in this country with the “active approbation” and, frequently, the selective “Nelsonian blind eye” of the government.

“The manner and form of protest inside or out of Parliament is a matter of coordinated strategy and not an issue to be publicly aired. But the country is assured that we will discharge our responsibilities vigorously and without fear, despite extreme and illegal intrusion and harassment,” he said.

The Budget Session of Parliament commenced on January 31 and continued till February 11.

245,02-3-20,Biden fights for momentum in Democrats' shifting primary,"An emboldened Joe Biden is trying to cast himself as the clear moderate alternative to progressive Bernie Sanders as the Democrats' shrinking presidential field raced toward Super Tuesday.

One of Biden's leading moderate rivals, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, dropped out of the campaign Sunday just 24 hours after Biden scored a resounding victory in South Carolina, his first of the 2020 rollercoaster nomination fight.

While other rivals appeared undeterred, Biden pressed his case during a round of national television interviews that reflected a stark reality a day after his resounding primary victory in South Carolina: The former vice president was forced to rely upon free media coverage because he was understaffed, underfunded and almost out of time as he fought to transform his sole win into a national movement.

Biden vowed to improve his campaign operation, his fundraising haul — and even his own performance — in an interview on ABC's “This Week.” He warned of a “stark choice” between him and Sanders, while making the case he was the candidate who could win up and down the ballot and in states beyond those voting next week.

Biden added a swipe at one of Sanders' signature lines during an appearance on “Fox New Sunday”: “The people aren't looking for revolution. They're looking for results."" The newfound confidence came at a crossroads in the Democratic Party's turbulent primary season. Sanders remained the undisputed front-runner. But the rest of the field was decidedly unsettled, even after Biden's South Carolina blowout and Buttigieg's sudden departure.

Most notably, New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg could create problems for Biden as the race sped toward Super Tuesday, when 14 states from Maine to Alabama to California hold Democratic elections as the 2020 primary moved into a new phase. No longer would individual states hold primaries every week. Starting Tuesday, and most Tuesdays through early June, batches of states would vote at the same time in what had essentially become a national election.

Biden claimed a handful of new endorsements and fundraising successes on Sunday in his quest to project strength.

Perhaps the most powerful endorsement would come from former President Barack Obama, who has a relationship with most of the candidates and has talked with several in recent weeks as primary voting has begun. He spoke with Biden after his South Carolina victory, but still has no plans to endorse in the primary at this point.

But a handful of high-profile political strategists with ties to the former president encouraged Biden's rivals — including Bloomberg — to quit the race to allow anti-Sanders' Democrats to unify behind Obama's former vice president.

""Most of them have seen the writing on the wall for at least the last week,” said Rufus Gifford, who held top fundraising posts on both of Obama's campaigns and was part of Biden's fundraising operation. “It's clear the Democratic alternative to Bernie Sanders is Joe Biden.”

Text messages reviewed by The Associated Press revealed an outpouring of interest in Biden from donors supporting other candidates, including Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren.

Biden announced he took in USD 5 million immediately after his South Carolina win, by far his best single day of fundraising over the last year. But in an example of Biden's challenge ahead, Sanders said Sunday he raised an eye-popping USD 46.5 million for February. That compared to USD 29 million for Warren and USD 18 million for Biden over the same period.

Sanders, who dominated the money race for much of the year even though he did not court wealthy donors, said it was not the overall fundraising haul that should impress but the enthusiasm of working people fuelling his candidacy.

""No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do,” Sanders said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""That's how you beat Trump."" Biden allies conceded that the post-South Carolina fundraising surge would have little impact on Super Tuesday.

""Super Tuesday is too close,” said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden supporter. “Fortunately, Joe Biden has been on the national scene for 35 years. He has less need to advertise.” Barry Goodman, a top Biden donor in Michigan and a prominent member of the Democratic National Committee, said he'd heard from about “a dozen or so” regular party donors who had been on the sidelines and now wanted to support Biden.

He said he had personally targeting at least 20 Bloomberg supporters who had been sitting on their checkbooks at Bloomberg's request.

“If Mike had known what was going to happen last night in South Carolina, he'd never have gotten in,” Goodman said.

As he exited the race on Sunday, Buttigieg said he was acknowledging reality: “The path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy."" Buttigieg didn't endorse any of the remaining candidates, though he and former Biden traded voicemails on Sunday. Buttigieg has spent the past several weeks warning that nominating progressive leader Bernie Sanders to take on President Donald Trump would be risky.Biden's other rivals showed no interest in getting out of the race. In fact, some vowed to keep fighting no matter what happened on Super Tuesday.

Warren campaign manager Roger Lau spoke brazenly of pushing into a floor battle at the Democratic National Convention this summer if no candidate emerged from the primary season with a clear majority, which was possible even if someone had a large delegate lead.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/biden-fights-for-momentum-in-democrats--shifting-primary-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/biden-fights-for-momentum-in-democrats--shifting-primary.html
246,02-3-20,Trump helped Apple begin its India retail journey: Cook,"Revealing for the first time that US President Donald Trump batted for Apple to help it get a strong retail foothold in India, the companys CEO Tim Cook has said that the US administration has worked in Apples favour to help it gain further ground in worlds second largest smartphone market.

After Trump visited India on February 24-25, saying he ""may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India,"" Cook also announced last week that Apple is set to open its first branded retail store in the country in 2021 and open an online exclusive online store this year.

In an interview with Fox Business, Cook said: ""I see India as a huge opportunity for us. For years, we could not enter there unless we entered there with a partner into retail and we did not want to do that. We wanted to maintain control of our brand and so forth"".

""The (Trump) administration worked on this with the Indian government and that change has been made and so we are very positive on entering there online this year and in retail next year,"" he told the show host.

Speaking to investors at the annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino, California last week, Cook confirmed the company will open its first offline retail outlet in India next year.

""I don't want somebody else to run the brand for us. We wouldn't be a very good partner in retail. We like to do things our way,"" the Apple CEO mentioned.

Apple currently has third-party reseller outlets to sell its devices in the country.

There are reports that Apple has leased a location in Mumbai for its upcoming branded retail store but the company is yet to reveal the location.

Apple's exclusive online store is expected to start functioning in the third quarter this year.

The Cupertino-based tech giant is currently selling its devices in India via third-party offline retailers and e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.in.

Welcoming the government's decision to ease the 30 per cent local sourcing norm in single-brand retail (SBRT), Apple said last year: ""We appreciate the support and hard work by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team to make this possible and we look forward to one day welcoming customers to India's first Apple retail store.""

The plan for opening owned stores would certainly help Apple in giving a controlled experience of its devices and services as it intends and designed them to be, as in a third-party retail environment, many such things cannot be controlled by the brand.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-helped-apple-begin-its-india-retail-journey--cook-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-helped-apple-begin-its-india-retail-journey--cook.html
247,02-3-20,China welcomes US-Taliban deal: Calls for orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan,"China on Monday welcomed the landmark US-Taliban deal and called for ""orderly and responsible"" withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan to avoid a security vacuum and prevent the terrorist groups from getting stronger in the war-torn country.

After 18 years of war, the US and the Taliban signed the peace deal in Doha on Saturday to facilitate intra-Afghan dialogue in Oslo this month and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan in 14 months.

""China welcomes the signing of the deal between the US and the Afghan Taliban. We think it is important to the political settlement of the Afghan issue,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday replying to a question over the US-Taliban deal.

""We hope taking this as an opportunity, the seed of peace can grow and prosper in Afghanistan. Foreign troops in Afghanistan should withdraw in an orderly and responsible manner to ensure a smooth transition and avoid a security vacuum especially to prevent the terrorist groups from growing stronger in Afghanistan,"" he said.

In the meantime, the international community should continue to support and participate in the peaceful reconstruction process in Afghanistan, he said.

""We call on the Taliban and all parties in Afghanistan to seize the opportunity and start inter-Afghan talks as soon as possible to discuss political and security arrangements acceptable to all and make joint efforts for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" he said.

He said that China will continue to work with the international community to support and help the Afghan peace and reconciliation process.

China, which also shares border with Afghanistan through the narrow Wakhan corridor besides Pakistan occupied Kashmir, is closely monitoring the evolving situation in Afghanistan amid its own concerns over the situation in Muslim-majority Xinjiang, where it is battling the separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM).

Beijing claims that the ETIM has links with al-Qaeda and it was believed to be regrouping in Afghanistan to carry out attacks in Xinjiang.

China is also trying to work out reconciliation between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the Afghan government's allegation of Islamabad's support to the Taliban through tripartite talks.

Responding to a question, Zhao said China attended the ceremony in Doha along with other foreign countries.

""China firmly supports the Afghan-led, Afghan-owned broad and inclusive peace and reconciliation process. We support the Afghan government, the Afghan Taliban and all parties in Afghanistan in starting and advancing intra-afghan talks as soon as possible,” he said.

""On the basis of respecting the will of all parties in Afghanistan, China will like to continue to be a supporter, mediator and convenience provider for the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan and will continue to play a constructive role,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-welcomes-us-taliban-deal--calls-for-orderly-withdrawal-of-foreign-troops-from-afghanistan-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-welcomes-us-taliban-deal--calls-for-orderly-withdrawal-of-foreign-troops-from-afghanistan.html
248,02-3-20,Indira Gandhi Arts Centre to get temporary address in Janpath hotel,"The sprawling Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) is likely to be shifted to Janpath hotel by July 2020 as part of the Central Vista Redevelopment project.

Top sources said the Central Works Board of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has approved a proposal to renovate and upgrade hotel Janpath, so IGNCA building could be shifted under the Central Vista Redevelopment project.

Janpath is currently shot down awaiting renovation. IGNCA will be eventually shifted to Jamnagar House plot by 2024.

According to sources, the retrofitting of Janpath hotel is necessary as the structure is over 50-year-old.

The renovation will start from March and it will complete in July.

In the first phase, four out of 10 blocks or buildings have been proposed to be constructed. Out of these three blocks will come up in the plot of IGNCA.

The IGNCA, established in the memory of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, may be shifted near Jamnagar House, where around 15-acre land currently used by hutments are likely to be removed.

Ahmedabad-based firm HCP Design Planning and Management is designing the master-plan for the new Central Vista.

The total cost of renovation of Janpath is estimated to be Rs 74 crore. The hotel spread in 4.4-acre-plot will be used as General Pool Official Accommodation (GPOA).

A committee of secretaries headed by cabinet secretary PK Sinha, set up last year to work out details such as land usage and how the hotel property should be used, has approved the proposal to develop the 4.4-acre-plot as GPOA.

According to the proposed plan, the IGNCA and other nine buildings, including Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shashtri Bhawan, vice president residence, are likely to be demolished to pave the way for the construction of a common Central Secretariat to house various Ministries.

As a part of the ambitious plan, being executed through the Central Public Works Department of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, a new Parliament building near the existing circular heritage structure has been proposed.

The triangular building will have a Lok Sabha chamber big enough to accommodate 900 MPs usually, in view of any future increase in the number of seats, and up to about 1,300 for a joint session of Parliament.

Two MPs would share one 1,300 mm bench, which would be enough to accommodate a third MP during a joint session.

The triangular building would have a spire, though the material it would be made of is yet to be decided.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indira-gandhi-arts-centre-to-get-temporary-address-in-janpath-hotel-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/indira-gandhi-arts-centre-to-get-temporary-address-in-janpath-hotel.html

She told Collider: ""Violet's trajectory of her grieving process is something that we really wanted to stay truthful. It's her process, and everyone's process is different, but it's life. Also, it's Jennifer Niven's story. This isn't fiction. This really happened to her, when she was young. She had a boyfriend who this happened to.

""So, we wanted to make sure that it was handled with care. We also thought about fans of the book. We got to meet a lot of those kids and read letters from kids who this story has helped, and I hope that the movie does the same. There's a real community now. I think it's beautiful to create a community and a conversation.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/elle-fanning--important-to-talk-about-dealing-with-grief-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/elle-fanning--important-to-talk-about-dealing-with-grief.html
252,02-3-20,Pak to request British govt for Sharif's deportation,"Pakistan has announced that it will request the British government to deport former prime minister Nawaz Sharif as he is an ""absconder"".

""The government has decided in principle to write a letter this week to the British government, seeking deportation of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, as he is an absconder not fulfilling the terms and conditions of the bail granted to him on medical grounds,"" Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Firdous Ashiq Awan told a press conference here on Sunday evening.

She said Sharif had gone to London on November 19 last year for his treatment but was yet to be admitted to a hospital there, indicating that ""it was a fixed match played by him, his party and a section of the media on his health"", paving the way for his departure to London.

Awan claimed that Sharif and his younger brother Shahbaz had gone to London to protect the businesses of their children.

""Nawaz faked his health condition,"" she alleged.

Last week, the Punjab government had refused to extend Sharif's bail, declaring that it had found no ""legal, moral or medical ground"" necessitating an extension in his stay abroad.

The Lahore High Court had, in October last year, granted bail to Sharif on medical grounds for four weeks, allowing the Punjab government to extend it further in the light of his medical reports.

The Islamabad High Court had also granted bail to Sharif in the Al Azizia Mills corruption case, in which the former prime minister was serving a seven-year jail term, clearing his way to travel abroad for medical treatment.

PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said if Sharif decided to return to the country, the Imran Khan government will request him not to come.

He said the three-time premier will challenge the government's decision not to give him extension in his stay abroad in the court shortly.

PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari told PTI that if Pakistan wrote to the British government for Sharif's deportation, the PML-N would also write to the US government seeking opening of a case against Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding his (""illegitimate"") child.

She said Sharif was seriously ill and had heart-related complications, adding that the former prime minister was going to have a heart procedure shortly.

""Imran Khan and his team should stop playing on the health of Sharif and concentrate on governance matters instead,"" Bokhari said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-to-request-british-govt-for-sharif-s-deportation-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-to-request-british-govt-for-sharif-s-deportation.html
253,02-3-20,"Nearly 500 new coronavirus cases send South Korea total past 4,000","South Korea reported nearly 500 new coronavirus cases Monday, sending the largest national total in the world outside China past 4,000.

Four more people had died, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, taking the toll to 22.

Infection numbers have surged in the world's 12th-largest economy in recent days and the country's central bank has warned of negative growth in the first quarter, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports, while scores of events have been cancelled or postponed over the contagion.

The figures are expected to rise further as authorities carry out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious group often condemned as a cult that is linked to more than half the cases.

A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four church services in Daegu -- the country's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million and the centre of the outbreak -- before being diagnosed.

254,02-3-20,Bin Laden doctor launches hunger strike in Pakistan,"The Pakistani doctor who helped the CIA track and kill Osama bin Laden has launched a hunger strike from his prison cell, his lawyer and family said Monday.

Shakeel Afridi has been languishing behind bars for years since his fake vaccination programme helped US agents track and kill the Al Qaeda leader in 2011.

""It is to protest the injustices and inhumane attitudes being committed against him and his family,"" his brother Jamil Afridi told AFP after meeting with Afridi in a prison in central Punjab province. His attorney Qamar Nadeem also confirmed the hunger strike.

Afridi was jailed for 33 years in May 2012 after he was convicted of having ties to militants, a charge he has always denied. His sentence was later reduced by 10 years. Some US lawmakers have branded the case as revenge for his help in the search for the Al Qaeda chief.

The 2011 killing of Bin Laden caused massive embarrassment for Pakistan and particularly its powerful military.

For years Afridi has had no access to his lawyer, while his appeal against his prison sentence has stalled with scheduled court appearances repeatedly delayed. His family has also complained of being targeted and harassed by authorities over the years.

US President Donald Trump vowed during his election campaign that he would order Pakistan to free Afridi, but since taking office has been largely silent on the issue.

The comments sparked a blistering rebuttal from Pakistan, whose interior minister at the time branded Trump ""ignorant"" and stated that the ""government of Pakistan and not Donald Trump"" would decide Afridi's fate.

In recent years Pakistani authorities have cracked down on nonprofits and forced them to leave the country, which analysts say was largely tied to the Afridi case due to the security establishment's fears that NGOs have provided cover for spying.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bin-laden-doctor-launches-hunger-strike-in-pakistan-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/bin-laden-doctor-launches-hunger-strike-in-pakistan.html
255,02-3-20,NASA images show drop in China's air pollution after coronavirus lockdown,"Satellite images by NASA and European Space Agency have shown a significant decline in pollution levels over China, partly due to the economic slowdown following the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the US space agency has said.

The pollution monitoring satellites of the space agencies detected significant decreases over China in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities, NASA said in a statement.

In January, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19).

It was the first of several quarantines set up in the country and around the world, according to NASA.

The virus has so far killed over 3,000 people, and infected more than 88,000 globally after the outbreak in China in December last year.

Maps created using data from NASA and ESA satellites show NO2 values across China from January 1-20 (before the quarantine) and February 10-25 (during the quarantine).

The data were collected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA's Sentinel-5 satellite.

A related sensor, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, has been making similar measurements.

According to NASA scientists, the reduction in NO2 pollution was first apparent near Wuhan, but eventually spread across the country.

""This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,"" said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Liu recalls seeing a drop in NO2 over several countries during the economic recession that began in 2008, but the decrease was gradual.

Scientists also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but the effect was mostly localised around that city, and pollution levels rose again once the Olympics ended.

The drop in nitrogen dioxide in 2020 also coincided with Lunar New Year celebrations in China, and much of Asia, according to NASA.

Generally, businesses and factories close from the last week in January into early February to celebrate the festival.

Past observations have shown that air pollution usually decreases during this period and then increases once the celebration is over, NASA said.

""There is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,"" said Barry Lefer, an air quality scientist at NASA.

""Our long-term OMI data allows us to see if these amounts are abnormal and why,""Lefer said.

Launched in 2004, OMI has been collecting global data on NO2 and various air pollutants for more than 15 years.

The maps show NO2 values over three periods in 2020: January 1-20 (before Lunar New Year), January 28-February 9 (around New Year celebrations), and February 10-25 (after the event).

The 2020 values were compared to the same periods in 2019 for reference.

Lefer noted that the overall values in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to new environmental regulations that China has enforced over the past few years.

While the Lunar New Year may have played a role in the recent dropoff, researchers believe the decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation.

In a preliminary analysis, NASA researchers compared NO2 values detected by OMI in 2020 with the average amounts detected at this time of year from 2005-2019.

In 2020, NO2 values in eastern and central China were significantly lower -- from 10 to 30 per cent lower -- than what is normally observed for this time period.

Liu and colleagues have not seen a rebound in NO2 after the holiday.

""This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,"" she said.

""I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimise spread of the virus,"" Liu added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nasa-images-show-drop-in-china-s-air-pollution-after-coronavirus-lockdown-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nasa-images-show-drop-in-china-s-air-pollution-after-coronavirus-lockdown.html

257,02-3-20,China steps up visa threats against foreign reporters: Media Group,"The Chinese government is threatening to remove visas from journalists as a weapon to intimidate foreign media ""like never before"", a press group said Monday, following the expulsion of three reporters last month.

In its annual report, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said it also feared Beijing was preparing to kick out more reporters, with two journalists this year given working visas of only a single month.

At least 12 correspondents received press credentials valid for six months or less -- more than double the number given short-term visas the previous year, in what the FCCC called a record.

Resident journalist visas, which are mandatory for all foreign media based in mainland China, are typically issued for one year.

""Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before,"" the report warned, flagging a ""continued decline in reporting conditions"".

Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, China has forced out nine foreign journalists, either through outright expulsion or by non-renewal of visas, the FCCC said.

The report also found a majority of journalists surveyed -- 82 percent -- said they had experienced interference, harassment or violence while reporting in China over the past year.

Nearly double the correspondents surveyed this year faced difficulty renewing their credentials, and almost all of them believed this was related to their reporting.

In late February, Beijing ordered three reporters from The Wall Street Journal to leave the country over what it deemed a racist headline in an opinion piece they were not involved in writing.

Deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, were given five days to leave.

The reporters had reported on Xinjiang, covering forced labour, surveillance and re-education camps.

Last August, China refused to renew the press credentials of Wall Street Journal correspondent Chun Han Wong after he and Wen wrote an article on one of Xi's cousins.

The group warned that ""hostility toward foreign press is now so pervasive that the most basic elements of journalism are often frustrated in China"".

The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-steps-up-visa-threats-against-foreign-reporters--media-group-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-steps-up-visa-threats-against-foreign-reporters--media-group.html

259,02-3-20,No police brutality in my film 'Sooryavanshi': Rohit Shetty,"Director Rohit Shetty, who is expanding his cop universe with ""Sooryavanshi"", on Monday said his movie doesn't show police brutality.

At the trailer launch of ""Sooryavanshi"", the director, best known for ""Singham"" series and ""Simmba"", was asked whether his films glorified police brutality and encounter killings but he dismissed the question.

""Police brutality hai hi nahin meri film mein. Tu galat film dekh ke aayi hai. Wrong question. (There's no police brutality in my film. You have watched the wrong film),"" Shetty told reporters.

Asked about his reaction on Delhi riots, the director said the best thing at this time would be to stay quiet.

""It's a very serious issue and a lot of people are talking about it. The best thing right now for all of us would be to stay calm. Our officials, the government, our people are there... It's easy to talk about what people have gone through there while doing an event here. So the best thing, right now, for entire India would be to stay silent.

""Everyone's been talking and the chaos is increasing. If we stay quiet, things will fall in place. There's a chief minister, others are there. Has anyone seen riots? You'll be s**t scared. One should never engage in it. I can give a lecture, people will praise me on social media. But right now, we all should stay silent about it for a few days...

260,02-3-20,"Lock, Stock and Barrel: New Zealand thrash India inside three days, win series 2-0","A star-studded Indian team was given a reality check by a disciplined New Zealand side that completed a memorable series sweep with a seven-wicket win inside three days in the second Test here on Monday.

New Zealand chased down a modest victory target of 132 in just 36 overs after India's second innings folded for 124 in less than an hour on the third day.

Tom Latham (52 off 74 balls) and Tom Blundell (55 off 113 balls) had a good batting session as Mohammed Shami didn't bowl post lunch due to a ball-impact injury while batting.

A solid 120 points took New Zealand's tally to 180 even as India stayed on top with 360 points courtesy their series wins against the lowly West Indies, depleted South Africa and a below-par Bangladesh.

The feel good factor of a 5-0 T20 series victory seemed like ancient history as a dream start turned into a virtual nightmare for Virat Kohli's bunch that has always taken immense pride in performing in overseas conditions.

However, a look at India's overseas performance indicates that whenever the ball had swung and seamed, reputations had been laid in tatters. It happened in England in 2014 and 2018 and now New Zealand have exposed them one more time.

More than the margin, the manner of surrender will come back to haunt the current Indian team, which leaves this part of the world with a lot of unanswered questions.

It's not only about technique of some top players against the moving deliveries but also about their mindset when put under the pump.

There were only four half-centuries across four innings in this series with techniques of some of the players like Ajinkya Rahane, Mayank Agarwal against seam and swing leaving a lot to be desired.

Skipper Kohli's 38 runs in four innings was one of the biggest setbacks for the visitors in the series.

Prithvi Shaw is a work in progress when it comes to his decision-making on deliveries on the fourth stump and, of course, the short ball, which the Kiwis used liberally to get rid of him since the start of the practice games.

Kohli's problems against the seaming deliveries resurfaced again during the series but there is little time to go back to the drawing board with a packed schedule for the remaining part of the year.

India will next play in seaming conditions in England in 2021 and hence some of the issues may just persist with no time in the interim for a course correction.

On Monday, there was another lower-order collapse as the last four wickets went for 34 runs, but lack of gumption from someone like Rishabh Pant, playing for his place in the side, was disheartening.

It was the pair of Tim Southee (3/36 in 11 overs) and Trent Boult (4/28 in 14 overs), which once again tormented the Indian batsmen, who were all at sea against quality bowling on a slightly challenging track.

In the morning, Hanuma Vihari (9) was caught down the leg-side off an innocuous Southee delivery.

On a track where it was next to impossible to defend, Pant was seen pushing and prodding defensively, something that's not his natural game. The result was a half-hearted poke at an away going delivery that safely landed in the wicketkeeper's gloves.

The much talked-about ""intent"" was completely missing in Pant's game and his approach defied logic. Especially after coach Ravi Shastri spoke about how his aggressive batting scored over Wriddhiman Saha, but questions will certainly be asked on if scores of 19, 25, 12 and 4 justify his inclusion over a more accomplished stumper.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lock--stock-and-barrel--new-zealand-thrash-india-inside-three-days--win-series-2-0-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/lock--stock-and-barrel--new-zealand-thrash-india-inside-three-days--win-series-2-0.html
261,02-3-20,Kohli irked after NZ scribe asks about his celebration of Williamson's dismissal,"India captain Virat Kohli on Monday got annoyed after being asked about his animated celebrations over Kane Williamson's dismissal on day two of the second Test before clarifying that match referee Ranjan Madugalle had no issues with what happened.

However, when Williamson was asked about the incident, New Zealand captain downplayed the incident, saying it was ""typical of Virat, who plays the game with lot of passion"".

Following India's seven wicket loss here on Monday, one of the local journalists sought Kohli's reaction on allegedly swearing at Williamson and that did not go down well with the away team captain. India lost the series 0-2.

""What do you think? I am asking you the answer,"" the irritation was writ large on Indian skipper's face as he came up with a sharp retort.

""You need to find out an answer and come up with a better question. You can't come here with half questions and half details of what happened. Also if you want to create controversy, this is not the right place. I spoke with the match referee (Madugalle) and he had no issues with what happened,"" said Kohli.

It was on day two when Williamson was dismissed by Jasprit Bumrah and Kohli was animated as ever in his celebrations. Kohli also gestured the crowd to keep quiet.

When Williamson was asked about Kohli's celebrations, he simply laughed it off.

""It is Virat and he is passionate on the field. I don't think we need to read too much into it,"" Williamson told PTI.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kohli-irked-after-nz-scribe-asks-about-his-celebration-of-williamson-s-dismissal-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/kohli-irked-after-nz-scribe-asks-about-his-celebration-of-williamson-s-dismissal.html
262,02-3-20,"We were completely outplayed, can't live in denial: Kohli","A disappointed Virat Kohli on Monday admitted that his side was ""completely outplayed"" by New Zealand in the two-Test series and they can't live in denial about ""not being brave enough"" to counter adverse conditions.

The Indian batting was in complete shambles in the two-Test series and the skipper said that with a packed schedule, the team management will have to find solutions despite time constraints.

""Obviously quite disappointed with how we played in this series. I feel like we were completely outplayed in this series,"" the Indian captain was honest and forthright in his assessment following the seven-wicket loss in the second Test here.

""We obviously didn't play the kind of cricket we do as a team. The thing to take away from here is to not shy away from things that have gone wrong and instead address them straight up, and not be in denial,"" he said.

Asked to point out what exactly went wrong, Kohli felt the outlook towards a series in adverse conditions was ""not ideal"".

""I think the outlook as far as I am concerned, and as far as I saw things happening, was not ideal for us in this series. We were not positive enough. We were not brave enough in moments, which we have done in the past. Skills follow your mindset, simple as that.""

However, he didn't like New Zealand being called India's ""bogey team"", having lost to the Black Caps in 2019 World Cup semifinal and two series in white and red ball formats.

""I am sure no one was saying that in first half of the tour,"" he said referring to his team's 5-0 win in the T20 series.

""You can't just make a team a bogey team because of one Test series defeat and a semi-final loss. They played better cricket on that day, and in this Test series, and there is no shame in accepting that.

""We are not trying to create some controversy by tagging a team or naming a bogey team or something like that,"" the skipper certainly wasn't amused.

But does the team have enough time to iron out the flaws considering the amount of cricket it plays?.

""There are two ways to look at it. I would much rather be in the middle and try to correct those things rather than having too much time in between and waiting for a game to arrive so that you can figure out whether you have corrected it or not,"" said Kohli.

""The advantage of playing a lot of cricket is that if you are working on something, you have many games to try and execute it straight up. It's the way you look at it. As I said, it needs to be balanced. Neither can you over-think nor be in denial. It works differently for different people.""

Asked about specific mistakes that this team can rectify, Kohli said that clarity of mind is paramount.

""Something (clarity) we failed to do as a batting unit, and I truly believe that we made too much of the conditions from the first day onwards, of the first Test: overcast, a bit of dampness on the pitch – we never spoke of these things before.

""If you're not clear in your head then the feet don't move, you're not quite sure whether to play the shot or not, leave the ball or play the ball. I think these sort of things can creep in, and which have crept in our game in this series. It's something we have recognised already,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-were-completely-outplayed--can-t-live-in-denial--kohli-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/we-were-completely-outplayed--can-t-live-in-denial--kohli.html
263,02-3-20,Can't single Pant out in collective failure: Kohli on Pant's form,"India captain Virat Kohli on Monday said the under-fire Rishabh Pant has got a ""lot of chances"" but the team is not looking to try someone else in the youngster's place just yet as one player can't be singled out in a collective failure.

Pant has been under the scanner for the past one year because of his inconsistent run. His tally of 60 runs across four innings in the 0-2 Test series loss to New Zealand, which concluded here on Monday, has only amplified the debate whether it was prudent to leave out a keeper of Wriddhiman Saha's calibre and back Pant.

""...We have given him (Pant) a lot of chances in the home season as well starting from Australia. Then he was not playing for a bit. In turn he really worked hard on himself,"" Kohli came to Pant's defence after the series here.

""You need to figure out when is the right time to give someone else a chance. If you push people too early, they can lose confidence,"" he added.

""...Collectively, we didn't perform. I don't believe in singling him out. We take the hit together as a group whether it's the batting group or as a team.""

When asked if he believes Pant has taken his place in the side for granted, Kohli made it clear that the culture of this team doesn't encourage anyone to think along those lines.

""I don't see anyone taking his place for granted in this team. That's the culture we have set. People are told to take responsibilities and work hard. Whether it happens or not is a different thing. Then you can have a conversation with the players,"" he said.

""But no one has come here thinking I am going to play every game or I am indispensable,"" he added in no uncertain terms.

Kohli, just like head coach Ravi Shastri, made it clear that Pant can make a difference in overseas conditions and he won't like to deviate during future tours.

""The time that he didn't play, he really worked hard on his game. So we thought this is the right time because of his game and the way he plays because he can make a difference lower down the order.

""That was our planning behind it. We can't really fluctuate when it comes to what we planned,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/can-t-single-pant-out-in-collective-failure--kohli-on-pant-s-form-2020-03-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/can-t-single-pant-out-in-collective-failure--kohli-on-pant-s-form.html
