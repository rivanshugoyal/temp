7,22-3-20,Coronavirus spike in S Korea: Role of Shincheonji sect,"The mysterious Christian sect termed the viral infection as weakness. What has irked many South Koreans is Shincheonji sect leader Lee Man-hee’s earlier claim that COVID-19 has been caused by evil spirits jealous of the rise of his faith

South Korea initially emerged as one of the potential hotbeds of coronavirus (COVID-19) along with China, Italy, Iran. The Shincheonji Sect, a mysterious Christian religious group, has played a vital role in fast spreading the virus across South Korea. When the cases of coronavirus spiralled in the country, the scientists discovered the common source of its origin: the much talked-about Shincheonji Sect, to which more than three-fifths of the victims belong. And it is based mainly in Daegu, the fourth largest city of South Korea. What has shocked the Korean authorities and the global health experts is that the unique style of congregation of Shincheonji may have catapulted the virus outbreak to the current alarming situation in the country. Its followers are supposed to kneel on the floor in close rows while praying, not allowed to wear masks (until recently) and encourage attending the church even when unwell.

In the month of February, a female follower who later tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected as per the information provided by the South Korean health officials. In fact, this woman’s refusal to undergo examination despite attending several church gatherings may have helped spreading the virus. This has signaled that Daegu, the southern city of the country, wherein the major activities of the sect take place, is responsible for the fast growth of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Also what has alerted the authorities is that it is quite common among its disciples to hide their identities in public. The faith itself has categorised “sickness” as weakness. These all may have allowed or rather forced the infected followers not come out in public. This can be considered as too dangerous looking at how fast the disease has travelled from faraway Wuhan to different parts of the world.

The Shincheonji cult was formed by Lee Man-hee in 1984. Many say this apocalyptic Christian group is a cult. The very origin of the sect lies in the Book of Revelation. In the Korean language, the word Shincheonji refers to “New Heaven and Earth”. Its official name is “Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. For all the believers, it is no other than Lee who is the one around whom their lives revolve. They address him as “Chairman Lee” or at times simply the “Chairman”. But in prominent Church literatures, he is referred to as “Promised Pastor”, “The Advocate” and finally, “The One Who Overcomes”.

It has lakhs of followers who generally keep their identities dormant in public places. The founder identifies himself as the “Promised Pastor” mentioned in the Bible. But what his critics say is that he is simply peddling Christian heresay. It is interesting to note that the cardinal principles of the faith say that the followers of the faith are the embodiment of the one true Christianity and pose for salvation when the moment of final judgment comes. All of them strongly believe that everyone else will be denied forgiveness and destroyed. To this sect, the end of the world is just near. Once we browse through the recent history of South Korea, we can easily locate such religious movements, sects or faiths that have quite often appeared and influenced a significant part of its society. Interestingly, Lee has been having long experience in such controversial movements that have quite often appeared in South Korea. Hence such religious revivalist movements are nothing new in this country. In fact, the Shincheonji has emerged from the ruins of earlier Tent Temple Movement that fell apart in the 1970s after its leader was accused of massive fraud. Even little before that there was another such revivalist religion called Olive Tree Movement that too brought millions together across South Korea. Such new religious movements though are on the fringe, they play significant roles in mobilising people and shaping opinions the way they feel right. And many a times the leaders of such cults are questioned, tried and even prosecuted as per the law of the land.

What is the current position of the sect and reaction of the common people over it? Since COVID-19 as global pandemic has already infected over 2,76,000 people and killed 11,419 (till March 21) globally, including 8,800 cases and 102 deaths in South Korean, people in the country are annoyed with the Shencheonji church. What has irked many is that initially its leader Lee squarely blamed the COVID-19 on evil spirits that are purely jealous of the rise of his faith. But very recently, he came out openly in public apologising for his church’s role in the outbreak of the virus in the country. He also offered all his support in checking the disease.

Meanwhile people are demanding the dissolution of the sect in no time. Thus, the Shencheonji has become the nerve centre of the nationwide invective as the COVID-19 is showing no signs of receding around the world. Again more than 5,52,000 Koreans have signed an online petition demanding quick action against the church. Along with this, many politicians are coming up against the Shencheonji and the way it has helped spreading the menace. The Mayor of Seoul demanded the prosecutors to investigate Lee for murder on the charges of negligence.

It is an unusual kind of a crisis that South Korea has experienced. But there is resigned acceptance among the people. Many feel that their health system is robust enough to gear up to counter such epidemics. Medics and health experts are on standby duty across the country. And the weekly briefings at least twice daily from the Centre for Disease Control not only alerts people but also helps the experts to track each infected person. Despite that, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore, there is no such panic prevailing in South Korea about COVID-19.

Unlike China, the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, South Korea has not adhered to total lockdowns or any other authoritarian measures to control the epidemic. Many health experts in the country feel that as it’s a democratic country total lockdown is not a reasonable choice for it. Though there is no astronomical rise in cases, the authorities in the country are not denying that there may be a resurgence of COVID-19. However there is hope due to the implementation of wide ranging and well-organised testing of the infected persons in the country. Accompanying such efforts is the complete isolation of the victims and trace and quarantine their contacts. So far South Korea has conducted 2,70,000 tests, that comes to 5,200 tests every million people. But when it comes to the US, it has so far carried out 74 tests per one million people as the data revealed by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention points out.

Any epidemic of such nature can be effectively controlled only by fast diagnosing the cases or infected people. And tracing the contact of the affected people and their immediate isolation could act as bulwark in preventing any such spike. Also the health experts have taken enough effort to investigate the cases related to Shincheonji mega church and equally quarantining the infected ones in the Daegu city. However concentrating on the Shincheonji for a long time has literally poured the entire energy of the Government behind it. And it has allowed new clusters of COVID-19 appear in Seoul and its surrounding areas such as Gyeonggi province. Now this needs to be urgently addressed by the epidemic experts.

Finally, what has made South Korea learn their lesson to hard hit such crisis is the experience of handling of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2015. This happened when a South Korean businessman was infected with MERS after visiting three West Asian nations in that same year. He was treated in three hospitals but in the process infection spread, killing 36, and isolating nearly 17,000 people before coming to stop in two months. That epidemic had forced the South Korean Government to pass strict laws that gave enough power to the officials to collect mobiles, credit cards and other data from those who tested positive to map their whereabouts. This information barring their identities shared in social media have helped others to track virus affected or their own contact with such people. Most importantly, once China witnessed the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention started developing its tests and planned its complete cooperation with the diagnostic manufacturers to make the commercial kits for testing. This all seriously have contributed to prevention and substantial control of the COVID-19 in South Korea.

8,22-3-20,Govt must go out of way to fight corona,"The PM will have to take a call urgently. These are exceptional situations and it won’t do to adhere to the rule book. India will have to establish new frontiers for this new abnormality. The Government will have to take giant strides to cope. The unresolved question is: how much sacrifice are citizens prepared for? There are no precedents to guide us

Last Saturday and Sunday, March 14 and 15 to be precise, I was preoccupied with a mass contact programme organised by the West Bengal unit of the BJP centred on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The programme took me to Cossipore and Behala — two extreme ends of Kolkata. Naturally, as happens in any political programme that has one eye on elections — the elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation were due in late April — the visits were concentrated around slums where there are big concentration of voters.

That weekend, in Kolkata at least, there was minimum mass awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic that had begun unsettling large parts of the world. I did not sight individuals with masks and the notion of social distancing seemed a non-idea in localities where the idea of privacy was notional. Although I kept a small bottle of hand sanitiser in my pocket, I was afraid of being seen to use it since, for the other political workers, it was business as usual. People occasionally stuck out their hands and it was courteous to reciprocate. The alternative was to appear stand-offish.

I mention this experience in Kolkata for two reasons. First, it is clear that news does not travel at the same speed. In a large and diverse country such as India, a state of heightened panic in one part does not mean a similar response in another part. Last weekend, when the numbers infected by coronavirus in India was still below 100, the feeling that it-won’t-happen-here was widespread. Secondly, it took Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s broadcast last Thursday evening for the whole country to be aware that the COVID-19 pandemic was a real threat that affected every citizen. Modi has been criticised by those who hate him politically for mouthing platitudes and not offering any concrete package. They miss the point. The important first step was to spread awareness. I believe that in announcing the Janata Curfew for Sunday, March 22, Modi succeeded in reaching out to the whole of India.

It is always difficult to gauge how far precautionary measures will work in India. Many of the cases of coronavirus have resulted from wilful negligence on the part of those who ought to have known better. In Kolkata, the son of a senior bureaucrat was so overcome by a sense of entitlement that he failed to get himself tested after returning from London. Instead he continued his social interactions as if life was normal. In Lucknow, some privileged people threw a big party that included a singer who had also returned from London and not got herself tested. This lapse has resulted in large numbers of politicians being exposed to the dreaded disease. It is broadly the same story in Bhubaneshwar and Bhilwara.

Whether it is elite culpability, official negligence or plain ignorance, the threat from COVID-19 is now very real. There are umpteen forecasts that proffer doomsday scenarios. One Indian-American expert is being wheeled around from studio to portal to suggest that at least a million Indians will die from the pandemic. The reason for this warning is, however, transparently political: to broadcast the assertion that the Modi Government is inept and incapable of doing anything to safeguard the wellbeing and livelihood of people.

Any Government finds itself having to make very difficult choices. If draconian measures — the most extreme being the Wuhan model — are put in place, there is certain to be an immediate knock on effect on the economy. The less the health measures, the less will be the economic consequences — at least in the short term. For any Government to try and manage the right balance between safeguarding lives and safeguarding people’s livelihood is difficult. Whatever is done will invite rebuke from people who may have some other agenda. Yet, the fact is that in moments of crisis and even panic, people invariably look to the Government to show the way.

Take the case of the evacuation of Indians stranded overseas. In normal circumstances, individuals should try and make their own arrangements to either protect themselves wherever they are located or find their own way back to India. However, the expectation is that the Government must charter an Air India aircraft and fly the stranded Indians back home, free of cost. To some extent the Government has already evacuated Indians from China and Italy but there are demands from the Philippines and even from Lithuania, to name just two, for evacuation.

The demands prompt a difficult question: would these demands have arisen if Air India wasn’t Government-controlled? And if Air India is pushed into fulfilling national obligations, why should we look at its bottom line? In the face of such an emergency, will the Government be right to press with its total privatisation?

There are no clear answers but it is now apparent that ordinary rules of the game are not applicable in dealing with a crisis that could escalate dramatically in the coming weeks. Should the Government, for example, suspend all principles of fiscal responsibility and spend lavishly to protect, as far as possible, the livelihood of people.

The women have been blocking a side of a road connecting southeast Delhi to Noida since mid-December to protest against the amended citizenship law.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shaheen-bagh-stir-will-continue--say-protesters.html
43,22-3-20,"Manage Fair Price Shops, stop hoarding: Minister","Food and Supply Minister Imran Hussain on Saturday said that necessary action against the black-marketers and hoarders are being taken as per law under the provisions of essential commodities act.

Hussain also directed officials for taking measures to manage Fair Price Shops (FPS) better during the fight against the COVID-19. He said that the guidelines issued by Government of India along with do’s and don’ts may be circulated to all FPS for strict adherence.

“The hygienic items like masks, hand sanitisers, soaps, etc required to contain the transmission of COVID-19 may be sold at FPS subject to the prohibitions and conditions as prescribed under law,” he told the official during a high level meeting to review the arrangements of Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department for effectively tackling the threat posed by coronavirus.

Social distancing may be adopted as a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention process, he said, adding that keeping a distance of one meter among the beneficiaries/persons in a queue at FPSs should be maintained.

The Minister further said that days of distribution of food grains at FPSs may be extended up to maximum period of the month so as to reduce the crowd of beneficiaries at the FPSs.

The meeting was attended by Commissioner, Food and Civil Supplies (F&CS) and other senior officers of Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department.

During the meeting, the minister observed that under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, masks and hand sanitizers declared as essential commodities. “The teams of F&CS and weights and measures department should regularly visit general stores, chemists, pharmacies, drug manufacturers etc dealing in the face masks and hand sanitizers to ensure that good quality masks and sanitizers are available and that these commodities are not being overcharged,” he said.

In order to ensure a better coordination among agencies, it was decided to associate the officials of Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department with District Magistrates for ensuring better monitoring the regulation of quality, distribution and logistics of masks and hand sanitisers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/manage-fair-price-shops--stop-hoarding--minister.html
44,22-3-20,Fight against Corona : Myths and Reality,"As India preps to make Janta Curfew a success today, it is time we realised that COVID-19 is spreading through our human networks and that a single person’s behaviour can cause ripple effect across the globe transmission. The onus, therefore, is upon us to check its spread, writes Dr Tamorish Kole

Myth: Coronavirus will disappear when summer sets in India.

Fact: From the evidence so far, the new coronavirus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather.

Myth: Taking a hot bath can prevent coronavirus disease.

Fact: Our normal body temperature is 97.5 degree F. Taking hot bath will only raise our body temperature. Additionally, extreme hot water is harmful for us.

Myth: Pets at home can spread coronavirus.

Fact: To date, there is no evidence that pets such dogs or cats can be infected with COVID-19. However, it is prudent to wash hands before and after handling them.

Myth: Eating Chicken or other meats can cause COVID-19.

Fact: There is no such evidence. However, eat well cooked meat and avoid raw meat.

Myth: Wear a mask when you step out.

Fact: There is no need to wear a mask for healthy people. If you have fever, cold and cough wear a three-layer surgical mask to protect others from getting infected. Seek medical attention as well. N95 mask is only required for healthcare professionals.

The novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV, now called SARS-CoV-2) causing the COVID-19 viral disease that has swept into 156 countries, which affected 191,127 people (as on March 18, 2020) and killed more than 7807 people is now officially a pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

It is for the first time that the WHO has called an outbreak a pandemic since the H1N1 “swine flu” in 2009. The 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was the deadliest flu season that we know of, infecting about one-third of the world’s population.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are known to infect both humans and animals, and in humans causes respiratory illness that range from common colds to much more serious infections. The most well-known case of a coronavirus epidemic was Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which, after first being detected in southern China in 2002, went on to affect 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths.

The COVID-19 disease appears to have originated from a Wuhan seafood market where wild animals, including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes, are traded illegally. Coronaviruses are known to jump from animals to humans, so it is thought that the first people infected with the disease — a group primarily made up of stall holders from the seafood market — contracted it from contact with animals.

If we compare COVID-19 with two other coronavirus outbreaks in the recent past, we will see that it is less lethal. With a mortality rate currently estimated at around 2 percent (a range of 0.7 to 3), it is less deadly to those who become affected than SARS or MERS. According to early WHO estimates, the average reproductive rate (r0) of coronavirus ranged between 1.4 and 2.5. That means, on an average, each confirmed case of coronavirus would infect between 1.4 and 2.5 other people. It is, therefore, more contagious than some of the deadliest airborne viruses.

India is one of the first countries in the world to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19 outbreak. According to Health ministry, India began screening people at airports from 17 January onwards, six days after Chinese state media reported the first known death from an illness caused by the virus and a good two weeks before the WHO declared it a global health emergency.

As on date, India has over 200 confirmed COVID-19 cases and is on Stage 2, which means we have only local transmission from positive cases. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) believes that we may eventually slip into Stage 3, where the disease spreads in the community and large areas are affected. ICMR also says that we have approximately 30 days window period to halt this transmission and that’s where our focus as a country should be on.

Till now, India has taken following stringent measures to address the problem:

Mandatory checks at airport and quarantine as required.

Blanket Visa ban until at least April 15, 2020.

Invoked Disaster Management Act to centralise the response and preparedness.

Invoked Epidemic Act for the same purpose.

Created isolation facilities across the country using Armed Forces and Paramilitary Forces facilities.

Carried Rescue Missions from China, Iran and Italy to bring back Indians who are at risk of COVID-19 exposure.

Indian Healthcare Sector along with Central and State Government is fully prepared to deal with the outbreak. However, we need to keep in mind that every country in the world is facing some challenges despite their socio-economic status as the virus is spreading very rapidly.

In today’s world, naturally fear is always the first wave of every epidemic. But, we must realise that we have had pandemics before, and we have responded to them before. It is very important to know what each one of us can do to fight against COVID-19.

WHO advises seven simple steps for every one of us to stay safe and prevent the virus from spreading to other people. These are:

STEP 1: Wash your hands frequently, regularly and thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand rub (use a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol, for at least 20 seconds) or wash them with soap and water (for at least 40-60 seconds). Wash your hands after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, before, during and after you prepare food, before eating, after toilet use, when hands are visibly dirty and after handling animals or animal waste. We use our hands to touch objects and surfaces that may be contaminated. Without realising it, we then touch our faces, transferring viruses to our eyes, nose and mouth where they can infect us. Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands, including the virus that causes COVID-19.

STEP 2: Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to avoid transmission of virus. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth and can then enter your body and make you sick.

STEP 3: Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough with the bend of your elbow or with a tissue. Also make sure that you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. By covering your cough or sneeze, you avoid spreading viruses and other germs to other people. By using the bend of your elbow or a tissue and not your hands to cover your cough or sneeze, you avoid transferring contaminated droplets to your hands. This prevents you from contaminating a person or a surface through touching them with your hands.

STEP 4: Avoid crowded places and close contact with anyone that has fever or cough, and international travel history in recent past. This is more important for people over 60 years of age or with underlying health condition such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart and lung diseases or cancer. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) of distance between yourself and anyone who has a fever or cough. COVID-19 spreads mainly by respiratory droplets that come out of the mouth or nose when a person who has the disease coughs. By avoiding crowded places, you keep yourself distant from people who may be infected with COVID-19 or any other respiratory disease. This is called Social Distancing and is proven a very effective strategy for containment.

STEP 5: Stay at home if you feel unwell, even with a slight fever and cough. By staying home and not going to work or other places, you will recover faster and will avoid transmitting diseases to other people. This is called Home Isolation and is very effective for rationing of healthcare resources to sicker individuals.

STEP 6: If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. If you can, call your hospital or health centre first so that they can tell you where you should go. In India the helpline number set up by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is: +91 11 23978046. This will help to make sure you get the right advice, are directed to the right health facility, and will prevent you from infecting others.

STEP 7: Get information from trusted sources. Stay informed about the latest information from about COVID-19 from trusted sources. Make sure your information comes from reliable sources — Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India website, the WHO website, or local health authorities. Everyone should know the symptoms — for most people, it starts with a fever and a dry cough. Local and national authorities will have the most up-to-date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

In addition, we also need to understand that so far 80% of people affected by COVID-19 have mild symptoms and recovered from the disease in two weeks. Most coronavirus illness are also generally mild for children and young adults. Treatment is similar to other coronavirus outbreak protocols with some drugs (Under trial) are now being tried in very sick patients. We do not have an effective vaccine as yet and therefore seek proper medical attention in time and avoid self-medications.

It is time we realise that COVID-19 is spreading through our human networks — through our countries, our towns, our workplaces and our families. In this spread, a single person’s behaviour can cause ripple effect across the globe. Let us be responsible and fight the coronavirus outbreak together.

45,22-3-20,Celebrating Raja Ram of Orchha,"Even today, the ancient legend holds charm in the quaint town of Orchha, says Navneet Mendiratta, as she shares stories from a festival that celebrates the land of the glorious Bundelas, its rich history, culture and cuisine

The past six months have seen a lot of action in the sleepy town of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh, India. The kind that you see before a grand event about to take place. The roads, all levelled and repaired, look as good as new; signages are in place, homestays model a fresh look, decorated with local Gond art… the excitement is clearly visible. There is something about the mood that takes you into a flashback, to the legend of Lord Ram’s condition to the Bundela queen, that he be made the king, if she wanted him to leave Ayodhya and accompany her to Orchha. This condition also makes Orchha the only place in India where Lord Ram is referred to as Raja Ram and worshipped as a king. Even today, there exists a temple dedicated to him called Sri Ram Raja Mandir.

Situated on the banks of Betwa River, Orchha is located around 80 km away from Tikamgarh district in Madhya Pradesh and 15 km from Jhansi of Uttar Pradesh. Jhansi being well connected, and as the nearest railhead, you can easily drive down to Orchha once you reach there. Built by King Rudra Pratap Singh of Bundela dynasty in the 16th century, this ancient town is famous for its Chaturbhuj Temple, Orchha fort complex, Raja Mahal among others.

The fort walk

The bustling Orchha Fort complex houses several palaces and monuments. That Orchha is sheltered by thick forest is one of the main reasons that the age-old monuments continue exist in excellent condition. It is this well-preserved state, and a clearly visible Mughal influence in the Bundela architecture, that recently put this historical town in the tentative list of the UNESCO’s world heritage.

It is recorded that King Veer Singh Dev of Bundela dynasty was a close friend of Mughal emperor Jahangir and even gave him refuge as support in latter’s fight against Akbar. The Jahangir Mahal inside the Orchha Fort bears testimony to the royal hospitality extended to the Mughal king for a night. This four-storey architectural masterpiece is a mix of Muslim and Rajput architecture and has countless rooms with arched entrances, balconies and latticed windows that frame miniature painting-like views of the monument-studded riverbank outside.

The Raja Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rai Praveen Mahal are three other palace highlights that make this fort popular among the tourists. Of these, Rai Praveen Mahal has an interesting history. It is said that Rai Praveen was a courtesan in Bundela king’s court. So famous was the beauty of this courtesan that Emperor Akbar summoned her to his court in Agra. It is said that upon reaching Agra, the intelligent courtesan composed a couplet for the emperor asking him why he should want to enjoy a meal that was already tasted. This earned her release to return home and a Palace inside the Orchha Fort.

Temples and chhatris of Orchha

Outside the fort, an impressive Chaturbhuj temple stands testimony to the King Ram legend. The story goes that after the grand temple was built, Lord Ram appeared in the queen’s dream, refusing to reside there. A section of the palace was then converted into the Ram Raja Temple, which continues to be worshipped so by people who come to pay respects to “King Ram” who rules Orchha. To date, no deity is worshipped inside Chaturbhuj temple.

A beautiful Laxmi Narayan temple is located very close to River Betwa, a 10-minute drive from the fort. Down the steps of the temple, along the banks of the river, are located the chhatris or the cenotaphs of the Bundela rulers. Fourteen in number, these chhatris are made in stone with domed ceilings, reminding you of a mix of Mughal and Hindu architecture.

Celebrating Bundelkhandi culture

Cut to present, the banks of Betwa river next to the chhatris came alive to the strains of Indian classical music and dance,with legendary Hindustani classical vocalist Shubha Mudgal opening the cultural evening with a soulful rendition of a bandish dedicated Lord Ram — Jab hari dhanush dhare. She was followed by a highly energetic danseuse Aditi Mangaldas and her troupe. A surreal aarti was offered to the river by dance group Sadhya creating magic for the audience.

Curated by Yasmin Kidwai of Springbox films, Namaste Orchha is an attempt by the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board to put this sleepy town on the active tourist map. Though the town has been attracting a fair share of travellers, most look at it as an ‘optional’ visit when they plan their travel to a more famous Khajuraho nearby. This unique three-day was organised earlier this month to celebrate the rich history, culture and cuisine of Bundelkhand.

For the first time, the town bore witness to unusual collaborations and performances by international artistes such as sitarist Smita Nagdev, fusion band Mrigya, bhakti folk singer Kaluram Bamaniya, Indian Ocean, santoor-player Shruti Adhikari, Kabir-folk singer Prahlad Tipaniya, singer Shilpa Rao, composer Clinton Cerejo and Franco-Spanish musician Manu Chao. Multiple guided tours of Orchha, such as photography tours, heritage walks, yoga sessions and rafting were held to get the visitors to engage with the locals and discover the hidden gem.

Crafts promotion, including direct engagement with the weavers, aimed to put the town on the textile map. Designer Anupama Dayal collaborated with the homestay owners and handpainted the exteriors and walls around town to lend an artistic touch and quirk to the stays.

What’s a festival without local food tasting? A unique food curation by Delhi-based food writer and curator, Anoothi Vishal, brought together noted Indian chefs like Vikramjit Roy and Harangad Singh to interpret Bundelkhandi cuisine and local ingredients in their inimitable styles. There was also a touch of the indigenous by home chef Vandana Dubey who put together a spread of Bundelkhandi food, including bada, thandula-aloo sabzi and tamatar chutney-bathue ka raita. Anamika Singh of Anandini Himalaya Tea gave Orchha its very own blend — Ram Raja Blend.

“The history and story of Orchha is too important and too beautiful to be dependent on anything or anyone to discover,” said Kidwai as she shared the tourism plan to extend the golden triangle of Delhi to Agra till Orchha, both for national and international tourists. “The aim of the festival is to get people to visit Orchha once. And we are confident that they would want to come back again.” There’s the temptation!",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/celebrating-raja-ram-of-orchha-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/celebrating-raja-ram-of-orchha.html
46,22-3-20,Balakot: a watershed moment,"The Balakot operation may not have stopped terrorists altogether, but it definitely sent a strong message to the international community, especially the one having ambiguous stand on terrorism, to make amends, writes Sanjana Mohan

Recently, when US President Donald Trump was in India with the agenda to push the Indo-American strategic and trade relations to new heights, there was unrest in the Capital, with North-East Delhi being the worst hit by communal riots. The same period coincided with the first anniversary of the Balakot air strikes, in retaliation to the killings of 40 jawans who lost their lives when terrorists — aided and abetted by Pakistan — attacked an Army base in Pulwama. To mark the anniversary, the Global Counter Terrorism Council (GCTC) held a round-table conference with Lt-Gen Syed Ata Hasnain, former Air Marshal Anil Chopra, Lt-Gen Satish Dua, former diplomat TCA Raghavan, Prof Amitabh Mattoo and retired police officer Prabha Rao as speakers.

Taking part in the discussion, Lt-Gen Hasnain reiterated that we should not look at Balakot in isolation. “We must look at incidents which are happening today and the incidents which happened on August 5, when the Government of India revoked the special status granted under Article 370 of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir,” he said as he reminded how it was only after the Uri terror attacks that India started taking tangible action on terrorism generating from across the border. “It reduced the strength of terrorists quite significantly,” he said.

Another watershed development of the Balakot strike was that it called the nuclear hoax paddled way too often by the Pakistani political and military establishment. It exposed the myth that any Indian ‘misadventure’ would lead to a war, more so a nuclear one. The conventional wisdom was that with Pakistan well equipped with nuclear weapons, it was suicidal to cross the borders. And if ever that happened, it would lead to nuclear catastrophe in the subcontinent. Balakot proved it was a well-crafted lie. For, it showcased there is several layers of strategic and diplomatic actions between a punitive strike on terrorism and nuclear warfare.

Lt-Gen Hasnain also questioned the notion that with Balakot we have done enough to tackle terrorism. “Actually, the thought should be that we have just started,” he said. “Now what we need in India is more of strategic planning through research, for which information is an important domain. It’s our responsibility to convey our narrative just not internationally but to our nation too,” he said explaining that a conflict doesn’t mean one operation followed by victory. “There is a whole theory of conflict where first comes conflict initiation, then progression, then stabilisation, then transformation, then resolution and finally termination. And in this theory, Pakistan is always a nice conflict initiator but worst conflict terminator,” he added.

Lt-Gen Dua took the discourse to history and reminded that India had never been an aggressor. “If we see the greatest emperors and kings, most of them fought within the boundaries and never were they determined in conquering the world,” he said, adding that in order to safeguard the unity and integrity of the nation, “we should make ourselves strong and kinetic when required”. Gen Dua also explained the inner dynamics of the Pakistan Army and how it controlled almost every aspect of Pakistani life, including economy. “In Pakistan, about 52% of funds are used for and by the Army, and less than 1% for education,” he said.

Raghavan too emphasised the need to move back and take a wider look at Pulwama and Balakot and the general aspect of how we can deal with Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. “Often tactical operations can be used to convey strategic messages and that we have very well conveyed through Pulwama and Balakot, but despite that we also need to move back and see the wider context. Seeing this through historical and political prospective what Balakot did was to send the message to Pakistan very similar of the kind which was send to Pakistan in 1965,” he said

The former Pakistani High Commissioner too said that Balakot alone wouldn’t be enough to intimidate Pakistan to cut off its terror tentacles. While reminding that India has added an element of unpredictability in its response to Pakistan, he cautioned against the impression that Pakistan had been successfully intimidated. “The fact is there are no winners here,” Raghavan said, urging the Indian establishment to again go to the drawing board and draft new ways to engage with Pakistan. “It cannot be just through military or through tactical measures; the political and diplomatic issues need to be addressed with political and diplomatic measures,” he said.

Former Air Marshal Chopra lauded the political and military leadership for Balakot. He informed how this mission, which involved about 6,000 people, could be kept under the wraps for the international community. “It makes me feel proud that this mission which involved so many people and so many days of planning could be kept away from public eyes.”

The Balakot operation may not have stopped terrorists altogether. It may not have totally convinced Pakistan to shun the jihadi path. But it definitely sent a message, and a strong one, to the international community, especially the one having ambiguous stand on terrorism, to make amends. Post-Balakot, it became apparent to one and all this in ‘New India’ any terrorist misadventure on its soil won’t go unpunished. It’s, however, just the beginning. The Government of India must always maintain its vigil and further build its security apparatus to take on growing terror challenges and threats.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/balakot--a-watershed-moment-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/balakot--a-watershed-moment.html
47,22-3-20,Astroturf : Watch your thought process,"A woman worried about her marriage prospects given her advancing age came asking the other day: “I am touching 40 this year, and yet I have not been able to find a reliable partner who would stand by me. I am fairly attractive to look at and professionally, too, I am doing comfortably well. What is it that prospective grooms find lacking in me? In the past, I came close to settling down with three guys at different times, but they all ditched me just as the marriage was fixed. What does my destiny have in store for me where marriage is concerned? Is it denied?”

Answering her questions, I told her that marriage was not denied at all. Rahu, the 7th sub-lord identified with marital prospects, occupied the 2nd house marked with addition to family. Rahu is conjunct the lagna lord Mercury, and in a sign owned by Moon, which occupies the 5th house identified with love life. The linkage of the denominators of the 7th house with the 2nd, promises marriage. Further linkage with the 5th house indicates a marriage of one’s own choice, which she has been vying for. For this very reason, she keeps rejecting the proposals offered by her family members. Here again, the 5th sub-lord Saturn, occupies the nakshatra owned by the Sun posited in the 2nd house, implying that she will develop relationship. But she could not hold on to any of them. The question now is why? Particularly when marriage seems promised. Was it because by chance she happened to pick up unfaithful love mates? Or, they felt that their chemistry will not work because of her habit tendencies? A look into astrological pointers to her personality traits will offer the right answer.

She was born in Gemini lagna implies that she may quickly develop friendships but will find fault with them equally fast. For, she wishes to live on her own exclusive terms. So, she may like only ‘yes persons’ around. Till such time people agree to her viewpoints, they remain her best friends for whom she may do all that she could do. The moment one disagrees with her on any count, she can’t digest. Mercury the lagna lord is conjunct erratic Rahu, and both placed adverse to Uranus. That makes her unconventional, eccentric, and opinionated. It also accounts for her insensible reasoning and judgment. If that would not be enough, even the Sun is placed adverse to Uranus, which further accentuates the above tendencies.

Mind signifying Moon is debilitated. It is conjunct mischievous Neptune, and also placed adverse to Jupiter as well as fiery Mars. This in the first place, makes her stuck to delusional dream perceptions, often distanced from ground realities. She may not be keen to look beyond for a reality check. She may not acknowledge truth on its first appearance. She may rather prefer passionately pursuing her own line of thinking on hope against hope till pushed to the wall. Second, she would be temperamental, moody, aggressive, impulsive, rash and argumentative. Third, she may be emotionally volatile. All the more, because the Sun is also placed adverse to emotions signifying Venus. That makes her too much touchy and sensitive. Even on trivial issues, she may get over exercised, and may stretch them beyond due, mulling over them for long. In the process, she loses her sense of objectivity and priority preference get compromised. Third, she would be domineering and live in a demanding mode, not realising that the world doesn’t necessarily move to an individual’s asking. Once provoked, she may become stingy and overcritical of others. At times, she may become mean also. Fourth, she carries peculiar beliefs because of which, she is often misunderstood by others.

Her love mates were good or bad, is beside the point, as their personality traits can’t be figured out through her astrological chart. But because of her own mental infirmities as detailed above, she would have scared them enough to run away from her life. She, therefore, in the first place, needs to understand that before blaming others one should look into own fault lines. Second, life can’t be lived just in a demanding mode. One needs to be accommodating, often ignoring some weaknesses in the other. In the process, their positives, that may be more, eludes one’s attention. So is said: “Watch your thoughts, they become words; watch your words, they turn in action; watch your actions, they become habits; watch your habits, that forms your destiny.”

55,22-3-20,R.I.P Nirbhaya,"Nirbhaya’s rapists have been hanged after ASHA DEVI’s seven-year-long fight to get justice for her daughter whose last wish was to live. MUSBA HASHMI catches up with this courageous mother who never lost hope in the system despite the roadblocks

They were hanged too

Before the four convicts — Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, and Mukesh Singh — were hanged on March 20,2020 at 5:30 am for the gangrape of Nirbhaya in December 2012, there were others too who met with a similar fate.

Geeta-Sanjay case 1978: It was a case that had shaken the nation to the core. Convicts Ranga aka Kuljeet Singh and Billa aka Jasbir were sent to the gallows for the kidnapping and killing of two siblings Geeta and Sanjay Chopra in Delhi in 1978. The two convicts had back then been recently released from Arthur Road in Mumbai when they kidnapped the siblings for ransom. But when the duo realised that the father of the siblings was a Naval officer they killed the children and not before the duo had raped Geeta. The two were executed on January 31, 1982.

Dhananjoy Chatterjee: He was the first to be hanged for rape and murder of a 14-year-old on March 5 1990 when she was at home. Chatterjee was a security guard with an apartment complex in south Kolkata. Chatterjee was born in Kuludihi, Bankura in West Bengal. He had claimed, repeatedly during his trial that he was innocent and that he had nothing to do with the murder, rape or theft. He maintained his stance till the day of his execution. The night before he was hanged he had requested for sweets and curd and a new shirt and pyjama that he wore when he was hanged – August 4, 2004 at age 39.

The seven years and three months long battle has finally come to an end. An end that will be remembered by all, especially those who are born without a heart and have the audacity to commit unimaginable crimes that put the entire human race to shame. The two feet that were yearning to see the sunrise like most of us, but was overshadowed with countless visits to courts and hundreds of meetings with lawyers, has finally seen the dawn. Now, she will no longer have to wake up every day and plead for justice for her daughter, which was not a big ask to begin with when her battle began in December 2012.

After an extended fight for justice, Asha Devi’s face that was always in a frown and worry lines was eventually filled with a huge smile not because of celebration but out of satisfaction that her daughter’s wrong-doers were hanged to death on March 20, 2020 (Friday) at 5:30 am.

“Last seven years have been extremely long and tough for us. Every day I use to wake up with just one thing in mind that my daughter should get justice. After completing the household chores, Nirbhaya’s father and I used to sit and decide who all we had to meet and where we had to go for the day. That was the only thing that we could have thought of all these years. Our efforts and the whole country’s prayers have paid off and the day came when justice was served,” Devi tells you.

It took a lot of courage for Devi to become a fighter mother from yet another voiceless woman from a village in Uttar Pradesh who never in her wildest dreams thought of standing up and raising her voice. “Until December, 2012 none of us knew what a thana looked like. We never got into any fights with anyone. All we wanted was to live a simple and happy life jahan ghar ki baat ghar mein hi rehni chahaiye. I have never been that kind of person who raised her voice. I have spent most of my life in a village and this was something that I or for that matter no one can ever imagine. Facing the camera, speaking in front of the mic and answering the media was initially difficult. But, the thought of what my daughter has gone through gave me the courage to stand up for her and do everything that I could. When Nirbhaya took her last breath in the hospital, I made up my mind that these sinisters should be punished so that no other girl will have to go through the same situation as my daughter. Saving my daughter was something that was not in my hands but protecting the other girls of the country and to ensure their safety is my responsibility,” she says with conviction in her voice.

She sounds exhausted when she finally takes the call at 10:15 pm on the day of the hanging. She tells you that she has been giving back to back interviews since morning. However, she gave up on a ritual that her family had been doing for the last seven years — candle march — due to COVID-19 and the pleas for social distancing. But she continued with the last interview for the day because it meant that the people and media never let her daughter fade into oblivion like so many other rape cases in the country.

Whether or not the death sentence will reduce the crime against women is yet to be seen but it will definitely send a chill down the perpetrator’s spine and make sure that before taking any such step they will give it a second thought.

“This is the first time that hanging has been given to the rapists in two decades. This will definitely leave an impact on the society and will ensure that rapists will know that they cannot run away from the judiciary. They can mislead the judiciary, they can delay the justice but can never in history deny justice to an innocent,” Devi adds.

In the wee hours of Friday, Devi and her husband, Badrinath Singh were counting every second. It was probably the longest night for them. “We were in the court till 3:30 am. After the hearing was over and the court dismissed the culprit’s plea, we went home and switched on the TV. All we were waiting for was the clock to strike 5:30 and the headline ‘Nirbhaya’s rapists have been hanged’ to flash on TV. We couldn’t get our eyes off the TV screen. That one-and-a-half-hour was the longest of our lives. We couldn’t wait to see my daughter get justice. And finally, when we saw that all the culprits have been hanged, I rushed to the other room where Nirbhaya’s photo is. I hugged her photo, looked into her eyes and said: ‘Beta, aaj aap ko nyay mil gaya. Aap ke aaropiyon ko saza mil gayi.’ I cannot put that feeling into words,” she recalls.

Devi says that the way society has stood by them through thick and thin and helped her daughter get justice, the same way it should support the other survivors too. “All my neighbours have been extremely encouraging and supportive. Every day at 8:15 pm we all used to participate in a candle march without fail. I feel fortunate that every Indian see Nirbhaya as their daughter. I hope that this is how all the survivors should be treated — with empathy and care by the society. The blame game should be only with perpetrators,” she says.

After the hanging, while everyone was congratulating Devi, what touched her heart was when a group of young girls came and hugged her outside the court. “I was almost in tears when I saw around seven young girls coming towards me with much happiness. They hugged me. It was a touching moment. This made me realise that how much faith these young people put in our judicial system and that it was not broken,” she tells you.

Not even once did Devi lose hope. Her husband, she says never let her break down. “There were times when we couldn’t see a way forward. The delays in hanging were disheartening but I never lost faith in the judiciary. I was confident that my daughter will get justice. When one of the culprit filed a mercy plea on March 19, 2020 (Thursday), I knew that this isn’t going to work and that the hanging couldn’t be further delayed. They all had exhausted all their legal remedies and the death sentence was confirmed. There was no other way that they could have extended the date this time round,” she says.

The fight is not over yet for Nirbhaya’s parents. Devi and her husband have to put some plans in place for their way ahead. “We will be working towards women safety in the country. It is not as if the fight has got over. We have to protect all our daughters. We will try to help the ones in need in whichever way possible. In the last seven years too, we have guided the ones who would seek our help. From now on, we will try and do this on a fast track,” Devi tells you.

Where they are

Closure for friend

Avanindra Pandey: Nirbhaya’s friend and the only witness in the December 2012 gangrape. He has since moved on. His journey through the ordeal has been quite terrible too. From being accused of taking money for interviews to be stinged on demanding a lakh for an interview. He later apologised.

The hanging should bring closure to Pandey who got married three years back, has a son and works abroad. His father, a well-known lawyer in Gorakhpur, refused to reveal exactly where but said his son was happy that all the accused have been finally hanged.

One who walked

Mohammad Afroz: The only rapist who walked free after serving three years in a juvenile home. Hailing from a village 250 km from Delhi, he left home at 11 and used to work as a cleaner with bus driver Ram Singh, one of the accused. According to a 2015 report, Afroz had been radicalised by his cellmate involved in Delhi High Court blast. An Intelligence Bureau inquiry on BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s letter to PM Narendra Modi saw to it that he was shifted to another cell but apparently there was no change in him or regret for what he had done on the night on December 2012. He was the one most violent during the gangrape. This is not all, before he committed the ghastly act, he had wanted to pick up another girl, the counsellor working with him had revealed back then. He also revealed that Afroz didn’t show any positive change and yet the system allowed him to walk free. Today, Afroz reportedly works at a roadside dhaba in a South Indian State under a changed identity. At the correctional home, for three years Afroz was taught to cook, paint and tailor.

No more

Ram Singh: The prime accused committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar Jail days after the trial began.

‘Focus on reducing crime’

Anuja Kapur, criminal psychologist, says that the hanging can only be seen as a research work and not as an implication that crimes against women will stop immediately after this. “First, our focus should not be on stopping the crimes completely because it is unrealistic. It is not possible to completely eliminate something from a society in one go. It takes time and efforts of one and all. We have to tackle this step by step. Our aim, right now, should be on reducing the crimes. Second, the hanging of Nirbhaya’s culprits is just a research work. This will help us see how things will change in the society. One can’t expect that this will hit the criminals hard and they will stop committing crimes,” she says.

She has a take on what AP Singh had said after the convicts were hanged. “The man has made such a statement because he wants to come into the limelight, that’s all. These people have no business but to pass derogatory remarks for women, there’s nothing else we can expect from such people. What made him question Nirbhaya’s character was may be that he has never learnt to respect women,” Kapur asserts.

The infamous defender

Ajay Prakash Singh is a Supreme Court lawyer from Uttar Pradesh but lives in Delhi with his family. A law graduate from the Dr Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow, with a Juris Doctorate degree in Criminology, he was been practising in Supreme Court since 1997. He is infamous for having taken up the case of two of the four convicts in Nirbhaya case — Akshay Kumar Singh and Vinay Sharma. When no lawyer took up the case of the other two convicts, he took up their cases as well. Apparently, it was his mother who made him take up the cases of the four convicts who were hanged till death on March 20, 2020.

In 2013, Singh had made an outrageous remark: “If my daughter or my sister in engages in pre-marital or meretricious relationship or if she lowers her moral standards and character, I will definitely burn her alive in front of my family members.”

The second time that Singh had made a similar remark was where ‘godman’ Chandraswami, had also played a key role in the bail granted to Swami Chinmayanand, the former BJP leader accused of sexual harassment, Singh had argued before the Allahabad HC that: “Both the girl and Swamiji had used each other and there was no coercion.”

Over the years Singh had left no stone unturned in order to defend the four convicts. He had filed over eight applications in various courts and even involved the National Human Rights Commission and the International Court of Justice on grounds that the death penalty isn’t an acceptable form of punishment.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/r-i-p-nirbhaya-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/r-i-p-nirbhaya.html
56,22-3-20,SC to hear plea seeking removal of Shaheen Bagh protesters on Monday,"The Supreme Court on Monday will hear fresh petition for ""immediate"" removal of the Shaheen Bagh protesters in the light of coronavirus spread across the country. The three-judge Bench will also hear an earlier petition filed before the apex court in relation to the case.

Judges Sanjay Kishan Kaul, KM Joseph and Sanjiv Khanna will take up the fresh petition for vacating protesters from Shaheen Bagh in the North-East Delhi on March 23 on a plea which has drawn attention of the apex court to the disease which has been earlier declared pandemic by World Health Organisation. Around 283 have been, to date , infected by the virus in the country.

A fresh petition was filed by Advocate Ashutosh Dubey and BJP leader and advocate Nand Kishor Garg pleading directions for immediate removal or dispersal of mass gathering at Shaheen Bagh health hazard posed by the coronavirus which first originated from China and subsequently rapidly spread to other countries, causing large-scale casualties. The fresh petition says coronavirus is a highly communicable, engulfing under its sweep all crowded public places. A committee of interlocutors who were deputed by the Supreme Court to negotiate with the protestors had earlier filed its report with the apex court.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's lawyers bodies - SCBA and SCAORA - have decided to recommend to the Chief Justice of India S A Bobde to prepone the summer vacation in the top court by declaring holidays for two to four weeks in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

In an executive committee meeting of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) held on Saturday, it was resolved that the summer vacation of the top court should be preponed and holidays declared from March 23 onwards for four weeks.

""Considering the various suggestions made by distinguished members of the EC (executive council), it has been resolved that Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court may consider the feelings and well being of all stake holders, declare vacation in the Supreme Court for four weeks beginning from Monday, March 23,"" a copy of the resolution sent to the media by SCBA said.

It said the executive council has resolved that further action in this regard should be taken after three weeks by analysing the situation.

""The EC also requests the court to adjust the lost days in the forthcoming summer vacation accordingly. The EC also resolves to inform the court of its readiness to help the institution at any point of time,"" the resolution said.

Similarly, another lawyers' body -- Supreme Court Advocate on Record Association (SCAORA) -- also held a meeting and passed a resolution saying ""considering the seriousness/severity of the present situation and to curtail the outbreak of the pandemic coronavirus (Covid-19) and with a view to safeguard and protect the members of the Bar, the Court, office staff and also the registry staff, it is resolved to unequivocally recommend to the honourable CJI to close the Supreme Court for a period of at least two weeks"".

The Supreme Court is scheduled to go on summer vacation from May 18 till July 5 during which vacation benches usually take up urgent matters.

The resolution of the SCAORA also made some suggestions in case the proposal for declaring holidays for at least two weeks is not accepted.

The lawyers' body suggested that filing of matters be completely stopped except for urgent matters pertaining to death warrants, bail or custody and habeas corpus petitions.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-to-hear-plea-seeking-removal-of-shaheen-bagh-protesters-on-monday.html

The universities and colleges have been issuing advisories to students to leave for homes and not stay in hostels as classes have already been suspended in wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

62,22-3-20,"Twelve fresh cases in Kerala, total at 49","For the second consecutive day, Kerala reported 12 more fresh cases of coronavirus taking the tally in the State to 49, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Saturday, even as he ruled out the possibility of community spread.

However, he warned of strict action if Government instructions were not followed to keep the virus at bay.

While six more people tested positive from Kasaragod, three new cases each were from Kannur and Ernakulam districts, Vijayan told reporters after a COVID-19 review meeting here.

“All those who were diagnosed with the virus today had returned from Dubai recently.

At least 52,785 people are in home quarantine, while 228 are under observation in isolation wards at various hospitals,” Vijayan said.

Three positive cases were earlier treated and discharged. On Friday also, 12 cases were reported from the southern state.

Vijayan again requested places of worship not to allow crowds during the regular prayer sessions.

“It has come to our notice that at some places of worship nearly thousands of people had been allowed for participating in a festival. We request religious leaders not to repeat such actions. We are also requesting the people to stay away from the crowd and those having symptoms should stay at home.

If they fail to follow the instructions of the state government, strong action will be initiated,” Vijayan said.

He also lashed out at the “irresponsible” act of the Kasaragod patient who had roamed around and forced even two of the MLAs into self-quarantine and said such people were working against the society. “The patient was roaming around as he pleased. Kasaragod district administration has published the partial route map of the patient.

Despite counselling, the patient failed to help the health department to make a proper route map.There is something fishy in it,” the chief minister said.

The district collector said the patient was not cooperating, Vijayan pointed out.

Meanwhile, a person who was asked to remain in home quarantine was found inside a Kerala State Transpot bus.

After passengers alerted police, he was shifted to a hospital. The KSRTC officials sanitised the bus before continuing with the journey.

The state government cancelled all lotteries in the state till next month.

As of now, Kasaragod is the worst-virus hit district in the state with 14 positive cases and the government has virtually shutdown the district.

When I first heard the narration from Imtiaz Ali, I was blown away with the story and was shocked too. Shocked because it is unlike any Imtiaz Ali story that people have seen before. Just to imagine this coming from his mind was an absolute discovery for me. Then he told me my part. It was a challenging one and I was scared to take it up but I am glad that I took the chance. I had an interesting time shooting for it.

From playing Jhunku in Chiitagong to Akhtar Lahori in Baaghi 3, how has the journey been?

Jhunku was my first screen outing and it has been a long journey since then. The journey was neither too tough nor too easy. I kept working and putting my efforts into everything I did. In the first two years of my career, I saw mostly failures. Then films like Pink and Gully Boy happened which were widely appreciated. It feels like it was an impossible journey but I am glad that I made it till here. Because it is not at all easy to come in the industry, do a minor role but still be able to leave an impact. Gully Boy changed the pace of my career. After the movie, a lot of work came my way. I am in the thick of things right now and I enjoy being here. It’s something that I have patiently waited for all these years and now I am living every moment of it.

What is your approach towards acting?

Whenever I take up any project, the only thing that I look for in my character or for that matter the story is there should be some truth in it. Even if I am doing fantasy or portraying a bizarre situation, I have to find a way to connect to the person in the story. I try to give some insights to the characters I play so that people can relate to them in a certain way. My approach is to say some kind of truth through my craft that people should find some connect with it and they should listen to me.

Your first short film was Shor. How did you come on board for that?

It was on-campus casting. Raj and Krishna DK were looking for some young actors to be a part of that for very little money. I was studying at FTII, they were in the campus, we met and they liked me. Then we went to Mumbai and shot for the film for few days. That’s how it happened.

Your parents were not happy with your decision of becoming an actor. How did you convince them?

I just didn’t bother convincing them because I myself wasn’t convinced that I would be able to do something in the industry. They got convinced once they started reading my name in the newspaper and then eventually watching my film with Amitabh Bachchan. That was like a sense of approval and validation for them.

Was there a dream role that you wanted to play when you came to the industry?

Back then I didn’t know what I want to play but I knew what I didn’t want to play. It is like you are coming from nowhere in the industry with no resources and you are digging your doubts of how things will happen, where to go, what would work for you and what wouldn’t and so on. But to give you the key to make your way in the industry is to figure out what you don’t like. That’s where I started from, I didn’t know what I like or what I could do but I definitely knew what I didn’t want to do. Like, I didn’t want to do TV back then so I didn’t go that way. I kept discarding stuff for some time. Eventually, I started finding what I liked and I started taking up projects. Even today, I still don’t know what I want to do and if I will get what I think I deserve.

What are your upcoming projects?

She just got released. Then I am a part of another series The Suitable Boy and have an interesting role in it. I am also a part of Hurdang. Then I will be a part of a sci-fi comedy with Anand Gandhi. I am also shooting for Fallen, an amazon prime series that will feature Sonakshi Sinha.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-seek-truth-in-stories----2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-seek-truth-in-stories---.html
64,22-3-20,It’s virtually a reality,"Looking for a destination wedding? Worry not. Step into the world of virtuality at a click of the mouse to solve all your woes, says MUSBA HASHMI

Planning your or a family member’s wedding can be tedious. More so, if one lives abroad and want to get married nowhere else but in his Motherland — India. In such a case, travelling to and fro could be time consuming and leaving all the decor to the organisers is the only solution. To solve all the wedding woes, Crowne Plaza, Greater Noida has come up with world’s first hotel virtual reality experience center.

“We have collaborated with a start-up, The Knotty Tales who have designed this platform for the wedding and MICE industry. The idea to brace this technology is that we believe that this is the future and we want to become a part of it before it becomes the past. Now, the customer doesn’t have to come to us, we will go to him. All the customer has to do is just open the link provided by the hotel and they are ready to step in our world,” Ashwani Nayar, General Manager, Crowne Plaza, Greater Noida tells you.

The technology allows the product to be carried to the doorsteps of the potential customers and allow an advanced way to explore a hotel like never before. One thing that makes it stand out among the clutter is 8K technology which has not been introduced in India yet but the start-up has made it happen.

“It involves virtual and physical inspection which means the client can experience 8K VR services that would enable them to experience a 360 tour of various hotel spaces from one point at the lobby. This will be a unique immersive and interactive virtual experience that would etch an impact the guests will remember for a long time. Also it would help customers to experience multiple decor setups while sitting at the comfort of their homes. Customers can visualise multiple decors for the same space, thus assisting them with decision making and positive closure of business queries. There is also a 24X7 live chat option that will help customers with all their queries and bookings,” he explains. This way, the customer doesn’t have to settle with what the hotel has to offer for their D-day instead he can simply just scroll through the different decors in several colours and decide what suits them best.

There is a reason why this unique concept was launched. “I would like to ask why not? This branch is one of the largest of the hotels in South-west Asia. It is a destination hotel for wedding and events. Also, Greater Noida is a popular destination among people. The major reason being its geography. It is situated near Yamuna Expressway that connects Agra-Mathura and Delhi, such a place is preferable among visitors. We were just the right hotel to bring forth this new technology to the world,” Nayar, who joined the hotel eight months back, says.

The start-up has been working on this technology for a quite a while now but it was in the India Expo mart that the two crossed their paths. “It was a casual meeting and I would say that they chose us. They had us on their radar as one of the first hotel to propose the idea to. When I heard the idea, I was sure that this would going to work and without any ifs and buts we decided to launch the virtual reality center. Although some people were apprehensive of my decision but I was confident that this would be a success. However, in the back of mind I was scared that how will we make this a scalable and monetised tool but once we sat and had discussions all my doubts were cleared,” he tells you.

Adapting to a new technology can be quite risky, more so if you are the first one to experiment, but Nayar believes nothing ventured, nothing gained. “Risks are always there but one have to be brave enough to take risks as long as one takes calculated decisions. For me, the biggest risk would have been inaction and not having embraced the technology,” he says.

Nayar tells you that the start-up is in talks with around 12 other hotels who could possibly adapt to the same technology soon.

“We don't have any problem with hotels embracing this technology. In fact, one risk could be when if we were the only hotel to embrace it. Because if you have to create an ecosystem, it has to be with every stakeholder including your competitor. Only if it excites my competitor, it will excite the consumer. So if other hotels are taking up the technology it is not posing a threat to us instead it is a blessing. The increasing interest of other hotels in the technology makes me realise that I have made the right choice and at the right time. Moreover, the tag of launching the world's first hotel virtual reality center cannot be stolen,” he says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it---s-virtually-a-reality-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/it---s-virtually-a-reality.html
65,22-3-20,‘Mirzya’s failure was disappointing’,"Saiyami kher, granddaughter of Usha Kiran and niece of Tanvi Azmi, who was seen in Mirzya, will now be seen in Hotstar’s Special OPS . She speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about her role and the truth behind Zoya offering her Luck By Chance

What attracted you to play Juhi?

Two things. First, I have never played a RAW agent. I have never done any action-oriented stuff. Second, it was created by Neeraj Pandey and I have always wanted to work with him. I have been a constant admirer of him after watching A Wednesday, which is one of my favourite Neeraj sir’s film, Baby and Special 26. I have always thought associating myself with this director.

Can the audience expect a Season 2 as well?

The team hasn’t told us anything yet but I hope that we do have a Season 2. This way the story gets carry forward and we get a lot f more stuff to do and experiment with.

There is such an extensive cast in the series. How was the experience to be a part of it?

This is the first time I have done such a project. It is always exciting to work with new people as you get to learn a lot from everyone you work with. For this series, I have spent the most time with Karan Tacker (who plays Farooq Ali), Vipul Gupta (who plays Bala) and Meher Vij (who plays Ruhani). Sharad Kelkar and I didn’t have anything common to do so we couldn’t connect much. However, it was an altogether great experience and I had fun shooting it.

A lesson that you took back home from the sets?

It was from Neeraj sir. He taught me not make a big deal out of everything what we do and to just keep it simple. This way the work can be done easily. Also, not to do unnecessary melodrama.

Your Bollywood debut film Mirzya didn’t perform well at the box office. Did it demotivate you?

Yes, it did. It is extremely disappointing because there are so much of efforts that goes into a film. But the performance at the box office is not something that is in our hands. All we can do is to just do good work. Going back in time and modifying things or doing the same thing again is just not possible. We can just wish that everything we do performs well.

Your next film Mauli was a Marathi blockbuster. How did you cope with the failure of Mirzya?

I am someone who is from sports background. I always took the failures to stride and move ahead with it. I believe in looking for other opportunities. Then Mauli happened with me and it was loved by the audience. So I kept on taking things as they came.

Coming from a filmi background, invite lot of compariosons. Does this bother you at all?

Fortunately, I didn’t have to face too much of comparisons because my aunt and grandmother are very senior artists. So there was no pressure at all. They were more like my support system. Whenever I needed any help related to my performance, I could just walk upto them and they would advice me.

Any actor or director that you would like to work with?

There are a whole lot of directors in my wishlist. Zoya Akhtar, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Imtiaz Ali are a few to name. And if given a chance I would like to work with Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra sir once again.

Is it correct that Zoya Akhtar offered you Luck By Chance?

Yes, it’s true. I was in Class VIII back then and so it never crossed my mind that I would ever be a part of this industry. Now, I wish that it should happened a few years later but everything happenes at its time.

What is there in the pipeline?

I have completed shooting for a film by Anurag Kashyap — Choked. It will release this year. I will be seen in Amazon Prime’s Breathe, it should be out soon. There are few other things as well.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---mirzya---s-failure-was-disappointing----2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---mirzya---s-failure-was-disappointing---.html
66,22-3-20,Slay your coffee cravings,"India is primarily a tea-drinking nation. But things are changing fast. Even though our per capita coffee consumption stands at 0.03 kg (2019), it is said that the coffee market is expected to register growth at a CAGR of over 12 per cent during 2019-2024. Not surprising given that each year, there is a rise in the number of coffee cafes across the country and new brands are entering the market. The latest brand to join the list is Slay coffee.

Unlike other cafes that are offline, this brand at present, offers coffee that one needs to order online through popular delivery apps. While many would find is cumbersome to order the beverage given our propensity to head to a cafe to chat or meet friends or even discuss business over a cuppa but the truth is that if one loves coffee ordering this beverage over an app is going to spoil one for any other brand or cafe out there.

Each of us have a favourite go to, but a taste of these new flavours — Go sin hot chocolate (hot), iced hazelnut choco latte, iced peppermint mocha and rose cold coffee are some of the must try. Many might balk at the thought to having a peppermint or rose cold coffee. However, it is just the the opposite. A taste is bound to ensure that that is not going to reach out to any other coffee. The flavours are not so overwhelming that it will drown the aromatic flavour of the coffee itself.

Lakshmi Dasaka, co-founder-COO, Slay tells you that months are spent on R&D. They have coffee tasters who give a feedback on the flavours that the brand experiments with.

“Another secret behind our coffee is aroma of the coffee itself. We use coffee where the beans have been selected from Chikmagalur and roasted in small batches each week. it is a supply-chain that we monitor minutely. None of the batches are kept with for more than 28 days,” she says.

The aim and the idea took root because the founders wanted to bring the best gourmet coffee to the customers sitting at home.

Since the brand offers coffee over an app, one can choose from options like an extra shot of the flavour or whether one wants sugar-free. Then there is the packaging itself. There is an adage: You eat with your eyes first. It holds true for this coffee as well. This coffee comes in a colourful and beautiful box.

An important aspect of any coffee is ensure that it is delivered either hot or cold. The packing has a kind of insulation that keeps the coffee either hot or cold depending on what the customer has ordered for 30 minutes.

Definitely, the graveyard black coffee is hot and strong. Those who are feeling sleepy and need a wake-up, this is the coffee to order. But if you like your coffee mild and sweet, this is not the coffee for you. No amount of added sugar is going to take that strong kick away from this coffee.

The brand also wanted to be environment-friendly. “We also wanted to ensure that we were not destroying nature. The packing is bio-degradable,” Dasaka explains.

The brand also offers a few eats to go with the coffee. Like the coffee menu, the food has also been selected on the basis of what goes well with the coffees that the brand has to offer. The items on offer may be limited, but the fantastic coffees that are on offer more than make up for this slight.

Next time you are in a mood to meet friends over a cuppa, try ordering online.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/slay-your-coffee-cravings-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/slay-your-coffee-cravings.html
67,22-3-20,China on virus PR offensive to mask its blunders,"The communist nation is supplying millions of masks and other desperately needed items to struggling foreign Governments, hoping to build political ties and defuse criticism that it allowed the epidemic to spread early on

As the fight against a new virus shifts to Europe and beyond, China is supplying millions of masks and other desperately needed items to struggling Governments, hoping to build political ties and defuse criticism that it allowed the disease to spread early on.

Serbia’s president plans to be at the airport this weekend to welcome a shipment of medical supplies from his “brother and friend,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Xi’s Government has flown gloves and protective clothing to Liberia. It is sending 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. More than 10 flights carrying millions of masks and other supplies are bound for the Czech Republic this week.

China, said Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, is “the only country capable of supplying Europe with such amounts.”

It’s part of an effort by the Communist Party to reshape the narrative, from one of early missteps to a nation that acted decisively to bring the outbreak under control. China is touting its deliveries of ventilators and masks overseas and dispatching its medical experts to share the lessons of its success.

China hopes to benefit from a realisation in the West of how difficult it is to bring the virus under control, said Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University in New York.

“The Chinese Government’s failures ... will be less harshly viewed in light of the failures of other Governments to respond effectively as well,” he said.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic blasted the European Union and praised China for offering help when he announced a state of emergency to combat the outbreak. His country wants to join the EU, but his Government has moved closer to Russia and China in a seesaw battle for influence.

“I believe in my brother and friend Xi Jinping and I believe in China’s help,” Vucic said. “European solidarity,” he said, was just a fairy tale.

EU officials denied they were stopping aid to Serbia, but said their first priority was EU members.

China has given $20 million to the World Health Organization for COVID-19 efforts. While the EU and the US have made larger pledges to combat the disease, they are now preoccupied by the crisis at home.

The Chinese “are winning points,” said Theresa Fallon, the founder of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels. “Serbia thinks that China is their savior.”

Six weeks ago, Chinese authorities were trying to quell outrage at home and condemnation abroad. The critics said due to politically motivated foot-dragging, China had mishandled the viral outbreak racing through a major province and its capital, Wuhan.

Now the criticism is raining down on governments from Tehran to Washington, DC. A visiting Chinese Red Cross official chastised Italy on Thursday for letting so many people stroll the streets of Milan.

“Right now we need to stop all economic activity, and we need to stop the mobility of people,” said Executive Chairman Sun Shuopeng.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

At one level, China is reciprocating assistance it received. Nearly 80 countries sent supplies to China, some on charter flights they sent to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan.

“It is China’s traditional virtue to repay goodwill with greater kindness,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, citing an ancient Confucian saying: “You throw a peach to me, and I give you a white jade for friendship.”

But at the same time, China is deepening ties with countries that have been receptive to its outreach as it assumes a larger international role. It is shipping supplies to Cambodia, whose Prime Minister Hun Sen has been an outspoken supporter of Xi and even visited him in Beijing last month as the outbreak raged.

China moved quickly to send experts and equipment to Italy, which last year became the first western European country to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The massive programme seeks to expand trade by building ports, roads and other transportation projects in a 21st century version of the fabled Silk Road.

China is ready to work with Italy to contribute to international cooperation on epidemic control and to the building of a “Health Silk Road,” Xi was quoted as telling Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in a phone call Monday.

“It’s not an accident that the heat map of where Xi Jinping is sending condolences and China is sending N95 masks overlaps pretty closely with those countries that have demonstrated a willingness to accommodate China,” said Daniel Russel, a former senior U.S. diplomat now with the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.

Opinions vary on the effectiveness of China’s efforts.

“It’s an open question how far that’s going to get ... but they’re clearly giving it the old-school try,” Russel said. The Communist Party’s propaganda, he said, has been more successful at home than abroad.

Clive Hamilton, author of “Silent Invasion: China’s Influence in Australia,” said that China has poured enormous resources into shaping the global discourse in recent years.

“It would be a mistake to underestimate how effective” this “major international campaign to rewrite the history of the coronavirus” might be, he said.

But Chu Yin, a professor of public administration at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said China lags the U.S. and Europe in its understanding of public diplomacy and has always struggled to convert humanitarian aid into diplomatic returns.

“If people really expect a big boost of China’s influence through the aid, it will be difficult,” he said. “In my opinion, let’s just take the aid as doing a good deed, and it would help China’s economy if the epidemic situation in these countries is contained.”",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/china-on-virus-pr-offensive-to-mask-its-blunders.html

70,22-3-20,"Maha records 12 new cases, total count mount to 64","Maharashtra, which has borne the maximum brunt of Coronavirus in the country, witnessed a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases on Saturday, as twelve more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in a single day, taking the total number of infected cases to 64 in the state.

Apart from one death, Maharashtra has so far recorded 25 per cent of the total 258 confirmed Coronavirus cases reported from various parts of the country.

Of the 12 fresh positive cases recorded in Maharashtra on Saturday, Mumbai accounted for a maximum of 8, while Pune—which is one of the worst-affected cities in the state – reported two cases. There was one confirmed case each in Yavmatmal and Kalyan.

Shockingly enough, one of the eight newly infected patients in Mumbai was working at the city airport, in an indication of the fact he might have contracted the virus owing to his exposure to people arriving in Mumbai from international destinations.

From among the remaining infected cases in Mumbai, six persons had a history of international travel, while one person had travelled to Gujarat.

In Pune, a 41-year-old woman with no history of international travel tested positive for Coronavirus, while 25-year man who had travelled to England and Ireland is the second infected case.

The person from Kalyan, who has tested positive for Covid-19, is the brother of a young woman from Ulhasnagar with history of travel to Dubai.

The infected patient from Yavatmal, who has been admitted to a Mumbai hospital, has a history of travel to Congo in Central Africa.

With the 12 fresh cases, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 rose to 64 in the state. Mumbai accounted for a maximum of 19 cases, while Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 12 and 11 cases respectively. The break-up of positive Coronavirus cases elsewhere in the state is: Nagpur-4, Yavatmal-4, Kalyan-4, Navi Mumbai-3, Ahmednagar-2, Panvel-1, Thane-1, Ulhasnagar-1 Aurangabad-1 and Ratnagiri-1. Of the patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier, a 63-year-old disease-infected had died at the Kasurba Hospital on March 17

Talking to media persons on the current Coronavirus situation in Maharashtra, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said: “In all, 285 persons with history of international travel are under surveillance for symptoms of Coronavirus. Till today, 1861 people have arrived in the state from Covid-hit countries”

“Since January 18, we had quarantined 1582 people with symptoms like fever, cold and cough in various hospitals in the state. Of the quarantined people, 1206 have been tested negative for Coronavirus, while 64 persons have tested for the pandemic,” Tope said.

Amid reports of people deserting their pet animals in fear of their contracting Coronavirus from them, Tope said: “Through our helplines, we are receiving complaints of people deserting their pet animals after apprehending that they might contract the Covid-19. But, we have so far no examples of any one contracting the pandemic from pet animals. Hence, there is no need for people to desert their animals.

Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP threw its full weight behind the Uddhav Thackeray government in combating the pandemic.

Talking to media persons, former chief minister and the current leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said: “Coronavirus is a national disaster. The entire country is fighting the pandemic. The State government is taking certain measures to tackle Covid-19. We are fully with the Uddhav Thackeray government in all its efforts.

Making a case for the Maharashtra government creating daily wage work for those who have been unemployed because of the pandemic, Fadnavis said: “The trade and all other activities have come to a standstill in Mumbai,Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur. In Mumbai Metropolitan Region itself, there are 50 lakh workers. The state government maintains a fund for the construction workers. The State government should use a fund of Rs 4,000 crore lying in the construction workers cess account to give some allowance these workers”

“The State government should also raise funds from voluntary organisations for creating jobs and providing allowances for jobless in the state,” the senior BJP leader said, while urging the government to draw up a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to deal with the problems faced by the unemployed people in the state.

Fadnavis also requested the people to take steps to ensure against the migrants to their native places in view of the coronavirus outbreak. “At railway stations,we are witnessing huge rush of migrants wanting to return to their native villages. The government has to take measures against reverse migration. The authorities have to also triple the thermal screening facilities at the railway stations to ensure against the community spread of the pandemic”.

Meanwhile, Tope advised people to respond to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call and observe the 'Janata Curfew' on Sunday, March 22, by remaining indoors.

Pune Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar also urged the people to extend 100 per cent support to the “Janata Curfew” called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from 7 am to 9 pm on Sunday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha-records-12-new-cases--total-count-mount-to-64.html

While Jail Minister Jyoti Priya Mullick said things would come to the fore after an inquiry, inside sources said that the under-trials were irked by the turning down of their application for payroll which they alleged was being granted to prisoners who were undergoing sentence.

Another reason for their anger was a bar on jail visits for the next one week by the relatives of the prisoners.

A general grievance for lack of facilities in the backdrop of Corona scare finally snowballed into a clash between the convicted prisoners and the under-trials, sources said adding the police and the jail authorities were also attacked when they tried to intervene even as the two sides fought with

brickbats.

The pandemic has completely upended lives across the planet, sharply restricting the movement of huge populations, shutting down schools and businesses, and forcing millions to work from home -- while many have lost their livelihoods entirely.

While President Donald Trump insisted the United States was “winning” the war against the virus, individual states dramatically ramped up restrictions, with New York and Illinois joining California in ordering residents to stay home.

The virus death toll surged past 11,000 worldwide, with 4,000 alone in worst-hit Italy where the daily number of fatalities has shot up relentlessly over the past week.

While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that young people were also vulnerable. “Today I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks -- or even kill you,” Tedros said.

“Even if you don't get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.”

China on Saturday reported no new local infections for a third straight day, and the WHO said the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, offered a glimmer of “hope for the rest of the world”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/worldwide-virus-lockdowns-as-who-warns-young-people----not-invincible-.html

The restrictions on the bank included barring the bank from giving fresh loans and acceptance of fresh deposits. Depositors were also not allowed to withdraw more than Rs 1,000 initially from their accounts but the limit was later relaxed to Rs 50,000, helping 78 per cent of the depositors to withdraw their entire account balance.

The Government in a statement said all international flights are being suspended for two weeks to curb the spread of the virus. From 8 pm tonight, “all incoming international flights are being suspended for two weeks,” a statement issued read.

National flag-carrier PIA however will be allowed to bring back its planes. Cargo flights will also be allowed. Earlier today, PIA had said all international departures were being suspended till March 28. Railway Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad ordered to reduce the number of trains running in the country from March 25 until the middle holy month of Ramadan, which would start around April 25.

“We have decided to suspend 34 trains out of total 142 running in the country while another eigh trains will be suspended from April 1,” he said. The Government announced the measures as the number of confirmed cases in the country jumped to 666 on Saturday.

112,22-3-20,Election put off as virus outbreak everts US primaries,"US elections have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic.

At least 13 states have postponed voting and more delays are possible as health officials warn that social distancing and other measures to contain the virus might be in place for weeks, if not months.

The states that have yet to hold their primaries find themselves in a seemingly impossible situation as they look to balance public health concerns with the need to hold elections.

While election officials routinely prepare for natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, the virus outbreak poses a unique challenge. “Usually when we are dealing with a crisis in elections, it's something that happens and then it's done,” said Chris Harvey, Georgia's director of elections. “The difference now is that it's a spreading threat, a fast-growing threat. We don't know where, when or how it is going to end.”

Primaries scheduled for Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Indiana, Louisiana, Connecticut and Kentucky have all been postponed to May or June. The Rhode Island Board of Elections has recommended the primary be delayed to June, while officials in Wisconsin are debating what to do. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has insisted the April 7 primary be held as scheduled, but a state elections commissioner said this past week that doing so would put people at risk.

The state's chief elections official cited a host of problems Wisconsin could face if it moved forward with the election: a poll worker shortage, lack of polling places and potential disruption of absentee voting if mail service in the U.S. Were to shut down.

All this comes at the worst possible time for election officials, in the middle of a major election year.

The virus outbreak erupted halfway through the presidential primary season. Voters in 23 states have yet to cast their ballots. While Arizona, Florida and Illinois held their elections as scheduled last Tuesday, Ohio halted voting over public health concerns after federal officials encouraged people over age 65 to stay home.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/election-put-off-as-virus-outbreak-everts-us-primaries.html

114,22-3-20,No need to rush Tokyo Olympic decision: US,"US Olympic chiefs said more time was needed to determine the fate of the Tokyo Olympics as a major US sports federation called for the Games to be postponed over the coronavirus pandemic.

In a conference call with reporters, United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) chairwoman Susanne Lyons said there was no need for the International Olympic Committee to make an immediate decision on Tokyo.

“I think we would concur with the IOC to say that we need more expert advice and information than we have today to make a decision,” Lyons said.

“And we don’t have to make a decision. Our games are not next week, or two weeks from now. They’re four months from now.

“So we are affording the IOC the opportunity to gather that information and expert advice.

“At this point in time, we do not feel that it’s necessary for us to insist that they make a decision.”

But just hours after Lyons’ comments, USA Swimming underscored the growing divisions within US sport on the issue by calling for USOPC to request a postponement.

In an open letter to the USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland, swimming federation boss Tim Hinchey said US Olympic leaders should “advocate for the postponement” of the Tokyo Games.

“We urge the USOPC, as a leader within the Olympic Movement, to use its voice and speak up for the athletes,” Hinchey wrote.

USA Swimming is the biggest US sports federation to call for a postponement.

The statement came against a backdrop of mounting unease amongst athletes over the impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on their preparations for Tokyo.

Several have called on the IOC to postpone the July 24-August 9 Games, noting that restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have wreaked havoc with training and competition schedules.

Lives ‘upside down’

Hinchey said American swimmers’ lives had been “turned upside down” as they scrambled to find training facilities or reconfigure schedules.

“Everyone has experienced unimaginable disruptions, mere months before the Olympic Games, which calls into question the authenticity of a level playing field for all,” Hinchey said.

USA Swimming’s stance found support from Bob Bowman, the former coach of Olympic star Michael Phelps, who said athletes were being placed in danger as they sought out places to train.

“My concern is as they are trying to find places to train and work out, it goes against what we’re supposed to be doing to not get the coronavirus,” Bowman told USA Today. “It’s forcing them to try to do things that are contrary to our national goal right now.”

Former US Olympic distance runner Kara Goucher, meanwhile, accused Olympic chiefs of placing financial considerations above athlete safety.

“Athletes are humans, they get sick!” Goucher wrote on Twitter. “Postpone so they can #ShelterAtHome w/o worrying about losing fitness to competitors!

“You are losing any credibility that you care about the wellness of athletes! Athletes over money please!”

The USOPC responded to Hinchey’s letter in a joint statement from Hirshland and Lyons.

“The USOPC has complete and total empathy for the athlete community as they manage the terrible stress and anxiety caused by the current lack of certitude regarding the Tokyo Games,” the statement said.

“We understand that the athletes have concerns about training, qualification and anti-doping controls, and that they want transparency, communication and clarity to the full extent possible.

“The USOPC has made it clear that all athletes should put their health and wellness, and the health and wellness of the greater community, above all else at this unprecedented moment.

“At the same time, and as it relates to the Games, we have also heard from athletes that they want the Olympic and Paralympic community to be very intentional about the path forward — and to ensure that we aren’t prematurely taking away any athletes’ opportunity to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games until we have better clarity.”

Hirshland told reporters that athletes were not unanimously in favor of the Olympics being postponed.

“As diverse as our athletes are, so too are their perspectives, and that adds to the complication factor,” Hirshland said.

“There are athletes out there for whom this feels like their only opportunity, their last chance. I don’t think we’re in a position where all athletes have a unanimous point of view.”

She said additional mental health resources were being made available to athletes as they grapple with “significant anxiety.”

“We are all living with a high degree of uncertainty and a lack of clarity, and we absolutely hope that we can have clarity as soon as that’s practical,” Hirshland said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-need-to-rush-tokyo-olympic-decision--us.html
115,22-3-20,Olympics should definitely be postponed: Sharath Kamal,"India’s veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal is in line to play his fourth Olympics in July-August but he wants the IOC to postpone the mega event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sharath, who won his first title in 10 years when he won the ITTF Oman Open last week, is in self-quarantine ever since he returned from Muscat in the wee hours of Monday.

With the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) suspending all events until the end of April, next month’s Asian Olympic Qualifying event in Bangkok has also been postponed indefinitely.

“As an athlete, I obviously want the Olympics to happen but it should not happen. The epicentre of the virus will keep changing, first it was China, now it is Italy and Iran too is badly affected in Asia. I don’t see the scenario being safe for the Olympics to start on time,” the 37-year-old said.

“Everyone is talking about social distancing but it is one thing which won’t be possible at the Olympics. Thousands of athletes would be staying in the same village,” he said.

Sharath, who is world number 38, and 31st-ranked G Sathiyan, are well placed to qualify on the basis of their rankings even if the qualifications event don’t take place due to the pandemic.

“There are no events happening at the moment so no change in the rankings.

116,22-3-20,ECB delay start of new season,"The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has suspended all professional cricket till May 28, delaying the start of the new season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ECB took the decision following discussions with the First Class Counties, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the Professional Cricketers’ Association (PCA).

“It was agreed that, given the current information available, a seven-week delay to the start of the season is the most appropriate approach,” an ECB media statement said.

The Board also announced that it is working on three new options, including the three-Test series against West Indies, the T20 Cup and the women’s schedule against India, for a possible start in June, July or August.

“Close liaison with the Government will continue, with discussions on the potential of starting the season behind closed doors and giving sports fans the opportunity to live broadcast action,” the statement said on Friday.

“The potential for reduced versions of competitions, should the season become further truncated, will also be discussed.”

The ECB said it will meet as needed to review the position and make further decisions as the UK situation unfolds.

ECB Chief Executive Officer Tom Harrison said, “The decision to delay the start of the season has been essential, given the circumstances the nation faces. I am reassured by the collaborative effort from across the game that together, we will make the very best of whatever length of season we are able to safely schedule in the coming months,” he added.

He said this would give the ECB time to keep pace with a fast-moving situation and continue to plan for how a revised season might look.

“Critically, we can also remain as flexible and adaptable as possible, within the obvious restrictions we face.”

Last week, England’s tour of Sri Lanka was called off mid tournament in view of the rising threat of the pandemic.

“Securing the future of the game will be a primary focus as we plot a revised schedule with an emphasis on the most financially important forms of the game for the counties across international and domestic cricket,” Harrison said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ecb-delay-start-of-new-season.html
117,22-3-20,CA may propose introduction of semis reserve days for Men’s T20 WC,"Cricket Australia (CA) may propose the introduction of reserve days for the semifinals of the Men’s T20 World Cup in the ICC Cricket Committee meeting later this year.

Earlier this month, the ICC had faced a lot of flak for not keeping a reserve day for the knockout stages of the Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia.

As a result, England were forced to make an exit after their semifinal clash was washed out resulting in India, the higher ranked side in the group stage, progressing to the final.

As the ICC’s current playing conditions stand, the men’s T20 World Cup, slated to begin here from October 18, will have no reserve days available before the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on November 15.

But, an ICC spokesperson said, according to a report in cricket.Au.Com, that playing conditions for the Men’s T20 World Cup will be discussed in the organisation’s Cricket Committee, which is scheduled to meet in the middle of this year, before they are formally signed by the Chief Executives Committee (CEC).

Should any of ICC’s member boards wish to suggest changes to playing conditions, they will have opportunity to do so at the CEC gathering, although it’s rare for standard playing conditions to be revised at that stage, the ICC spokesperson said, according to the report.

CA Chief Executive Kevin Roberts, who will be part of that CEC meeting, said a case existed for the inclusion of reserve days in the upcoming men’s T20 World Cup.

“There’s always cause for reflection at the end of any tournament or any season, in terms of how you approach future tournaments,” Roberts said.

He, however, conceded that there was a valid argument to maintain the playing conditions that governed the preceding women’s tournament.

“In saying that, there will be people who suggest there should be semi-final reserve days for the men’s. But I’m not sure how the English women’s team would feel about that, not having had a reserve day in their leg of the tournament,” he said.

“I would imagine the playing conditions are in place for the women’s and men’s events within this tournament (in 2020) and can be discussed and considered after that’s completed.”

He said the playing conditions were typically determined before a tournament starts.

“We have got two events here — women’s and men’s — within the one tournament, albeit staged at different times of the year,” Roberts said.

The last year’s men’s 50-over World Cup included the provision of reserve days for knock-out finals, in keeping with existing playing conditions for the ICC’s men’s and women’s ODI tournaments.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ca-may-propose-introduction-of-semis-reserve-days-for-men---s-t20-wc-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ca-may-propose-introduction-of-semis-reserve-days-for-men---s-t20-wc.html

Hafeez, who made his Pakistan debut in 2003, took a dig at Sharjeel on his Twitter account which has led to a debate on the PCB’s policy on allowing tainted players back in the national team.

Hafeez, in his post, said: “Shouldn’t we set standards of dignity and pride higher than any other ‘Extra Talent’ to represent Pakistan. Just Asking.”

He had also resisted the comeback of Muhammad Aamir to the Pakistan camp some years back when the board recalled Aamir after he completed his five-year ban for spot-fixing.

Another former captain Ramiz Raja has also voiced his concerns over the worrying trend of giving tainted a lifeline.

Ramiz said the board needed to draw a line as far as corrupt players are concerned even if they have completed their bans.

Sharjeel competed his ban last August and made a comeback to cricket with his appearance in the Pakistan Super League where his form was under scrutiny.

The opener was banned for five years, with half of the ban suspended in late 2017, for his role in agreeing to spot fix a game in the PSL earlier that year. He and another Pakistan batsman, Khalid Latif were sent back home from Dubai from the 2017 edition.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hafeez-takes-dig-at-sharjeel---s-comeback.html

I had not auditioned for the lead character but then the director liked my face and re-auditioned for the lead. This film is unique — for the first time a film has been shot on an iPhone. A lot of Hollywood directors have done this, but in India, we are doing for the first time. It as a bit of a challenge as we are used to facing the camera. The crew also had to get trained. We did workshop for a month and shot the film in two weeks. But it was fun and crazy experience.

You have a mixed bag of work. Has that been a conscious decision?

I love to challenge myself and try to repeat my characters so I can avoid being stereotyped. I did comedy; I did a web series — Bhaukaal — based on a real-life cop. I travelled to the place where he was posted and learnt body-language and other nuances of a real-time cop. Then I too up the horror project. I love to experiment with genres.

You have worked on TV, films and web series. Does that mean that you like to experiment with platforms as well?

What matters to me the most is the character and content that I am offered. Platforms don’t matter as much. It was much an honor to work with R Balki and Harman Baweja’s production for the web series. I have loved to be part of each and every project that has come my way as it has been different.

What is the attraction of taking up a project for a digital space?

The content that one sees here is so bold. There is so much more than one can do here. There are no restrictions, I don’t mean there is vulgarity but the boldness of the subject, there is no fear to experiment with a subject. We have the freedom to express ourselves. In TV, one is restricted by the channel and other guidelines. Even in films the Censor Board will cut a scene that they think is inappropriate.

How has the journey been so far?

It has been really good. I have had the opportunity to work with some of the best people in the industry. I am at a very good place as far as my career is concerned. My acting career is just starting.

What was your parents’ reaction when you quit your job?

I didn’t tell them for the longest time. I had quit my job to shoot for the show for three months. I never told them that I was busy shooting. It was only when the day to air the show was announced that I called up the family and told them and asked them to watch the show. It was a pleasant surprise that they fully supported me. I am the youngest in the family, maybe that was the reason. Now, my mother calls me everyday to know about my day.

What next?

There is Kaavya of course. There is a web series as well in which I play the lead. There is another project that I am working on; I can’t talk about it but I can let you know about my look in it. I have had to shave my hair and grow a beard. It took me time to see whether I wanted to take it up or not since I won’t be able to do anything else due to the look. It was a daring decision but I am glad I took it up.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-love-to-experiment-with-genres----2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-love-to-experiment-with-genres---.html

148,22-3-20,Step-up your moves,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with the judges of Sony TV’s India’s best Dancer to tell you what makes the show different

Dance can never go out of trend. This can be one reason why makers are not ready to give up on the format of dance reality shows anytime soon. While these shows is not new for the audience, but what makes them worth a watch is the talent from across the country.

Raising the bar is Sony Entertainment Television’s latest offering India’s Best Dancer. Adding to the charm of the show are the judges — Malaika Arora, Terrence Lewis and everyone’s favourite Geeta Kapoor.

Tagged as the toughtest dance reality show on TV, what sets it apart is the 90 seconds format. “The contestants will get only 90 seconds to give their best shot in front of the judges, to prove their talent. The contestant will have to impress us with their three ‘best’ moves in order to get their ticket to move to the mega auditions. From a large number of talented contestants, we will pick the ‘best barah’ ! Also, this show is different from any other dance reality show because we are not going to judge them only basis the number of flips, stunts and tricks in their acts, it’s beyond all of that,” Arora tells you.

All the three judges are expecting talent who will surprise them with their range as a performer. “We are glad that the contestants on the show are uniquely different from each other. The audience won’t see any similarity between two contestants. Each contestant brings uniqueness and variety on stage. And we, as judges, will ensure that we review them objectively as well as encourage them to realise and tap into their infinite potential. So far, the contestants have managed to intrigue us with their acts and only set the bar higher for themselves. We are waiting to be blown off by their power-packed performances,” she says.

Arora will be on a lookout for entertainment quotient in the performances this time. “We will be judging contestants based on three main elements, which is entertainment, newness and technique. Therefore, we are calling ourselves the ENT specialists. While Geeta will be evaluating them on the novelty factor, Terence will scrutinise their dance techniques, and I will be assessing the entertainment quotient in their performances. Lastly, we are looking at originality in their performances,” she tells you.

Kapur tells you that the reason she said yes to the show is that it stands out from other dance reality shows is that it is not harbouring duets, crews, groups or trios. “After a long time, a show is only going to showcase solo dancers, which hasn’t happened in many years now. It was high time that someone came up with this concept, and now here it is. Such a concept was much needed,” she says.

Internet has become a go to option for people who would want learn dance. But, Kapur believes that physical training is a must. “It is great that people are taking interest in learning dance and in case they can’t reach out to a formal guide or guru they are turning to internet. But I would recommend that there should always be someone who can guide you with technique because you can learn dance on the internet, but you may not know or understand the technique. Personal training has always helped me. There should be someone to keep an eye on you and train you with care,” she says.

Kapur is one of the most loved judges on reality shows. What makes her everyone’s favourite is the aura that she possess and the love that she showers upon everyone on the show. She says that she was fortunate enough to have been in the industry for so long.

“Every person has a story to tell, and I have been a part of this industry for quite some time now and I have a long story to tell. But to cut it short, all I can say is that it has been very fruitful. I have been trained by the best, worked with the best and that has helped me foresee the future of dance, and the creation and evolution of dance. I have had a blessed journey. I have never looked at my journey as a struggle; it has only been a learning experience,” she recalls.

Kapur admires a lot of people in the industry to name a few they are Gopi Krishnanji and Birju Maharajji. “They dance beautifully, and I don’t think there is anyone who can compete with them. Also, Farah Khan and Michael Jackson continues to inspire me till now,” she tells you.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/step-up-your-moves-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/step-up-your-moves.html
149,22-3-20,AI can better predict drug response to lung cancer therapies,"Researchers have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to train algorithms and predict tumour sensitivity in three advanced non-small cell lung cancer therapies which can help predict more accurate treatment efficacy at an early stage of the disease.

The researchers at Columbia University's Irving Medical Center analyzed CT images from 92 patients receiving drug agent nivolumab in two trials; 50 patients receiving docetaxel in one trial; and 46 patients receiving gefitinib in one trial.

To develop the model, the researchers used the CT images taken at baseline and on first-treatment assessment.

""The purpose of this study was to train cutting-edge AI technologies to predict patients' responses to treatment, allowing radiologists to deliver more accurate and reproducible predictions of treatment efficacy at an early stage of the disease,"" explained Laurent Dercle, associate research scientist at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Radiologists currently quantify changes in tumour size and the appearance of new tumour lesions.

However, this type of evaluation can be limited, especially in patients treated with immunotherapy, who can display atypical patterns of response and progression.

""Newer systemic therapies prompt the need for alternative metrics for response assessment, which can shape therapeutic decision-making,""

Dercle said in a paper appeared in the journal Clinical Cancer Research.

The researchers used machine learning to develop a model to predict treatment sensitivity in the training cohort.

Each model could predict a score ranging from zero (highest treatment sensitivity) to one (highest treatment insensitivity) based on the change of the largest measurable lung lesion identified at baseline.

""We observed that similar radiomics features predicted three different drug responses in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,"" Dercle said.

""With AI, cancer imaging can move from an inherently subjective tool to a quantitative and objective asset for precision medicine approaches,"" he added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ai-can-better-predict-drug-response-to-lung-cancer-therapies-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/ai-can-better-predict-drug-response-to-lung-cancer-therapies.html

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that 46 new confirmed cases were reported on the mainland on Saturday, including one domestic infection transmitted by imported cases in Guangzhou.

Six deaths were reported from China, including five from Hubei Province, taking the death toll in the country to 3,261.

Coronavirus epicentre Wuhan, however, has not reported a new coronavirus case for the fourth consecutive day, health officials said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 81,054 by the end of Saturday, including 3,261 people who died of the disease, 5,549 patients still being treated and 72,244 patients discharged after recovery.

On Saturday, 504 people were discharged from hospital after recovery, while the number of severe cases decreased by 118 to 1,845, it said.

The imported cases included 14 from Shanghai, 13 from Beijing, seven from Guangdong province, four from Fujian province and two from Jiangsu province, while the provinces of Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong and Sichuan reported one case each, taking the total number of infections from abroad to 314, the NHC said.

By the end of Saturday, 273 confirmed cases, including four deaths, were reported in Hong Kong, 18 confirmed cases in Macao and 153 in Taiwan, including two deaths.

Meanwhile, facing a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases from abroad, China will take strict measures to prevent imported cases, NHC spokesman Mi Feng told media here on Saturday.

He called for unswerving efforts in preventing the COVID-19 epidemic from rebounding.

Beijing and several other cities have already initiated stricter quarantine rules under which the people will be confined to designated hotels for which they have to pay.

Beijing also started diverting flights to neighbouring cities where the foreign returnees would undergo a 14-day quarantine.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-reports-first-local-covid-19-case-after-three-days--witnesses-surge-in-imported-infections-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-reports-first-local-covid-19-case-after-three-days--witnesses-surge-in-imported-infections.html
151,22-3-20,Trump sent letter to Kim offering help on virus outbreak',"US President Donald Trump has sent a letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, offering help with Pyongyang's fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the latter's sister said on Sunday.

The letter is a ""a good example showing the special and firm personal relations"" between Trump and Kim, said Kim Yo-jong, the first vice department director of the Central Committee of the North's Workers' Party, in a statement carried by the country's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), reports the Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency.

""We regard it as a good judgment and proper action for the US President to make efforts to keep the good relations he had with our Chairman by sending a personal letter again at a time as now when big difficulties and challenges lie in the way of developing the bilateral relations, and think that this should be highly estimated,"" she said.

""In the letter, he also explained his plan to propel the relations between the two countries of North Korea and the US and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic,"" Kim Yo-jong added.

North Korea has not reported a single coronavirus case, but was widely suspected to be covering up an outbreak.

The regime has tightened its borders and enforced tough quarantine measures on its people, according to state media.

Relations between Washington and Pyongyang have come to a standstill due to a deadlock in denuclearization negotiations following the collapse of Trump and Kim Jong-un's second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, said the Yonhap News Agency.

Kim Jong-un had set an end-of-year deadline for the US to show flexibility in their negotiations, but 2019 passed without progress and a warning from the North Korean leader of a soon-to-come ""new strategic weapon"".

Still, the leaders have appeared to maintain their warm personal relations, and in January, Trump sent a letter to Kim Jong-un to congratulate him on his birthday.

""In the personal letter, President Trump said he was glad to hear that his congratulations to Chairman on his birthday was correctly conveyed, and wished the family of the Chairman and our people wellbeing,"" Kim Yo-jong said in the Sunday letter.

""Saying that he values his relations with Chairman Kim Jong-un, President Trump said that there were difficulties in letting his thoughts known because communications were not made often recently.

""He expressed his willingness to keep in close touch with the Chairman in the future.""

The North Korean leader also ""mentioned his special personal relations with President Trump again and appreciated the personal letter"", she said.

Kim Yo-jong, however, cautioned against misjudging the two countries' ties based only on the personal relations of the two leaders.

""As they are the close relations between the two men representing the two countries, they would have positive impact but nobody knows how much the personal relations would change and lead the prospective relations between the two countries, and it is not something good to make hasty conclusion or be optimistic about it,"" Yonhap News Agency quoted her as saying in the letter.

""If impartiality and balance are not provided and unilateral and greedy intention is not taken away, the bilateral relations will continue to aggravate,"" she warned.

Adding that it is her personal opinion, Kim Yo-jong suggested that dialogue can only be restored when ""the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries, not merely by the personal letter between the two leaders"".

She also extended ""sincere gratitude"" to Trump for sending ""his invariable faith"" to Kim Jong-un.

The statement came a day after the North fired two short-range projectiles toward the East Sea in its third such weapons test so far this year.

153,22-3-20,Rly stations crowded on ‘curfew’ eve,"Covid cases at 283, States ready to ensure Sunday lockdown

Amid India preparing for lockdown and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal for “Janata Curfew” on Sunday against the backdrop of coronavirus pandemic and suspension of all passenger trains, massive crowds of passengers surged at railway stations across the country to leave for their respective States of UP, Bihar and West Bengal.

Several States, including Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Karnataka, have declared lockdown on Sunday and shutting down bus services, restaurants and banquet halls across the State till March 31 to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

As coronavirus cases in India rose to 283 on Saturday, from 249 on Friday, in various parts of the country, the Government has decided to change testing criteria for COVID-19 to include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history. Several States also reported fresh cases though these numbers were not immediately taken into account by the Health Ministry.

Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal on Saturday said guidelines for coronavirus tests have been revised, directing that asymptomatic direct, high-risk contacts of confirmed cases should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact with an infected person. Earlier, testing was limited to symptomatic patients with travel or contact history, and symptomatic health workers with contact history.

Cutting across party lines, Chief Ministers and other leaders urged the people to follow the self-imposed curfew from 7 am to 9 pm, noting that “social distancing” was key to breaking the chain of infection. No passenger train will originate from any railway station in the country from midnight to 10 pm on Sunday while all suburban train services will be reduced to a bare minimum as well. Metro services, including in Delhi, will remain suspended for the day. Air carriers like GoAir, IndiGo and Vistara have announced that they will be curtailing domestic operations on Sunday. Traders’ body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has announced they will keep their establishments shut across the country on Sunday. From suspending regular prayers in shrines of various faiths, including Sunday mass, to disallowing jail inmates from meeting their families on the day, organisations and institutions in every sphere have announced restrictions for Sunday.

In some good news, Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh, Vasundhara Raje and Dushyant Singh who had attended a party with Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor in Lucknow days before she tested positive for coronavirus, tested negative for COVID-19 on Saturday.

Thousands of passengers surged at railway stations in New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai on Saturday after the Railways announced it would stop its services across the country from 7 am to 9 pm on during the Janata Curfew.

As the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus swelled up in India, the Prime Minister on Saturday appealed people to take all precautions and avoid panic and urged people to avoid all “unnecessary travel”, saying ""small efforts can leave a big impact"".

In a series of tweets, Modi appealed to the countrymen to stay in 'home quarantine', saying people must listen to the advise given by doctors and authorities. ""Never forget - precautions not panic. It's not only important to be home but also remain in the town/city where you are. Unnecessary travels will not help you or others. In these times, every small effort on our part will leave a big impact,"" Modi said in a tweet message.

In another coronavirus related development, a couple was deboarded from a Bengaluru-Delhi Rajdhani train on Saturday after co-passengers noticed a home quarantine seal on the husband's hand. The Railways reported two other recent incidents when people asked to remain in quarantine were found travelling on trains. It said at least 12 people, including eight who travelled on the AP Sampark Kranti train on March 13 have tested positive for coronavirus.

154,22-3-20,"Delhi CM cuts crowd size to 5, says lockdown not ruled out","Delhi Chief Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday further restricted the size of crowd at a place to 5 persons, encouraging social distancing to contain the spread of coronavirus. In his first ever digital interaction, Kejriwal also said there is no lockdown plan as of now, but it can’t be ruled out if the situation deteriorates.

“In case there is a queue, people are requested to maintain a distance of 5 metres between each other,” he said.

“At times when Delhi Metro has decided to suspend all its services, a lot of public transport such as autos and taxis will also not be running. We deliberated on the decision to suspend bus services for tomorrow. However, suspending bus services will cause a problem in case of emergencies. We have decided that 50% of the buses will not ply on the roads of Delhi tomorrow,” said the CM.

Urging senior citizens to stay indoor as they are more vulnerable to the virus which has claimed 5 deaths so far in India, Kejriwal said, “My sincere appeal to all senior citizens. Please stay indoors. You need to take special care so that you remain free from infection. I urge you to skip your morning/evening walks for the time being.”

As corona restrictions have caused terrible stress to the poor, Delhi Government will pay Rs 4000-5000 pension amount to 8.5 lakh beneficiaries by April 7.

He said that there will be 50 percent increase in ration quantity than normal entitlements will be given to 72 lakh beneficiaries; the ration will be given without any cost.”

While corona is affecting adversely daily wagers , Delhi Government has ordered that lunch and dinner will be served free to each and every person at all Delhi Government night shelters.

“As few people who are advised to quarantine themselves and staying in luxurious hotels opted self paid facilities, the Government will waive off Good and Service Tax ( GST ) to make their stay more affordable,” Kejriwal added.

Kejriwal said, “The Delhi Government is taking all possible measures to tackle Coronavirus in close coordination and cooperation with the Central Government and the people of Delhi.”

“Delhi has witnessed 26 Corona cases to date, along with one unfortunate death. Out of these, 4 cases were spread by local transmission, and 22 cases had travel history. So, the spread of the virus has not been intense until now. But, we need to take all possible precautions. We have seen how the virus has spread in Italy, Iran, and China, and we do not want that to happen in Delhi and the entire country. I know these measures are causing a hindrance in the normal lives of the people, but this is the only we can save ourselves from this.”

“If you follow all the measures and Do’s and Dont’s that have been prescribed, such as not shaking hands, regularly washing hands, social distancing, staying at home as long as you can, we will be able to save ourselves and our family from Corona,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-cm-cuts-crowd-size-to-5--says-lockdown-not-ruled-out-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-cm-cuts-crowd-size-to-5--says-lockdown-not-ruled-out.html
155,22-3-20,ICMR revises plan to widen corona testing,"As the coronavirus cases in India rose to 283 on Saturday after a number of fresh cases were reported in various parts of the country, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has revised its testing strategy and, most crucially, asked hospitals to now test all those patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and cough and/or shortness of breath). It has also asked hostpitals to test those asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts that have come in touch with a confirmed case. Such persons will have to be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact of a Covid-19 positive person.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry on Saturday said at least 111 labs will conduct test for diagnosis of novel coronavirus across the country. These testing labs include both Government and private sectors. However capping the prices of the tests is still under discussion.

“Direct and high-risk contact includes those who live in the same household with a confirmed case and healthcare workers who examined a confirmed case without adequate protection as per WHO recommendations,” the ICMR said. The initial strategy of testing those with a travel history and showing symptoms, and those who came in contact with persons having a travel history will continue.

Seen together with the Union Health Ministry’s advisory issued to hospitals and medical institutions on Friday, it marks a significant shift in the strategy to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak crisis facing the country. The advisory had said no suspected Covid-19 patient should be turned away from any hospital and the admission of any such patient should be notified to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) or Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) immediately. It added, “Similarly, all pneumonia patients must also be notified to NCDC or IDSP so that they can be tested for Covid-19.”

159,22-3-20,Stranded Indian sailors off UAE coast appeal for help,"Eight Indian sailors stranded on a ship off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the past nine months have send out an SOS as some of them have fallen sick, a media report said on Sunday.

The sailors have been stranded without full wages aboard the MV Hoot, moored off the coast of Khor Fakkan since June 2019, Gulf News said in the report.

In recent days, two of them have reportedly developed a cold and fever while a third has contracted skin infection.

With no access to healthcare or medicines, the remaining crew members fear that it was only a matter of time when they will also fall sick.

""Our condition is deteriorating day by day. We are exhausted both mentally and physically. I don't know how long we could hold on like this,"" Suresh Kumar, the ship's chief officer, told Gulf News on Saturday over the phone.

He also claimed that the shipping company owed him several months of wages.

Jaspal Singh, 32, who handles engine maintenance, said: ""Two of us are running fever and our cook has developed blisters all over his body.

""We have to ration drinking water as we have no access to fresh water. Many of us haven't taken a proper bath in months, We use sea water to bathe.""

The sailors said they have written to various authorities including the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi but to no avail.

The offshore supply vessel left Hamariyah Port in Sharjah on June 1, 2019 but had barely reached Khor Fakkan when it ran into trouble with coast guards for refueling in mid-sea without permission.

""It wasn't our fault. The ship owner sends us a boat carrying diesel. We were just following orders,"" Kumar told Gulf news.

Since June 6, 2019, the ship has been anchored in the same position.

Vivo has not officially confirmed the new launch date, but the company has deleted the old tweet about the March 26 announcement, GSMArena reported on Saturday.

The company already revealed that Indian V19 will feature six cameras - two on the front and four at the back.

The rear cameras are said to be the same as the ones on the Indonesian V19 which was launched recently, but the 32MP front-facing camera is now joined by an 8MP ultrawide unit.

The device may feature a 6.44-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Dual iView E3 display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 409 pixels per inch pixel density.

Under the hood, the device is said to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vivo-v19-india-launch-pushed-to-april-3--report-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/vivo-v19-india-launch-pushed-to-april-3--report.html
163,22-3-20,Realme 6 Pro: Great value for money mid-segment device,"After creating a formidable space in the India smartphone market, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Realme is looking to disrupt the mid-price segment further, and has launched two smartphones -- Realme 6 and 6 Pro -- with the company's own user interface based on Android 10 software.

The device has been priced at Rs. 16,999 for the 6GB RAM + 64GB storage variant, 6GB RAM + 128GB storage option is priced at Rs. 17,999 and the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option comes for Rs 18,999.

The smartphone comes in two colours: Lightning Blue and Lightning Orange. Both the colours look good, but blue is the one we reviewed.

The phone is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 5, both on the front and back.

Let us see how it fares.

Realme 6 Pro features a 6.6-inch LCD display with a dual hole-punch cutout, which gives the device a fresh look.

Watching videos and playing games on this Realme phone was good, thanks to the big AMOLED display with 90hz screen refresh rate and proper placement of front camera.

The power button is placed at the right side and has been flattened in order to accommodate a fingerprint sensor.

The SIM tray has slots for two nano-SIMs and a microSD card, along with volume rockers which are are placed on the left.

Meanwhile, the bottom edge of the phone has a single speaker, a USB-C port, as well as a headphone jack.

There is a quad rear camera setup that includes a 64MP Samsung GW1 primary sensor with an f/1.8 lens.

The camera setup also has an 8MP ultra-wide-angle shooter with an f/2.3 aperture, 12MP telephoto shooter with an f/2.5 aperture, and a 2MP macro shooter with an f/2.4 aperture.

The combination of sensors captured decent photos -- pretty good via an under Rs 20,000 smartphone.

At night, we found the primary camera excellent in artificial lights. Night Mode was surprisingly effective and helped balance the brightness.

For selfies and video chat, the Realme 6 Pro comes with the dual hole-punch selfie camera setup that consists of a 16MP Sony IMX471 primary sensor with an f/2.0 lens and an 8MP secondary sensor with an ultra-wide-angle f/2.2 lens that has a field-of-view (FoV) of 105 degrees.

The front camera is fairly good -- in daytime as well as at night -- with proper detailing and portrait shots had nicely blurred backgrounds.

The Realme 6 Pro can shoot videos at up to 4K, but only at 30fps and video shot also looked fine, with good stabilisation.

The phone packs Octa-core Snapdragon 720G SoC, along with Adreno 618 GPU and up to 8GB of LPDDR4x dual-channel RAM.

Since Snapdragon 720G SoC is a newer chip, it also has new features such as support for Bluetooth 5.1, NavIC satellite navigation, and a more power-efficient Sensing Hub.

The device was powerful enough to handle anything from basic calls to heavy gaming without any trouble.

Apart from PUBG, we also played ‘Call of Duty' on high settings without any lag.

Additionally, the device runs Android 10 OS and the OS has Realme UI customization over it.

The 4,300 mAh battery capacity on the Realme 6 Pro is pretty standard.

The device also has 30W fast VOOC 4.0 fast charging.

Conclusion: With good camera and best-in-class performance, Realme 6 Pro is one of the best smartphones in mid-price segment and a tough challenger for Redmi Note 9 Pro and Note 9 Pro Max.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/realme-6-pro--great-value-for-money-mid-segment-device-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/realme-6-pro--great-value-for-money-mid-segment-device.html

168,22-3-20,"Iran announces 129 new coronavirus deaths, raising toll to 1685","Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets.

But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic.

“I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.”

He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.”

“You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said.

There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments.

However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!”

Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain.

Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed.

An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.”

Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak.

His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday.

Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries.

Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003.

Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed.

Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves.

Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.”

Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open.

In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities.

And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-announces-129-new-coronavirus-deaths--raising-toll-to-1685-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-announces-129-new-coronavirus-deaths--raising-toll-to-1685.html

172,22-3-20,Aaditi Pohankar: 'She' has been an exciting journey,"Playing the protagonist in the new web series ""She"" has been an exciting journey for Aaditi Pohankar. The ""Lai Bhaari"" fame actress plays the lead character on the show.

Aaditi's character in the Imtiaz Ali-scripted show is called Bhumika Pardesi. She is a lady constable who has to pose as a prostitute to help the police force nab a dreaded narcotics dealer.

""What I understood about Bhumika Pardesi is that she is a timid person going through the mundane rhythm of life, where she goes to work and comes back home. When she goes home, where she is with her family, she becomes her real life. She is melancholic, rather masochistic at times,"" the actress told IANS, describing her character.

The antagonist is a dreaded narcotics dealer named Sasya, played by Vijay Varma.

Talking about how the two characters are interrelated, the actress said: ""Sasya is a catalyst in Bhumika's life in a strong way. As Bhumika goes ahead, she is just understanding herself. From being timid, she is realising that it is okay to be what she is being now and it's okay sometimes to think about Sasya. Nobody is watching her.""

In what way was becoming Bhumika a challenge for her? ""Challenge is very subjective. It's so much fun! I don't like to go on those scary rides, I would rather go on that ride within my script. I would like to go and not look where I am going to reach but I still want to take that leap, and I want to keep falling down that valley till I feel free. And I feel free at times with that character. Like with Bhumika at times I was just sitting and it did work out very well,"" Aaditi replied.

""It was not very challenging but of course all the credit goes to Imtiaz sir (Ali) with the great rehearsals that we did, with the amount of talking that we did on it. And of course with Arif sir (Arif Ali, director) and Avinash sir (Avinash Das, director) , it didn't feel like a challenge. It has been an exciting journey,"" she concluded.

Directed by Arif Ali and Avinash Das, the web series has premiered on Netflix on March 20.

185,22-3-20,"Iran leader refuses US help, citing virus conspiracy theory","Iran's supreme leader refused US assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments come as Iran faces crushing US sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets.

But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic.

“I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?"" Khamenei said.

""Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,"" he said.

There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei's comments.

However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China's ambassador to complain.

Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. Senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed.

An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.”

Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak.

His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday.

Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries.

Iranian officials have criticized US offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. Has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003.

Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran's government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed.

Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the September 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida's role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves.

Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,"" while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open.

In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities.

And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.M. To 4 a.M., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-leader-refuses-us-help--citing-virus-conspiracy-theory-2020-03-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/iran-leader-refuses-us-help--citing-virus-conspiracy-theory.html
