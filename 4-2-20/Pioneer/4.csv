0,04-2-20,More innovative thinking needed,"The Budget sets our fiscal policies. Therefore, there were major expectations of initiatives to handle the economic crunch

Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman revealed a wide range of policy initiatives in her Budget speech on February 1 but people paid more attention to the restructuring of income tax slabs because this has a tangible effect which everyone can realise. The Budget was presented in the backdrop of an economic slowdown, decline in consumption and a poor investment environment. Though all the issues cannot be tackled by the Centre alone, the Budget sets the fiscal policies of the Government. Therefore, there were major expectations of some out-of-the-box initiatives by the Centre to handle the current crunch.

Allocation and tax structure: Major tax cuts for the corporate sector were announced five months ago. Therefore, their wish-list included other structural reforms. Though we are yet to see any positive impact of the previous rate cut, the FM has announced abolition of the dividend distribution tax, which will put pressure on collections. Decline in domestic demand and sluggish export are causing underutilisation of production capacity and mere tax cuts will not solve India’s economic problems. If the installed capacity is lying idle, then it makes no sense for any businessman to incur fresh capex and therefore, the dividend distribution tax should have been kept for the time being and this money could have been used for public investment. The Government should have refrained from taking decisions merely on the basis of stock market sentiments because such measures are not going to solve macroeconomic problems. The Economic Survey cautions that higher non-tax revenue is not sustainable year after year.

The Government has factored 10 per cent nominal GDP growth for the coming fiscal while calculating expected tax receipts. Disinvestment proceeds are expected to fetch 2.1 lakh crore, which is too ambitious. That the Government is also aware of the extent of the problem can be seen from the Budget documents in which indirect taxes for the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 are less than the original estimates for the FY 2019-20. The fiscal deficit target for next year has been kept at 3.8 per cent of the GDP and this is dependent on tax buoyancy projected by the Government and realisation of non-tax receipts (like disinvestment proceeds). If revenue targets are not met, then the Government will approach the market for borrowing, which will negatively affect the bond yield movement. Given the small number of taxpayers who will benefit from the tax slab restructuring, it would be too optimistic to believe that a marginal tax cut would boost consumption. Though this slab restructuring was announced as a measure to simplify the tax structure, it has its own complications as people are expected to give up exemptions which are available now. This announcement can impact domestic savings, which are already declining and have come down to 30.5 per cent of the GDP for FY 2017-18 from 32.1 per cent in FY 2013-14. A fall in domestic savings will make us more dependent on foreign investment.

Budgetary allocations: The FM deserves credit for continuing to push capital expenditure, which has now been set at 1.8 per cent of the GDP as compared to 1.7 per cent during the FY 2019-20. The total investment in roads and highways has gone up more than three times in the five-year period of 2014-15 to 2018-19. The Corruption Perception Index shows that India has significantly improved its ranking, which supports the Centre’s claim of improving governance.

Other policy initiatives: Banks are an important institution for any economy and growth comes from increased monetary activities for which money is provided by financial institutions. But the balance sheet issue is still haunting Public Sector Banks (PSB) and the Economic Survey has highlighted that banks may remain risk-averse unless the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code proceedings speed up. In 2019, every rupee invested in PSBs led to a loss of 23 paisa, contrary to a gain of 9.6 paisa by private lenders, which tells the story of Government lenders. In January, the Government assured public lenders that prudent commercial decision-making would be protected. Various measures were taken in the past to improve the liquidity situation and now the Budget has proposed to increase the Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) limit in corporate bonds from nine per cent to 15 per cent. This will help in the development of a bond market for corporates and increase fund availability and reduce their cost. On the investors’ protection issue, the Budget has proposed to hike deposit insurance cover from 1 lakh to 5 lakh, which was needed for the protection of small depositors.

In the previous Budget, the Sabka Vishwas scheme for settlement of indirect tax-related disputes was announced and the Government is expected to receive 39,500 crore, which is higher than the estimated collection. More than 8.02 lakh crore of income tax dues are under dispute and the new amnesty scheme, Vivad se Vishwas, which was announced on February 1, will minimise litigations. Faceless appeal is also on its way after introduction of faceless assessment and these steps will reduce corruption. Introduction of tax charter and announcement related to decriminalisation of offences under the Companies Act, 2013 are good steps directed towards governance. The Budget contains one out-of-the-box idea relating to tax residency of individuals by amending Section 6 of the Income Tax Act. People used to avoid paying taxes by manipulating their residency status and now they will have to pay it in India if they are not liable to tax in any other country. This is a good step but more such initiatives are the need of the hour.

1,04-2-20,War against terror has to be fought in the mind,"Words alone may not have the potency to win battles but they definitely have the strength to rupture the very existence of terrorist outfits that constantly take advantage of naïve, god-fearing people

Recently, a group of terrorists, travelling in a Srinagar-bound truck on the Jammu-Srinagar highway, opened fire at a police team when stopped for checking near a toll plaza in the Ban area of Nagrota, North of Jammu. In the ensuing gunfight, a policeman was injured and a militant was killed, while the rest of the terrorists managed to escape to the adjacent forests. This brings us back to the question whether there is an effective strategy to win against terror outfits? While the security forces have been countering them, there has been no let-up in the attempts by the ultras to strike. One slip-up and there could be a major catastrophe. This clearly indicates that this battle against terror outfits, based on extreme ideologies cannot be won by the security forces alone.

History stands witness to extremist ideologies breeding violence. These extreme ideologies could be Marxist, religion-based or even nationalist. In the second half of the 20th century, the major threat emanated from various outfits influenced by radical Marxist thoughts. In contemporary times, the threat from the radical Marxist ideology appears to have declined and the biggest threat in the 21st century emanates from jihadi outfits that believe in their own radical Islamist ideology. There have been many attempts by Western academics to find raison d’être for terror outfits by justifying their existence on socio-political discrimination or economic deprivation. While doing so, there has been a strong tendency to undermine the theological underpinnings of such outfits. Right or wrong, these groups have an Islamic world view, which entails creation of a global Islamic Emirate. Consequently, groups like the Al Qaeda and Islamic State (ISIS) have shown least concern about the Palestinian problem.

Consequently, to imagine peace without taking into cognisance the theological factors is a mistake. An appropriate example is the Al Qaeda and Taliban matrix. The Al Qaeda wants to wage a jihad which can only happen under a righteous leader or Amir-ul-Mumineen, as per their theological beliefs. The Amir has never been the leader of the Al Qaeda. Neither Osama bin Laden nor Ayman al Jawahir claimed to be the Amir. This exalted position was earlier held by Mullah Omar and now by Mullah Akhundzada, the present leader of the Taliban. Any peace negotiated with the Taliban would, therefore, render Al Qaeda’s jihad theocratically and theologically illegitimate. It is, therefore, obvious that the Al Qaeda will not let the Taliban arrive at a lasting negotiated settlement. More significantly, if the Taliban comes to power in Afghanistan, it will not confine its radical ideology to the territorial frontiers of Afghanistan. An ideological outfit would like to propagate its ideology all around and, therefore, there is no feasibility of ushering in peace by negotiating with the Taliban, notwithstanding the recent attempts by the Trump Administration to reach out to them. On October 28, 2019, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-styled caliph of the ISIS was killed. This caliph is dead but his caliphate lives on. The territorial control of the caliphate may have diminished but the influence by no stretch of imagination has vanished. There are outfits across the globe owing their allegiance to it.

Ideology-based outfits cannot be countered by bombs and bullets. This battle has to be fought in the mind. Hence, the need for an alternate or counter-narrative, which needs to be propagated in a subtle manner. For the narrative to be effective, it needs to be seeped in theology.

This attempt cannot stop at merely countering the theological warfare waged by the radicalised groups. There is an equally pressing need to popularise an alternate narrative with peaceful preaching, which aims at holistic understanding and does not stop at just countering the arguments put forth by the extremist groups.

This alternate or counter-narrative cannot be country-specific. With the modern state resting on civilisational crossroads, these narratives have to be specific to a region. In furtherance of their commitment to fight terrorism and create an ecosystem for shared progress and development, the states must collaborate and prepare a potent alternate or counter-narrative, which can only be created by those with good knowledge of history or theology. Quotes from religious texts, scriptures and teachings, as well as incidents from Islamic history must be used, so that people are not influenced by the violent narratives of ideology-based terror groups.

Fighting these elements is a long battle, not a short war. It is not to argue that popularising alternate or counter-narratives is the only weapon available to the state. A state must constantly strategise to weaken the strong footholds of the terrorist groups. It must deploy its resources judiciously to gain control over territory and curtail their avenues of expansion.

However, the long-term solution undoubtedly, lies in developing a comprehensive strategy to delegitimise their cause. Alternate or counter-narrative is one of the more important factors that will make the vulnerable people sitting on the margins, critically think against the arguments propounded by the extreme religious ideology- based terrorist outfits.

Words alone may not have the potency to win battles but they definitely have the strength to rupture the very existence of such terrorist outfits that constantly take advantage of naïve, god-fearing people.

5,04-2-20,SAD to meet Guv to urge withdrawal of Punjab’s affidavit,"Lashing out at the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government’s stand in the court seeking separate gurudwara body for Haryana, the Shiromani Akali Dal core committee on Monday decided to approach the Governor VP Singh Badnore to urge him to order withdrawal of Government’s affidavit regarding the same.

The core committee, passing a resolution, described Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress Government’s revised affidavit endorsing the setting up of a separate Sikh religious body in Haryana as “the continuation of old and deep-rooted conspiracies by the enemies of the Khalsa Panth to strike at the sources of the spiritual strength of the Sikh quom by weakening, dissolving or grabbing the control of the supreme Sikh religious parliament, the SGPC”.

Through a separate resolution, the party decided to submit a memorandum to the Punjab Governor drawing his attention to the fact that the State Government’s fresh affidavit is not only a U-turn on the affidavit submitted by the State Government earlier but was also fraught with serious consequences as it amounted to a brazen interference in the religious affairs the Khalsa Panth.

SAD pointed out that the Capt Amarinder’s affidavit is “legally and constitutionally weird in that it runs directly opposite to the State Government’s earlier affidavit on this issue which had opposed the breaking up of the SGPC with a separate religious body in Haryana”.

The core committee also decided to ask the state Governor to intervene in the highly sensitive case pertaining to the death of a key witness in the Behbal Kalan case under mysterious circumstances, said the party spokesperson Harcharan Singh Bains after the meeting.

Bainsa said that the party would draw the attention of the Governor to the grave allegations leveled by the wife of the deceased witness of the Behbal Kalan case. She has leveled most damning allegations against the two Congress leaders, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon and Gurpreet Singh Kangar, noted the core committee.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-to-meet-guv-to-urge-withdrawal-of-punjab---s-affidavit.html
6,04-2-20,15 Hry MLAs get notice for not paying hostel rent,"The Haryana Vidhan Sabha has put 15 Haryana MLAs on notice for defaulting on the payment of room rent of the MLAs’ hostel, located in Sector 3 in Chandigarh.

The MLAs to whom the notices have been issued are from Congress, Jannayak Janata Party and Bharatiya Janata Party.

Sources in the Vidhan Sabha said that notices have been issued to MLAs for the recovering of the dues of room rent of the MLAs’ hostel without delay.

Assembly Speaker Gyan Chand Gupta along with officials visited the MLAs’ hostel to see the system there. After this, information was collected and 15 MLAs have been asked to deposit the amount without delay.

Sources said that Speaker received complaints from MLAs that on many occasions, rooms in the MLAs’ hostel were not available for them. In some cases, MLAs book rooms in MLAs’ hostel in their own name and keep the key with them. Instead of MLAs, their relatives or workers stay in these rooms.

Recently a drug peddler was arrested with heroin by the Haryana Police and in course of interrogation it was revealed that he stayed in MLA’s hostel a few days ago.

The Haryana Assembly Speaker has taken a serious view of legislators and their acquaintances not making timely payment for their stay at the hostel.

Talking to The Pioneer, Gupta on Monday said that he served notice to 15 MLAs for not depositing the dues of MLA Hostel rooms.

The notices has been issued to make immediate payment of the pending room rent, besides vacating the rooms in case they were still being occupied by any persons.

The Speaker said that he had received several complaints regarding this. ""It has been reported that recently that a drug peddler stayed in MLA’s hostel few days ago. Along with officials, I inspected the hostels. Later I convened a meeting with the officers and reviewed MLAs’ facilities, their security and rule and regulations,"" the Speaker said.

Gupta said, “Now onwards whoever will stay in the rooms of MLAs’ hostel, will have to give their ID proof. This rule will not be applied on elected legislators.”

In the meeting it was informed that around 15 legislators have secured room in MLA hostel but are yet to pay the rent. CCTV cameras which were installed there have been found functional. The officials have been asked to strictly follow rules and regulations.

Room’s rent should be displayed appropriately at important places within the campus.

They have been directed to ensure that no anti-social elements stay in hostels. “Now we have asked the officials to ensure that all the visitors submit their identity card to the MLA Hostel office,” Gupta added.

In the meeting it was also revealed that certain relatives and acquaintances of the legislators had stayed in the MLAs’ hostel for long periods of time and had failed to make timely payment for their stay.

Gupta said, “The MLAs staying in the hostel are charged Rs 50 per day while their relatives are charged Rs 200 per day. Similarly, any other person staying in the hostel, which has to be booked in the name of the MLA, is charged Rs 600 per day.”

According to sources, the outstanding amount on a minister in the JJP-BJP government is more than Rs one lakh rupees. The legislators have not yet responded after the notice. In this case, the speaker said that the legislators have been notice and asked them to reply without delay.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/15-hry-mlas-get-notice-for-not-paying-hostel-rent.html
7,04-2-20,Reading the Act,"The CAA offers fast-track citizenship to persecuted minorities (not Hindus alone) and does not ‘explicitly vow not to take a single downtrodden Muslim’

As the unending Delhi-based protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) seem to be heading for face-saving talks, Western media busybodies have rushed to the cause, alleging a sinister plot to render 200 million Muslims stateless. In an article, “Intolerant India”, The Economist of London alleges a plot to “transform India from a tolerant, multi-religious place into a chauvinist Hindu state.” (January 25, 2020)

It adds, “The scheme looks like the most ambitious step yet in a decades-long project of incitement.” It clubs the demolition of a mosque in Ayodhya in 1992 with the “massacre of Muslims in the state of Gujarat in 2002, when Mr Modi was chief minister”, which was “electoral nectar” for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but “political poison” for India.

The colonial British know that the Hindu struggle for the Ram Janambhoomi was part of a centuries-old struggle against Islamic iconoclasm, the justice of which was upheld by successive English administrators, even if they did not help the community. Possibly the British are appalled that the Supreme Court of India resolved the issue so well.

Regarding 2002, surely The Economist knows that the unrest began with the burning alive of 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya, near Godhra station. Much like the Azad Hind Fauj, these victims are simply erased from the narrative and (it is hoped) public memory. It says Modi and his party are “likely to benefit politically by creating divisions over religion and national identity.” Actually, this template was patented by another party.

Former Vice-Chancellor of Ashoka University, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, reveals, “In India, the use of communal instigation has often been associated with the demands of electoral mobilisation – episodic violence as a means of securing votes. This was always a blot on Indian democracy. But in a strange way, we also used to find it reassuring: It somehow signalled that the use of violent provocation had its spatial and temporal limits. It will be used fleetingly, in local contexts, but will not become a continuous strategy.” (Indian Express, February 1, 2020)

Having routinely benefitted from communal riots (Meerut, Sholapur and so on), the Congress should explain how these “spatial and temporal limits” were defined. Muslim leaders should explain the reason for sacrificing poor Muslims as electoral harvest for one party. Why did India’s avowedly secular party constantly need serial communal polarisation to win votes from both communities? In 1984, only the minority changed.

There is general agreement that 2002 marks a watershed in Indian history. Mehta observes that violence declined sharply after 2002 but the Delhi events [Shaheen Bagh] show that one cannot read “past reassurances on the limits of violence” into the present, as the structure of Indian politics has changed. Mehta’s arguments cannot hide the change, viz violence no longer privileges the once-dominant party; communal polarisation wrought by non-BJP entities splits votes on communal lines and advantages the BJP.

The Act offers fast track citizenship to persecuted minorities (not Hindus alone) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and does not “explicitly vow not to take a single downtrodden Muslim”. Indeed, in recent weeks, several Muslim refugees from Pakistan were given citizenship, the provision for which remains on the statute.

The CAA redeems a pledge neglected by India’s leaders from 1947 onwards. Mendi Safadi of the Safadi Center for International Diplomacy, Research, Public Relations and Human Rights says: “Bangladesh in recent years has become a country that has suffered from a high number of ethnic murders, the mass rape of Hindu women and girls by mainly Muslim men and a high number of Hindus being expelled from their homes so that the Muslims can take over their lands.”

Afghanistan had a sizeable Sikh and Hindu population which slowly migrated to India, especially after the assassination of Presidents Daud (1978) and Najibullah (1996). The rise of Taliban would be a nightmare.

In Pakistan, intellectuals themselves denounce the daily abductions of schoolgirls, their forced conversion, and marriage to older men. In Sindh, there are two recent cases of brides being abducted from their wedding ceremony, converted, and married to Muslim men. Unsurprisingly, border districts are reporting the arrival of dozens of poor Hindu families, with whatever belongings they could carry. Much has been said about persecuted Muslims, mainly Pakistan’s Ahmadiyas and Shias, but these groups prefer the West. Recently, Gulalai Ismail, a Pashtun activist from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, escaped to the United States.

The real citizenship problem concerns Assam, where the crisis of illegal immigrants began. In 1950, the Illegal Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act was passed to protect Hindu refugees from East Pakistan and expel illegal Muslim infiltrators. But successive regimes dodged the issue. Then, in 1983, the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act clubbed Hindu refugees and Muslim illegal immigrants together as “illegal migrants” and put March 25, 1971 as a cut-off date to detect illegal migrants.

The Assam Accord of 1985 retained 1971 as a cut-off date (Section 6A of Citizenship Act) and thus legalised Muslim illegal migrants till 1971 as All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), that signed the Accord, fell into the Congress trap. But in 2005, the Supreme Court repealed the IMDT Act and revived the Illegal Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950, thus protecting Hindu refugees and differentiating them from illegal immigrants. But just prior to the IMDT Act repeal, in December 2004, the Congress amended the Citizenship Act and inserted “illegal migrant” into Section 2, so that illegal migrants (which then included Hindu refugees) could not even apply for citizenship.

The Citizenship Amendment Act corrects this mischief and allows only persecuted minority refugees to apply for nationality. As the BJP came to power in May 2014, it fixed December 31, 2014 as the cut-off date for applying for citizenship as the cut-off date has to be on or after July 12, 2005, when the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the IMDT and 1950 Acts, protecting Hindu refugees. Once these refugees receive Indian citizenship, they will be free to move to other States and need not be a burden on Assam.

8,04-2-20,Forked tongue,"If the BJP indeed is serious about talks with Shaheen Bagh women, then it must stop pushing the goli maaro brigade

When the women of Shaheen Bagh sat in protest against the Government’s new citizenship law and identity policies, they simply were defending their right to be defined as Indians and not letting the new regime’s exclusionary limits redefine their legitimacy in this country. They swore by the Constitution and lived its spirit, surrounded themselves with the tricolour and demanded they be heard. They developed a drill for sustaining the tempo of a genuine people’s movement, one group taking over after the other and carrying their food from home. And they made common cause with citizenry in general. No politics of gender or religion could tame their impassioned burst which challenges stereotypes of protest sit-ins at many levels. Muslim women, a constituency that is seen as exploited and in need of protection, are leading a rights movement, overturning the need for community leaders or maulvis to plead their case. They have refused to confine their agitation to ghettoised concerns and made it an equally nationalist issue, significantly forcing an “us versus us” war. They are using dialogue and non-violence as the only rule of engagement. And though criticised for blocking traffic, they agree that it is the only disruptor that will draw mass attention to them, though now they have relaxed certain norms for schoolgoers and ambulances. It is the upending of these carefully packed boxes of convention that has unsettled traditional politics. Which is why the vilification of Shaheen Bagh has reached a war cry-like crescendo of goli maaro. The Hindu Right, too, so used to demonising the mullah, has been caught off guard by the women talking mainstream than from their cloisters and seeking a level-playing field. That explains the fury to box it in as a Pakistani conspiracy. Perhaps, that’s what has prompted the Government to make a peace overture through Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad proposing a template for “structured” talks. At least a beginning has been made. However, the Government must realise that it cannot speak in a forked tongue, its senior Ministers themselves guilty of unleashing the most strident rhetoric of the “us versus them” binary. There has to be a reassuring peace and not intimidatory gunfire.

The ruling BJP, which is using Shaheen Bagh to polarise votes for the Delhi elections, is doing far more damage in terms of mainstreaming the crassest form of otherisation politics. If the Congress appeasement of years was one end of the spectrum, then the extreme Right, as embodied by the likes of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath or Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, is not just content stretching the other end. They want to overwrite our civilisational matrix of consensus and embed a mindset of oppressive rather than a compassionate majoritarianism. That can only lead to a conflict-ridden polity that unfortunately works in the short run. History shows that even the victor has not emerged unscathed from the spoils of a genocidal war. The ruling BJP must realise that it could even use the women of Shaheen Bagh as a political constituency, considering it has authored the Triple Talaq Act on behalf of Muslim women in general. Unless it wants to junk that as a political move that has served its purpose. The BJP must also be wary of becoming too transparent in its divisive design so close to the Delhi polls. It would make it look like a party with no difference at all. Yes, it has as much right to defend CAA in a public debate but to stub out all dissent as incorrect, questioning the motivation of these women and denying them their rightful voice could also work against it in a subterranean manner. Simply because Shaheen Bagh will be remembered as the first independent and informed civilian movement against the Modi Government, which is yet to bow down to vested interests. The more these women are cornered by force, the more they can churn up an anti-Government sentiment by holding out. The effect of this is already being felt pan-India with women protesting in Prayagraj, Kanpur, Kolkata, Patna and Gaya, all coincidentally important cities in our civilisational history. The BJP should not forget that Modi first came to power in 2014 only because a civil society movement against corruption had sounded the drumroll of change. Had it not been for rights activist Anna Hazare, neither could the BJP have projected itself as a political agent of a nation’s clean-up, nor could Modi have challenged the Congress’ sense of entitled leadership. Even if the BJP were to break Delhi away from the Aam Aadmi Party’s development goals, it would be mistaken in thinking it has a hold of the aam aadmi’s mind in the long run.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/forked-tongue-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/forked-tongue.html
9,04-2-20,Baby steps,"There is a need to transform the personal income tax system but did the Budget go far enough?

On the face of it, the new income tax slabs might have seemed like a slight saving window, particularly for younger earners. While this seems to be the result of a report on changes to the Direct Tax Code submitted to the Ministry of Finance last year, the public is yet to see it. There is little doubt that the income tax code for most taxpayers — and India has far too few direct taxpayers — is very complicated with several exemptions added over the years, from housing loans and children’s tuition to tax-saving investments. While the list of exemptions allowed higher-income earners to defray their taxes significantly in some cases, it also promoted a culture of investments, particularly among younger salaried earners, who otherwise might not have done so. That said, a simplified tax code with lower slabs will help younger earners save some money. But will they make the shift now because they will not be able to return to the old regime where they could avail exemptions when they get older, earn more and start a family? Far from simplifying things, young earners will need to talk to their parents and to tax experts to figure out which path they should take. Robert Frost might have chosen the road less travelled but is it worth spending some money today to make more later?

The question, however, is will it? Is this slight reform an indication of what direction the Government wants to move in, a future with fixed income tax slabs and minimal exemptions? While that might make things simple, any Government must realise that encouraging investments by younger earners is also a positive that it should not forego. Strangely enough, while studying the new rates, it appears that senior citizens, who have dividend and interest income, might be able to take more advantage of the rates than younger people. There needs to be a direction that the Finance Minister and her officials need to give income tax payers and not just a tax charter. Is the direction towards lower rates with fewer exemptions going to be a one that this Government will stick to? After all, it is safely ensconced in power until May 2024. Thankfully, the Government has refrained from an overnight changing of the rules. Lessons might have been learnt after demonetisation but it would be a start to make public the reform recommendations to the direct tax code.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/baby-steps-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/baby-steps.html
10,04-2-20,Not fighting a losing battle,"There’s hope for people with advanced stage cancer due to new diagnosis, monitoring and personalised treatment methods available today and the new ones being developed

Communicable ailments are on the decline in India but non-communicable maladies like cancer and cardiovascular diseases are on the rise. Cancer has emerged as one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. As per the latest GLOBOCAN data, compiled and disseminated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) ahead of World Cancer Day today, there are 11.5 lakh new cases and 7.8 lakh cancer-related deaths every year in India. Mortality in low-income and middle-income countries, including India, is on the high side compared to high income counterparts. This is attributable to relatively low awareness, late diagnosis and the lack of or inequitable access to equivalent care compared with patients in high-income countries.

In India, the problem is compounded by the low availability of dedicated specialists. The country has just 2,000 oncologists to treat 11.5 lakh new cases annually. Very few institutes reportedly offer Medical Council of India (MCI)-approved specialty courses in oncology, leading to a very limited increase in the current workforce every year. Many oncologists take up more than 1,000 new patients per year and their workload is among the highest globally. In developed countries the oncologist to cancer ratio tends to be a much healthier 1:100.

Concentration of specialty oncology centres in the metros and big cities is another problem as patients in smaller towns and rural areas are still largely deprived. Every year, tens of thousands of cancer patients flock from all over the country to a handful of hospitals like the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi due to the absence of treatment facilities closer to where they live and the unaffordable cost of treatment at private hospitals. There is an urgent need for policymakers to consider measures that will improve the doctor-to-patient ratio and also build health infrastructure in smaller towns to address the growing epidemiological and financial burden of the disease.

The country’s cancer incidence is expected to almost double as a result of demographic changes alone by 2040. In terms of reducing mortality due to the disease in India, early detection is one approach that could give people a much better chance of fighting it successfully. India does not have a national breast cancer screening programme but various Government and private hospitals have been offering screening services for men and women. This has slowly increased the proportion of cases being diagnosed but more needs to be done.

People often ignore symptoms either due to lack of awareness or due to fear, anxiety and social stigma related to diagnosis. Increased awareness of breast cancer and penetration of opportunistic screening can lead to more cases being detected in the early stages. This will not only drastically improve the odds of successful treatment but also reduce the cost and aggressiveness of treatment. For example, there are many advantages of being detected in the early stages of breast cancer. Patients who are diagnosed with Stage I or II breast cancer are candidates for breast conserving surgery (BCS) versus full breast removal in mastectomy. Because a woman gets to keep her breast and has a better cosmetic outcome, the psychological effects associated with permanent removal can be avoided. In the West, breast conservation rates exceed 70 per cent for early breast cancer. In contrast, rates of BCS have traditionally been very low in Asian settings.

In India, BCS rates vary from 10 per cent in smaller cities to about 40 per cent in the metros. There are many reasons for this disparity. One of the important reasons for the disparity is the requirement for highly-specialised oncosurgeons and radiation after BCS. Radiation therapy is not easily available in smaller towns and considering BCS leads to better body image and psychosocial outcomes compared to mastectomy, having better radiation facilities across the country is certainly something that we need to resolve.

Another advantage of early detection is the availability of a new category of tests called prognostic tests. Mounting evidence that all early-stage breast cancer patients don’t benefit from chemotherapy led to the development of prognostic tests. These tests profile the tumour biology of patients to determine breast cancer relapse or recurrence risk. Test results can be used to put patients into different risk categories which help to personalise their treatment depending on their specific risk of recurrence.

Most women suffering from breast cancer, prior to prognostic tests being available, would have been recommended chemotherapy based on practice guidelines. Now prognostic tests can help doctors determine which patients can avoid chemotherapy, saving a lot of patients from the physical and financial toxicity of chemotherapy. The use of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer has significantly declined in the West due to these prognostic tests and doctors are now able to offer patients personalised treatment.

Increasingly, we are seeing a more personalised approach to cancer treatment, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Personalised medicine works by means of analysing patient-specific information and prescribing them therapies best suited to treat them and prevent cancer from returning. This can be game-changing in many ways as it can lead to improved outcomes for patients by ensuring they get the right treatment. It can improve the quality of life by helping patients avoid overtreatment. It can lead to huge cost savings for the patient in a country like India where most healthcare expenditure is out of pocket and it can result in more optimised use of healthcare resources.

Targetted cancer therapies or drugs block its growth and spread by attacking specific biomolecules that are involved in cancer signalling pathways, versus most standard chemotherapies which act on all rapidly-dividing cells whether cancerous or not. Many targetted drugs have been approved by the FDA to treat specific types of cancer. For example, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receive the anti-HER2 drug trastuzumab, pertuzumab, TDM-1 to control growth and spread of the tumour. Use of these targetted therapies has proven to decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 50 per cent. For advanced small cell lung cancer, the FDA recently approved atezolizumab as the second immunotherapy drug for, and the first for use as part of first-line treatment. They also approved targetted drugs for bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma and other cancer types in the last year.

Another promising area of targetted cancer treatment is immunotherapy, which taps into the ability of using a person’s own immune system to fight cancer. Many immunotherapy treatments are much more tolerable than chemotherapy or radiation. The goal is that they will reduce or even replace the use of more toxic therapies. Various immunotherapies have been approved by the FDA and have been used to treat patients with advanced or metastatic disease.

Recently, the FDA approved Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for certain cancers. This therapy involves genetic modification of the patient’s autologous T-cells to express a receptor specific for a tumour antigen. This helps the patient’s cells to find and attack cancer cells. Remarkable results have been seen in previously untreatable cancers because of this.

Cancer vaccines are another topic of great interest. For cancers caused by viruses such as Hepatitis B, that can cause liver cancer, and the human papillomavirus that can cause cervical cancer, vaccines already exist which prevent infection with these cancer-causing agents. By blocking the viruses from infecting body cells, these vaccines prevent the development of subsequent virus-associated disease. For cancers not caused by virus, researchers are working to develop vaccines that they hope will activate the immune system to attack cancer cells reliably and effectively. They are also exploring other ways to boost the immune system’s response to malignant cells. If successful, these cancer vaccines can be a big game-changer in the future.

Not only treatment but even the screening of cancer is evolving in very exciting ways. The advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are visible in many industries and healthcare is no exception. A recently-published study by MIT’s Computer Science and AI Lab on a new deep learning-based prediction model that can forecast the development of breast cancer up to five years in advance is one such example.

AI and ML can increase access to treatment in developing countries which don’t have enough cancer specialists. It can improve the sensitivity of detection, add more value in treatment decisions and help personalise treatment. There’s increased hope for people with advanced stage cancer due to all the new diagnosis, treatment and monitoring methods not only available today but also in development.

“This is another sign of dictatorship as they (Badals) have no regard for democratic values because they never issued us any show-cause notice earlier which they said they have. If they had issued us the notice, we would have given our explanation telling them the truth…but they didn’t which shows their insecurity,” said Parminder reacting to their expulsion.

Notably, the Dhindsa father-son duo had decided to stay within the party and revolt against the undemocratic way of functioning of the party, headed by Sukhbir Badal.

Not revealing much about their future plans, Parminder maintained that they would work towards bringing together all the like-minded people and groups together.

13,04-2-20,Congress again targets Anubhav Mohanty,"A day after accusing Kendrapada BJD MP Anubhav Mohanty of furnishing false information in his election affidavits about his educational qualifications, the Congress on Monday claimed that the MP’s silence on the issue proves that its allegations are true.

Addressing a Press conference here, Congress leader Nishikant Mishra stated, “We had hoped that the MP would face media with all necessary evidences. In his clarification, Anubhav avoided the main question and spoke about Kendrapada’s development. We thank him for accepting our allegations.”

Mishra said that based on information obtained through RTI, the party on Sunday had alleged that Anubhav submitted false information during the 2014 Rajya Sabha election. The MP has accepted our allegations or else he would have taken legal action, the Congress leader said.

“We will wait and see what action is being taken by the BJD against its MP on the issue as Naveenbabu always claims to believe in transparency,” he added. As per allegations, Anubhav, in his affidavit, mentioned that he completed his Bachelor of Arts from the Sobhit University of Engineering and Technology in Meerut.

But in its affidavit before the Supreme Court in 2010, the HRD Ministry had mentioned about derecognising Shobhit University. If the university was already derecognised, how Anubhav could study there, Mishra had questioned.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-again-targets-anubhav-mohanty.html
14,04-2-20,"4,000 MCC staff will be under strict monitoring","In a first-of-its-kind initiative, around 4000 field employees of Chandigarh’s civic body will be under strict monitoring from now onwards.

To keep a check on the irregularities in attendance of different field staff in the city, the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh has introduced GPS-enabled Human Efficiency Tracking System (ImTrac).

The objective of the GPS-enabled wrist watches include recording attendance of field staff shift-wise, prevention and control of misuse of manual attendance system, maintaining transparency, accountability in operations and weeding out of the fake, duplicate, and false workers, saidKK Yadav, Commissioner, MCC.

Yadav wore the first watch and then tied it up on the wrists of employees of various wings.

Rs 18 lakh has been spent to procure the wrist watches for the employees. The employees under the MC’s watch include 2,400 safai karamcharis (sanitation workers), 1,000 work munshis and 600 gardeners besides labourers in various departments.

The MC Commissioner said often, citizens and even councilors complain about workers irregular attendance in the field. Under the new system, attendance will be taken ward-wise at the work location and updated immediately from the field using GPS networks daily on a real-time basis, he said.

He further said that it improves the management to balance the under or over utilize the resources based on geographic demand. It will completely replace the old manual based attendance system and increase the production of workforce without any new deployment of additional workforce.

The attendance will be calculated based on the number of shifts attended by the worker and will be consolidated for the entire month. Under the current system, the attendance of field staff of various wings is being recorded one or two times in a day, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/4-000-mcc-staff-will-be-under-strict-monitoring.html
15,04-2-20,"We’re more professional, less devotional about original Odia theatre","Dramatist, writer, actor, composer, anchor Pradeep Biswal has emerged as a brand name in Odisha’s theatre world. Born and brought up amid the sylvan shores and the cashew nut grooves near an adjacent village to the Sun Temple of Konark, he carried contagion from the rural artistic milieu to become what he is today. Founder of Swetapadma Cultural Organisation, he took to writing dramas, directing plays and acting like a bird in the sky. His published works include “Akuha Katha”, “Abyakta Yantrana”, “Bhabar Thakur”, “Apratihata Pratidwandi” and they have been successfully staged throughout the State. His other creations awaiting to be published are “Nukad Club”, “Achinha Raijare Manisha”, “Jeenat” and “Ardha Satya “. He has acted in innumerable dramas in and outside the State. Known for his depth and impartiality, he is invited as a jury to various Natak Mahotsavs. Spandan, a dramatic organisation of in Rourkela has honoured him as a jury. Awards and accolades have been showered upon him. Audiences remember with nostalgia Biswal’s inimitable style of acting. Adding spins to his plots and thrills to his writings, he harbours a fresh aesthetic preference in building a drama and handling the characters that cast a spell on his audience. In an interview to The Pioneer, Biswal spoke to Sugyan Choudhury.

How were you attracted towards theatre?

I believe in the Shakespearian maxim that the world is a stage and we are all actor on it. I was born in remote village near the Sun Temple of Konark. I remembered in my formative years how the rural folk used to dance there. I also witnessed ‘Pala’, ‘Dhudaki’ and ‘Daskathia’ that enthralled me. Later when I grew, they enticed me towards drama.

Could you tell us about your dramatic work of arts?

My published dramatic works have been successfully staged throughout the State in proscenium theatres. My unpublished works, which have been staged mostly at the Rabindra Mandap in Bhubaneswar and many other important places in the State, received well by the audiences and are waiting for publication.

How far has the Odia drama evolved till the recent times?

This is a very difficult question to answer. You may not agree with what I say since one man’s meat is another man’s poison. Theatre lovers may or may not agree with me. During the 1980s, there were no developed technology available. The then writers came out with their writings keeping in their mind our culture, tradition and literature. The unmistakable devotion of stage artists, actors and directors were palpably present during the shows then. With the passage of time, the number of writers, directors, artists have increased manifold. Technologies are now said have revolutionised the theatre world. Now, we can see a flow of copywriters; and most of the directors and writers are resorting to Jatra style in pandals to attract audience for easy success. We have become more professional and less devotional in creating original Odia theatre. Very few writers like Dr Manmath Satapathy, Shankar Tripathy, Prof Samar Mudali hold the original thoughts of Odia drama.

How does Odia drama stand apart from pan-Indian dramas?

Barring the exception of a few dramatists, our theatre writers and directors try to put Odisha art, culture and tradition in their theatrical vision. Outside dramatists adopting developed technology with absolute contemplation on story lining try to impose their thoughts upon the audience. But Odia writers, directors are with the thoughts of the audience balancing the emotion of story lining and live acting.

Why are Odia theatre pandals witnessing a fall in the audience scenario?

Ha. Ha. Ha. Your question makes me laugh and pains me as well. Yes, we all know that such a scenario has come to pass owing to home theatres like TV channels, mobile apps and cinema halls. It is also due to lack of critical acumen and perceptibility due to dearth of creative thinking among our present generation of youths who are attracted by easy success, short time amusement and assailed by fluctuating thoughts. We are still trying our best to woo the audience to our pandals within the ambit of Odishan culture. We are using developed technologies and many talented directors have taken over the stage and we would not be lagging behind our counterparts in other States.

As a writer, actor and a director of Odishan drama, what are your plans to preserve, protect and defend the Odishan theatre against the onslaught of sky invasion?

We may not close our doors and windows against this sky invasion. While witnessing TV serials, dramas, dance and music, we should keep our legs solidly transplanted on the Odishan soil. Anything of alien culture is not superior to everything Odishan or Indian. We should present the best of our culture in appropriate dramatic forms to ennoble and entice our younger generation. Besides, theatre pandals should be established in every block and district headquarters punctuated all the while by lively performances to attract the theatre aficionados.

How do you enjoy acting?

I have acted in over 60 Nataks; and in most, I have played the role of the principal protagonist. I have acted in comedies, tragedies and tragi-comedies as well. I get the best of satisfaction during acting. However, my unforgettable moments are those when I find tears in the eyes of my audience being overwhelmed with sympathy and empathy for my character role. That is the best moment of my life which I always cherish in my heart of hearts.

Being a writer, a director and an actor, what’s your message to the young generation of artists?

A successful artist is he or she who is loyal, committed and remains punctual to his or her acting. One should be meticulous and keep on learning and acting all the while mastering the intricacies of acting. A good artist should not confine himself or herself to his or her role however small it may be but should totally devote him or her with the entire storyline in order to enable him or her to earn the confidence, love and admiration of the audience. Actors should keep in mind that pleasure or satisfaction lies in the quest, not in the conquest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/we---re-more-professional--less-devotional-about-original-odia-theatre.html

17,04-2-20,Adityapur toll bridge to get iron fencing,"In view of rising cases of suicides by jumping, Adityapur toll bridge over Kharkai river connecting Adityapur Industrial area in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district to Kadma locality in the steel city will too get iron fencing soon.

East Singhbhum district administration has taken an initiative for fencing the either side of toll bridge similar to the Jai Prakash Narayan Setu in Mango so as to prevent incidents of suicide there.

The deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla has asked departmental officials to work in this regard.""We are planning to install iron fencing on either side of the Adityapur bridge. We are thinking to fence the toll bridge because it is increasingly turning into a suicidal point. Once the bridge is fenced like Jai Prakash Narayan Setu over Subernarekha in Mango,"" said Shukla.

The deputy commissioner pointed out that he would hold a meeting over the issue soon and would instruct the civic body Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) for installing the iron net or fence like it has been fixed at the Jai Prakash Narayan Setu .

Two youths committed suicide by jumping down the Adityapur toll bridge during in January. While one of the deceased was a resident of Burmamines locality about 7- Kms away from the toll bridge in Kadma, another deceased, a 17-year-old boy, was a resident of Bagbera locality about five kms away.

On an average two incidents of attempted suicide take place at the bridge every month. Though in most of the cases, such people are saved by the fishermen and boatmen from getting drowning, after the jump in the rocky river-bed some of them sustained serious injuries on being hit on the rocks below the bridge.

City-based Dr. U K Srivastava said that limiting the availability of one method of committing suicide is reported to reduce the overall suicide rate. Suicide and injury suicide preventive measures should be considered. A study also demonstrates that bridges attract suicide candidates.

Welcoming the move, Mahabir Ram an official of Jeevan, a city based suicide prevention centre said: "" The situation was becoming serious. We had requested the administration to provide safety nets on the bridges. Once the sides of the bridge are covered with nets, the people will not be able to come to the bridge for committing suicide by jumping into the river”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/adityapur-toll-bridge-to-get-iron-fencing.html

19,04-2-20,SAD shows door to Dhindsa father-son duo,"A day after the Akalis virtually demonstrated their show of strength in the Dhindsa’s bastion — Sangrur, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday declared its decision of expelling the father-son duo — Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Parminder Singh Dhindsa.

The move came within a month after the party suspended the membership of the two from the party on January 11, besides charge-sheeting them for anti-party activities.

Thrown out of the party following the decision by the party’s core committee meeting, the rebel leaders, in turn, are not opening their cards on their future plans.

Akali veteran Sukhdev Dhindsa, who has been raising the banner of revolt against the party’s way of functioning especially against the Akali president Sukhbir Badal, is the member of the Rajya Sabha, while his son Parminder is legislator from Lehra Gaga.

Akali Dal senior leader and former Minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that their legal team would see what to do with their membership.

“The decision to expel both father and son was taken by the core committee…the Core Committee has only approved the decision taken by the party workers from Sangrur in the rally yesterday…they had demanded their expulsion,” he said.

It has been learnt that Dhindsas have been charged with anti-party activities as both of them have all along been criticizing the party leadership, and even joined hands with the Taksali faction.

Senior Dhindsa, who was the senior-most leader in SAD after the party patron and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, had stepped down from all party posts in September 2018 citing “health issues and age”, a month after the party appointed Parminder as its leader of legislative wing in Vidhan Sabha in August.

After maintaining a distance with the party leadership since more than a year after his resignation from the party posts, Dhindsa finally came out in open against his parent Akali Dal by joining its splinter faction, SAD Taksali, to commemorate SAD’s 99th foundation day on December 14, 2019.

Parminder soon went incommunicado, and strategically chose to stay away from both the events — one organized by the SAD and another by Taksalis to commemorate Akali Dal’s 99th foundation day. He again gave a miss to the party’s protest dharna in the Chief Minister’s home city, Patiala, December 21.

On January 3 this year, Parminder finally decided to follow his father’s footsteps and resigned as the leader of party’s legislative wing, without specifying any reason.

Raising the banner of revolt, the two alleged that the Akali Dal was being run in an “undemocratic manner” and controlled by “a family”. In fact, they have a call to liberate the party from the control of one family and revive its lost glory.

Even as the war of words continued between the two sides, the five-time former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who has been maintaining a distance from active politics and party affairs, was forced to come out in his son Sukhbir’s support, and lashed out at the Dhindsa’s at party’s Sangrur rally on Sunday.

The senior Badal, addressing a massive gathering at Dhindsa’s stronghold, accused the father-son of stabbing the party in the back. “None would be allowed to weaken the SGPC (Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee) at any cost,” he had stated while backing his son’s claims of dubbing Sukhdev Dhindsa as “traitor”.

At that time, Sukhdev Dhindsa had stated that the fight was on between the “Akali Dal of Sukhbir Badal and the real Akali Dal”.

“Sukhbir and his coterie have taken over the party completely. Our fight is with them and the real Akali Dal,"" he told the media adding that like them many other leaders were feeling suffocated, but they were yet to speak out.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-shows-door-to-dhindsa-father-son-duo.html
20,04-2-20,Former Congress MLA from Punjab joins AAP,"The ruling Congress party in Punjab suffered a setback on Monday when its senior leader and Nabha’s former MLA Ramesh Singla joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

During the campaigning for Delhi assembly elections, Singla formally joined AAP in the presence of Punjab state party president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann and the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema, besides senior leaders and MLAs.

Welcoming Singla into the party fold, Mann said that the former MLA played his political innings in various capacities spanning over decades and did not succumb to any political pulls and pressures of the Congress brass when it came to probity and propriety.

Mann, in his tongue-in-cheek style, said that keeping oneself above board in a corruption-ridden Congress dispensation was indeed a milestone by itself.

“Ramesh Singla always put the interests of the people and the State first…He fought a grim battle during the dark days of terrorism in the State and the people of Punjab, especially from Nabha-Patiala area, remember his insignificant role in dousing the seething flames of terrorism…By his joining, the AAP held greater significance as it would prove to be a great moral strength for the party cadres and dedicated workers of the party at large,” said Mann.

Singla said that while Capt Amarinder Singh Government had disappointed every section of the society in Punjab by reneging on the promises it made to the people, on the other hand, the Arvind Kejriwal Government in Delhi had won the people’s hearts by pushing an unprecedented growth through its honesty and hard work, which was why people of the national capital were singing paeans in favor of the Kejriwal government.“I decided to join AAP on the basis of the Kejriwal government’s performance in Delhi and Bhagwant Mann's performance in the Parliament broaching issues and concerns of the people of the State,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/former-congress-mla-from-punjab-joins-aap.html

25,04-2-20,State Govt to implement Odisha Library Act soon,"Librarians, senior citizens and book lovers have reason to cheer as the much-awaited Odisha Public Library Act, 2001 is going to be implemented soon.

Notably, the Odisha Society of Americans (OSA) and different Library Associations’ constant effort to appeal to the Government of Odisha through their delegation to implement the Odisha Public Library Act in its letter and spirit ultimately paid off with the constitution of the Odisha Public Library Council, the highest policy making body in this respect.

The noble act has taken 14- long years for the Government to frame the rules and took another four years to constitute Odisha Public Library Council. Perhaps, the State Government all these years felt that the establishment of public libraries in the State doesn’t fetch votes for the ruling party, social worker and prolific writer of Gajapati district Raghunath Panigrahi.

However, he said the very formation of the council assuredly reveals the regional imbalances in representation.

""Most of the members belong to costal and western Odisha. People from southern Odisha negligibly represent in the council,"" Panigrahi alleged. For effective and smooth functioning of the council as well to achieve the very objectives of the crucial public library legislation, Panigrahi demanded for appointment of a professionally qualified Director in the Department of Culture exclusively to deal with public libraries. He also urged upon the Government to form a committee from among the Council members under the chairmanship of the concerned Minister to visit the neighbouring WB and AP to have on-the- spot experience of their public library systems and services.

Among other issues raised by him include establishment of three Central Library Systems in three Revenue Division towns, namely, Cuttack, Brahmapur and Sambalpur; shifting of the existing City Central Library to Old Town, Bhubaneswar with two more branches at Chandrasekharpur and Khandagiri, establishing District Libraries in the remaining 13 districts on priority basis, identification of corporate houses, industries and philanthropists to facilitate infrastructure and joining hands with the Government in the process of public library development, making an appeal to OSA in America to contribute liberally to institute Odisha Public Library Fund as goodwill gesture, constituting a technical and expert committee for public library digitization and recruiting a district librarian in each district library in the rank of DEO.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-to-implement-odisha-library-act-soon.html

27,04-2-20,‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’ to be held on village ‘haat’ days,"Haat days be made the days of ‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’. At present it is Wednesday for the DC to conduct this ‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’ while it is Saturday for the DDC of a district.

These programmes are mostly held either in the panchayat secretariat premises or in contiguity of it which may by incident turn out to be a’ haat’ day as here in Palamu every day of the week is a ‘haat’ day at one place or the other.

The new dispensation under the stewardship of Hemant Soren CM Jharkhand the State chief secretary DK Tiwary issued a notification in this regard to hold two such programmes a week specifying days for DC and DDC.

However popular demand is that fleet of Government officials led by DC and DDC on their respective days should hold this programme at the haat days as villages/ panchayats in Palamu still have ‘haat’ days like Wednesday when town like Daltonganj has its bazaar day on this day where on the bank of the river Koyal here in the town there is held a bazaar where are sold chicken and goat both by villagers who gather here and sell their goods sitting on the raw flank of the road near a temple in the town.

Ram Pukar Mahto a resident of Palamu said, “It will be far more beneficial if this programme is held on haat day of the villages or the panchayats.”

He said, “Jharkhand Government should take a cue from the neighbouring State Chhatisgarh where on haat days medical teams visit the haat hold out tables and medicines and then provide instant medical care.”

He said like what is done in Chhatisgarh can be replicated here too with civil officials in line with medical teams.

DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, “Sarkar Aap Key Dwar has begun to yield good results. There were 95 pending cases of mutation alone in the Mohammadganj block/ circle but after this programme held at Bhajaniya on Wednesday more than 30 cases of mutation have been solved which is a big relief to a common man. The remaining ones too will be solved in the coming fortnight.”

DDC Bindu Madhav Prasad Singh said the programme is picking up as the first one held here was at Pathak Pagar panchayat and since then gathering is swelling as one saw at Lehar Banjari and Loharssi where he held the programme while DC's programme at Bhajaniya& Kala Pahar panchayats have been a big shot.

However a BJP leader requesting not to be identified by name said, “Our party has nothing to say on this programme but it has been seen that over a period of time such a programme loses its sheen and officials get exhausted holding it.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---sarkar-aap-ke-dwar----to-be-held-on-village----haat----days.html
28,04-2-20,Sense of fear has gripped society: Jayanta Mahapatra,"A sense of fear appears to have gripped the society as the situation has undergone changes in recent times, said Jayanta Mahapatra, the first Indian to win the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award for English poetry.

“The situation is not what it was a few years ago. The sense of freedom which I used to experience personally has disappeared,” Mahapatra said while participating in a ‘Face to Face’ programme at a two-day 1st SOA Literary Festival, which concluded at the SOA University here on Sunday.

“Whatever that sounds illogical has become logical today. I don’t like it,” the celebrated 91-year-old poet said in an oblique reference to the current situation in the country involving protests by students and others and the faceoff with the police.

In an interaction with Dr Dipak Samantrai, Mahapatra walked down the memory lane while expressing his love for mundane things like the sunshine, moonlight, birds and flowers. “I always wait for sunshine to light up my life,” he said, adding that he doesn’t like the idea of an overcast sky.

Asked about his daily routine at this age, Mahapatra said he is primarily confined to his home in Cuttack and works at his desk. “I spend my day learning new words,” he said.

“I never ever wanted to be a poet, but perhaps my experiences of an unhappy childhood made me a poet,” he said.

Speaking at the valedictory session, eminent Odia poet Dr Ramakanta Rath underlined the need to make poetry comprehensible to the common reader.

“The idea that poetry which is difficult to understand is high-quality stuff borders on the ridiculous. Somehow, we have come to accept this thinking,” he regretted.

Dr Rath was accompanied by two other Odia literary giants Dr Sitakant Mahapatra, winner of the Jnanpith Award, and Dr Bibhuti Patnaik, Sahitya Akademi Award winning novelist, on the dais.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sense-of-fear-has-gripped-society--jayanta-mahapatra.html

37,04-2-20,Budget 2020-21,"The recently released Economic Survey has given an optimistic view of the Indian economy with a projected growth rate of 6 to 6.50 per cent in 2020-21. This is a welcome news since the economic slow-down in manufacturing, industry and agriculture had pulled the growth indices down to 4.5 per cent - a virtual shock to the planners who have been talking about lifting the economy to 5 Trillion Dollar level by 2024-25. In this backdrop, the budget 2020 looks attractive and balanced.

The focus on aspirational India, economic development for all and a humane, compassionate and caring society appears to be on the right track. The focus on agriculture with new features like – PM Kusum Scheme, Kisan Train etc. is a continuation of the earlier budget focusing on development of rural and agri-based India.

The wellness programme with PMJAY leading the bandwagon and 69000 crore allocation for health sector is also a welcome move. Focus on education and skills is on the right track.

However, the thrust on economic development by invoking the spirit of entrepreneurship, Government e-market place, economic corridor, housing, safe and clean drinking water, roads, solar power, trains, national inland water ways, Arth Ganga, and 100 more airports will take the country ahead, there is no doubt. Renewable energy and National gas-grid development, environment and climate change, MSMEs promotion and rationalization of personal income tax besides other regular schemes like –PoshanAbhiyan, culture and tourism, financial market improvement are moves that will take the country forward towards its identified goals.

The Core sector will get aboost through the proposed infrastructure buildup.

Overall a balanced and growth oriented budget with an eye to fulfill the aspirations of the teeming millions of the nation.

Some more concrete steps for direct employment generation would have added more feathers to the FM’s cap.

In a memorandum, Parasad president Pravakar Mishra has requested Singh for erecting a statue to commemorate visit of Bhave to Sarvodaya Nagar before independence. Mishra said that Savodaya leader Bhave had held a big meeting in Sarvodaya Nagar during his visit to Puri and himself named the colony as Savodaya Nagar also.

But over the past decades, neither the State Government nor any local leader has thought of a statue of the great freedom fighter to remember the historic visit of the great leader, lamented Mishra, adding that Parisad has now decided to install a statue.

As there is a vacant space in the colony, so a statue would be a respect towards the freedom fighter, he said.

40,04-2-20,"‘Wetlands are cradles of biodiversity, human benefits’","The wetlands, as sources of water, habitats and foods for survival of innumerable species of plants and animals, are the cradles of biological diversity.

Though they cover only around 6% of the Earth’s land surface, the wetlands provide shelter and breeding grounds to 40% of all the terrestrial living organisms. Conversely, the human beings are deriving tremendous economic benefits, including water supply, fisheries, agricultural support through the maintenance of water tables and nutrient retention in floodplains, fuel sources, transportation and recreation and tourism.

The vital ecological functions the wetlands carry out include water purification and storage, storm protection and flood mitigation, shoreline stabilisation and erosion control, groundwater recharge, and withholding of nutrients and sediments. In addition, these act as sources of special religious and spiritual values serving as the basis of aesthetic and artistic inspiration, and supporting local social, economic and cultural traditions. However, they are presently disappearing three times faster than forests due to diverse human activities and global heating, which has been the cause of concern.

Experts expressed such views on the occasion of the World Wetlands Day observed by the Orissa Environmental Society (OES) on the global theme ‘Wetlands and Biodiversity’.

The programme presided over by OES president Dr Sundar Narayan Patro was attended by environment expert Dr Jaya Krushna Panigrahi as chief speaker.

Panigrahi explained how wetlands absorb CO2 to help slow down global heating and reduce pollution for which they are referred to as the ‘Kidneys of the Earth’. Out of the total of 27, 403 wetlands in India, 23,444 are inland and 3,959 are coastal wetlands. The country’s 37 wetlands have been declared as Wetlands of International Importance or Ramsar sites, while over 2,300 such sites exist around the world.

Odisha has two such nature’s wonders, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Mangroves.

Dr Panigrahi lamented that enormous development pressure is now bringing about degradation and disappearance of wetlands and extinction of living species. The need of the hour is to undertake concerted, long-term efforts for the scientific management of the wetlands.

Among others, former FM University VC Prof Siba Prasad Adhikary laid emphasis on undertaking of intensive research on hydrology and biology of wetlands. Dr Prakash Chandra Jena and Sanjib Kumar Das narrated their experience in recently-conducted bird census in the State.

Dr Patro reminded how the OES had stimulated the Government for initiating conservation initiatives for protection of the Chilika Lake. Prof B Sitaram Patro presented a vote of thanks.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---wetlands-are-cradles-of-biodiversity--human-benefits---.html
41,04-2-20,JMM ready for grand show at Golf Ground,"After a thunderous victory in the Assembly elections, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) geared up for a grand show at Golf Ground in Dhanbad on 4 February – 48 foundation day of the party. The coal capital Dhanbad has been decorated with festoons and JMM flags and welcome gates are being erected at the main roads.

Over 10 thousand party workers form Bokaro are scheduled to participate in the functions at Golf Ground, informed Mantu Yadav, president JMM Bokaro district. “It would be a historic one,” he added.

“Besides the procession, top JMM leaders including Guruji will address to the mass at Golf Ground, it seems, will not be big enough to accommodate JMM supporters who will come to listen to Guruji,” said Yadav.

Over 5,000 vehicles have been engaged in Bokaro and Dhanbad districts to ferry supporters on the eve. Besides Bokaro and Dhanbad party supporters from Giridih, Jamtara, Bihar and West Bengal will also participate in the event. All the cabinet ministers, MLAs and central committee members are also scheduled to attend the function at Golf Ground, he said.

42,04-2-20,Debate over domicile policy set to intensify in State,"The ghost of domicile policy is likely to haunt Jharkhand once again after ruling party Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) at its 41st foundation day celebration held in Dumka on February 02 passed a resolution urging Chief Minister Hemant Soren to implement domicile policy based on Khatiyan (land records) of 1932.

At the 41st foundation day function of JMM in Dumka, a resolution was passed in the presence of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, JMM chief Shibu Soren, party MPs and MLAs. The leaders urged the CM to implement domicile as per 1932 Khatiyan. With the introduction of such domicile policy, those having land records as per 1932 land records will be given preference in III and IV grade jobs.

Sources said that though JMM’s stand is clear on domicile issue, the contentious issue is likely to bring heart burns among other constituents of Grand Alliance especially Congress and RJD. The BJP sensing the issue has asked Congress and RJD to clear their stand on domicile issue.

BJP's state general secretary-cum-headquarters in-charge Deepak Prakash said that Congress and RJD, which are constituents of Grand Alliance and also part of Hemant Soren Cabinet should clear their stand on this issue. He said, “As Congress and RJD are yet to clear their stand on the issue it appears that government is confused.” Attacking Congress and RJD, the BJP leader alleged that all three parties have different manifestos with neither of them having coordination with each other. The BJP Government headed by former CM Raghubar Das in 2016 announced the new domicile policy. As per the provisions of the Domicile Policy, people living in Jharkhand since or before 1985 are considered local inhabitants and avail all the facilities offered in the policy.

Sources said that though Raghubar Das announced the domicile policy it created rift in BJP too as many tribal leaders were opposed to Government fixing 1985 cut-off date for defining the local issue.

At that time while some BJP leaders said that those who have been living in Jharkhand since its creation should be accommodated, tribals, Mahto leaders have demanded that land records must be made mandatory to ensure that outsiders do not get any job in the State.

As the issue is contentious, difference of opinions is likely to emerge in BJP too. State BJP vice president and Rajya Sabha member Sameer Oroan said, “The State BJP leaders will sit and discuss on the issue. Senior party leaders will chalk out future course of action what step to taken in the issue.”

Sources said that none of the parties want to be fast on the issue as in 2002 when then Chief Minister Babulal Marandi announced the domicile policy, the announcement triggered widespread turmoil with pro and anti domicile supporters clashing on streets. On July 24, 2002 at least five people were killed during violence. Eventually, Chief Minister Marnadi had to resign from his post in 2003 and the Government had to withdraw the proposal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/debate-over-domicile-policy-set-to-intensify-in-state.html

44,04-2-20,Budget Session of Assembly likely in Feb end,"The budget session of Assembly will begin by February end which is a month late from three earlier budget sessions. For last three years, the State budget sessions used to start before the presentation of Union Budget, a practice introduced during the tenure of Chief Minister Raghubar Das. The budget session in 2017, 2018 and 2019 started on mid January.

However, this time it appears that Soren government will break the practice. Sources said that due to delay in expansion of Soren’s Cabinet and allocation of portfolios, the government is yet to start the process for preparing the budget.

Parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam said, “The government will announce the date for budget session this week. The budget Session is likely to start by end of this month.” Alam also said that main reason behind late commencement of budget session there is huge old liabilities and the government is going through all these liabilities.

Sources said that as the budget session is longest session in Assembly involving question hours, lawmakers attending the budget session must have information about session so that they can prepare questions for the session.

Sources said that Hemant Soren’s first budget session will be held at New Assembly premises, which has come up at Kute village. On September last year, Jharkhand finally received its own Assembly building, 19 years after the State was carved out of Bihar.

The three-storied building, constructed at a cost of Rs 465 crore, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The state-of-art structure, which has come up on 39 acres, has 57,220 square metres of built-up area. The edifice has a spectacular 37-metre-tall dome.

However, on December 5 last year a fire broke out in new Vidhan Sabha Bhavan months before the start of the new session. Fire in the entire West Wing has caused major damage in four places on the first floor and second floor. The damaged areas include a bank, post office, sitting area for the members of the opposition and the chairman's chamber. All other furnishings, including chair tables, ceilings, kept in the four places were burned to ashes by the fire.

The investigating officers had claimed that sabotage was behind the fire incident. The fire officials had claimed that the fire did not break out due to short circuit of electricity wires. In short circuit there is one fire point, but the fire at new Assembly building was caused due to several fire points.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/budget-session-of-assembly-likely-in-feb-end.html

53,04-2-20,BJP to get new State prez by February 10,"The State BJP unit will get new president by 10th of this month. After the appointment of JP Nadda as national president last month, there is speculation that there will be nominations of BJP presidents in States where the term of State presidents has expired or is soon to expire.

In Jharkhand too, the BJP central leadership will nominate many State leaders as State president. BJP general secretary and Raj Mahal MLA, Anant Ojha said, “The nomination of new State presidents will be done by February 10. The nomination of district presidents and other office bearers too will be carried out by that time.”

Sources said the BJP central leadership is going through various names which are likely to be given the post of State president. Amidst speculations over JVM (P) Chief Babulal Marandi joining the BJP, the saffron party is gearing up for an organisational overhaul following the loss of power in the recently concluded Assembly polls.

A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “If Marandi joins BJP, he will be either given the State BJP president post or the leader of opposition in Assembly post. “

Insiders say, most of the district presidents are likely to be removed for failing to meet their electoral targets, which is to be followed by a review of the state party structure. The focus is to be on tribal areas, where the BJP lost heavily.

The BJP central leadership is said to have decided to nominate tribal faces on key posts after it won just two of the 28 Assembly seats reserved for Scheduled tribes, as against 11 seats in 2014. “In the light of poor performance in polls, the party is expecting a change of guard in the organization in many of the districts dominated by tribals, besides in such areas where the party failed to perform,” said the senior BJP leader.

Apart from Marandi names of other leaders are also doing rounds who will be made state president. The BJP leader said, “If Marandi is nominated as leader of opposition then any non-tribal will be made State presidents and in such situation there are various names.” Sources said among the non-tribal leaders, names of BJP MLA from Raj Mahal Anant Ojha, Chatra MP Sunil Singh, Dipak Prakash and former state president Ravindra Rai are probable names.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-get-new-state-prez-by-february-10.html

63,04-2-20,Anti-CAA protests 108 PFI activists held for involvement in violence,"The Uttar Pradesh Police launched a crackdown on activists of the Popular Front of India (PFI), arresting 108 for their alleged involvement in large-scale violence during the anti-CAA and NRC protests in December last. Earlier, the UP Police brass claimed to have sent a report to get the PFI banned.

Addressing mediapersons in Lucknow on Monday, officiating DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthi and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the arrests were made from different parts of the state during a special drive. The arrests are in addition to the 25 persons netted earlier in 18 districts.

“This is just the beginning, we will get to the roots of the outfit. A probe is also underway into their financial dealings. We are in touch with Central agencies and sharing inputs with them. UP is the first state to take this kind of action against the PFI,” Awasthi told reporters.

Giving details about those arrested in the last four days, DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthi said that 14 PFI men were held from Lucknow, three from Sitapur, 21 from Meerut, nine from Ghaziabad, six from Muzaffarnagar, seven from Shamli, four from Bijnore, 20 from Varanasi, five from Kanpur, 16 from Bahriach, and one each from Gonda, Hapur and Jaunpur.

Asked whether the police got any inputs on the PFI’s financial transactions from Enforcement Directorate (ED), the DGP said, “We are collecting evidence and are in constant touch with the ED and other agencies.”

In December 2019, the then DGP OP Singh had sought a ban on the PFI, suspecting the outfit’s complicity in state-wide violent protests against the CAA and NRC. The ban was sought after PFI’s Uttar Pradesh head Wasim and 16 other activists were arrested for masterminding violence during the protests in Lucknow.

69,04-2-20,‘Girls falling prey to honey-traps of traffickers online’,"Cupid-struck girls of rural Jharkhand are now falling prey to the lures of human trafficking agents masquerading as college students and working professionals on social media platforms – a trend that has cost many teenage girls their education, career, and physical and mental wellbeing, say activists working at the grass root level.

In August last year, anti-human trafficking activist Baijnath Kumar, who also happens to be a member of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Khunti, met a 17-year-old trafficking survivor from Koderma. And her anecdote highlighted how social media was being effectively used by trafficking agents to honey-trap girls. The teenager met a man on social networking website, Facebook, and fell in love with him after a few months of chatting. “The man, who happened to be a trafficker, lured her to Mumbai on the pretext of marrying her. She was recovered from a brothel in Mumbai after about six months,” said Kumar.

In a similar case reported in capital Ranchi, a girl was lured to Bokaro on pretext of marriage after she became friends with a man on a Facebook page, Kumar said. “She was tortured by the trafficker and was also subjected to religious conversion,” he added. The trafficker, he said, was planning to sell her off, but she was rescued before he could execute his plans.

Jharkhand has been one of the worst-affected states in India in terms of human trafficking in the past decade. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data says that at least 131 incidents of human trafficking were reported in Jharkhand in 2018 – fourth highest in the country. However, activists claim that several thousand children, especially tribal girls, are trafficked from the state to metro cities every year on the pretext of jobs, marriage and even education.

Ravi Kant, founder member of Shakti Vahini, a Delhi-based NGO, said that traffickers were now sharing pictures of girls over WhatsApp and convincing young girls and boys to accept their offers over social media platforms like Facebook. “This is a new practice that has put several girls of Jharkhand at risk,” said Kant, a Supreme Court lawyer who will be a part of an awareness campaign in Jharkhand aimed at cautioning girls here about the activities of trafficking agents on social media platforms.

The penetration of Internet in rural areas has made several youngsters in Jharkhand hinterland active on social media.

“They have smart phones and internet connectivity. But the need of the hour is to caution them about the misuse of the platforms by trafficking agents,” said Kant.

However, Inspector General (CID), Arun Kumar Singh said that the police were yet to get any concrete reports on the use of social media by members of human trafficking rackets. “The social media monitoring is done by the special branch. However, as of now, we do not have any substantial report on the use of social media by trafficking agents in Jharkhand,” he said.

State Labour Minister Satyanand Bhokta said that addressing the menace of human trafficking will be one of his key objectives in the ministry. He has been given the portfolio recently in Chief Minister Hemant Soren’s Cabinet.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---girls-falling-prey-to-honey-traps-of-traffickers-online---.html

73,04-2-20,"Cow protection policy lacks direction, harming farmers: Akhilesh","Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav flayed the Cow Protection policy of Yogi government, saying it lacks direction and is against the interests of farmers. Akhilesh said stray cattle have wreaked havoc on farmers as their standing crop was grazed upon and destroyed by hordes of stray cattle in rural areas.

In a statement issued in Lucknow on Monday, the SP chief said that large number of cows are dying in sheds due to lack of proper nourishment, care and basic amenities like sanitation. He said that the government had announced a policy for Cow Protection and increasing milk production but it resulted in huge losses to farmers and death of cows in government-promoted cow sheds.

Akhilesh also criticised the disinvestment programme for offloading government stakes in LIC announced in the Union budget. He said that the government has decided for sale of 100 per cent stake in Air India and it wants to disengage from Indian Railways.

The SP chief said that the disinvestment and privatisation policy of the Modi government would deprive the economy of vital energy and severely hit the common man and agriculture sector. Alleging that the Modi government failed to develop a cohesive vision for development, Akhilesh said: “Rail travel for common passengers is a nightmare and addressing their problems is nowhere on the priority list of the government while they have announced to launch 150 Tejas trains to be run by private players.’’

Akhilesh further said that the common man is disillusioned with the BJP government at the Center and its economic policies. He claimed that resentment among people is simmering and spreading across the country, visible in the form of protests against CAA.

The SP chief said that the economic agenda of the Modi government failed to address the grievances and aspirations of all sections of the society.

“Narendra Modi had launched universal health insurance scheme called ‘Ayushman’ with much fanfare but basic infrastructure and medicines are missing in hospitals and drugs are in short supply from Jan Ausadhi stores opened by the Union government. To hide its failure, the BJP government is using catch phrases and acronyms for naming welfare schemes like Kisan Udan and Digital Kranti,” Akhilesh alleged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cow-protection-policy-lacks-direction--harming-farmers--akhilesh.html

79,04-2-20,NHRC moved over murder of Kendrapada RTI activist,"Though more than two days have passed to the killing of RTI activist Ranjan Kumar Das, the Marshaghai police have failed to nab the culprits. Neither have they established cause of the murder.

Meanwhile, demanding the arrest of the accused and Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of the deceased, Supreme Court lawyer and rights activist Radhakanta Tripathy has moved the doors of NHRC by filing a petition .

Tripathy pointed out that Das had taken to RTI activism about eight years ago. Das was regularly receiving death threats for seeking information including on the numerous brick kilns that had sprung up illegally. Last month his parents received death threats asking them to keep Das’ activism under check. Recently, Das had lodged a case before the Odisha Lokayukta alleging encroachment of 1,100 acres of Government land by a resident of Mahakalpada for shrimp farming. He had also filed RTI applications seeking details of expenditure on roads constructed by Rural Development department, quality of dry food for babies in Anganwadi Centres under ICDS programmes as well as irregularities in Government schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana.

The delay in arresting the culprits is a serious question of human rights violation as it involves role of police, intelligence and law and order. Failure of the State in implementing the provisions of Whistleblowers Protection Act, 2013 in the State amounts to serious human rights violation, Tripathy said and requested the NHRC to ensure fair investigation by an independent team of experts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nhrc-moved-over-murder-of-kendrapada-rti-activist.html

82,04-2-20,AIPEF fears closure of thermal power plants,"All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) warned that thermal power plants generating 2,500 megawatt in the state would be closed down if energy sector proposals of Union budget are implemented. AIPEF chairman Shailendra Dubey urged Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to urgently intervene in the matter and save the state from an ‘unprecedented’ power crisis.

Dubey said that the Union budget proposed to shut down thermal units generating flue gas beyond environmental safety norms and to utilise their land for other purposes.

Flue gas is the substance exiting via a flue (a pipe to remove exhaust gases from a fireplace, furnace or steam generator). In general terms, flue gas refers to as the exhaust gas produced at power plants.

The AIPEF head claimed that going by budgetary proposals, three 210 mw units each of Anpara A thermal plant, two 500 mw units each of Anpara B, five 200 mw units each of Obra; two 110 mw units each of Parichha, and two 110 mw units each of Harduaganj thermal power plants totaling nearly 2,500 mw would have to be shut down completely.

“In fact, all state-run thermal units in UP with installed capacity of roughly 4,000 mw will be closed if action was taken conforming to proposals of the budget,” he said.

Dubey recalled that last year’s budget had mentioned a proposal to equip such thermal plants with retrofitted technologies like fuel gas desulfurisation system (FGDS) and selective catalytic reducer (SCR) to curb environmental pollution.

“The sudden decision to shut these stations is unfortunate,” he said. Dubey warned that the budget proposals would create a severe energy crisis in the state following prospective closure of the state-run power stations. He also criticised the Centre’s proposal to utilise land of such thermal plants by changing land use, maintaining that it was against the statute as the land was acquired from farmers for setting up power plants.

Recently, the AIPEF urged the Modi government to take them into confidence on any prospective legislation aimed at ‘privatisation’ of power supply during the Budget session of Parliament.

AIPEF, which represents nearly 1.5 million public sector power employees, wrote to Union Power Minister RK Singh apprehending that the Centre was planning to amend Electricity Act, 2003 to introduce multiple supply licencees or franchisees by segregating carriage and content in the distribution system.

The Federation urged the Union minister to give time for holding broad discussions before declaring any amendments or changes in Electricity Act, 2003.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aipef-fears-closure-of--thermal-power-plants.html

85,04-2-20,Priyanka to kick off major campaign to highlight farmers’ problems,"A month after formulating plans with UP Congress office-bearers and district/city chiefs, party general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is set to kick off her first major campaign across the state to highlight problems of farmers.

Priyanka was scheduled to launch a ‘Kisan Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ under ‘Kisan Bachao’ programme and address her first rally in Basti on February 23. “Aiming to revive the Congress in the state, the party will launch a huge campaign pertaining to farmers’ issues and plan to contact 1.5 crore farmers and later raise these issues before competent authority to get them resolved,” UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said.

“The Congress will ask the government to provide adequate minimum support price to farmers and facilitate benefit under crop insurance policy to those who faced huge losses due to natural calamities,” Lallu added.

The Congress leader claimed that India is a country-based on agriculture but since the BJP came to power in Delhi in 2014, the contribution of agriculture to national income has witnessed a dip from 4.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent. Lallu said that his party would take on the Yogi government on issues like stray cattle, payment of dues to cane farmers, non-availability of fertilisers, irregularities in procurement of paddy, no increase in minimum support price of foodgrains and rising cases of suicides by farmers in UP, especially in the Bundelkhand region.

“Party workers will reach out to the farmers to fill a form in which they can write about their problems. The forms collected from the farmers will be handed over to the tehsildars/DMs and will be sent to the state government,” he said.

Congress workers will also distribute pamphlets in which the situation of farmers will be compared during the UPA and NDA regimes. The party will also seek loan waiver for farmers, waiver of half their power bills, cowshed and watchdog allowance in every village.

Sources said that the Congress would hold programmes at village level every month highlighting farmers’ problems across the state. In the second phase, ‘nukkad sabhas’ will be held at block level and later, ‘padyatras’ will be organised at tehsil and district headquarters.

After kicking off the campaign from Basti on February 23, Priyanka will address four more rallies to raise farmers’ issues and she is expected to be accompanied by senior Congress leaders at the programmes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-to-kick-off-major--campaign-to-highlight--farmers----problems.html

98,04-2-20,"Mom braves Shaheen chill, baby dies","Undeterred, mother says she will be back at sit-in site soon

Four-month-old, Mohammed Jahaan, who used to go at Shaheen Bagh demonstration with her mother daily, died last week after acquiring severe cold and congestion following exposure to the winter chill at the outdoor demonstration site. His mother is, however, undeterred and determined to participate in the protests, saying it is for the future of her children.

The infant’s parents, Mohammed Arif and Nazia, live in a tiny shanty put together with plastic sheets and cloth in Batla House area and have two other children — a five-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son.

Hailing from Bareilly in UP, the couple is barely able to make ends meet. Arif is an embroidery worker and also drives an e-rickshaw. His wife helps him in his embroidery work.

“I haven’t been able to earn enough in the last month despite driving the battery rickshaw in addition to my embroidery work. Now with our baby’s demise, we have lost everything,” he said, showing a picture of little Jahaan wearing a woolen cap that read ‘I Love My India’.

A visibly disturbed Nazia said Jahaan passed away in his sleep on night of January 30 after returning from the protests.

“I had returned from Shaheen Baag at around 1 AM. After putting him and other kids to sleep, even I went to sleep. In the morning, I suddenly found him motionless. He was gone in his sleep,” she said.

The couple took their motionless baby to the nearby Alshifa Hospital on the morning of January 31 where he was declared dead on arrival.

Nazia, who had been visiting the Shaheen Bagh demonstration everyday with Jahaan since December 18, says that he died after catching a cold that turned lethal.

She said she didn’t realise that his congestion was so severe. However, the doctors in the baby’s death certificate have not mentioned any specific reason for the death.

Nazia said she strongly feels that the CAA and NRC are against the welfare of all communities and will join the Shaheen Bagh protests, but this time without her children.

Arif, however, blamed the NRC and CAA for his child’s death. “Had the government not brought CAA and NRC, people would not have protested and my wife would not have joined them, my son would have been alive,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mom-braves-shaheen-chill--baby-dies.html
99,04-2-20,Data presented on prevalence of cancer among survivors,"To mark the World Cancer Day, members of the Sambhavna Trust Clinic presented data on the alarming prevalence of cancer among the survivors of the Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal. The members expressed concern on the lack of facilities for the treatment of gas affected cancer patients and called for setting up of proper registration of cancers of the gas affected people.

“Our data shows that the prevalence of cancers among the people exposed to Union Carbide’s gases is eight times more than that of an unexposed population in Bhopal. Compared to an unexposed population, the prevalence of cancer is almost double in the population that has had exposure to groundwater contaminated by Union Carbide’s hazardous wastes. All of these findings are of diagnosed cancers and we have copies of the relevant medical records of each case.” said Farhat Jahan, community research worker at the clinic.

According to Mahendra Soni in-charge pathology laboratory, “Throat, lungs, oral, stomach and breast cancers are most common among the gas exposed people. We found that in the areas that were severely affected Ly the poisonous gases, twice as many people were dying of cancers compared to an unexposed population. Official data shows that till October last year, 8,551 gas victims with cancers have been paid ex-gratia amount by the Government.”

“While the number of gas victims with cancers is growing at an alarming rate, there are no facilities for treatment of cancer in the hospitals run for the gas victims by the state and central governments. The private and trust run cancer hospitals that gas victims are asked to go to have not been paid for the last one year by the Government and this is impacting the quality of care in a serious way. No action has been taken regarding provision of palliative care to gas affected cancer patients as recommended by the Monitoring Committee more than two years back,” said Aziza Sultan, gynecology assistant at the Clinic.

Commenting on the shoddy registration of gas affected cancer patients, Clinic’s community health worker Deepa Mandrai said, “There appears to be deliberate neglect in registering gas affected cancer patients by the Population Based Cancer Registry in Bhopal established by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 1985. While the registry was specially established to record the effect of gas exposure on cancer prevalence, the registry does not collect information on history of exposure to Union Carbide’s gases of cancer patients.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/data-presented-on-prevalence-of-cancer-among-survivors.html

To escalate the protest, three drivers have also begun a fast unto death. According to one of the protesting e-rickshaw drivers Amit Kumar, ""We are not allowed to operate our e-rickshaws on the main roads between 8 AM and 8 PM, which is basically the duration when passengers are taken up.

We have taken loans to buy these rickshaws after government assurances that it will give us employment but now the administration is deceiving us. To awaken the government and administration, we will burn one more e-rickshaw on Tuesday at Clock Tower and it will be done every day.” Another protester Amir Ahmed said, “The people from the bank routinely ask for installments.

How am I going to pay any installment when I am hardly able to arrange one time meal for my family? Today I earned only Rs 40. For now, I have just burnt my e-rickshaw but if the government would not change the decision, I'll commit self immolation.”

Devbhumi E-Rickshaw Owner and Driver Welfare Society office bearer Santosh Kumar said, “They say that e-rickshaws cause traffic jam on the main roads but even without us, traffic remains congested. The main reason is that the administration does not earn through us as much as they earn through auto rickshaws and Vikrams.

Though we give taxes too, still we are deprived of operating our vehicles on the roads. Our only request is either pay off our loans or lift the ‘no entry’ from the major roads of the city.” Meanwhile, four e-rickshaw drivers also commenced their fast unto death on Monday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---e-rickshaw-to-be-burnt-daily-if-restrictions-not-lifted---.html

116,04-2-20,Need to gear up efforts to make U’khand disaster safe: Negi,"Considering the seismic vulnerability of the state, all need to gear up their efforts to make Uttarakhand disaster safe. The state falls in seismic gap of 1905 and 1934 earthquakes that enhances seismic risk in the region and the same could roll back developmental efforts of decades in just a few seconds and human losses could well surpass our imagination, said that state’s Disaster Management secretary Amit Singh Negi. He was speaking at a one-day workshop on building construction and disaster resilience techniques organised by Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA) here on Monday.

Speaking on the occasion, Negi highlighted the efforts put in by USDMA during the past years in this direction. He spoke of seismic vulnerability and risk assessment, training of masons and engineers in earthquake safe construction, retrofitting of lifeline infrastructure, strengthening of building by-laws and mass awareness for voluntary compliance. Negi also shared details of ongoing disaster safety programmes of the department together with those being planned and to be rolled out soon.

He particularly emphasised upon the role of urban local bodies in warning dissemination and making Uttarakhand disaster resilient. Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ highlighted the need for amalgamation of seismic safety precepts into smart city initiatives being undertaken presently in Dehradun and promised full support and cooperation of the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun in all the initiatives of USDMA for bringing forth seismic resilience. He also raised concern over increasing encroachment over Bindal and Rispana rivers and possible losses during extreme rainfall events.

Professor Yogendra Singh of IIT Roorkee deliberated upon essentials of earthquake safe construction and put forth simple ways of making commonly constructed structures safe. He highlighted that seismic safety commonly talked about is a compromise between saving human lives and economy and does never guarantee complete safety of the structures. He presented details of the evolutionary history of Himalayas and explained the cause of earthquakes in this region.

Explaining causes of losses caused by earthquakes, Singh said that most buildings are largely designed for sustaining vertical loads and not shear forces. Integration of all the four walls was stressed upon by him as being a remedial measure. Other safety measures put forth included restricting openings in walls, making openings away from corners, providing roof and gable bands in sloping roofs together with vertical reinforcement.

Earlier, USDMA ACEO Riddhim Agrawal highlighted the importance of the workshop and hoped that such initiatives would bring forth seismic resilience in the state. She highlighted that during disasters human losses are largely due to structural and non-structural damages as also due to follow up disasters.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/need-to-gear-up-efforts-to-make-u---khand-disaster-safe--negi.html

Addressing an election rally in Hari Nagar, he also hit out at AAP, saying that AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had done ""nothing exceptional"" by providing cheap power and healthcare in Delhi.

Singh said Chief Minister Kejriwal should tell the people what he has done for the progress of Delhi and to provide jobs to people here, instead of talking about the freebies.

Singh said that there has been virtually no progress in Delhi in the last five years and it is only the Congress which can ensure Delhi's development and work for strengthening and uniting India.

Sanjay Singh, the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and senior party leader said the AAP will seek a ban on the BJP leaders from campaigning. He also demanded an FIR to be registered against the political leaders who are giving provocative speeches.

""What is happening? Is this happening in the national capital where the parliament is situated? How can a central minister be allowed to speak such language?""

""The BJP has no issue to raise in the election and that is the reason it has indulge in violating the rules and regulations of the Election Commission (EC) with impunity and EC is completely silent,"" he said.

Efforts are being made to distract from real issues of electricity, water, education and health, he said,"" adding that they (BJP) will fuel communal sentiments and spread hate to avoid the real issues.

""The Chief Minister studied from IIT and left his job as a Revenue Commissioner and sat on a dharna for 15 days against corruption. Have you ever seen a terrorist doing dharna against corruption,"" he asked? Singh also slammed BJP MP Ananth Hegde for calling Gandhi Ji's struggle for India's independence a 'drama'.

Earlier, addressing the media Javadekar said ""Kejriwal is now asking with a sad face, 'am I a terrorist?' You are a terrorist and there is a lot of evidence to prove that. You yourself had said you are an anarchist. There is not much difference between an anarchist and a terrorist,""

Javadekar also raked up the issue of Kejriwal ""staying a night at the Moga residence of Khalistani commander Gurinder Singh during the Punjab Assembly polls"". ""You knew it was a militant's house. Still, you stayed there. How much more evidence do you need?"" he said.

Singh said ""The victory of AAP is very clear and the BJP is completely baffled at the prospect of a certain defeat and all their leaders have resorted to making objectionable statements out of desperation"".

""The kind of statements they are making should attract strict penal action and FIR should be filed against them. First, a BJP MP called Arvind Kejriwal a terrorist, and then the CM of Haryana called him a 'monkey', the UP Chief Minister Yogi made fun of Kejriwal's health.

119,04-2-20,Migrants key to candidates’ fate,"There is a fight between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates in East Delhi's Laxmi Nagar constituency. The residents were happy over the Delhi Government works, such as free electricity, water and Mohalla clinic. Laxmi Nagar is known for housing a surfeit of coaching centres for Chartered Accountancy and a large chunk of migrant population resides in the area and it is understood that they will decide the fate of candidates. Congress held sway in this constituency as its candidate Dr Ashok Walia won this seat four times in a row. However, after delimitation in 2008, Congress is struggling to survive.

The AAP has once again fielded Nitin Tyagi, who won last Assembly election in 2015 with a margin of 6,000 votes, while BJP has brought Abhay Kumar Verma and Congress has fielded Hari Dutt Sharma.

Laxmi Nagar constituency comprises Shakarpur, Ganesh nagar, Lalita Park, Nehru Enclave, Yamuna Bank, Nanakpura, Dayanand colony, Pandav Nagar, Patparganj, Vinod Nagar north, Mother Dairy Plant, Krishna Kunj, Lakshmi Nagar, Mohan Park, Guru Angad Nagara West and Shakarpur Khas.

The Pioneer visited the constituency where residents highlighted their issues such as poor parking facility, pathetic garbage disposal system, irregular water supply, sewerage issues and congested streets casketed with wires. The residents haven't been able to get rid of poor infrastructure and narrow parking spaces causing discomfort since a long time, said a local resident of Laxmi Nagar.

""Pedestrian lanes are nearly invisible as adjoining roads are always choked with heavy traffic especially during peak hours. Majority work was initiated by the AAP Government during the final year of their tenure,"" said Atul Garg, a resident of Preet Vihar.

""Though the condition of the roads has improved but all of this sums down to zero during heavy pour every monsoon. These roads get choked and residents face acute problems because of pathetic condition sewerage lines,"" he added.

Lalita Park, another area in Laxmi Nagar accommodates large portion of unauthorized colonies where voters face deep troubles combating poor drainage systems. Many residents affirm that neither AAP nor BJP has kept their promises in the past.

""Nitin Tyagi has done a lot of work for us and has lived up to my expectations. Under his governance the condition of roads and pavements has improved. I expect him to return with a bigger mandate,"" said Sunny Chaurasia, helper at a private clinic from Ward No. 14, Laxmi Nagar. ""Despite CCTV cameras and GPS technology being installed in Delhi buses women safety still remains a concern. Free bus rides for women is a good initiative but how does it guarantee me personal safety? "" said a woman resident of Shakarpur who did not wish to be named.

Muslims in the constituency appeared to have issues with the sitting MLA. ""Free electricity and water supply cannot just guarantee AAP's victory. The constituency requires concrete planning and better infrastructure. Heaps of garbage and litter across the streets can be seen frequently and Municipal Corporation hardly sends workers to clean up the mess. Such unhygienic surroundings are open invitation for plague and other illnesses,"" said Mohammad Rizwan, a businessman of Vikas Marg, Laxmi Nagar.

""None of the governments have addressed the issue of pollution and environment degradation with certainty and with the ongoing 'Climate Crisis', this should have been their No.1 priority,"" said Sahil Singhal, a proprietor in Laxmi Nagar.

On January 19 AAP released its ""Guarantee Card"" enlisting 10 promises they will deliver if elected back in power. Besides continuing their scheme for free electricity (upto 200 units) Arvind Kejriwal looks forward to plant two crore saplings across the National Capital to combat pollution. Subsequently his rival Manoj Tiwari, President of BJP Delhi pitched his remedy for tackling air pollution in and around Delhi. He assured voters to install 60 smog towers across the National Capital to reduce 70 per cent pollution following the polls on February 8.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrants-key-to-candidates----fate.html

127,04-2-20,"Use technology to increase silk production, says CM","Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Monday said the Government will help acquire whatever techniques needed to develop Tussar production in State. Speaking at a function in Dumka on Monday the CM said that Jharkhand holds a distinct identity in the silk sector.

“Especially the Santhal Parganas has its own identity in the entire State ranging from silk production to making silk garments. Dumka district is the largest producer of silk in the entire State. This identity needs to be retained. Departments better prepare action plans. So that the income of people connected with silk can be increased and better opportunities for self-employment can be provided,” he said.

The CM said that employment in all houses is very important. “People will have employment only then their all round development will be done. You all work to make silk yarn. Many types of objects are made from silk thread. Do your work better so that you can earn more income. Take full advantage of whatever technical support is being provided to you by the government,” he said.

Soren further said, “We need to fast-connect our products with new technology. Earlier, the work of extracting silk thread from hands was done. With the advent of technology, the thread took months to remove.

Now it happens in a few hours, the work which used to take hours becomes possible in minutes.

All this was made possible by technology. Over time there is a need to connect with new technology and add others.”

The CM told the farmers that Khadi shows the identity of the country. “Khadi costumes are in high demand due to their manufacturing through technology. Improve your product so that it is in demand all over the world. There is a need to provide self-employment by adding more and more people in the field of silk production so that the standard of living of the people can improve. Given your interest in this field, the government will definitely work in the field of tasar production so that this sector can be strengthened,” he said.

The CM said that there is no stronger system in the whole earth than the system of nature. “We need to preserve the arrangement made by nature. Nature's system needs better management, only then we will get its benefit. Formerly a large number of cashew trees were found in this area. Due to neglect, cashew trees are rarely seen today. We devastated the entire forest. Today, the cashew nut is so expensive that we cannot buy it. In the past, no arrangement was made for the production of cashew,” he added.

Dumka DC Rajeshwari B said that the Chief Minister has given a new energy to farmers associated with tussar production. Efforts are being made to improve the quality of silk-related production so that the income of the farmers can be increased and the demand for the products produced by them increases.

132,04-2-20,Govt failed miserably to create jobs... afraid of replying questions: Rahul,"After tearing into Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget as “hollow” and failing to address unemployment levels in the country, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday targeted the Government again over the issue of unemployment, saying it has “failed miserably” to generate jobs for the youth of the country.

In a tweet posted this morning Rahul told Sitharaman “don’t’ be afraid of questions... asking on behalf of youth... replying is your responsibility”. The former Congress chief hit out at Sitharaman and the Centre for failing “miserably” to provide jobs.

“Finance Minister, don’t be scared of my questions. I am asking these questions on behalf of the youth of the country, to answer whom is your responsibility,” Rahul said in a tweet in Hindi. “The youth of the country want employment and your Government has failed miserably to provide them the same,” he said. The Congress leader used the hashtag “JawaabDoMantriJi” to put across his point.

Soon after the Budget was presented in Parliament, Rahul said there is nothing concrete in the Budget as the biggest problem in front of the country is unemployment and the Government has not addressed that.

“This is the mindset of the government -- all talk and nothing concrete. The biggest problem our youngsters are facing is unemployment and I didnRs t see any strategic idea as how they will get jobs,” Rahul told reporters in Parliament.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-failed-miserably-to-create-jobs----afraid-of-replying-questions--rahul.html
133,04-2-20,Case registered against irregularities in Manipur civil services 2016 exam,"The CBI has registered a case to probe alleged irregularities in the conduct of the Civil Services Mains examination for 2016 organised by the Manipur Public Service Commission (MPSC).

The agency has registered the case against unidentified officials of the Commission at the behest of the Manipur High Court. The Manipur Civil Services Combined Competitive Examination (CSCCE), 2016 had selected 82 officers of the Manipur Civil Service, Manipur Police Service and allied services whose selection was quashed by the High Court.

The high court had, in October last year, quashed the examination after several aspirants approached it alleging irregularities in the selection process and also ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the matter.

The court had then instituted a two-member panel to probe the matter, which revealed “irregularities and discrepancies”, including absence of examiners’ signatures on answer scripts, manipulation of marks and allotment of marks without evaluation of answer scripts.

“The MPSC appears to have taken the examination very lightly, like a child’s play, completely forgetting that it would decide and determine the career of a candidate,” it had said while handing over the investigation to the CBI.

In November last year, the order was upheld by the SC, which told the agency to conduct a time-bound investigation.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/case-registered-against-irregularities-in-manipur-civil-services-2016-exam.html
134,04-2-20,Opp walks out of LS as Verma begins speech,"The Opposition created an uproar in Parliament and even staged a walkout on Monday over the utterances by BJP MPs Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur during their campaigning in the Delhi Assembly polls.

Opposition members walked out of the Lok Sabha when Verma rose to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address while the Congress raised slogans against Union minister Anurag Thakur. Rajya Sabha proceedings were also washed out as the Opposition raised slogans against the Government, demanding a debate on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR).

As soon as Lok Sabha proceedings commenced, Congress-led Opposition protested in the lower house and continued slogan shouting against comments of Thakur and Verma with slogans “save India” , “ Save Democracy” and “ Save Constitution”.

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Government is silencing the voice of common people and accused ruling members as being “ Nakli Hindu”. He said the Government cannot silence people’s “boli” (voice) with “goli” (bullet). All through this, Thakur was answering questions related to his Ministry during question hour. AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, who was to ask a question, rather shouted, “We are with Jamia, we are with students.”

At 12.10 Speaker Om Birla adjourned the house till 130 hrs. When the house resumed its proceedings opposition members, including those from the Congress and DMK, walked out of Lok Sabha as soon as Verma rose to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address to protest his controversial remarks during a poll rally here.

Opposition benches raised slogans against the BJP MP like “Sharam Karo (Have Shame)”.

Speaker Om Birla said what a member says outside cannot be raised inside the House and that members should not set a “wrong precedent”.

Verma was barred by the Election Commission last week for four days for his controversial remarks made during an interview and at an election meeting.

The choice of Verma , a Delhi MP, as the first speaker by the BJP was obvious with Delhi set to go to poll on February 8.

Initiating the debate, Verma said India is proud to have such a President who has rejected the mercy plea of Nirbhaya convicts. Besides praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also admired the speaker for making the House paperless and giving an opportunity to new members to speak.

He accused ruling AAP of not fulfilling promises it made to the people of Delhi and standing up with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protestors. Verma also referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against CAA, rather people there are saying “Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-walks-out-of-ls-as-verma-begins-speech.html

As the lawyers representing various parties in the case have not arrived at a consensus on framing larger issues to be deliberated upon by the Constitution bench, it will frame them by Thursday, the top court said.

The Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, said it will inform the parties about the time frame for the hearing and would commence the proceedings by next week.

The bench said that it would go by the reference order of November 14 last year, made by a five-judge bench which by a majority of 3:2 had said that the larger bench will have to evolve a judicial policy to do “substantial and complete justice” in matters of freedom of religion, such as entry of Muslim women into mosques and ‘dargah’ and Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agyari.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc--will-frame-larger-questions-relating-to-women-discrimination-at-religious-places.html

An Act passed by Parliament in 2008 provided for setting up of ‘Gram Nyayalayas’ at the grass roots level for providing access to justice to citizens at the doorstep and to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to anyone by reason of social, economic or other disabilities.

A Bench headed by Justice N V Ramana also took into account the fact that several States have issued notifications for establishing ‘Gram Nyayalayas’ but all of them were not functioning except in Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

In his plea, Mani has urged the top court to call for the records from the Centre, states and UTs regarding steps taken by them to prevent children from falling into open or abandoned bore well pursuant to the directions given by the apex court in its August 2010 order.

138,04-2-20,Desi vaccine to control swine fever,"In order to check the falling pig population in India, the Government on Monday unveiled a new indigenously developed vaccine for controlling classical swine fever, which is an highly contagious fatal pig disease. The new vaccine, developed by Uttar Pradesh-based ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), will be much cheaper than the existing one. It would cost only Rs 2 per dose compared to the current vaccine’s rate of Rs 15-20 per dose and imported Korean vaccine rate of Rs 30 per dose. As per 2019 census, the country’s pig population declined to 9.06 million from 11.13 million in 2007.

Currently, India does not have enough vaccine for controlling classical swine fever (CSF), which has led to high mortality with annual loss of about Rs 4.29 billion. Against the annual requirement of 20 million doses, the availability is only 1.20 million doses, according to the IVRI.

Although there is no health risk to humans, it is highly transmissible among swine. “This CSF vaccine is much cheaper and will be a game changer. We need to speed up commercialisation,” Animal Husbandry and Dairying Department Secretary Atul Chaturvedi said after the launch.

The new vaccine has been developed using Indian strain and lakhs of doses can be produced very easily using the cell culture technology and the country’s requirement can be easily fulfilled, said Trilochan Mohapatra, Secretary to the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE). The vaccine has been tested on around 500 pigs at multiple locations.

He further said the vaccine will be commercialised in the next six months. Various state governments, private manufacturers and Nepal government have shown interest.

The cost of new vaccine would be less, as only one dose of new vaccine is required to be given to pigs in a year, unlike two doses of the existing ones, he said.

According to Ministry of Animal Husbandry, since 1964 a lapinized CSF vaccine is being used in India for controlling the disease. The vaccine is produced by sacrificing large numbers of rabbits for each batch. To do away sacrificing of rabbits and increase the productivity, IVRI later developed a cell-cultured vaccine using foreign strain and commercialised it in 2016 and 2018.

According to IVRI, the newly developed vaccine using Indian strain is safe and potent. It does not revert to virulence and provide protective immunity from day 14 of the vaccination till 24 months studied so far.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/desi-vaccine-to-control-swine-fever.html

140,04-2-20,U’khand Cong leaders missing Delhi election campaign,"The absence of leaders of Uttarakhand Congress from the heat of election campaign of Delhi assembly has led the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat to take jibe on the faction ridden party. On Monday while talking to the media persons, CM Rawat after returning from his whirlwind tour of Delhi, said that the Congress leaders are engrossed in fighting with each other due to which they are not finding time to campaign in Delhi election.

The CM claimed that the people of Delhi have decided to support BJP in the upcoming assembly elections. He said that Arvind Kejriwal rode piggyback to the movement of Anna Hazare to come to power in Delhi and all the leaders of the Anna movement who supported Kejriwal have left him.

Terming the anti Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest at Shaheen Bagh as the conspiracy of Arvind Kejriwal, Rawat said that the people of Delhi have decided to support BJP. Answering the jibe of CM Rawat, the vice president of the Uttarakhand Congress, Surya Kant Dhasmana said that many Congress leaders and members are camping in Delhi. On the absence of senior leaders of the party from the campaign in Delhi, Dhasmana claimed that the party would release the list of campaigners soon.

Notwithstanding the explanation given by Dhasmana and other Congress leaders, the fact is that the Congress leaders from Uttarakhand have so far remained away from the campaign in Delhi. Former CM Harish Rawat is the only leader from the state who has campaigned in Delhi. Harish Rawat incidentally is the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and is among the star campaigners of the Congress party in Delhi. With only three days left for campaigning for the polls slated to be held on February 8, the state unit’s claim of sending senior leaders to Delhi looks out of the place.

On the other hand, almost all senior leaders of BJP including, CM Rawat and members of his council of ministers are camping in Delhi for the campaign. It is pertinent to mention here that there are about 26 lakh voters of Uttarakhand origin in Delhi and they constitute a significant vote bank. It is estimated that these voters decide the outcome in all least 16 assembly segments in the 70 member Delhi assembly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/u---khand-cong-leaders-missing-delhi-election-campaign.html

142,04-2-20,"Meeting of Harish Rawat, Karan Mahra raises speculation","The deputy leader of Congress legislature party, Karan Mahra met former chief minister Harish Rawat here on Monday. The meeting triggered speculation about the next step of the Harish Rawat camp in the ongoing factional feud in the state unit of the party.

Later talking to The Pioneer, Mahra said that he met Harish Rawat to hold discussions on a variety of issues. He said that the Delhi election was one point of discussions.

“We discussed how we can help Congress candidates in Delhi assembly elections. We also discussed strategy for the assembly elections of 2022. Since my focus is on the districts of Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Champawat districts, I held discussions with former CM about them,’’ he said.

On being asked- if the discussions involved Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami who has resigned from the post of secretary in the new PCC, Karan Mahra said that Harish Rawat has said that since the assembly elections of 2022 are not far away, the issue should not be given much weightage.

He added that party MLAs would meet Harish Rawat after the Delhi assembly elections. Dharchula MLA has virtually revolted ever since the new PCC was announced. He was appointed as secretary by the party and his name was on the last position. Terming it as his insult the two time MLA had resigned from the post offered to him. The PCC president Pritam Singh accepted that the name of Dhami appeared erroneously in the list of secretaries.

Interestingly the episode gave the Harish Rawat camp to open front against Leader of Opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh. Dhami has accused the LoP for remaining friendly and non combative with the BJP government.

He said that the moment the BJP government stated that it would hold inquiry on the irregularities on the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) during the Congress reign; Indira Hridayesh adopted a soft stance on the Government.

Dharchula MLA claimed that eight out of eleven MLAs were not in favour of making her the LoP but everyone accepted the decision of the party high command.

He even claimed that the MLAs of would meet party high command and request to replace Indira Hridayesh with someone else. The meeting of Harish Rawat and Mahra on Monday is being viewed in the backdrop of the Harish Dhami episode and his open rebellion against Indira Hridayesh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/meeting-of-harish-rawat--karan-mahra-raises-speculation.html
143,04-2-20,Political masters behind hate speeches by BJP leaders: Cong,"Responding to Parvesh Verma’s speech on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, the Opposition parties alleged that “political masters at the top” are giving directions to make inflammatory speeches.

Participating in the debate, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded registering cases against Ministers and top BJP leaders for making inflammatory speeches to divide people on communal line. “They think that they can rule like dictators and make such speeches. It is unfortunate,” he said.

Gogoi said that for this Government, the students and women who are protesting against the CAA are “our enemies. But for me, they are my brothers and friends. They are telling about values of Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekanand”. Referring to the JNU incident on January 5, Gogoi said people witnessed disturbing scenes in universities.

Students and professors at JNU were bleeding due to attack and police did not do anything, he said adding, “I am not questioning Delhi Police”. Delhi Police, he said, is capable of managing everything, but “what I feel is that political masters are dictating them and giving directions”.

“In front of Delhi Police, a boy fired on the people,” the Congress leader said adding “he must have been motivated by someone. I want to know who is pulling the trigger. It’s not the minister or that boy,” he added.

Attacking Verma, the Congress MP also said that a member banned by Election Commission for campaigning in Delhi was allowed to speak first in the House and “that shows the BJP’s attitude towards the Election Commission and Parliament”. Gogoi said the government should talk about the real problems of poverty, unemployment, and inequality as these issues are not yet over.

Speaking during the discussion, T R Baalu (DMK) wondered if the President had gone through his speech before reading it during the joint sitting of Parliament. He said that Budget has not provided anything to boost investment in agriculture sector. On Citizenship Amendment Act, he asked the government about the compulsion under which they came up with this law. “You want to discriminate among people,” he alleged.

Opposing the motion, Trinamool Congress’ Mahua Moitra said the government is betraying the people who have voted for them. “You have betrayed the tribal people in Gujarat on whose land you built a statue,” she said. She dubbed the National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens and the CAA as the “biggest betrayal” of people of India. “People who voted for you in 2014 are horrified,” she said adding, “Today, you put a person banned by Election Commission to speak in parliament”.

She also said that the state of economy is abysmal and the finance minister was fearful in giving the target for the real GDP. “You have rubbished all economists, but your own former CEA appointed by you” is raising question marks on government data, she said. P V Midhun Reddy (YSRCP) said that his party was opposed to the NRC and the NPR and the government should not do anything which creates a sense of insecurity among minorities.

146,04-2-20,Sugar price may go up as yields 24% down,"A decline in sugar production by 24 per cent between October and January may lead to increase in prices in the country. The total sugar production declined to 141.12 lakh tonne this year as compared to 185.59 lakh tonne during the corresponding period last year due to fall in output in the major producing State of Maharashtra. The sugar marketing year runs from October to September.

According to Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), as on January 31, 2020, 446 sugar mills in the country have produced 141.12 lakh tonne of sugar, as compared to 185.59 lakh tonne produced by 520 mills last season on the corresponding date.

In Maharashtra, sugar production in the first four months of the 2019-20 marketing year is estimated at 34.64 lakh tonne compared with 70.99 lakh tonne in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Sugar output in Uttar Pradesh, however, increased to 54.96 lakh tonne from 52.86 lakh tonne. In Karnataka, production fell to 27.94 lakh tonne from 33.76 lakh tonne. ISMA has pegged the country’s sugar production at 260 lakh tonne for 2019-20.

The estimates are based after accounting for the diversion of sugarcane juice and ‘B’ heavy molasses into ethanol, which will reduce about 8.5 lakh tonne of sugar production.

“260 lakh tonne of sugar will be around 70 lakh tonne less than the production of the last season. We can already see that current year’s production is trailing by almost 44.5 lac tonne till the end of January 2020 as compared to the previous season,” the statement said.

The sugar sales in the first four months of the current season would be almost 7-8 lakh tonne more than the year-ago period.

“In the last year, the estimated sugar sales by the sugar mills were around 255 lakh tonne and considering the higher sales in this year, ISMA expects the sugar sales by sugar mills in the current season to be around 260 lakh tonne,” it added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sugar-price-may-go-up-as-yields-24--down.html

148,04-2-20,Islamists have infiltrated anti-CAA protests: Vijayan,"For the first time since the commencement of the agitation against Citizenship Amendment Act, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan accepted in the Legislative Assembly on Monday that Islamic terrorists have infiltrated into anti-CAA protest rallies.

“It has come to the notice of the Government that Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI, an Islamic extremist organisation) activists have infiltrated and almost hijacked the agitation against the CAA. The SDPI elements infiltrate into the agitation with the connivance of the local Mahul committees (the body in charge of the Mosques). The Mahul Committees should be careful about the activities of the SDPI activists,” Vijayan told the House while answering a question in connection with the unrest in Kerala.

The Chief Minister said that the anti-CAA agitation in Kerala is a role model to the country itself. “It has been a peaceful and disciplined agitation. So far, the Government has not taken action against anybody participating in the anti-CAA agitation,” he said. Vijayan came down heavily on the Congress leadership for that party’s alleged tie up with the SDPI.

There were allegations against the CPI(M) for including various Islamist organisations in its 621 km long Human Wall held on January 26 against the CAA. Thousands of burqua clad women were seen lining up along the National Highway in Kerala as part of the wall.

While the Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala blamed the CPI(M) for seeking the help of SDPI, the chief minister retorted by asking him why he was bothered about the SDPI.

Meanwhile BJP leader K Surendran blamed both the Congress and the CPI(M) for appeasement politics. “The CPI(M) cannot wash off the responsibility for ushering in Islamic terrorist organisations into the anti CAA rallies.

Rehman, who had resigned from his post in December last year in protest against the CAA, was detained at Lodha Police Station in Aligarh on Sunday.

The former IPS officer from Maharashtra told reporters that he was served a written notice by police stating that his presence at the AMU could lead to a law and order problem, and hence he decided to comply with this missive “and would come back” again after he gets permission.

He said the police told him that his presence at the AMU could be misused by some people as an excuse to instigate trouble on the campus. “I agreed to return because I am a law-abiding citizen and my purpose to visit the AMU was only to speak on the CAA and not provoke any trouble,” he said before leaving Aligarh.

153,04-2-20,NIA quizzes IIT-Guwahati Prof again over stir,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday quizzed IIT-Guwahati Professor Arupjyoti Saikia for the second time in three days in connection with the violence in the city over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.

The agency summoned him again for questioning on Tuesday.Saikia, a professor of History at the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati, was summoned to the NIA office at Sonapur in the outskirts of the city on Saturday, when he was asked to appear again before the sleuths of the agency on Monday.

An NIA official confirmed that Saikia was interrogated during the day.

“Today (Monday), he (Saikia) was questioned for about four hours. NIA is questioning him as a witness to Akhil Gogoi’s case. He has been asked to appear again at 11 am tomorrow (Tuesday),” Saikia’s advocate Santanu Borthakur told PTI.

The NIA has already arrested around half a dozen senior leaders, including Akhil Gogoi, of peasant body Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and its sister organisations for their alleged role in massive violence during the anti-CAA protests across the state in December last year.

Earlier in December, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said that the State Government has evidence that a leading academician working at a central educational institute was monitoring the “entire exercise” of violence on December 11 and 12 in protest against the Act.

“That Assamese academician gave three statements — a revolution has started, all you senior leaders disappear and now enter through the Janata Bhavan (Secretariat) gate,” Sarma had said at a press conference on December 17.

Based on the evidence, it was found that the academician was giving instructions from a control room, he had said.Meanwhile, 42 eminent scholars, including Ramachandra Guha, Sukanta Chaudhuri, Partha Chatterjee, Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Nivedita Menon expressed concerns over the issue and the “ordeal that Saikia is going through”.

“Professor Saikia is an adornment to the literary and intellectual world of Assam and of India. He is also an individual of high moral character; gentle, soft-spoken, and utterly non-violent. His devotion to his students at IIT- Guwahati is exemplary.

“That a scholar of such standing, and a human being of such decency, has been called for intensive grilling by the National Investigation

Agency is deeply distressing. We urge that the NIA treat him with the dignity and respect he deserves, and allow him to continue his professional work unimpeded,” the statement issued by the academicians said.

Saikia has done extensive research on the history and nature of Brahmaputra and has penned several books on the mighty river.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-quizzes-iit-guwahati-prof-again-over-stir.html
154,04-2-20,NIA to quiz ex-J&K MLA for links with HM commander,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will question former J&K MLA Sheikh Abdul Rashid for his links with self-styled Hizbul Mujahideen commander Naveed ‘Babu’, arrested along with suspended Jammu and Kashmir Police DSP Davinder Singh, officials said here on Monday.

Rashid, popularly known as ‘Rashid Engineer’ and leader of the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), contested as an Independent candidate in the 2014 Assembly constituency from Langate in North Kashmir.

He is at present in judicial custody at the Tihar Jail after he was arrested by the NIA on August 9 in connection with a case related to finding of terror activities in the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir.

The officials said the agency would soon approach court for seeking a production warrant for summoning Rashid and question him about his association with Naveed alias ‘Babu’, whose full name is Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmad.

He is at present under the custody of the NIA till February 6.

Naveed was arrested along with suspended Jammu & Kashmir Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Davinder Singh on January 11. The police officer was allegedly ferrying Naveed along with two others out of the Kashmir Valley.

As reported by PTI last week, Naveed had claimed during interrogation that he had been in constant touch with the legislator for establishing a firm base for the terror group in North Kashmir and was looking for possible hideouts in that area, the officials alleged.

This is definitely a serious offence and needs to be probed thoroughly, they said, while justifying the need for questioning Rashid.

Along with Singh and Naveed, Rafi Ahmed Rather and Irfan Shafi Mir, who claims to be an advocate, were also arrested on the day from the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway at Qazigund.

On January 23, Naveed’s brother, Syed Irfan Ahmed, was also arrested after he was brought from Punjab. He was in constant touch with his brother and had asked him to look for an accommodation in Chandigarh, where they could escape the harsh winter months of Kashmir.

Last year also, Singh had ferried Naveed to Jammu and facilitated his return to Shopian after “rest and recuperation”.

Rashid was first a mainstream politician who was arrested by the NIA last year in connection with a case related to the funding of terror activities in Kashmir.

His name had cropped up during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali arrested by the NIA for allegedly supplying money to terror groups and separatists in the valley.

The NIA had registered the case against separatist and secessionist leaders, including unknown members of the Hurriyat Conference, who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations Hizbul Mujahideen, Dukhtaran-e-Millat, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and other outfits and gangs in 2016. The case was registered for raising, receiving and collecting funds through various illegal means, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in the erstwhile state and for causing disruption in the valley by pelting stones on the security forces, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India, the probe agency said in the FIR.

Hafiz Saeed, chief of the banned Jamaat-ud- Dawa (JuD), the front of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror outfit, has been named in the FIR as an accused.

The FIR also names organisations such as the two factions of the Hurriyat, one led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the other by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Hizbul Mujahideen and the Dukhtaran-e-Millat, an all-women outfit of separatists.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-to-quiz-ex-j-k-mla-for-links-with-hm-commander.html
155,04-2-20,Stir on till Act goes: Mamata,"Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has reiterated that the movement against the “cruel and discriminatory” Citizenship Amendment Act will continue till the Central Government rolls it back.

The Chief Minister on Monday joined the sit-in demonstration of the Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad, the Bengal ruling outfit’s students’ arm, congratulated the students for carrying on their dharna and asked them to continue with their stir till the Central Governmentdid not take the “black law” back.

“I congratulate you all for your tenacity … that you have been sitting in this demonstration site for the past several weeks for a right cause … I have a number of engagements that is keeping me busy but still I will keep coming back to the dharna site whenever I get time.

But I will implore student colleagues to continue with their movement against this cruel and discriminatory law until it is taken back by the Central Government,” Banerjee said.

The Trinamool Congress also attacked the Central Government and the BJP for trying to divert the people’s attention from the real issues by dividing the society.

Attacking the saffron party for intimidating the Opposition into silence TMC MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy said that as the present Government had failed to address the real issues it was trying to divert the attention of the people.

Referring to the incidents of firing at Saheen Bag and Jamia Millia University the TMC leader said the government has suffered a moral loss in its bid to enforce the “undemocratic CAA” and now “its leaders are trying to scare away the protesters by instigating firing incidents.”

He said that the saffron party “came to power by promising acchhe din (good days), jobs, price reductions and development but failed to fulfill its promises in all fronts. And now in order to cloak its failures it is dividing the society and organizing violence.”

In Kolkata TMC leader and Mayor Firhad Hakim said the BJP was digging its own ditch for the coming days. “They had come to power by promising development. But instead of developing India they are dividing it. They will have to reap the ‘harvest’ in future. They are digging their own ditch and will fall in it.

“This is just the beginning. We will get to the roots of the organisation. A probe is also going on about their financial dealings.

He added that they were continuously interacting with the ED and other agencies but declined to comment further. In December 2019, Uttar Pradesh Police sought a ban on the PFI, suspecting the organisation’s complicity in the statewide violent protests against the CAA.

157,04-2-20,Chinmayanand gets bail in sexual abuse case,"The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail to former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand, accused of sexually abusing a law student.

Justice Rahul Chaturvedi issued the bail order on the plea filed by the BJP leader.

On November 16, the court had reserved its order after hearing the counsels from both sides.

Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman studied, was arrested on September 20 under section 376-C of the IPC, a charge short of rape.

It is applied when someone in authority takes advantage of his official position to ‘induce or seduce’ a woman to have sex with him. In a parallel case, the woman was charged with trying to extort money from Chinmayanand, whom she had accused of rape.

The high court granted her bail on December 4. The Supreme Court had stepped in after the 23-year-old law student went missing for a few days in August last year after posting a video clip on social media, alleging sexual abuse.

A special investigation team of Uttar Pradesh Police, formed on the directions of the apex court, arrested Chinmayanand about a month later.

159,04-2-20,Goa House passes motion hailing PM amid walkout by Cong,"The Goa Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a motion, congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) amid a walkout by MLAs of Opposition Congress and the Goa Forward Party GFP).

Majority of Catholic MLAs of the ruling BJP supported the motion which was moved by Atanasio Monserratte and Clafacio Dias in afternoon on the first day of the Budget session.

MLAs of Congress and the GFP led by the Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat created ruckus and rushed to the Well of the House demanding that Speaker Rajesh Patnekar disallow the motion.

They later staged a walkout saying they had submitted a notice seeking a discussion on the new citizenship law and the proposed country-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In the House of 40, the ruling BJP has 27 MLAs of its own including the speaker, who all were present besides two Independent legislators who support the party-led government.

NCP MLA Churchil Alemao, who also supports the Government, was absent. The Opposition MLAs included five members of the Congress, three of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), one of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and an Independent.

Addressing the House, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said “few leaders were misguiding people on the CAA”.

“Opposition members are not ignorant about the Act. They are well aware about it, but are purposefuly trying to misguide people,” he said. Sawant said the CAA was enacted to take care of the minority communities in Pakistan, Afghanisthan and Bangladesh.

The CAA, under which non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be given Indian citizenship, came into force from January 10. It was passed by the Parliament on December 11, 2019.

The amended law is facing strident Opposition from various quarters over its “discriminatory nature”, with states like Kerala, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Punjab passing resolutions opposing it.

Sawant said the number of Hindus in Pakistan shrank from 13.5 per cent to 1.85 per cent.

“Where have these people gone? They have either got converted or migrated, and naturally they have come to India,” he said.

Urging the Opposition benches to read the history, Sawant saidIndia was divided on the religious lines in 1947 by the Congress party.

“Pakistan (was created) for Muslims while India is for Hindus. The attempt to give citizenship (to refugees from Pakistan) was made by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who in the year 1950 assured the Lok Sabha that the refugees would be given (Indian) citizenship,” the CM said.

He said some people from outside Goa are trying to “poison” the minds of local Christians.

Ports Minister Michael Lobo of the BJP said many Christians who had migrated to Pakistan are wiling to return to Goa.

“I have been giving them the letters required by the embassy to visit Goa for participating in feasts and other occasions. Those people would be benefitted due to enactment of the CAA,” he said.

Deputy Speaker Isidore Fernandes said the Goa Church has adopted an anti-CAA stand, but it is for the elected representatives to clear the air on the act.

“We face humiliation many a times when we go for religious gatherings, but we should face it and we should convince people on this Act,” he said.

BJP MLA and Power Minister Nilesh Cabral said the CAA will resolve the major issue of enemy properties in Goa.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/goa-house-passes-motion-hailing-pm-amid-walkout-by-cong.html

Public sector companies often have more people on rolls than their private sector counterparts and companies wanting to take them over would likely right-size them to remove inefficiencies.

In an interview with PTI, the Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) said the government will follow a two-stage bidding process for selling its entire holding in Air India and BPCL.

First preliminary interest from potential bidders is invited, followed by them being given access of data room on the companies for due diligence. In the second stage, price bids are invited.

While in the case of Air India, the expression of interest (EoI) has been invited by March 17, an offer seeking the same for BPCL is likely to be floated in the next few days.

Asked if the bidders will get a free hand to right-size the companies after the acquisition, Pandey said, “There will be certain protection to employees and there will be other conditionalities and this will be listed out in the share purchase agreement (SPA).”

He did not give details of the conditionalities. An SPA will signed with the acquirer who offers the highest bid for buying out government stake.

The government is selling its entire 100 per cent stake in Air India but wants effective control to stay with Indian nationals. The airline, which started as a Tata Airlines in 1932 and was later acquired by the government, has not made profits since 2007.

167,04-2-20,Fitch predicts India’s FY21 GDP growth at 5.6%,"Fitch Ratings on Monday said India is expected to clock a GDP growth of 5.6 per cent in the next financial year, lower than the projection made by the government’s Economic Survey, as Budget 2020 has not “materially altered” its view on the country’s growth outlook.

The Economic Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget for 2020-21 on February 1, had projected a GDP growth of 6-6.5 per cent, up from 5 per cent estimate for 2019-20.

“The fiscal slippage announced in the government’s new FY21 budget is modest relative to its previous targets, and is consistent with our expectations when we affirmed India’s ‘BBB-’ rating with a stable outlook last December, given slowing growth momentum,” said Thomas Rookmaaker, Director and Primary Sovereign Analyst for India, Fitch Ratings.

Sitharaman’s Budget missed deficit target for the third year in a row, pushing shortfall to 3.8 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal as compared to 3.3 per cent previously planned. The fiscal deficit target for the coming fiscal year starting April 1, has been fixed at 3.5 per cent.

“The new budget targets imply some further postponement of fiscal consolidation, in line with the government’s ambivalent approach to consolidation of the past few years when deficit outturns have typically exceeded budget targets,” Fitch said projecting general government debt to remain close to 70 per cent of GDP through FY22.

India’s high public debt relative to peers is a rating weakness, it said.

“The budget does not materially alter our view on India’s economic growth outlook, which we forecast to pick up to 5.6 per cent in FY21 from 4.6 per cent in FY20,” it said.

The report further noted that Budget contains some measures which may support GDP growth in the medium-term, including reduced individual income tax rates, some easing of restrictions on foreign portfolio inflows, continued focus on public infrastructure spending, and schemes of which the details remain to be announced to encourage manufacturing in the electronics and textiles sectors.

The rating agency said the assumptions in the budget, including nominal growth of 10 per cent and a rise in revenues by 9.2 per cent were “broadly credible” although there were risks to the downside.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fitch-predicts-india---s-fy21-gdp-growth-at-5-6-.html

171,04-2-20,"Dissatisfaction, intense lobbying ahead of K’taka Cabinet expansion","A wave of dissatisfaction has hit the six-month-old BJP Government against the backdrop of ChiefMinister BS Yediyurappa’s announcement to induct 13 aspirants in the second Cabinet expansion on February 6.

In the first Cabinet expansion, the Chief Minister hadinducted 17 Ministers on August 20, 2019.

Among the 13, ten will be those defectors from Congress and the JD(S) who were disqualified earlier and won the assembly by-election in December last year.

The rest will be the ‘native BJP leaders’, as Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol put it.

Speculation is rife that Mahadevapura MLA Arvind Limbavali, Hukkeri MLA Umesh Katti and CP Yogeshwar, who hadlost to HD Kumaraswamy from Channapatna Assembly segment,would be inducted.

If Yogeshwar is included in the cabinet then he will bethe second Minister after Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadiwho had lost and yet made it to the cabinet.

The possible induction of Yogeshwar and Savadi, who was made Deputy Chief Minister despite losing the Assembly elections, are also a “reason” for discontent in the BJP.

Hectic activities began in the power corridor and MLAsstarted forming groups to impress upon the Chief Minister toinclude their members in the ministry.

While one group was from the “Kalyana Karnataka” region, the others were the defectors who will be excluded in the cabinet expansion.

A few MLAS from ‘Kalyana Karnataka’ region or erstwhileHyderabad-Karnataka region comprising six districts, met atthe Legislature Home and held a meeting.

The meeting was led by Shorapur MLA Narasimha Nayak akaRaju Gouda and Honnalli MLA MP Renukacharya.

The MLAs of the Kalyana Karnataka region were unanimous that their backward region should get representation in the cabinet.

Later, Gouda met the Chief Minister and requested that their region be given adequate representation in the cabinet, which is lacking development.

Talking to reporters, Gouda said, “We had given representations to all the MPs, MLAs and the Chief Minister. Today also we all had a meeting and later called on the Chief Minister requesting him to make any MLA from our region.”

He said any imbalance in Cabinet expansion will causetrouble to the MLAs from Kalyana Karnataka region.

“If you make the defeated candidates Ministers then include 120 people in the cabinet,” an aggrieved Gouda taunted.

Renukacharya too echoed the same sentiments.

“If you givepreference to the defeated candidates then what will happen tothose who won the election? Where should the winners ofelection go? We emphasise upon giving preference to thewinners.”

On the other hand, the defectors who jumped the Congress and the JD(S) ship and helped form the BJP government too had a meeting in Bengaluru, said BJP sources.

They were unanimous that not only the 11 MLAs who won the election be made Ministers but also AH Vishwanath and MT BNagaraj who had unsuccessfully contested the assembly bypolls from Hunasuru and Hoskote on a BJP ticket.

Vishwanath, who was quite vocal on Sunday for dropping hisname, was mellowed down on Monday after meeting Yediyurappa.

However, his insistence for getting a Cabinet berthremained intact.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dissatisfaction--intense-lobbying-ahead-of-k---taka-cabinet-expansion.html
172,04-2-20,"Woman tied up, dragged, locked in house by TMC men","A woman was tied up, dragged on the road and locked inside a house by alleged Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters who wanted to ‘forcibly’ acquire her land for a village road in West Bengal’s South Dinajpur district.

The incident has kicked up a storm, with Opposition parties accusing the TMC of ‘letting loose goondaraj’ in the state. The TMC leadership dubbed the allegations as “baseless” and said they would look into it.

The woman identified as high school teacher and BJP supporter Smritikana Das, her mother and other family members were also assaulted by the group, led by panchayat members, at Nandanpur in Gangarampur block, the police said.

So far nobody has been arrested in connection with the incident that took place on Friday. A video grab of the purported attack showed Nandanpur panchayat ‘upa-pradhan’ (deputy chief) Amal Sarkar and some others involved in the act, the police said.

The TMC district leadership on Sunday expelled Sarkar for his alleged involvement in the incident, party sources said.

The video showed that the teacher fell down on the road when the attackers tied her hands and legs, and dragged her for nearly 30ft while raining blows on her.

The attackers then locked her up inside a house, belonging to a TMC block level worker.

Her sister, Soma, was also beaten up by the attackers when she went to Smritikana’s rescue.

The teacher, who was discharged from a local hospital after preliminary treatment, lodged a complaint against Sarkar and four TMC supporters at Gangarampur police station, a police officer said.

“We are probing the incident and also talking to eye-witnesses,” he said.

According to locals, the panchayat had recently taken up a project to build a road that would pass by the woman’s land.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/woman-tied-up--dragged--locked-in-house-by-tmc-men.html
173,04-2-20,Indian-origin man tried to stop London terrorist with knife,"An Indian-origin shopkeeper tried to stop the convicted terrorist from stealing the knife which he used for a stabbing frenzy on a busy high street in south London, before being shot dead by armed police officers during Sunday's terror attack.

Jagmon Singh was in the shop where convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman stormed in to steal a knife before using it to stab a woman in the back, who has since been discharged from hospital.

The 20-year-old Sri Lankan origin Islamic State (ISIS) inspired Londoner went on to attack another man, who suffered life-threatening injuries and remains in hospital but has been declared out of danger. Jagmon Singh's brother revealed on Monday how his brother tried to grab the knife out of Amman's grip, believing him to be a shoplifter, before he fled out of the store on Streatham High Road on Sunday.

“My brother recognised him because he had come in the week before and didn't buy anything,” Kiranjeet Singh told the ‘Evening Standard' newspaper.

“My brother said he grabbed a ceramic 10-inch kitchen knife that was hanging by the till. He walked in, took the knife, saw nobody was looking and ran out. He removed the packaging then stabbed the woman in the back. It was completely random then he started running,” said the 38-year-old, who owns the 'low price store' on the street. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers have been carrying out searches on Monday in the bail hostel in south London where Amman had been lodged after he was released half-way through a three-year terrorism prison sentence under parole conditions.

Amman's mother Haleema Faraz Khan spoke about her last visit with her son at the hostel last week as she described him as a “polite and lovely boy” who had been “brainwashed” by material he saw online.

She told Sky News in an interview that her son had been further radicalised by his time in the high security Belmarsh prison in south-east London.

Khan, whose family is originally from Sri Lanka but is now based in Bedfordshire in the east of England, said when she first heard an attack had taken place, she “had a feeling” her son was responsible because it was in south London.

“I saw it on the TV, that's when I knew it was him. His name was there. That was the first time I heard. He didn't answer his phone, I tried to ring him [after the attack],” she told Sky News.

Amman had been under surveillance since his release following his sentence for terrorism offences in December 2018.

He had pleaded guilty to the possession and dissemination of terrorist material and it emerged in court that he had shared ISIS-related beheading material on social media. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reiterated that the government will be looking into imposing tougher custodial sentences on dangerous and convicted terrorist suspects.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/indian-origin-man-tried-to-stop-london-terrorist-with-knife.html

175,04-2-20,Sedition charges against 51 in Mumbai for pro-Sharjeel slogans,"In major development, the Mumbai police on Monday evening slapped sedition charges against 51 people who allegedly raised pro-Sharjeel Imam slogans at a rally held at Azad Maidan on Saturday.

Hours after some videos of the group raising slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam at Saturday’s rally went viral, the police registered cases under section 124-A (Sedition) of the Indian Penal Code against 51 per5sons, including activist Urvashi Chudawala.

Police official spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok confirmed the development.

Saturday’s rally was organised by the Queer Azadi Mumbai (QAM), a collective of various LGBT groups. At the rally, some of the participants raised slogans in favour of Sharjeel Imam, who has been arrested on charges of sedition for provoking people to try to cut off north eastern states from rest of the country. The group was allegedly carrying posters of Sharjeel's pix and raised slogans promising to complete his unfulfilled task.

Earlier in the day, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya lodged a complaint with the Azad Maidan police, demanding strong action against those involved in the anti-national activities at Azad Maidan.

In a letter written to the senior inspector of the Azad Maidan police station, Somaiya said: “It is understood that on February 1, few individuals abused country and raised anti-national slogans during a programme organised by LGBT.

The function and demonstrations were misused to support Shaheen Baug/anti CAA feelings. I would request to register FIR against the anti-nationals and take strong action”.

Somaiya threatened to stage a dharna outside the Azad Maidan Police Station if the police failed to book such persons within 72 hours.

Senior BJP leader and Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Devendra Fadnavis demanded to know as to “what was going on and why the Maharashtra govt was keeping silent in the matter”.

On his part, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had said earlier in the day that the police were examining the issue before initiating suitable action in the matter.

Meanwhile, the QAM disassociated itself from the sloganeering in support of Sharjeel Imam. “We completely dissociate ourselves from and strongly condemn the abrupt radical slogans in support of Sharjeel and/or any other slogans against the integrity of India at the gathering. QAM works on the process of consensus before executing any action, however, we would like to highlight that neither QAM nor the individuals who have signed the permissions were communicated with or kept informed of the intent and/or content of this sloganeering,” the QAM said in a statement issued here.

The QAM also claimed that it was irresponsible and potentially detrimental and none of the individuals raising these slogans were part of the organizing process or permissions process with them. “These slogans, performances and protests happened abruptly and precipitously without the consent of the organizers”, the statement read.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sedition-charges-against-51-in-mumbai-for-pro-sharjeel-slogans.html

186,04-2-20,Chinese stocks crash as virus gloom infects markets,"Chinese stocks collapsed Monday with hundreds of firms plunging by the maximum 10 per cent as investors got their first chance in more than a week to react to a barrage of bad news from the spiralling coronavirus outbreak.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended the morning session down 8.13 percent, or 241.87 points, at 2,734.66, while the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China’s second exchange, was down 8.30 percent, or 145.78 points, to 1,611.04.

Hong Kong went into the break 0.09 percent, or 23.78 points, up at 26,336.41 on bargain-buying after being battered last week.

The scale of the plunge was remarkable even by the standards of China’s notoriously volatile share markets, indicating deep concern over the economic impact of the epidemic, which has now killed more than people SARS in 2003.

The last time Chinese indices had plunged in excess of eight percent in a day was when an equities bubble popped nearly five years ago.

“Investor panic quickly spread across the board and will be dominating the market over the short term,” said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund. More than 2,600 stocks fell by the 10 percent daily limit, according to Bloomberg financial data.

The yuan also weakened more than 1.5 percent to around 7.02 per dollar.

Markets in the world’s second-biggest economy had closed on January 24 for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, but in that time the viral epidemic that started in Wuhan has spread globally. They were scheduled to reopen on Friday but the government extended the holiday to help deal with the virus.

Stock markets worldwide have sunk as major corporate names froze or scaled back their Chinese operations, threatening global supply chains that depend heavily on the country.

China’s central bank said it would pump 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the economy on Monday to help stabilise markets. Yang said an interest rate cut also is “urgent and necessary”. Volatility will reign until there are clear signs that the coronavirus is contained, analysts said.

Travel and tourism shares plummeted after domestic and international travel curbs were imposed to slow the virus.

China International Travel Service fell 10 percent to 73.80 yuan shortly after the open.

Individual Chinese stocks can only move 10 percent in either direction each session before being suspended, a measure intended to limit volatility. Foxconn Industrial Internet, an arm of Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn, were also limit down at 18.00 yuan.

Foxconn has closed its Chinese factories until at least mid-February, potentially affecting supply chains for tech companies that rely on it for everything from Apple’s iPhones to flat-screen TVs and laptops.

China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines were also suspended after diving 10 percent.

Consumer bellwether Kweichow Moutai, the world’s largest distiller and whose fiery liquor is a favoured Lunar New Year gift, fell 5.27 percent to 997.30 yuan.

Many healthcare stocks gained, however, as Chinese rush to stock up on face masks and other medical supplies.

Shares in Shanghai No. 1 Pharmacy and China Meheco both were suspended after surging 10 percent.

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said its market intervention was aimed at maintaining banking system liquidity and a stable currency market. China’s economy is expected to take a clear hit from the crisis, which has brought industrial regions grinding to a halt.

“The near-term impact on Chinese GDP growth is likely to be large,” Oxford Economics said in a research note.

“Considering the affected areas account for just over 50 percent of total Chinese output, we think this could lead China’s annual GDP growth to slow to just four percent in Q1,” it added — down from a previous forecast of six percent growth.

China’s benchmark iron ore contract declined by its daily limit of eight percent on Monday, while copper, crude and palm oil also sank by the maximum allowed, according to Bloomberg News.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chinese-stocks-crash-as-virus-gloom-infects-markets-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/chinese-stocks-crash-as-virus-gloom-infects-markets.html
187,04-2-20,Remove tags to get more women in workforce: Tata Sons Chairman,"Tags need to be removed to get more women into India's workforce, Tata Sons Chairman, N Chandrasekaran said.

There are lots of 'tags' in India such as 'women cannot do this (kind of jobs); this is only for men,' and all of them have to be removed, he said.

""There is a possibility of creating platforms for SMEs, there is a possibility of getting (more) women into workforce,"" Chandrasekaran said.

Policy changes are also needed.

In healthcare for example, rules are strict, he noted, pointing to ""what can be done by doctors and what can be done by people who are not doctors.""

Chandrasekaran also said that 'care' in general -- such as those targeted at elderly and children as an industry is a ""huge opportunity.""

""We got to create women role-models in non-traditional areas,"" he said, questioning as to why they can be confined to only educated women.

Chandrasekaran made the comments here last evening while responding to a related question after the launch the book ""Bridgital Nation"" authored by him and Roopa Purushothaman, Chief Economist and Head of Policy Advocacy Tata Sons.

The launch was followed by a conversation with Nandan Nilekani, Co-Founder & Chairman Infosys and Founding Chairman, UIDAI (Aadhaar).

Referring to India's education system, Chandrasekaran said it has always been about 'reading, writing and counting.'

""Thinking, collaboration, digital, using software are far more easier to teach than reading, writing and counting,"" he opined.

188,04-2-20,Nominal GDP growth projections ambitious given structural challenges: Moody's,"Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said economic growth projections made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2020-21 appear ambitious given the structural and cyclical challenges facing the Indian economy.

The Budget expects nominal GDP growth of 10 per cent in the next fiscal , followed by 12.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent in FY22 and FY23, respectively.

""These forecasts appear ambitious given the combination of structural and cyclical challenges that the Indian economy faces,"" it said.

Even before the significant slowing in economic expansion in 2019, nominal GDP growth had averaged about 11 per cent over the five years from 2014 to 2018.

""We expect the economy to rebound at a more modest pace, with nominal GDP growth rising to around 8.7 per cent in fiscal 2020 and 10.5 per cent in fiscal 2021, from about 7.5 per cent in fiscal 2019,"" it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nominal-gdp-growth-projections-ambitious-given-structural-challenges--moody-s-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nominal-gdp-growth-projections-ambitious-given-structural-challenges--moody-s.html
189,04-2-20,"6 Turkish troops, 13 Syrian soldiers killed in north Syria","Turkey hit targets in northern Syria, responding to shelling by Syrian Government forces that killed at least six Turkish soldiers, the Turkish president said Monday.

A Syrian war monitor said 13 Syrian troops were also killed.

Also, Syrian activists said airstrikes in the country's northern, rebel-held region killed at least nine civilians on Monday.

The exchange between Ankara and Damascus came hours after a large Turkish military convoy entered the northwestern province of Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria.

It is likely to further increase tensions between the two neighboring countries as such direct clashes have been rare and could also cause friction between Moscow and Ankara, which have sought to coordinate their actions in Syria.

Earlier, Turkey's National Defense Ministry said the Turkish forces were sent to Idlib as reinforcement and were attacked there despite prior notification of their coordinates to the local authorities.

It said Turkish forces responded to the attack, destroying targets. Four Turkish soldiers died at the scene while two others died later in hospital. Seven Turkish troops were wounded.

Speaking to reporters before departing for a visit to Ukraine, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish artillery hit some 46 targets in Syria. Erdogan said Turkish warplanes were also involved and claimed that there were between 30 and 35 casualties on the Syrian side but offered no evidence.

“Those who test Turkey's determination with such vile attacks will understand their mistake,"" Erdogan said. He said Russia was told that Ankara would not stand for any “situation where we are prevented"" from responding to Syrian assaults.

“It is not possible for us to remain silent when our soldiers are being martyred,"" Erdogan said.

The exchange occurred near the Syrian flashpoint town of Saraqeb, according to the the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group.

It added that Turkish troops shelled Syrian army positions in three provinces, killing eight soldiers in Idlib, three in Latakia province and two in the Hama region.

However, Syria's state news agency SANA said government forces captured two new villages on the way to Saraqeb. It added that as Syrian troops were chasing insurgents, four Turkish soldiers were killed and nine wounded triggering a Turkish retaliation — but it claimed there were no casualties among Syrian troops.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/6-turkish-troops--13-syrian-soldiers-killed-in-north-syria.html
190,04-2-20,US spreading global ‘panic' over coronavirus: China,"China on Monday accused the US of spreading ""panic"" through its actions like travel bans and evacuation of diplomats and said there was no ""substantial help"" from Washington to contain the virus that has killed 361 people and infected 17,205 others in the country.

The deadly virus — first emerged in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province — has spread to 25 countries, including India, the US and the UK.

Joining a growing list of nations to impose travel restrictions, the US has announced a 14-day travel ban on all visitors from China, regardless of their nationality. The US citizens arriving from China's virus-hit Hubei province will have to undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine on arrival, while those travelling to other parts of China will face screening and monitoring. A CNN report said the mandatory quarantine is the first time the US has issued such an order in 50 years. ""What the US has done could create and spread panic,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said addressing the first online media briefing.

""The US Government has not provided any substantive help to the Chinese side yet. On the contrary, it was the first to withdraw its consulate staff from Wuhan, the first to suggest the partial withdrawal of embassy staff, the first to announce a ban on entry by Chinese citizens after the WHO made it clear that it doesn't recommend or even opposes travel and trade restrictions against China,"" she said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-spreading-global----panic--over-coronavirus--china.html

The pan-Islamic body, which represents more than 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, ""rejects this US-Israeli plan as it does not meet the minimum aspirations and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and contradicts the terms of reference of the peace process"", it said in a statement. A meeting of foreign ministers at OIC headquarters in the Saudi city of Jeddah called on ""all member states not (to) deal with this plan or cooperate with the US administration efforts to enforce it in any way or form"".

Under the US plan unveiled last week, Israel would retain control of the disputed city of Jerusalem as its ""undivided capital"" and annex settlements on Palestinian lands. Trump said Palestinians would be allowed to declare a capital within annexed east Jerusalem. The OIC reiterated its support for east Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state, stressing its ""Arab and Islamic character"". It said peace would ""only be achieved with the end of the Israeli occupation, the full withdrawal from the territory of the State of Palestine in particular the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) and the other Arab territories occupied since (the) June 1967 (Middle East war)"".",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pan-islamic-body-oic-rejects-trump-s-west-asia-peace-plan.html

Filmmaker Karan Johar says his forthcoming production Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship is first of its kind and a pure horror film.

“Horror genre is popular worldwide and it's audience-friendly but unfortunately it is made little less in Indian cinema. I am grateful that Vicky Kaushal helmed the film with us because it gives us confidence that such films can be made. We would like to take this franchise forward,” said Johar, at the film's trailer launch, which he attended with lead actor Vicky Kaushal, co-producer Shashank Khaitan and director Bhanu Pratap Singh.

‘Every individual has her own reality, and every action she takes, she feels, is justified in the situation that she lives. That is what my character is about in Malang. For example, there are psychopath killers and, of course, what they are doing is not right! So when the audience watches the film, I do not want them to get inspired by her actions and try them in reality. It is a work of fiction.’

195,04-2-20,Mumbai face Saurashtra in must-win game,"Having endured a disappointing so far, 41-time champions Mumbai face a must-win situation to keep their slim knock-out chances alive when they take on an in-form Saurashtra in an Elite Group B Ranji Trophy game starting here today.

The road to the knock-outs for Mumbai became even tougher after their match against Himachal Pradesh was washed out and both the teams shared a point each.

Mumbai, with 13 points, are languishing are at the 12th spot in the combined Group A and B table with one win, two losses and three draws.

Only five teams from combined Group A and B can make it to the knock-outs. An outright win here would take Mumbai to 19 points and a win with bonus point will take them to 20 points.

Anything less than a victory, would mean that Mumbai are virtually out of the tournament.

The visitors would be bolstered by the return of senior batsman Suryakumar Yadav, who was with on India A duty in New Zealand. And he would be more than eager to contribute with the bat for his side.

Another young batsman Sarfaraz Khan, who has hit back-to-back triple and double hundreds, would look to continue from where he left in Dharamshala.

He had remained unbeaten on 226 on the opening day of Mumbai’s game against Himachal Pradesh and before that he had notched up a triple hundred against Uttar Pradesh.

Another positive sign for Mumbai is that ‘crisis man’ Siddesh Lad and skipper Aditya Tare are back among runs. However, their top-order needs to fire big time.

Mumbai bowlers led by experienced Tushar Deshpande would also need to deliver for the team.

Spinners Shashank Attarde and Shams Mulani have been playing their part well and they would be more than keen to rattle the opposition one more time.

Saurashtra, on the other hand, are sitting pretty on the third spot in combined A and B table, with 25 points.

Their skipper Jaydev Unadkat is leading from the front and his 12 wickets in the last match against Baroda helped his side win the game.

But Saurashtra need make improvements in their batting department.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mumbai-face-saurashtra-in-must-win-game.html
196,04-2-20,India take on Pak in U-19 semis,"Four-time champions India will back themselves to reach their third successive final at the U-19 World Cup when they face arch-rivals Pakistan in a last four clash here today.

Both teams go into the semifinal unbeaten. While India beat Australia in the quarterfinals, Pakistan outplayed Afghanistan.

Pakistan captain Rohail Nazir played down the hype surrounding the game but an India-Pakistan contest is always a high-pressure one which tests the character of players on either side. Doing well in the game makes them overnight stars and the players know that.

Like at the highest level, the India juniors have had the upper hand over Pakistan of late, having beaten them in the Asia Cup last September when they emerged tournament winners.

India, who are the defending champions of the U-19 World Cup, had inflicted on Pakistan a 203-run hammering in the last edition in 2018.

However, history counts for little and the Priyam Garg-led India will have to play their best game to knock Pakistan out of the competition.

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has been the backbone of India batting, scoring three half-centuries in four games including against Australia.

The rest of the batsmen have not done much to write home about and if the lower-order had not rescued India in the quarterfinal, the outcome of the game could have been different. Not to forget the match-winning spell from pacer Kartik Tyagi.

Facing Pakistan fast bowlers Abbads Afridi, Mohammad Amir Khan and Tahir Hussain will be a challenge for the Indian batsmen.

Opener Huraira made an impressive debut in the last game, scoring 64 to lead his team to a comprehensive win over Afghanistan after bowlers nicely set up the game.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-take-on-pak-in-u-19-semis.html
197,04-2-20,Domingo rues Pak fixture list,"Bangladesh begin a to-and-fro commute to Pakistan on Wednesday for a Test and ODI series sandwiched between home fixtures — a quirky fixture list prompted by security fears.

They play a first Test in Rawalpindi starting Friday, but head home immediately afterwards for a series against Zimbabwe.

They then return to Pakistan for the second Test beginning April 5, after an ODI on April 3.

“It is not ideal. You always want to go there at least seven or eight days before a Test match,” coach Russell Domingo told reporters on Monday.

Bangladesh wanted to play the series in phases because they want to spend as little time in the country as possible due to safety concerns.

Domingo said he was happy with the form shown by some of the Bangladesh batsmen in domestic competition this season, but acknowledged conditions would be different away from home.

Tamim Iqbal scored an unbeaten 334 runs on Sunday — the highest first-class innings ever on Bangladesh soil — in a local league game.

Skipper Mominul Haque and senior batsmen Mahmudullah Riyad and Liton Das have also scored recent centuries.

“The wickets that they are playing here don’t have much pace and bounce,” Domingo said.

“I am sure Rawalpindi might have some pace and bounce... It is going to be a big challenge for the boys.

The South African said he had demanded more commitment from his batsmen — especially away from home.

“Some of the boys know that they have to put in some big performances on the back of a poor Test series against India,” he said.

“We have to show a bit more commitment with the bat, and find ways to manufacture scores even when the conditions are not good.”

Bangladesh lost all five of their Test matches in 2019, with their last two defeats coming by an innings margin against India.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/domingo-rues-pak-fixture-list.html
198,04-2-20,"Be patient, don’t rush comeback: Zaheer to Pandya","Former India speedster Zaheer Khan on Monday advised injured all-rounder Hardik Pandya to be patient and not rush his comeback from a back injury.

Pandya has been out of action since September and underwent a surgery for an acute lower-back injury in October. The 26-year-old, who plays for Mumbai Indians in the IPL, is not expected to make a comeback before the cash-rich T20 league, beginning March 29.

“For MI, IPL is still a long way away, and for Hardik it’s important he should take his time to comeback 120 percent. I can say it by experience, when anyone goes through injuries, it’s not about coming back, it’s about how you come back,” Zaheer, who himself made multiple comebacks after being injured said.

“You have to be patient through that process and you have to listen to the team which is around you — the support staff, be it your doctor, your physio, your trainers. Those are the key people one should communicate with and control the controllables.

“I have always been advising everyone in the same fashion: you have to take your time; you cannot be impatient and rush your comeback. It’s about when you come back, it should be in for a long haul,” he said.

Pandya is undergoing rehab and also failed a fitness test which delayed his comeback bid.

Asked if he has spoken to Pandya recently, Zaheer said: “I have (spoken to him). I will say this to anyone who is a sportsman and is going through an injury phase. It’s frustrating at times when you’re away from the game, but it’s very important to stay patient and control things in your control. It’s about listening to your body...”

The former Indian pacer also rated India’s recent 5-0 T20 triumph in New Zealand as a huge achievement.

“New Zealand was having a tough time; they tried to find answers to beat this Indian team. But I feel 5-0 victory is a huge achievement. They should take a lot of pride from what they have done from the New Zealand.

“It is definitely going to be a tough (ODI) series for New Zealand for sure. For India, it is about maintaining that momentum and carrying the confidence from previous series win to the ODI and Test matches,” he said.

Asked whether injury to senior pacer Ishant Sharma could affect the India attack in New Zealand, Zaheer said there was no need to worry as bench-strength was good. Ishant, who had twisted his right ankle during a Ranji Trophy, is unlikely to recover in time for the Test series beginning February 21.

“What was the result in the previous series? It’s not about that; it’s about putting up a team there together. That’s the strength right now this Indian team has. The strength of any squad is seen with their bench strength as well. We are in a position at the moment where the talent and pool of players we have is excellent,” said Zaheer.

“The roles are shared by different people. We are in a great space as a team at the moment with regard to that,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/be-patient--don---t-rush-comeback--zaheer-to-pandya.html
199,04-2-20,First UN ‘mercy flight' leaves Yemen's rebel-held Sanaa,": Children in critical need of medical care were evacuated Monday from Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa, in what the United Nations hopes will be the first of many mercy flights.

Seven young patients and their families had gathered at Sanaa airport, closed to commercial flights since 2016, clutching their transport documents for the trip to Amman.

""This is the first of what we hope and believe will be many flights,"" said UN Resident Coordinator for Yemen Lise Grande.

""It's a very important day, it's a day of hope. It shows that everyone wants the people who need help to get that help,"" she told reporters.

""The key is to have many flights, bigger planes, so that the people who need aid can get to the places where they will receive it."" Yemen's internationally recognised government, backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, has been fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels since 2014 when they seized control of the capital.

In November, the coalition -- which controls Yemen's airspace -- said patients needing medical care would be allowed to fly out of Sanaa.

The move was among confidence-building measures aimed at ending the five-year war that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions in what the UN has termed the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

200,04-2-20,Back to the roots,"Actor-director Amol Palekar, who is back on stage after 25 years with his play Kasur, talks about realism in films, charm of theatre, actors voicing their opinion and much more. By Sakshi Sharma

Amol Palekar is known for embodying the Indian middle class, replete with flaws, in films such as Gol Maal, Choti Si Baat, Rajnigandha and Baaton Baaton Mein. This realism is what has given him an unparalleled connect with the audience.

The actor-director has returned to the stage after 25 years with Kusur (The Mistake), an adaptation of the Danish thriller, Den Skylidge. A social thriller, the play focusses on the complexities of a contemporary life in a modern Indian city. Palekar has essayed the role of a retired assistant police commissioner Dandavate, whose life changes over the course of the night he volunteers at a police control room. One phone call leads to a series of twists and turns and when he leaves the control room, he’s a changed man. Returning to the stage after a long hiatus and experiencing both sides being the lead as well as the director, he tells us how he navigated that space.

How challenging was it to return to the stage after 25 years?

For anybody, 25 years is a very long time. After such a huge gap, it becomes a challenge to be back in form. For instance, you know driving but then you don’t drive for 10 years, it is very obvious that you will get apprehensive. This is something very natural.

How did the audience receive the play, especially the Tier-II cities?

The way people are responding is overwhelming and extremely fulfilling. It is received very perceptively. We find a pin-drop silence in those 90 minutes. There are cities where people appreciate the play with a standing ovation towards the end. And this makes me very happy.

I am also happy because I had earlier decided that I will only perform the play at 25 locations. We have already performed at more than a dozen now. But I also said that I don’t want to perform only in the metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. I wanted to perform beyond that and reach out to the audience with this very rich and different theatrical experience. I am glad that we have been able to do it. We have already performed in Guwahati, Bhubaneswar and Ahmedabad and we are set to perform in Chandigarh as well. The response in all these places has been humbling. It makes me feel that people love me so much even at this stage of life. They even said that the play has given them something to cherish for a long time. Isse jyada kya chahiye? (What more do you need?)

You have usually played realistic roles which are said to have epitomised the middle class. We are again seeing an upsurge of such films. What’s your take?

This is forming a full circle now. During my time, it was more about larger-than-life cinema. There were people like Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra and Jeetendra ruling the industry. But parallel to it, there was a cinema movement, which dealt with day-to-day issues of a common man. And now it is the same again. That’s how you can see it forming a circle. There are films where realism takes the upper hand, where the hero isn’t bashing 30 people and isn’t perfect or an epitome of goodness. But that is just a part of the mainstream cinema. The majority of it still strives on stories that don’t revolve around such issues. But I am glad that the aspect of realism is making a strong presence in filmmaking today.

Do you think the change has come about due to a change in actors’ professionalism and mindsets?

I feel that young actors are much more professional than us. During our time, a lot of wrong things were practised as a part of the star system. And yet glorified. An actor who usually arrived late on the sets was considered to be the biggest star. These were the wrong norms, which were completely unprofessional, yet were followed during that time. Today’s generation is doing a better job. They give their entire attention to one film at a time or whatever project they are doing and nail it.

Do you think the charm of theatre is still intact, especially at a time when they are owned by corporate houses?

The charm of theatre is intact and that is because more and more people prefer watching a live performance. The interaction between one human being with another is the crux and magic of theatre. This has remained the same over the years. Long time back, even before my coming into this field, many theatre companies collapsed with the advent of cinema. It was feared that theatre will be dead but it created its own space, identity and attention. Then when television came, once again it was said that theatre cannot survive because people do not like to watch cinema outside, they prefer watching it at home. Even cinema was threatened at that time but both the artforms survived.

The role of corporate houses in theatre is not a cause of worry because of the intrinsic strength and magic of theatre. It will always survive.

How has storytelling evolved overtime?

Everybody tries to tell a story in a way which is different and holds the audience attention for a long time. That’s the basic about storytelling. You may do it in a traditional, classical, folk or contemporary way, that is your choice, or there might be somebody who doesn’t want to tell a story yet finds a narrative which leaves one spellbound. And this has been going on and will go forever. That’s the beauty of it. It’s like our grandmother used to tell us stories. Now my wife or I will not be able to tell a story in that manner to our children. The stories which we tell them will be different and something which is related to our times and lives. So it will go on evolving and the more evolved it is, the more exciting it becomes.

What would you say about actors voicing their opinion strongly and Bollywood going political?

Of course, actors should voice their opinions. When other professions, for example, journalism has the right to put views out, why shouldn’t you give it to the actors? It is unfair to put a gun under them. At the same time, we can see many journalists meekly accepting whatever is being told. It’s the same scene in every field, even in Bollywood.

The reason politicians question the industry or performers is because actors have a tremendous following and their stance makes an impact. Same is the case with politicians, so they are scared of them. They try to brush aside their opinion and muzzle their voice. They tag actors with a certain political party. I want people to go beyond the party politics. Once you go beyond that as a conscious educated, thinking citizen, you will express your opinion. Everybody keeps voicing their opinion instantly on digital media. So, if all of us want to express our views why are you denying that right to the actors?

201,04-2-20,WWI a safe bet for BAFTA,"While World War I epic 1917 was named the best picture at the British Academy Film Awards, Joaquin Phoenix called out systemic racism in the industry

Gut-wrenching World War I epic 1917 was the big winner at the British Academy Film Awards, winning seven prizes including best picture and best director. Sam Mendes’ drama about one of the most devastating conflicts in British history bested hotly tipped American contenders including Joker, The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at a glitzy event that was overshadowed by criticism of the nominees’ lack of diversity — even from some of the nominees themselves.

Director Mendes based 1917 on his grandfather’s wartime experiences. Shot in sinuous long takes that immerse viewers in the action, it follows two British soldiers on a perilous mission across No Man’s Land to try to avert a suicidal offensive. The film was also named best British film and won the cinematography prize — Roger Deakins’ fifth win in that category. It also took trophies for production design, sound and visual effects.

Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor for superhero story Joker, which charts the origins of Batman’s ginning nemesis. Renee Zellweger won the best actress prize for the Judy Garland biopic Judy. Joker took three awards — best actor, casting and score — from 11 nominations. Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman had 10 nominations but went home empty-handed.

Victory at the British awards, known as BAFTAs, is often a good predictor of success at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, being held this year on February 9. Like the Oscars, the British awards have struggled to become less male and white. No women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. Phoenix slammed the lack of diversity in his acceptance speech, saying it sent “a very clear message to people of colour that ‘You’re not welcome here.’”

Awards organisers called it “disappointing” that there were no performers of colour among the acting nominees, who are chosen by 6,500 academy members who work in the UK and international film industry.

The rising star award — the one trophy decided by the public — went to Black British actor Micheal Ward. British star Cynthia Erivo, who is Oscar-nominated for her performance as abolitionist Harriet Tubman in Harriet but was snubbed by Britain’s Academy, declined an invitation to perform at the award ceremony in protest.

The British Academy has promised to review its voting procedures. BAFTA chairwoman Pippa Harris said the problem was “an industry-wide issue.” “It takes everyone to look at what they’re doing,” she said. “Awards are right at the end of a whole process and so we need to look at the types of films being made, the opportunities that people are getting, how the films are being promoted. All of these things play a part.”

Presenting the best-director award, Australian actress Rebel Wilson quipped that she could never achieve what the nominees did: “I just don’t have the balls.” Scarlett Johansson, a best-actress nominee for Marriage Story, said the lack of recognition for female directors was disappointing. “So many women made great films this year,” she said. “And I think it just goes to show you that there is a systemic problem that is very prevalent.”

Hours before the event and several miles away, three people were wounded and a knifeman shot dead by police in what police called a terrorism-related attack. The BBC canceled plans to broadcast interviews from the red carpet on its news channel as a result.

Brad Pitt was named best supporting actor for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino’s bloody fairy tale of 1960s Los Angeles. He didn’t attend but sent a jokey acceptance speech, read out by his co-star Margot Robbie. “Hey Britain, heard you just became single. Welcome to the club,” he said — one of several references during the ceremony to the UK’s exit from the European Union, which became official on Friday. Pitt also referenced recent tumult in Britain’s royal family, saying he was going to name the trophy Harry, “because he’s really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.”

Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a take-no-prisoners divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. She noted that her mother, Dianne Ladd, had won the exact same prize in 1975, when Dern was 6, for Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.

Bong Joon-ho’s Korean-language drama Parasite was named best foreign-language film and also took the prize for best original screenplay. Organisers set out to make the awards ceremony carbon neutral for the first time. The red carpet was made from recycled fibers. Instead of the goody bags of past years, guests will receive a “gifting wallet” made from recycled plastic and containing vouchers. The post-awards dinner featured sustainably sourced food, including a vegan option. Stars walking the red carpet were encouraged to make sustainable fashion choices by wearing an outfit they already owned or renting one for the occasion.

Prince William, the British Academy’s president and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, were the guests of honor at the ceremony. William presented a BAFTA Fellowship, the academy’s top honour, to Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy. The Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes star Andy Serkis — the maestro of motion-capture acting — was handed a prize for outstanding British contribution to cinema.

Falling two days after Britain left the European Union, the evening couldn’t avoid the subject of Brexit. “We know it’s been a hard week for you guys and it’s very nice to take a little bit of your gold, back home where it belongs,” joked New Zealand director Taika Waititi as he collected the best adapted screenplay prize for Jojo Rabbit.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wwi-a-safe-bet-for-bafta-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/wwi-a-safe-bet-for-bafta.html
202,04-2-20,What’s behind paint names?,"Calamine pink or Dead Salmon? Names can sway a person, say colour experts

Ever wonder how paint colours get their names? If you’re shopping for pink, say, you’ll find dozens of shades referencing roses, bubblegum and shells. There are some extra-evocative names like Calamine and Dead Salmon. And what about a pink called Harajuku Morning? Modern Love? Names can sway a person, says New York designer Daun Curry. “We once had a client choose one paint colour over another because the name was Peace and Happiness,” she says. More often, we pick a shade because we like it, says colour consultant Debra Kling of New York, and ‘the names’ associations serve to augment our feelings about the hues.’’ She warns clients that paints when applied can look very different from their names: Creams, especially, easily veer into yellow territory, even when there’s no hint of that hue in their name.

Natalie Ebel, co-founder of the direct-to-consumer paint company Backdrop — which is behind Harajuku Morning and Modern Love — says that choosing the right names for paint colours is essential. “We encourage customers to not just paint their walls but create their backdrop,’’ she says. “So each name was chosen to evoke an emotional connection; we were inspired by real people, places, things and moods.”

Farrow & Ball is known for creative naming; their latest Colour By Nature palette, made in collaboration with London’s Natural History Museum, was inspired by Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours, an 1814 guide that cross-references hues with markings and colorations found in nature. Scotch Blue, for example, suggests both the throat of a blue titmouse and copper ore.

Time and place also provide inspiration, says Farrow & Ball’s colour consultant Joa Studholme. “Occasionally, the paint name comes almost before the colour. Plummett was mixed after an afternoon spent fishing on the river, where the colour of the lead used to weight the fisherman’s line was a thing of such beauty that it just begged to be added to the Farrow & Ball palette,’’ she says.

Studholme shares the backstories on two Farrow & Ball pinks, Calamine and Dead Salmon: “For many people of a certain age, Calamine lotion was an intrinsic part of early life. Applied to treat scraped knees, stings and the general travails of a lively childhood, it was always of comfort. And what was more calming, the actual lotion or its extraordinary delicate colour? It certainly creates soothing rooms in the modern world,” she says.

As for the fishy one, the name was found on a decorator’s invoice dated 1805 for a library. “Salmon is the colour, and Dead actually refers to the matte paint finish,” Studholme says. Another rosy paint that Studholme thinks is well-named was inspired by the soft, feminine shade found in traditional ladies’ private quarters. But “Boudoir Pink’’ didn’t sit right, she says. “So, we spent time considering how the boudoir got its name, only to discover it comes from the French bouder, meaning ‘to sulk.’ Thus, Sulking Room Pink was born,” she says.

Pink has enjoyed a favoured position in the colour pantheon since at least 2014, when film director Wes Anderson clad his “Grand Budapest Hotel’’ in the hue. That was followed by rose gold fever. Colour company Pantone designated light pinks as signature colours in both 2016 and 2017.

Paint marketers generally like names that are aspirational, that stir the imagination. First Light is Benjamin Moore’s 2020 Colour of the Year, a dreamy, soft shade of pink. The company’s director of colour marketing and development, Andrea Magno, says that while the colour was already part of Benjamin Moore’s 3,500-hue library, “it’s always fortuitous when the trend concept and colour name complement one another. While descriptions like ‘light pink’ are quite straightforward, we also look for names that evoke positive associations and experiences.”

PPG Paint’s senior colour marketing manager, Dee Schlotter, says Linen Ruffle is the top pink requested on the company’s Paintzen platform. It’s a pale, taupe-tinged white with a pink undertone, named to evoke images of ruffly pillows and curtains.

And what about Kenny’s Kiss or Salsa Diane, two other pinks in the PPG collection? The former was named after an employee’s dog; the latter after a colour lab stylist’s beachy dress. HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams’ colour of the year is Romance, another gentle pink with a name that stirs feelings. Ebel, of Backdrop, says pinks have been the most fun to name.

“I wanted to keep the colours and names approachable for people like me — I wasn’t a huge pink person before Backdrop,’’ she says. “Harajuku Morning was inspired by a trip we took to Tokyo in 2016. The colour is bright, airy and fun, and reminded us of the playfulness of Takeshita Street, but in the morning before the crowds.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what---s-behind-paint-names--2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/what---s-behind-paint-names-.html
203,04-2-20,An odyssey of self-discovery,"Artist Gerard Garouste creates a medley between the metaphorical and the melancholic through his radical and revolutionary paintings, says Uma Nair

Take the transcription of truth, colour it with the fantasy of literature, brush it with the spirit of the Bible, weave in the miracles of a few saints and you get the surreal palette of Gerard Garouste, France’s favourite artist. Framed in the pinnacle of pain amid trials and conflicts, he showcases his select Retrospective of 60 paintings that mirror the beauty of creating something new for one’s own satiety.

Author and artist Garouste’s words form the ferment of fantasy and surrealism. He said, “If art is everywhere, it is nowhere. If I believe neither in progress in art nor in the diktat of the clean slate, I think on the other hand a painter must know his culture well to be able to forget it and to play it freely.”

Learning at the Louvre in isolation

Garouste learnt his profession as a painter during his initiation at the Louvre Museum in Paris. “For Garouste to stand alone in front of the works and study the history of art and techniques of painting was an odyssey of self-discovery,” says director-general, NGMA Adwaita Gadanayak. According to Garouste, learning a lot from the masters who preceded him made him aware of his heritage and he was indebted. But he is a rare example of a genius who has struggled between a hoary world of a bipolar disorder and the sanity of sitting in his studio and painting.

Garouste says that in every artist, two characters co-exist — the classic and the Indian. In his words to France’s legendary paper, Le Figaro, he said, “One never moves without the other just as intuition cannot do without reason. They are inseparable. I have one foot in a classic technique, which involves roughing, glazing and impasto, and the other in a surreal and expressionist way of treating my subjects.”

Influence of Christianity

Garouste has long been fascinated with the influence of Christianity on French culture and his most famous work explores the myth of Faust as presented by Goethe in 1808 — a man arguing with God and the Devil about his fate. Using oil on canvas and gouache, he examines the main themes of Goethe’s tragedy, and the quest for knowledge, desire for pleasure, nature of evil, the idea of wagers, pacts with the malevolent forces and the alchemy of life.

Literature and the art of questioning

He uses the powerful imagery stemming from literature and the essential art of questioning to create his enchanting canvasses. His fantastical paintings combine restlessness and joy of their various protagonists. There are creatures like apes, scapegoats and geese, which keep us agog.

His sensibility is born of self-learning. His interest in the texts of Western culture began in the 1980s. Dante’s Divine Comedy, Cervantes’ Don Quixote and Rabelais’ Gargantua, followed by examining sacred texts of the Bible, Judaisim and the Talmud for a decade.

His satirical stances are full of stories and Warsaw Bridge and Donkeys is an emblematic image that adds to the richness of repertoire, full of metaphors and meandering conversations within and without.

Faces of friends and family

The faces in these canvasses are full of intensity. He uses the faces of his friends and family to illustrate the various characters. They are swamped with references and allusions. Some are softer but they are all living within the intensity of dreams. His human figures leap out of the canvas. He transforms possibilities of representation by co-opting classic models of antiquity and recreating them with a new, expressive and imaginative power. In his own self portrait, we see a portrait of Renaissance blended into the promise of the Baroque, oscillating between Classicism and Christianity.

Riot of spectrum

Colours for Garouste are a riot of spectrum — ranging from elegant greys to puissant purples, gay greens and velvet blacks. His characters do not have predictable forms but they are theatrical sometimes and have archaic outlines that emerge as in his earliest work, The Boat and the Fisherman.

Each face on his canvas is a character to be studied. He is constantly metamorphosing between characters from literature and history. The Boat and the Fisherman and Three Masters and Fatted Geese are examples of brilliance in conception and composition. His mastery of the rules of classical painting is counterbalanced by his total pictorial freedom, intuition and rambling wildness in his composition of human hybrids.

Timeless figurative

His pliant brush celebrates human figures. He extols a timeless, figurative painting style, which was a daring choice at a time when France was in the grip of avant grade expression. His works have a lyrical moodiness to them and you, at once, know that music is a part of his everyday sensibility. His words in an interview hold true, “The more I apply myself to a simple, basic shape, like someone practising a violin, the more I am able to start inventing my own music.” It is in this spirit that Garouste approaches the old masters and ancient texts. Oscillation of the past and the present like a pendulum that keeps time — you get drawn into the maw of his characters.

The scenes depicted in these paintings are particularly radical, revolutionary and resonating with rhythms full of human emotions.

At the NGMA, around 60 oil paintings draw on satire, sadness and humour to produce a fusion of a whole range of symbols. Between bridges and rivers, animated and morphed characters, we see fat and plucked geese, herds of cute donkeys, and familiar and unfamiliar figures like Pinocchio, Kafka and Borges. In a free association of images and ideas, Garouste delights us with overthrowing prevailing interpretations and creating a medley between the metaphorical and the melancholic.

204,04-2-20,Awards seem fair when you win: Vidya,"Actor Vidya Balan, who has won many accolades in her successful film career, contradicts the popular notion that award ceremonies in India are rigged. At an event to promote the 2020 edition of a popular Bollywood awards function, she said that everything seems fair when an artiste wins an award.

“People often say many things about award ceremonies but I feel when you get that (award) in your hand then everything is fair,” said Vidya, at an event for the forthcoming 65th edition of Amazon Filmfare Awards 2020. She further said, “It’s a special feeling (to be an award-winner). First, the statue of Filmfare Award in itself is so beautiful. It is a symbol of love and appreciation from the audience and the industry, so it is very special for me.”

“I feel it’s every Indian actor or actress’ dream to win a Filmfare Award. It was my dream as well but I never prepared my acceptance speech, because the more you want to win an award, the more you feel anxious after winning it. It actually happened with me four years in a row. I won Best Actor (Female) award for three year and one year in between I won the Best Actor (Female) Critics’ award,” she added.

“For four consecutive years, I went on stage to receive an award and I asked myself, ‘how can this get any better’. When I got Best Actress for the first time, I thought that I would become mad but when I went on to win it for four consecutive years, I didn’t believe it,” the actress said.

Vidya Balan has won Filmfare Awards for her performance in Paa (2010), Ishqiya (2011), The Dirty Picture (2012) and Kahaani (2013).

“I also feel happy when I am nominated for a Filmfare Award because they honour the best of the year, so just to be there is a good feeling. If you win, then it’s icing on the cake but if you don’t win, and if you are at least nominated, then you feel good about it by thinking that at least you are among the best in that particular year,” she said.

In 2012, when Vidya won for Kahaani, Priyanka Chopra was reportedly miffed for losing out for her performance in Barfi. Asked for her reaction on that controversy, Vidya said, “I was glad I won it that year,” she laughed, and asserted: “I am not that kind to think that she (Priyanka) should have got the award. I got it and I felt really good about it. As long as enough people felt that my work was worthy a Filmfare Award that year, I am happy. I think this has happened many times in the history of awards where two performances run neck-and-neck and then one person gets it.”

In 2019, Vidya garnered praise for her performance in Mission Mangal. Asked which actresses’ performances she liked the most in the year gone by, Vidya said, “Unfortunately, I have seen very few performances, but I think Alia (Bhatt) was lovely in Gully Boy. I believe Taapsee (Pannu) and Bhumi (Pednekar) are lovely in Saand Ki Aankh and that’s something I want to watch. Again, I believe Yami (Gautam) was lovely in Bala.

Also present was Maya Krishna Rao, Special Curator, from the 2018 edition of the festival, who performed a reprised iteration of ‘Loose Woman’, first commissioned for the SAF- 2018.

Speaking about the plans ahead in 2020, Rajgarhia said, “We have received an excellent response from the people in Delhi, our patrons, partners, visitors and the friends of the festival. We are happy to have shared excerpts of the festival at the India Art Fair, where we also released our festival film and new catalogue for 2019-20. As an institutional partner, we are thankful to the fair committee for hosting us.”

The artworks showcased at the fair prominently features emerging artists from the region like Farah Viraf Mulla, who participated in Dharti Arts Residency Programme 2019, the Foundation’s flagship artist residency programme.

207,04-2-20,Lukaku gives Inter 3 points,"Inter returned to winning ways in Serie A as Romelu Lukaku scored twice in the second half to secure a 2-0 triumph away at lowly Udinese.

Antonio Conte’s side had drawn their three previous league outings and, with leaders Juventus defeating Fiorentina 3-0 earlier on Sunday, appeared in danger of losing further ground in the title race.

However, after a scoreless first half, Lukaku’s brace moved Inter back above Lazio and into second place, three points behind the reigning champions.

January additions Christian Eriksen and Victor Moses were handed their full debuts by Conte while teenager Sebastiano Esposito filled in up front for the suspended Lautaro Martinez.

Yet the fresh faces failed to inspire, and it was Udinese who were the more threatening side in the first half. Seko Fofana fired into the side netting and Jens Stryger Larsen saw an on-target strike blocked by Ashley Young.

Lukaku had been on the periphery of proceedings before converting his first attempt of the game, his low, left-footed effort in the 64th minute going through the legs of Bram Nuytinck to beat Juan Musso.

The Belgian’s second arrived from the penalty spot seven minutes later, Musso having been spectacularly up-ending Alexis Sanchez as the substitute attempted to skip beyond the advancing goalkeeper.

Kevin Lasagna twice dragged efforts wide in the closing stages as Udinese drew a blank, the hosts managing just one shot on target as they allowed Inter goalkeeper Daniele Padelli a comfortable outing while standing in for the injured Samir Handanovic.

CONTE SATISFIED

However coach Antonio Conte insisted he was pleased with Christian Eriksen’s performance despite substituting the midfielder early in the second half.

Following his arrival from Tottenham, Eriksen came off the bench in the midweek Coppa Italia tie against Fiorentina, replacing Alexis Sanchez.

The Denmark international was handed the chance to start for the first time in Serie A on Sunday, recording 51 touches and completing 78 per cent of his attempted passes before he was replaced in the 58th minute.

Conte — who saw his team end a run of three successive league draws — called for patience with Eriksen, despite expressing his satisfaction with the 27-year-old’s efforts during his time on the pitch.

“I think that for someone who arrived five days ago, and we should not forget we had to rush him in because we were missing several midfielders, Eriksen still made a positive impact,” Conte told Sky Sport Italia.

“Obviously, he needs to get settled into our style of football and also find the right fitness levels for Serie A, but I am very pleased with his full debut.

“He will get to learn the positioning we ask of our midfielders, but these are early days and I am satisfied.”

The result sees Inter move above Lazio into second place in the table, three points behind leaders Juventus, ahead of next weekend’s Milan derby at San Siro.

“The match against Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia gave us a boost,” Lukaku told Sky Sport Italia. “We knew that it wouldn’t be easy here in Udinese, but in the second half we did well.

“We managed to score two goals and get all three points. It’s an important victory on our journey. We must now keep this up and turn our attention immediately to the derby against Milan.”

HANDANOVIC A DOUBT

Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic is set to miss the Milan derby this weekend after fracturing a finger.

While no time frame was provided for the Slovenia international’s return to action, he seems unlikely to recover in time to face Milan.

“Samir Handanovic has undergone an X-ray examination following an injury to his left hand suffered in training,” a statement published by Inter on Monday read.

Ansu Fati became the youngest player ever to score a brace in La Liga on Sunday by capitalising on two brilliant Lionel Messi assists to give Barcelona a 2-1 victory over Levante.

Fati, at 17 years and 94 days old, broke the previous record held by Juanmi Jimenez, who scored twice for Malaga against Real Zaragoza at 17 years and 115 days old in 2010.

Messi teed up Fati’s quick-fire double with a defence-splitting pass and then a trademark weaving run before Ruben Rochina scored Levante’s goal in the 92nd minute, which really should have come sooner.

Barca reduce the gap at the top to three points behind Real Madrid and begin to regain some rhythm under new coach Quique Setien after Thursday’s 5-0 thumping of Leganes in the Copa del Rey.

“We could have won 8-2 or 8-3,” said Setien. “We lost a little control in the second half and conceded too much but it was a good job from the team.”

Yet Levante should have converted more of a handful of excellent chances in the second half, that suggested Barcelona’s defensive problems and fragility when in the lead are far from solved.

Leganes and Levante, who sit 18th and 13th respectively, offered a relatively straight-forward route back to winning ways too for Barcelona, who were wobbling last weekend when they followed a last-gasp win over Segunda side Ibiza with a convincing defeat by Valencia.

Setien, who replaced Ernesto Valverde as coach last month, found his methods questioned and there was evidence against Levante to suggest he may have decided to introduce his style of play more gradually.

Barca played with more urgency and ambition, their dominance of possession sacrificed occasionally for riskier passes forward.

Yet Levante also pressed high and left gaps to be exploited, despite the likes of Valencia and Granada enjoying more success against Setien’s team by sitting deep and bursting out on the break.

Fati has been one of the main beneficiaries of Setien’s arrival.

He exploded onto the scene at the start of the season but was used increasingly rarely by Valverde, who may have been wary of burdening the teenager with too much too soon.

Instead, Setien has started Fati in all five of his games in charge so far and this was the first time his faith has really been rewarded.

“He is a boy who is emerging and has great potential,” Setien said. “Today he had a historic day for his goals and for helping the team.”

Messi’s own excellent form also continues. He now has nine goals and four assists in his last 10 league games.

His first set-up for Fati came from the centre circle where he played a reverse pass through three Levante players that sent clear his teammate, who cut inside Jorge Miramon and finished.

Less than two minutes later, Fati was in again. Levante lost the ball upfield and Gerard Pique fired straight into Messi inside the right flank, midway inside the opposition’s half.

He drove into the penalty area and when he finally stopped by a cluster of Levante chasers, he slid left to Fati, who fired through the legs of Aitor Fernandez for a second.

Nelson Semedo crashed a shot against the crossbar and then hopped over Tono only for Antoine Griezmann to tap wide at the front post.

But Levante were more dangerous in the second half and could have taken a draw if they had been more clinical with a handful of opportunities.

The best of them fell to Gonzalo Melero, who blazed over, and by the time Rochina’s shot flew through one pair of legs and in off the hands of Marc-Andre ter Stegen, there were only two minutes remaining.

There was time for one Levante attack and Sergio Busquets’ weak header gave Rochina another chance but he could not keep his shot down.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/teenage-prodigy-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/teenage-prodigy.html
209,04-2-20,Kobe Bryant's death put life in perspective for me: Virat Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday said the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash has impacted his outlook towards life, which he feels, is sometimes taken for granted in pursuit of control over the future.

Bryant, a two-time Olympic gold-medallist and one of the most decorated basketball players of all time, died in a helicopter crash last month along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who was also a budding hoopster.

""Firstly, it was a shock to everyone. I grew up watching those NBA games in the morning and watching what he did on court. But when someone that you have looked up to in some ways, passes away like that, it does put things in perspective,"" Kohli said on the eve of the first ODI against New Zealand here.

""...At the end of the day, life can be so fickle. It's so unpredictable. I think a lot of the times we get too caught up in the pressures of what we have to do tomorrow...We really forget living life and enjoying life and just appreciating and being grateful for the life we have,"" he added.

Kohli said a tragedy like this makes one realise that nothing can be more important than enjoying every moment of existence.

""...It did put things in perspective for me massively. It just makes you feel like not wanting to have control of things in front of you all the time, and just embracing life and appreciating it.

""You start looking at things from a different point of view suddenly and you want to enjoy every moment you're going through. You realise that what you're doing at the end of the day is not the most important thing.

210,04-2-20,India dismiss Pakistan for 172 in U-19 World Cup semifinal,"Indian bowlers produced a brilliant performance under pressure to dismiss Pakistan for 172 in the first U-19 World Cup semifinal here on Tuesday.

Pacer Kartik Tyagi (2/32 in 8 overs) bowled yorkers at will while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (2/46 in 10 overs) was a difficult proposition to read for the Pakistani batsmen.

Pakistan skipper Rohail Nazir (62 off 102 balls) and opener Haider Ali (56 off 77 balls) were the only ones to make a significant contribution as the innings lasted 43.1 overs.

While Tyagi's scorching pace and Bishnoi's googlies were eye-catching, left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar (1/29 in 7 overs), left-arm seamer Sushant Mishra (3/28 in 8.1 overs) and part-time leg-spinner Yashasvi Jaiswal (1/11 in 3 overs) also kept the rival batsmen under check.

Tyagi, probably one of the fastest bowlers in India in his age category, bowled an inswinging yorker wide off crease to uproot Irfan Khan's off-stump and then got his second wicket with an intimidating bouncer that removed tail-ender Tahir Hussain.

In between, Bishnoi bowled his fast googlies to get rid of Fahad Munir (0) and Abbas Afridi (2).

The only time Pakistan looked to be gaining some foothold was during the 62-run stand between Haider and Rohail before Yashasvi's part-time leg-breaks saw the end of opener's effort that had nine fours.

Skipper Rohail did scratch around and got a fifty but never for once did he look in any sort of control and was holed out at square leg.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-dismiss-pakistan-for-172-in-u-19-world-cup-semifinal-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-dismiss-pakistan-for-172-in-u-19-world-cup-semifinal.html
211,04-2-20,India enter final after thrashing Pakistan by 10 wickets in U-19 World Cup,"Defending Champions India stormed into their second successive finals of the Under-19 World Cup after thrashing Pakistan by 10 wickets in the first semifinals here on Tuesday.

Four-time champions India produced a superlative allround display as they first dismissed Pakistan for 172 in 43.1 overs and then returned to overhaul the target with consummate ease, scoring 170 for no loss in 35.1 overs.

Chasing the target, openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (99) and Divyaansh Saxena (59) displayed great maturity as the duo mixed caution with aggression and didn't allow their rivals any chance to make a comeback in the match.

Jaiswal, who currently tops the run-getter list with 306 runs in the tournament, smashed eight fours and three sixes in his 112-ball innings, while Saxena had six boundaries to his name.

Earlier, Sushant Mishra (3/28), Kartik Tyagi (2/32) and Ravi Bishnoi (2/46) shared seven wickets among them, while Atharva Ankolekar (1/29) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (1/11) scalped one each to restrict Pakistan to a low score.

For Pakistan, skipper Rohail Nazir (62) and opener Haider Ali (56) cracked half-centuries but rest of the batsmen found the going tough.

Ali's 77-ball 56 contained nine hits to the fence, while Nazir smashed six boundaries in his 102 ball 62.

India will either face Bangladesh or New Zealand in the final.

Brief Score:

Pakistan: 172 allout in 43.1 overs (Haider Ali 56, Rohail Nazir 62; SS Mishra 3/28, Ravi Bishnoi 2/46).

He said that in the Delhi elections, the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) was contesting which ran its government on the basis of ""lies"" and on the other hand there was the BJP that followed the path of truth.

""On the one hand is the BJP whose government at the Centre ensured hanging of rapists in five days, and on the other hand is a government (AAP) that saved the 'tukde tukde gang',"" Tiwari claimed.

She also claimed that the BJP indulged in communal politics, as and when elections were around.

""How can he (the CM of UP) say 'Boli se nahi manega toh goli chala do'? I have never heard such remarks before. A Union minister (Anurag Thakur) has also said something similar. They are just indulging in hatred politics.

214,04-2-20,Calm demeanour helped Dhoni become India's best captain,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s calm demeanour under pressure has helped him emerge as India’s most successful captain and a role model for youngsters, feels Rohit Sharma.

Rohit, who made his debut under Dhoni during the T20WC in South Africa, was effusive in his praise for his former captain.

“Whole India knows MS Dhoni is the one who has been like that. It has helped him to make such good decisions on the field and now you see he is the most successful Indian captain, having all three ICC Trophies with him and many IPL titles as well,” Rohit said in a chat show Curly Tales.

“He is the best captain India has seen and there is a reason behind it and that reason is him being calm and composed under pressure situation.”

Rohit said during his captaincy days Dhoni used to put the young and inexperienced bowlers at ease, getting the best out of them.

“I have seen him handle a lot of younger bowlers when they get under pressure, he goes around and puts his arm around their neck and talks to them what he needs to do and what not,” Rohit said.

“You know when a younger player is being treated like that by the senior member of a team, you obviously feel confident and want to deliver for the team.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/calm-demeanour-helped-dhoni-become-india-s-best-captain.html
215,04-2-20,Rohit out of NZ tour,"In a blow to India, limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma was on Monday ruled out of the upcoming ODI and Test series against New Zealand after sustaining a calf injury during the fifth T20I.

Rohit retired hurt after scoring 60 off 41 balls after he pulled his calf muscle while going for a quick single during the match that India won on Sunday.

“He is out of the tour. Right now, it’s not looking good. The physio is assessing him. We will get to know how bad it is but he is not taking any further part in the series,” a top BCCI source said.

It has been learnt that Mayank Agarwal will be replacing Rohit as the third opener in the ODI set-up along with KL Rahul and Prithvi Shaw.

Agarwal was the logical choice in the white-ball format since he was the reserve opener in the side during the home ODI series against the West Indies when Shikhar Dhawan was absent due to knee injury.

In the Test squad, Shubman Gill will join KL Rahul and Prithvi Shaw as the third opener in the absence of Rohit.

During India’s last two Test series at home (vs South Africa and Bangladesh), Gill was the back-up opener to Rohit and Agarwal. His place was sealed in the squad after scores of 83 and 204 not out in a drawn first A Test against New Zealand in Christchurch.

The Test squad is yet to be officially announced but it is learnt that it has already been selected and only the official announcement is due.

The old selection committee under MSK Prasad picked the replacements but it might take some time for the official announcement as convenor of the selection committee, secretary Jay Shah, is on his way to New Zealand along with treasurer Arun Dhumal.

“Once the secretary’s approval comes, the replacements will be officially announced. But the selectors have already sent the names,” the source added.

It has still not been ascertained whether Rohit has endured a calf muscle tear but he looked in severe pain even after physio Nitin Patel attended to him.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rohit-out-of-nz-tour.html
216,04-2-20,‘All-weather bowling attack makes India formidable’,"An all-weather bowling attack and batsmen’s improved ability against pacers in overseas conditions have made India a formidable unit across formats, feels former New Zealand head coach Mike Hesson.

Hesson, who will take charge of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2020 IPL season, also said the 5-0 rout of New Zealand in the T20 series shows the current lot of Indian players is exceptionally talented.

“India are far better side now at present and they are improving all the time. Their bowling attack now suits all conditions around the world because their bowlers, pacers and spinners, are so good. That’s something they haven’t always had,” Hesson said.

“And their batsmen’s ability to play pace bowling has also got better the more they have toured. So this group of players is exceptionally talented group. This series’ win will help them (for the World Cup in Australia later this year).”

Up next is a three-match ODI series, and India-New Zealand will play the first match in Hamilton tomorrow. Hesson said New Zealand’s new-look pace attack will have its task cut out.

However, he feels the subsequent two-Test series will be a different proposition despite New Zealand’s recent 0-3 loss in Australia.

“New Zealand had a poor tour of Australia and they would be hurt with that. But up to that point, their Test cricket was exceptional in the last 2-3 seasons, probably even longer.

“New Zealand know these conditions well. From a Test bowling point of view, if there is something in the surface, likes of Tim Southee will exploit it and Trent Boult should be back as well. Neil Wagner asks different questions too, so I am really looking forward to it.

“India will have an expectation of winning this Test series. But New Zealand is a very tough place to come and win Test matches. You cannot take anything for granted and I am sure India won’t,” said Hesson.

Hesson also blamed New Zealand for making some questionable decisions during the T20 series in which they lost back-to-back games in a Super Over.

“Losing in such a manner can become a bit of habit. Once New Zealand lost a couple (Super Overs), they almost started dreading the Super Over. And once you do that, you are not in the right frame of mind.

“Once again, even in both those Super Overs, New Zealand were in situations in this series where they could have won it. They will look back in hindsight and wonder if they used the right bowling option (Tim Southee) at that time.

“Changes of pace can be useful in a Super Over rather than necessarily trying to bowl yorkers,” reckoned Hesson.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---all-weather-bowling-attack-makes-india-formidable---.html

Harmanpreet Singh will do duty as the vice captain in the matches taking place on February 8 and 9 at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.

218,04-2-20,Djoker takes aim at Federer’s record,"Novak Djokovic put Roger Federer on notice as he won his 17th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and warned he was going all-out for the Swiss’s record of 20 — and his mark for weeks as world number one.

Djokovic, who came through a mid-match slump to win his eighth title in Melbourne, is relentlessly totting up the victories that could soon end the debate over who’s the greatest in history.

The five-set victory over Dominic Thiem was his eighth in eight finals in Melbourne, putting him alongside Federer and Nadal as the only men to win the same Slam eight times.

It makes Djokovic, 32, the first man in the Open era, and only the second in history, to win Grand Slam titles in three different decades — and as a not-insignificant bonus, returns him to world number one.

In an ominous sign for his rivals, the Serb has started the year unbeaten with Wimbledon, the French Open, the Tokyo Olympics and the US Open all lying in front of him as tantalising opportunities.

He is clear-sighted about his goals: overtaking Nadal’s 19 Major titles and Federer’s 20 to become the all-time Grand Slam king, and outdoing the Swiss master’s record 310 weeks in the top ranking.

Djokovic has so far clocked up 276 weeks as number one and could pass second-placed Pete Sampras’s 286 in April, and Federer’s 310 on October 5.

“Obviously at this stage of my career, Grand Slams are the ones I value the most. They are the ones I prioritise,” said Djokovic, adding “there’s a lot of history on the line”.

“Grand Slams are one of the main reasons why I am still competing and still playing full season, trying to obviously get the historic number one (record). That’s the other big goal,” he said.

‘Huge win’

With five Major titles in just over two years, and unbeaten by Nadal and Federer at the Grand Slams since 2014, there’s no question who’s now the leading member of the Big Three.

The latest rankings tell the story at the top of men’s tennis: Djokovic is number one, Nadal, one year older at 33, is second and 38-year-old Federer is a relatively distant third.

Seven-time Major winner Mats Wilander said Djokovic’s win in Melbourne sets a marker for a year in which he could sweep all before him.

“At the end of the year, we could have two players on 20 or two on 19 or even more because Novak can win all four,” he said.

“This is a huge win for him going forwards. A loss here would have been very difficult to get confidence and come back.

“But the door is open for him to start climbing through it and talk about being the greatest ever.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/djoker-takes-aim-at-federer---s-record.html

Sprinter Dutee Chand and para-badminton player Manasi Joshi are the other nominees for the award, the winner of which will be announced on March 8.

The winner will be decided on the basis of public voting, which will be open till February 18 on six BBC vernacular websites.

Vinesh had won a Bronze at the 2019 World Championship in Nur Sultan to secure a quota for the Tokyo Olympics while Sindhu became the first Indian shuttler to become world champion last year.

Manasi became a world champion after winning gold at the para world championship while Mary Kom is the only Indian boxer to win eight world medals, including six Gold.

Dutee had won a 100m Silver at the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games.

Rupa Jha, the Head of BBC Indian languages, informed that the nominees were picked up by a panel of 40 eminent sports journalists.

“We had asked our panel members to pick their candidates. The five athletes who got the maximum number of votes, were eventually selected as the final nominees,” Rupa said while addressing a press conference.

“We will cover their journeys, the societal attitude towards them and their lives beyond sport. A research is being conducted on this, simultaneously,” she added.

Rupa said that in sports women’s journey is comparatively tougher than their male counterparts, so they thought of honouring their achievements.

“We feel that though, of late, the media has started taking interest in women athletes, still they are not promoted as male athletes. Since 2000, of the 13 Olympic medals, 5 are won by women but we feel the recognition they should have got, is not there. That was the thought behind starting this award,” she said.

When a journalist asked why Manasi was among able-bodied athletes, Rupa said “they have kept in mind only the spirit of the sport while deciding and no discrimination was made”.

“I am very pleased to know that I am nominated not in para-athlete category but in the able bodied, normal category of sportswomen,” Manasi was quoted as saying in a release.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/vinesh--sindhu--mary-in-race-for-bbc-sportswoman-award.html

After successfully hosting the Khelo India Youth Games, the Indian government has decided to conduct the Khelo India University Games in Bhubaneshwar from 22 February to 1 March, 2020 to unearth more talent for the Olympics.

“I went to the United States of America for training last year. The college-level tournaments are very popular there and the level of competition is very high. The competition level is high in European university tournaments as well. Some of the university-level athletes go on to represent their country as well. So it’ll be good if the university-level athletes receive support in India,” said the 28-year-old.

Johnson said that the athletes will get better with more tournaments being hosted in India, but they will need financial assistance as well.

“Athletes need good support to perform well in world events. The Sports Authority of India is trying to garner sponsorships for athletes. The sportspersons at the university level are not working, so they need the funds to pursue sports. All equipment for any sport is expensive. So more competitions are good for athletes, but they need to be financially supported as well,” said the runner.

Johnson, who missed the Tokyo Olympics qualification mark by 24 milliseconds at the ISTAF Berlin event last year, is currently looking to book a berth at the quadrennial event.

“I am currently looking to book my place at the Olympics. The qualification mark is 3:35 minutes for the 1500m event and I recorded a timing of 3:35:24 last year, so I missed the qualification mark by 24 milliseconds. The competition level in athletics is very high. More than 200 countries participate in athletics events. I have seen a rise in sportspersons taking up athletics in the last few years. Many national records have been broken in the last few years. Neeraj Chopra (javelin thrower) has come up really well.

Sawant said this reflected the real gratitude of people of Goa towards the ""historic decision"" taken by the BJP-led central government.

The state Assembly on Monday passed the motion congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for enacting CAA, amid a walkout by members of the opposition Congress and Goa Forward Party.

""I am delighted that Goa Assembly has had the privilege of being the first to pass a congratulatory motion in support of #CAA2019. This is the real sentiment of gratitude and support from the people of Goa towards the historic decision by PM @narendramodi ji and HM @AmitShah ji,"" Sawant said in a tweet late Monday evening.

In the 40-member House, the ruling BJP has 27 MLAs including the speaker, who all were present during the passage of congratulatory motion, besides two Independent legislators who support the saffron party-led government.

NCP MLA Churchill Alemao, who also supports the state government, was absent.

Majority of Catholic MLAs of the BJP supported the motion, which was moved by Atanasio Monserratte and Clafacio Dias on the first day of the Assembly's budget session.

The opposition MLAs in the House include five members of the Congress, three of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), one of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and an Independent.

Members of the Congress and GFP, led by Leader of the Opposition Digambar Kamat, on Monday created ruckus and rushed to the Well of the House demanding that Speaker Rajesh Patnekar disallow the motion.

They later staged a walkout saying they had submitted a notice seeking a discussion on the new citizenship law and the proposed country-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Addressing the House, Sawant said ""few leaders were misguiding people on the CAA"".

""Opposition members are not ignorant about the Act. They are well aware about it, but are purposefully trying to misguide people,"" he said.

Training his guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), he said both had an aim to spread hatred in the society, something the Congress could never do.

Addressing his first rally in the run-up to the February 8 Delhi Assembly polls, the former Congress chief hit out at the BJP for not addressing the economic slowdown and the issue of unemployment, but instead, encouraging violence.

""They (BJP) talk about the Hindu dharm, they talk about Islam, they talk of Sikhism. They have no knowledge of religions. In Hiduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism-- where is it written that attack other people, suppress them?,"" he asked the crowd.

What kind of ""Hindu dharm"" is this of Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as Hinduism talked about taking everyone along, Gandhi said at the rally organised in favour of the Congress candidate from Jangpura, Tarwinder Singh Marwah.

225,04-2-20,Delhi needs govt that will not resort to appeasement but supports CAA: PM,"Attacking the ruling Aam Aadmi Party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said Delhi needs a government that will not resort to appeasement but supports the CAA, abolition of Article 370 and issues of national security.

Addressing an election rally in Dwarka three days before the February 8 assembly elections, the prime minister said the national capital also needs a government that will give direction and not resort to blame games.

The prime minister accused the AAP dispensation of not implementing the Ayushman Bharat scheme in the national capital and asked if the AAP government's 'mohalla clinics' will work if Delhiites fall sick outside the city.

Modi, who addressed a rally in east Delhi's Karkardooma locality on Monday, said the people of Delhi have seen how the AAP government practises the politics of hate.

The people of Delhi say the country has changed, and now is the time for Delhi's transformation, the prime minister told the gathering.

""Delhi does not need a government which gives opportunity to enemies to attack us,"" he said.

The Centre, he added, opened more bank accounts for the poor than the population of US, and built more houses than the population of Sri Lanka.

Modi said opposition parties are spreading lies and rumours about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but people of Delhi understand this.

Slamming the AAP and Congress, he said both parties cry for Batla House terrorists, put security forces in dock and instigate people but can't develop the national capital.

Appealing to people to vote for the BJP, he asked them to punish those who insult armed forces.

The national capital goes to the polls on February 8 and the results will be declared on February 11.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-needs-govt-that-will-not-resort-to-appeasement-but-supports-caa--pm-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-needs-govt-that-will-not-resort-to-appeasement-but-supports-caa--pm.html

227,04-2-20,Shaheen stir conspiracy to destroy India: PM,"AAP, Cong fuelling anti-CAA protests for vote bank politics, says Modi

Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused them of fuelling the anti-CAA stir in Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia Islamia and Seelampur for vote bank politics.

He said the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Shaheen Bagh — the epicentre of the stir in Delhi and other areas — are not a coincidence but an “experiment” and a political conspiracy to destroy the country’s harmony.

Addressing his first rally here ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls scheduled for February 8, at Karkardooma, the PM said Delhi’s ruling AAP and the Congress are provoking people and spreading canards and asked voters to back the BJP because Delhi could not be left to anarchists.

They were keeping the Constitution and tricolour in the forefront, but the aim is to “divert attention from the real conspiracy”, Modi said.

“As long as it (AAP) stays in power, it will continue to create roadblocks to development. You have seen a lot. Now you are left with only one option. That’s why the BJP needs to come to power in Delhi,” said the PM.

Referring to the protest in Shaheen Bagh, he said people commuting to and from Noida are facing a lot of problems. The people of Delhi are quiet and they are angry watching this vote bank politics, he said. “If the strength of those plotting a conspiracy increases, then another road or lane will be blocked. We can’t leave Delhi to such anarchy. Only people of Delhi can stop this. Every vote given to the BJP can do this,” Modi said in his nearly one-hour-long speech in Karkardooma in East Delhi.

“In the India of 21st century, politics of hate will not work. Only politics of development will,” he added.

Modi said the Supreme Court and the High Court have expressed their dissatisfaction over the violence during protests and the destruction of property.

“But these people don’t care about courts. They don’t accept what the court says but talk about the Constitution,” he said. In December, several parts of the national Capital witnessed widespread protests against the CAA.

Modi also took a swipe at the Congress, saying those who questioned the Batla House encounter in the capital are now saving those who raised “tukde tukde” slogans.

Blaming the AAP for blocking the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) in Delhi, Modi said it would continue to block all positive moves.

Modi also slammed the AAP leader and Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, and said he questioned the Army on surgical strikes in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (POK) in 2016.

Modi listed out a series of measures taken by his Government to address the issues of the national Capital, touching on national issues like the revocation of special provisions of Article 370, construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya and bringing in the CAA for persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, saying these were unaddressed issues for decades as the previous Governments did not work on the same.

“Our Opposition says, Modi ji, why are you working so fast, why are you taking such big decisions. But, the problems of many decades need to be solved for the country to move faster. This is what people of the country want and this is the mandate which we are following,” he stated.

Referring to the Lok Sabha elections, Modi said, “BJP was strengthened by the people of Delhi, who gave all seven Lok Sabha seats to BJP. Their vote helped in changing the fortunes of this country.”

Modi said, “This time, your vote will change the fortunes of Delhi, and make the city clean, safe and modern.”

Modi recalled glorious history and struggle of people who settled in Delhi after partition.

“Delhi has earned a name in the world because of hardwork of its people, “But for the last two decades, the city is being run by people who never let the wave of 21st century touch the city,” said PM?Modi, also targeting Congress.

Modi also mentioned about various aspects of the Union Budget favouring youth, businessmen and traders inDelhi.

“In this Budget, it has also been taken care that middle-class taxpayers have more money to save.” “The Government has now given the option of a new slab of tax. This slab is also simple and there is no pressure to invest in certain schemes only to save tax.” “There was a complaint from traders of the country, including Delhi, that they face pressure from tax authorities. So we started an Indirect Tax Settlement Scheme last year. After this, there was a demand that such a scheme be started for Direct Taxes. In this budget, we fulfilled this.”

While BJP has concluded its mass campaigning with more than 4000 small meeting to reach out every corner of the city, Modi’s back to back rallies are master stroke when polling date is just few days away in Delhi.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-stir-conspiracy-to-destroy-india--pm-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-stir-conspiracy-to-destroy-india--pm.html

231,04-2-20,"Seattle City Council passes resolution against CAA, NRC","The Seattle City Council, one of the most powerful city councils in the US, on Monday unanimously passed a resolution condemning India's recently-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The new citizenship law passed by Parliament in December 2019 offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Reaffirming Seattle as a welcoming city and expressing solidarity with the city's South Asian community regardless of religion and caste, the resolution ""resolves that the Seattle City Council opposes the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act in India, and finds these policies to be discriminatory to Muslims, oppressed castes, women, indigenous, and LGBT people"".

The Indian government has maintained that the CAA, which was passed by the Indian Parliament last month, is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries.

The NRC exercise was conducted in Assam on the directions of the Supreme Court.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said his government has never discussed the NRC since coming to power for the first time in 2014 and it was done only in Assam.

Introduced by Indian American City Council member Kshama Sawant, the resolution urges the Parliament of India to uphold the Indian Constitution by repealing the CAA, and to stop the National Register of Citizens, and take steps towards helping refugees by ratifying various UN treaties on refugees.

""Seattle City's decision to condemn CAA should be a message to all who wish to undermine pluralism and religious freedom. They cannot peddle in hate and bigotry, and expect to have international acceptability at the same time,"" said Ahsan Khan, president of Indian-American Muslim Council.

Thenmozhi Soundararajan of Equality Labs, which organized the community in support of resolution, welcomed its passage. ""We are proud of the Seattle City Council for standing on the right side of history today. Seattle is leading the moral consensus in the global outcry against the CAA,” she said.

Soundararajan said that thousands of organizers across the country have called, e-mailed, and visited Seattle City Council members to amplify this resolution, and it sets an example to cities across the United States.

""At a time when members of the Indian ruling party sided Trump, the Muslim ban, and his war on immigrants as justification for targeting hundreds of millions of Indian minorities, Americans have a unique responsibility to stand up and speak about this human rights crisis.

Two unidentified persons had opened fire during the ongoing protests at Jamia Millia Islamia late on Sunday. Though no one was injured in the incident, there was panic among those present.

Hundreds of protesters laid siege to the Jamia Nagar police station and remained there till around 4 am when the police lodged an FIR against the unknown accused. The police, however, denied that there was any delay in lodging the FIR.

“As usual, the police weren’t taking any complaint and after two to three hours of people shouting slogans and approaching cops inside the police station, the FIR was registered,” claimed Mohd Hafeez, a Jamia student who was at the police station.

“We had taken photographs of the red scooter which the accused had used and based on the same identified its registration number. It is up to police to now verify and see if the owner of the vehicle and the accused are the same or if the accused used someone else’s vehicle,” he said.

“We carried out intensive search of the place where the firing took place near Gate no 7 (of the varsity campus). We found no empty cartridges there. We are, therefore, probing further to identify the accused and verify the crime. The FIR was lodged after due procedure,” in-charge DCP, South East, Gyanesh Kumar said.

The Jamia Nagar police stated that a few persons approached them during the registration of the FIR saying they had seen the red scooter that was allegedly used for the crime.

The police has claimed that no one could capture the full registration number of the two-wheeler. “We have the same series of the vehicle number. However, according to some persons the last digit is 2 while as per some it is 4. There are many vehicles with the same series (registration) and we are now verifying information to see what is the actual number of the vehicle used in the crime,” Jamia Nagar SHO Upendra Singh told PTI.

As per the vehicle registration records, the owner of the two-wheeler with the registration number caught on camera apparently ending with the digit 2 belongs to a man while that ending with 4 belongs to a woman, police said.

The police is cross verifying the CCTV cameras and other videos of the incident captured by some protestors to ascertain whether the number ends with 2 or 4, they said.

Four days ago, a minor was arrested for brandishing a gun and firing at protesters at the Jamia, injuring MCRC student Shadab Farooq. The minor had allegedly shouted, “Yeh lo Azadi”.

Following these incidents, the Election Commission shunted out DCP South East Chinmay Biswal on February 2.

This is known as palliative care. When given in a timely manner, it can help in improving the patient’s quality of life and of their families. Palliative care in some cancer patients, when used as a supportive form of therapy in early stages along with other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation, is also known to prolong life. A diagnosis of cancer is accompanied with associated problems such as depression, anxiety and fear. In palliative care, experts counsel and support patients and make referrals to mental health professionals. There are also other things that a patient’s family may need to address including financial and legal issues, or insurance. This is also an area where palliative care specialists assist and help in coordinating with relevant professionals. Last but not the least, through palliative care, cancer patients are guided to come to terms with their condition and are able to make better sense of their thoughts and fears.”",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/tiptop-tiptop-2020-02-04.html

“Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria,"" the WHO said on its official website, noting that as it was a virus, antibiotics were not effective in preventing or treating it, reports Xinhua news agency.

However, if a patient is hospitalized for the virus, the person may receive antibiotics since “bacterial co-infection is possible”, the organisation added.

240,04-2-20,Studycentre,"Finding hard to get out of bed? Melodic alarms can help you. A new study shows that melodic alarms could improve alertness levels, with harsh alarm tones linked to increased levels of morning grogginess or sleep inertia.

The study, published in PLoS One journal, involved 50 participants, using a specially designed online survey that enables them to remotely contribute to the study from the comfort of their own home.

“Morning grogginess was a serious problem in our 24-hour world. If you don’t wake properly, your work performance can be degraded for periods up to four hours, and that has been linked to major accidents,” said the study’s lead author Stuart McFarlane, doctoral researcher at RMIT University in the US.

According to the researchers, the finding could have important implications for anyone who needs to perform at their peak soon after waking, such as shift workers and emergency first responders.

“Although more research is needed to better understand the precise combination of melody and rhythm that might work best, considering that most people use alarms to wake up, the sound you choose may have important ramifications,” McFarlane said.

“This is particularly important for people who might work in dangerous situations shortly after waking, like firefighters or pilots, but also for anyone who has to be rapidly alert, such as someone driving to hospital in an emergency,” McFarlane added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre-2020-02-04.html
241,04-2-20,"Less meat, more plant-based diet cuts heart disease risk","If you are on high-protein diet like meat, daily, soy or nuts, read this carefully. According to the researchers, meats and other high-protein foods are generally higher in sulfur amino acid content which is bad for your heart.

The study, published in the journal Lancet EClinical Medicine, found that a plant-based diet may be key to lowering risk for heart disease.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. A subcategory, called sulfur amino acids, including methionine and cysteine, play various roles in metabolism and health, the researchers said.

""Meats and other high-protein foods are generally higher in sulfur amino acid content. People who eat lots of plant-based products like fruits and vegetables will consume lower amounts of sulfur amino acids,"" said study lead author Zhen Dong from Penn State University in the US.

""These results support some of the beneficial health effects observed in those who eat vegan or other plant-based diets,"" Dong added.

In an earlier study releases in 2018, Dong found that the longevity and health improvements seen in animals on sulfur amino acid-restricted diets could translate to people. The analysis found that methionine restriction has been associated with delayed aging and longer lifespans in human cells, yeast and animals including fruit flies and rodents.

In the latest study, the research team examined the diets and blood biomarkers of more than 11,000 participants from a national study and found that participants who ate foods containing fewer sulfur amino acids tended to have a decreased risk for cardiometabolic disease based on their bloodwork.

They compiled a composite cardiometabolic disease risk score based on the levels of certain biomarkers in participants' blood after a 10-16 hour fast including cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin.

""These biomarkers are indicative of an individual's risk for disease, just as high cholesterol levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Many of these levels can be impacted by a person's longer-term dietary habits leading up to the test,"" said study researcher John Richie.

Participants were excluded from the study if they reported having either congestive heart failure, heart attack or a reported change in diet due to a heart disease diagnosis.

After accounting for body weight, the researchers found that average sulfur amino acid intake was almost two and a half times higher than the estimated average requirement.

The researchers found that higher sulfur amino acid intake was associated with a higher composite cardiometabolic risk score after accounting for potential confounders like age, sex and history of diabetes and hypertension.

They also found that high sulfur amino acid intake was associated with every type of food except grains, vegetables and fruit.

""Here we saw an observed association between certain dietary habits and higher levels of blood biomarkers that put a person at risk for cardiometabolic diseases,"" Richie said.

244,04-2-20,"Controversy’s child Hegde at it again, disconcerts BJP","Party serves notice on MP for swipe at Gandhi’s freedom struggle; Congress seeks PM’s reply

As controversial BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde kicked up a row yet again, this time describing the freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi as a “staged drama” and “adjustment” with the British, the Congress on Monday demanded that the Prime Minister should come to Parliament to clarify his position on the former Union Minister’s “disparaging” remarks.

The Congress also demanded a case of sedition against Hegde, whose swipe at Mahatma Gandhi has irked the BJP leadership.

The BJP has issued a show-cause notice to Hegde and asked him to tender an unconditional apology, sources said. The five-time BJP MP is known for hardline Hindutva leanings and has a history of making controversial remarks, only to embarrass the party. The Congress asserted it was time for Modi to prove whether his loyalty is towards Gandhi or his assassin Nathuram Godse.

“They are disparaging the national movement. If the PM and the BJP Government are sincere about the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, we demand that the PM comes to Parliament and clarifies his position,” Congress’s senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said at a Press conference.

Sharma said there could not be a greater insult to India’s national movement and those who sacrificed everything to give the country freedom. “The PM and the BJP leadership as a whole has to apologise for these things,” he said.

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted, saying, “Anantkumar Hegde is perhaps reflecting the views of his masters. If he is not, his comments should invite the strictest possible action from his party.”

A senior BJP leader said the Karnataka leader’s comments were “condemnable” and the party leadership is upset with him. “The party has conveyed its displeasure to him and asked him to take remedial measure. Any insult to Mahatma Gandhi is unacceptable,” he said.

Hegde reportedly claimed at an event in Bangaluru that the entire freedom movement was staged with the consent and support of the British, and the independence movement led by Gandhi was a “drama”. He also wondered why the Father of the Nation was called ‘Mahatma’ (a great soul).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/controversy---s-child-hegde-at-it-again--disconcerts-bjp-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/controversy---s-child-hegde-at-it-again--disconcerts-bjp.html
245,04-2-20,SRK-linked firm’s assets attached in Rose Valley scam,"Assets worth Rs 70 crore of private firms, including actor Shah Rukh Khan-promoted company that owns the IPL cricket team of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), have been attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering probe in the Rose Valley scam case.

Besides the KKR Sports Pvt Ltd, promoted by Khan, the agency has attached assets of two other entities — Multiple Resorts Pvt Ltd and St Xavier’s College, Kolkata.

The Knight Riders Sports Pvt Ltd owns the KKR, and its directors include actor Shah Rukh Khan’s wife Gauri Khan as well as Jay Mehta, Bollywood actor Juhi Chawla’s husband.

“ED has provisionally attached movable and immovable properties belonging to various entities/individuals who received funds from Rose Valley Group and related entities having book value of Rs 70.11 crore under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA),” the agency said.

The attached assets include bank accounts of these three firms totaling Rs 16.20 crore.

This apart, 24 acres of land at Ramnagar and Mahishdal, Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, residential flat at Dilkap Chambers, Mumbai and one acre at Jyoti Basu Nagar, New Town, Kolkata and a hotel of Rose Valley Group have also been attached, the agency said.

The ED registered an FIR against the firm, its chairman Gautam Kundu and others in 2014 under the PMLA. Kundu was arrested by the agency in Kolkata in March, 2015 and is still under judicial custody.

Multiple charge sheets have been filed in the courts in Kolkata and Bhubaneswar by the ED in this case.

ED initiated investigation under PMLA on the basis of the FIRs/chargesheets received from West Bengal Police against Rose Valley Group of Companies and others.

The probe has revealed that Rose Valley Group of Companies were illegally and fraudulently collecting deposits from public with the intention to cheat them by falsely promising high returns on their investments.

Investigation under PMLA revealed that the Rose Valley Group collected over Rs 17,520 crores from public throughout India by luring depositors with false promise of high return/interest on their deposits out of which an amount of Rs 10,850 crore was refunded to the investors and remaining Rs 6,670 crore is still unpaid which constitutes the ""proceeds of crime.""

The Group had diverted and siphoned off the amount through cheating and had no real business that could repay this amount. Earlier ED had identified and attached properties under PMLA having tentative market value of around Rs 4,680 crore which includes several luxurious resorts, hotels, vehicles, flats, lands and gold, jewellery among others.

With the latest attachment, the total market value of properties attached so far in the Rose Valley Group cases has reached around Rs 4,750 Crores.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/srk-linked-firm---s-assets-attached-in-rose-valley-scam.html
246,04-2-20,'Indian presence in Afghanistan and US rhetoric exacerbate Pak fears of encirclement',"India's diplomatic and commercial presence in Afghanistan, along with the US's rhetorical support to it, exacerbates Pakistani fears of encirclement, a Congressional report has said.

The security establishment of Pakistan, which has long-running and ethnically-tinged dispute over their shared 1,600-mile border with Afghanistan, is fearful of strategic encirclement by India.

As such Pakistan continues to view the Afghan Taliban as a relatively friendly and reliably anti-India element in Afghanistan, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in its latest report.

The CRS is an independent research wing of the US Congress. It prepares periodic reports in issues of importance for lawmakers, helping them take informed decisions.

It's reports are not considered the official view of the Congress.

""India's diplomatic and commercial presence in Afghanistan-- and the US's rhetorical support for it -- exacerbates Pakistani fears of encirclement,"" the CRS said in its latest report.

""Indian interest in Afghanistan stems largely from India's broader regional rivalry with Pakistan, which impedes Indian efforts to establish stronger and more direct commercial and political relations with Central Asia,"" the CRS said.

India has been the largest regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, but New Delhi has not shown an inclination to pursue a deeper defense relationship with Kabul, it added.

According to the report -- slate 2018, the Trump administration has been seeking Islamabad's assistance in facilitating the US talks with the Taliban.

One important action taken by Pakistan was the October 2018 release of Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who was captured in Karachi in a joint US- Pakistani operation in 2010.

According to the report, Pakistan's security agencies maintain ties with Afghan insurgent groups, most notably the Haqqani network.

Afghan leaders, along with the US military commanders, attribute much of the insurgency's power and longevity either directly or indirectly to Pakistani support.

US President Donald Trump has accused Pakistan of ""housing the very terrorists that we are fighting.""

US officials have long identified militant safe havens in Pakistan as a threat to security in Afghanistan, though some Pakistani officials dispute that charge and note the Taliban's increased territorial control within Afghanistan itself, the CRS said.

""Pakistan may view a weak and destabilised Afghanistan as preferable to a strong, unified Afghan state (particularly one led by an ethnic Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul; Pakistan has a large and restive Pashtun minority),"" the CRS said.

""However, instability in Afghanistan could rebound to Pakistan's detriment; Pakistan has struggled with indigenous Islamist militants of its own. Afghanistan-Pakistan relations are further complicated by the presence of over a million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, as well a long-running and ethnically tinged dispute over their shared 1,600-mile border,"" the report said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-indian-presence-in-afghanistan-and-us-rhetoric-exacerbate-pak-fears-of-encirclement--2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/-indian-presence-in-afghanistan-and-us-rhetoric-exacerbate-pak-fears-of-encirclement-.html
247,04-2-20,Fight the epidemic,"About 10 million people die of cancer each year globally. The number of cases are expected to get doubled by 2030. Doctors tell you facts and reasons why is it on rise

On World Cancer Day, the entire world unites together in the fight against the global cancer epidemic. What should we do on this day and thereafter? We must gain knowledge about cancer and make people aware of cancer, its impact on an individual and his family and society. In order to defeat cancer there is a need for each of us in this world, to learn, plan, act and change.

In the year 2018, 180 lakh new patients were diagnosed to have cancer out of which 98 lakh passed away. Cancers continue to spread and grow through a process called metastasis wherein the malignant cells travel through lymphatic or blood vessels forming tumors in other parts of the body.

The major types of cancers are carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma and leukemia. Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, leukemia is the cancer of blood, sarcomas are found in bones, muscles, fat, blood vessels, cartilages or other soft connective tissues in the body whereas carcinomas can originate in the skin, lungs, pancreas, breasts, breasts as well as other glands and organs. Melanomas can arise in the cells that make the pigment in the skin.

The types of cancers in India are also undergoing transition. There is a decline of infection caused cancers in India such as cervical, and penile cancer, and an increase in lifestyle and aging associated cancers such as breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.

The numbers of cases all over the country are expected to double by 2030.

Reasons for increase in cancer

Population increase

Increasing life span, (current life expectancy in India is 68 years)

Better health facilities for diagnosis

Increased tobacco and alcohol consumption

Less physical activity and over consumption of calories that results in obesity and lifestyle diseases.

Changing food habits: transiting from traditional to more western diet, high fiber to low fiber diet.

Common myths associated with cancer are :

It is infectious. Wrong, It is not infectious.

It is a curse. It is not, it’s a Man made disease

Starvation can cure cancer, no, not at all.

Biopsy or surgery will spread it; chemotherapy kills the patients, and so on. Never, They don’t spread cancer.

The writer is Dr PN Uppal, Senior Consultant, Medical Oncology, Saroj Super Specilaity Hospital, New Delhi

Facts

Cancer is the first or second leading cause of death in 50% of the countries and third to fifth in 15% countries and sixth to tenth in the rest. One in six deaths in the world is due to cancer.

About 10 million people die of cancer each year in the world.

Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to these five leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.

Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer and is responsible for approximately 22% of cancer deaths.

Late-stage presentation and inaccessible diagnosis and treatment are common.

In India, 7 lakh new patients are diagnosed each year.

Homeopathy can help

Homeopathy should be considered as an option for patients of cancer. It is safe, free of side-effects and does not interfere with the action of any other medication.

Homeopathy has a big role to play in the management of cancers. It can be beneficial as an add-on therapy to radiation or chemotherapy. In cases where the cancer is significantly advanced, homeopathic treatment can improve the quality of life and may extend survival without adding to the patients’ suffering with the side-effects that chemotherapy or radiation may bring. Elderly patients diagnosed with cancers may not be fit to receive aggressive chemotherapy. These patients may also opt for homeopathic management of their illness, since there may be a high likelihood that chemotherapy itself could shorten their lifespan.

Homeopathic medicines act in a gentle manner causing no discomfort to the patient, while the patient is at home and can spend time with friends and family. A combination of these factors vastly improves the quality of life and may also prolong the life of the patient.

Common side effects of the management of cancer whether through chemotherapy, surgery, radiation or a combination of these means, are also effectively managed with homeopathic medicines. Severe appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, peripheral neuropathy are just some examples of side-effects which respond well to homeopathic medicines. Low white blood cell count during chemotherapy can lead to life-threatening infections.

Homeopathic medicines can help reduce the chances of contracting infections in this immune-compromised state and help in recovering from them. Non-healing sites of cancer surgery also respond well to homeopathic treatment.

248,04-2-20,Say no to steroids,"Conventional skin treatment only targets the visible signs. Therefore, the need is to switch to novel ways for long-term results, says DR PRADEEP V Mahajan

Ask a person who suffers from any form of skin disease about the prolonged duration (sometimes for years together) of treatment and the dissatisfactory results achieved. They would probably tell you stories of how they have run from pillar to post in search of effective treatments. A cause for concern is the use of steroid medications for certain dermatological conditions, which as we know has long-standing systemic effects.

What then can be done to treat the myriad of skin conditions that affect populations across all age groups? For this, first we need to understand the different types of dermatological conditions. Here’s a look at some of the common skin conditions frequently encountered by medical practitioners.

Bacteria, virus, parasites, allergic reactions, and autoimmune conditions may cause skin lesions. Acne remains the most common skin disease among adolescents. The common occurrence in this age group is due to hormonal fluctuations combined with factors such as lifestyle and diet that facilitates growth of bacteria, leading to skin eruptions. Acne can be of different types-pustular (pus-filled pimples), papular, cystic and more. Oily skin and inadequate maintenance of personal hygiene can worsen the condition. Affected individuals usually undergo treatment for several months to years with antibacterial creams/lotions as well as oral medications.

Another common condition is dermatitis, which is a general term that describes skin irritation. Symptoms of dermatitis include itchy, dry skin or a rash on swollen, reddened skin. At times, the skin may blister and cause oozing, crusting, and flaking. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic condition that tends to flare periodically. As with acne, topical antibiotics, corticosteroids are advised for management of eczema.

The issue with management of skin conditions is that, conventional treatment only targets the visible signs and symptoms. Agreed that antibiotics and anti-fungal medications kill or inhibit the activity of the associated microorganisms; however, these are not definitive solutions to prevent recurrence. The need of the hour; therefore, is a natural and effective therapeutic alternative. Bring in cell and growth factor based therapy!

Cell-based therapy is creating ripples in the world of regenerative medicine. The aim is to harness the innate healing mechanisms of our body, target the core pathology of conditions, thereby, achieve tangible results. Growth factor and cell-based proteins can be used topically or be administered locally to provide effective results in a variety of skin conditions.

Lipodermatosclerosis: Skin and connective tissue disease that occurs due to inflammation of the layer of fat under the epidermis. The condition is associated with increased body weight and immobility, commonly in older women. The symptoms of the condition are swelling, pain, and plaques on the skin, which may ulcerate as the condition progresses.

Lichenplanus: Skin condition associated with immune system dysregulation. It causes purplish, itchy, flat rashes on the skin that develops over weeks. Swelling and skin irritation may also occur.

Results achieved through the are maintained over a long period of time, based on the overall health status of the patient. It is time to move over conventional, long-term treatments and discuss with us regarding this novel therapy for sustained results in dermatological conditions.

249,04-2-20,Docyard : Don’t fall for these myths,"Many believe if the vaccine preventable diseases are eradicated from the country it’s not necessary to get injected, but the truth is none of us are fully protected from any disease until it is eradicated from the planet

As we all know immunisation is the most cost-effective way to prevent your loved ones from deadly diseases. A healthy person increases productivity and directly contributes to the economic growth of any country. However, vaccines have generated endless debate and with easy access to the internet, it’s easy to spread misinformation among the community. Hence, it’s important to evaluate the myths and facts about vaccines and immunisation.

Many believe if the vaccine preventable diseases are eradicated in their country it’s not necessary to take vaccines, but the amount of migration happening between countries none of us are fully protected from any disease until the disease is eradicated from the planet.

One more major concern is vaccines are not safe and they cause diseases like autism, cancer, affects your reproductive health and what not. Truth is, any vaccine coming to the market has undergone multiple tests, clinical trials before it gets the license.

People believe vaccines are partly responsible for the increasing number of global cancer incidence, however, vaccines such as human papillomavirus (HPV) do contribute to reduce cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancer. Although there is no evidence to show any connection between allergic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases, some blames vaccinated kids are more prone to the above whereas vaccines purely teach the immune system to react against antigens. One more interesting fact is, many believe it’s better to be exposed to disease and get naturally immunised rather than getting a vaccine. Immunity by natural infection can cause birth defects from congenital rubella or death from measles or Japanese Encephalitis (JE) if not treated in a timely manner.

An unimmunised child living a healthy life is one more argument that comes from the anti-vaccine community. But the fact remains before the Measles vaccine was introduced, 90 per cent of the children were infected by measles before they reached 10 years of age. The same applied for Polio cases, so it’s very clear vaccine-preventable disease can be nasty at times, so it’s better to be protected all the time. In some communities, people think vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses are god’s will or fact of life. This is mostly due to unawareness about vaccines and it’s very important to educate people on the consequences of not vaccinating children.

Vaccines containing harmful ingredients such as Thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound and it causes a severe threat is one of the main arguments that come from the anti-vaccine community. But Mercury is a natural element found in air, water, and soil, the amount of thimerosal dose in vaccines is much lower than the amount we are exposed to in our daily life. Giving a child more than one vaccine at a time can overload the immune system is one common concern among parents. However, no scientific evidence shows any negative effect on a child’s immune system, in fact combined vaccines reduce discomfort for the child through less vaccine doses and save money and time.

251,04-2-20,UK and EU clash over trade with 11 months to make a deal,"Britain and the European Union set out clashing opening gambits on striking a post-Brexit trade deal, making it clear that each side is willing to walk away without an agreement rather than compromise on key issues.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent a bravado-filled salvo toward Brussels on Monday, three days after Britain left the bloc, the first country to exit.

In a speech to business leaders and international diplomats in London, Johnson said, ""We want a free trade agreement"", but not at any cost.

""I see no need to bind ourselves to an agreement with the EU,"" he said, insisting that the UK would ""restore full sovereign control"" over its borders, rules and economy.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was equally emphatic that the EU's 27 remaining nations wouldn't agree to any British trade deal just to avoid a costly, chaotic ""no-deal"" at the start of 2021, when an 11-month post-Brexit transition period ends.

""We are in favour of free trade, but we are not going to be naive,"" Barnier said. ""If the request is to have broad access to a market of 450 million European consumers, zero tariffs, zero quotas — that won't happen for nothing, or in any kind of condition."" In their divorce agreement, Britain and the EU agreed to strike an ""ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership"", including a free trade deal and agreements for security and other areas.

The details are to be worked out during a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, in which relations stay essentially unchanged. For the rest of this year the UK will continue to follow EU rules, although it will no longer have a say in EU decision-making.

After that, a cliff-edge looms. But Johnson insisted the choice facing Britain was not ""deal or no deal"".

""The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's – or more like Australia's,"" Johnson said.

Australia does not have a free-trade deal with the EU, and Australia-style trade would mean a panoply of new tariffs and other barriers between the UK and the EU, its near neighbour and biggest trading partner.

Britain is aiming for a ""Canada-style"" free trade agreement with the EU, which would eliminate almost all tariffs and cover both goods and services. But it is adamant it won't agree to follow the EU's entire rule book in return for unfettered trade because it wants to be free to diverge in order to strike other new deals around the world.

The bloc insists there can be no trade deal unless Britain agrees to a ""level playing field"" and doesn't undercut EU regulations, especially when it comes to the environment, workers' rights and health and safety standards.

""There is no such thing like a free ride to the (EU's) single market. It is always rights and obligations in a good balance,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Johnson, however, doubled down on Britain's tough stance in Monday's speech. Even as he set out a vision of trade that would impose new barriers between Britain and the EU, Johnson said the UK would become a champion of free trade in a world where ""the protectionists are gaining ground"". And he sought to allay EU fears that a post-Brexit UK will slash workplace and environmental protections in order to gain a competitive edge.

""The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas — better, in many respects, than those of the EU — without the compulsion of a treaty,"" Johnson said.

His bullish message was aimed as much at a domestic audience as it was at the bloc, but EU leaders are unlikely to be reassured by what they'll see as British intransigence and wishful thinking.

""The UK can independently decide not to respect the rules,"" said France's Europe Minister Amelie de Montchalin before pointedly adding: ""But when it passes the frontier, it concerns the place where it arrives...It is important for European citizens to know that the single market will be protected.""

Barnier signalled that one flashpoint in the talks will be fishing. He said the EU would link access to its market for British products directly to the access that EU boats are given to UK waters.

""That agreement on fisheries will be inextricably linked to the trade agreement,"" he said. Formal trade talks won't start until next month, once they have been approved by all 27 EU nations.

EU leaders have repeatedly warned that the timetable is tight to strike any kind of deal.

If there is no deal by the end of 2020, and the UK refuses to extend the negotiating period, Britain faces an abrupt, disruptive economic break from the bloc — with tariffs and other obstacles to trade imposed immediately between the UK and the EU.

That prospect alarms many businesses, especially in sectors such as the auto industry, which depend on the easy flow of parts across borders.

The devil will be in the details, and Britain's position as outlined in a government document is less set in stone than Johnson's speech suggested. It said Britain would negotiate with the EU ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"", and also spoke of possible ""regulatory and supervisory cooperation"" in financial services, a key area for the British economy.

However, Barnier said the EU would continue to prepare for no deal.

""If we cannot manage by the end of the year, there will be a widespread cliff,"" he said.

Johnson, however, brushed off the idea of a ""no-deal"" Brexit — though that is essentially what Australian-style trade means.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-and-eu-clash-over-trade-with-11-months-to-make-a-deal-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-and-eu-clash-over-trade-with-11-months-to-make-a-deal.html

254,04-2-20,Salman wants Bollywood to promote 'home state' MP tourism,"Superstar Salman Khan wants more and more Bollywood films to be shot in his home state Madhya Pradesh.

Portions of his recent film ""Dabangg 3"" were shot in the ""pretty"" state -- the superstar's ""home ground"" as he was born in Indore.

Explaining how Bollywood helps in tourism of a place, he told reporters here: ""Around 300 to 350 people come as crew (to shoot a film). We also need junior artistes, the ration, and hotel services. It's not just about 300 people coming... petrol, kerosene and everything is from that particular place.

""We spend so much on travel. Even if a movie does not do well at the box-office, there are satellite and digital mediums where the movies can be seen. We brand that place. That is how your tourism increases. Whenever you see a film on television or digital, you see that it was shot in Indore or Bhopal. So when fans watch it, they visit that place,"" he added.

""Indore and Bhopal are so pretty. If films are not shot here then what is the point?"" he asked.

Apart from shooting in Madhya Pradesh, Salman will be back to the state to host the 21st edition of IIFA (International Indian Film Academy) Awards.

""When I was told that IIFA is going to Indore, I thought it was going to be held in some indoor stadium! It is amazing that we are going to Indore. Not just me, half of the film industry is going to be there,"" said Salman.

He hopes the Bollywood event helps in giving a push to the state's tourism.

The superstar, who has launched star kids like Sooraj Pancholi, Athiya Shetty and Pranutan in Bollywood, wouldn't mind picking up talent from Madhya Pradesh.

""I keep supporting and launching newcomers. I was launched in the industry by Sooraj Barjatya. Wherever I see somebody is worth it, I use him or her in my film,"" said the actor.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath is all for it. He also hopes to get a film institute built in the state some day.

""A lot of cameramen and lightmen from Madhya Pradesh work in Mumbai. We would like to give training not just for acting but technical things too. We are thinking of it,"" said Nath.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/salman-wants-bollywood-to-promote--home-state--mp-tourism-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/salman-wants-bollywood-to-promote--home-state--mp-tourism.html
255,04-2-20,Eilish feared she was heading for Spears' head-shaving meltdown,"Grammy-winning singer Billie Eilish feared she was heading for a breakdown akin to singer Britney Spears' 2007 head-shaving drama after hitting her ""lowest point"" while on tour last year.

The 18-year-old became a pop phenomenon with the huge success of her debut album, ""When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"", but Eilish recently said her sudden rise to fame took a huge toll on her mental health, and even made her feel suicidal, reports aceshowbiz.com.

In a new interview with US Vogue, she said she began sympathising with the personal troubles Spears went through so publicly over a decade ago, because Eilish was concerned she was destined for the same fate.

""As a fan growing up, I was always like 'What the f**k is wrong with them?,'"" Eilish shared of watching her teen idols fall from grace as a child.

""All the scandals. The Britney moment. You grow up thinking they're pretty and they're skinny; why would they f**k it up? But the bigger I get, the more I'm like 'Oh, my God, of course they had to do that.' In my dark places I've worried that I was going to become the stereotype that everybody thinks every young artist becomes, because how can they not?"" she said.

Eilish added: ""Last year, when I was at my lowest point during the tour in Europe, I was worried I was going to have a breakdown and shave my head.""

The ""Bad Guy"" hitmaker, who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome and has self-harmed in the past, has since managed to reach a healthier place mentally and emotionally, thanks to therapy and a reduced work schedule, but she is continually blown away by her pop stardom -- particularly after becoming the youngest artist ever to win the four major categories at the Grammy Awards last month.

Reflecting on the groundbreaking career milestone, she said: ""That s**t was f**king crazy.""

Eilish just hopes it provides some encouragement for young, aspiring musicians, as she had been not too long ago.

""If anything it's an exciting thing for the kids who make music in their bedroom,"" she said. ""We're making progress, I think, in that place -- kids who don't have enough money to use studios.""

256,04-2-20,"Taapsee: There's nothing like a slap 'out of love', it's aggression","Actress Taapsee Pannu is gearing up for her upcoming release ""Thappad"", and she asserts that the act of slapping amounts to violence, disrespect and, to an extent, a controlling nature, whether it involves a parent and a child, or husband and wife. She adds that a slap can never be an expression of love, ever.

""I think no one takes a stand against the disrespect of women, including women themselves. Standing up against it is the need of the hour. Women who are living in poor economic condition cannot stand up because of their conditioning and financial dependency on their spouses. They have no place to go and they do not earn money, so they deal with disrespect and torture every day. In elite society, they refuse to address the issue only because they look at it as social embarrassment and (feel that) it hampers their image of a perfect family!"" Taapsee told IANS.

She added: ""The fact is, whether it is one slap or several more slaps or other acts of domestic violence, it all comes from a place of disrespect and discrimination. There is nothing called a slap out of love. No, never!""

""Thappad"" revolves around a young couple and how one day the husband slaps his wife in front of guests at a house party. The wife decides to walk out of the marriage.

The ""Pink"" fame actress believes the first introduction to violence happens through parents and it gets normalised by them. Therefore the actress emphasised on sensible parenting.

""A kid is slapped by an elder because of the elder wants to create fear in the child's mind, because the child is comparatively weak. It is the wrong style of parenting. Since childhood, the human mind learns to normalise a few acts of physical violence like slapping or raising a hand. In adulthood, men especially use the same habits to control people. It is a cycle and we need to question it,"" she said.

""Thappad"" also features Paveil Gulati, Ratna Pathak Shah, Tanvi Azmi, Dia Mirza, Ram Kapoor and Kumud Mishra among others.

Taapsee did a dozen-odd glamour roles in southern commercial films before ""Pink"" changed the tide of her career in 2016, and she carved her image as a serious actress in Bollywood. In a short time, she has crafted for a ""no-nonsense"" image on and off the screen with films like ""Naam Shabana"", ""Soorma"", ""Mulk"", ""Badla"" among others.

Taapsee said that playing the protagonist Amrita in ""Thappad"" was a huge challenge. ""The character Amrita was suffocating for me in the end and I took it as a challenge. After 15 days of shooting, I started feeling claustrophobic. It was tough for me to get out of my firebrand image and mindspace and get into the skin of this character,"" she said.

She describes Amrita as a ""good-hearted, loving and homely girl"", who finally decides to walk out of a relationship that she invested all her emotions in.

""She took all the typical nonsense of ‘girls should compromise', ‘little physical violence is part of love', ‘and girl should do everything to save the marriage'. As Taapsee, I cannot take such no-sense at all. So, emotionally I was feeling claustrophobic,"" she shared.

Directed by Anubhav Sinha, ""Thappad"" is scheduled to release on February 28.

259,04-2-20,"Death toll in China's coronavirus jumps to 425, confirmed cases soar to over 20,000","The death toll in China's coronavirus rose sharply to 425 with 64 deaths on Monday alone while 3,235 new confirmed cases were reported, taking the number of those infected with the deadly disease to 20,438, Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday.

The 64 people who died on Monday were all from the Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, China's National Health Commission said.

Also, 3,235 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported, a big increase in a day.

Another 5,072 new suspected cases were reported on Monday, said the commission, adding that 492 patients became seriously ill.

The commission said that 2,788 patients remained in severe condition and 23,214 people were suspected of being infected with the virus, a pointer that it is increasingly turning virulent.

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 20,438 by the end of Monday, the commission said, noting that a total of 425 people had died of the disease.

A total of 632 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery, state-run Xinhua news agency reported

As the virus spreads from human to human, 221,015 close contacts had been traced, with 171,329 others still under medical observation.

By the end of Monday, 15 confirmed cases had been reported in Hong Kong, eight in the Macao and 10 in Taiwan.

The Philippines reported the first overseas death from the virus on Sunday while 148 cases have been reported from abroad.

India has reported three cases of the coronavirus. All the three patients from Kerala recently returned from the affected Wuhan city.

Currently, 647 Indians and seven Maldivians who have been evacuated from Wuhan and Hubei are in 14-day quarantine at a medical camp in Manesar, near Delhi.

As the virus continued to spread at an alarming rate, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday warned officials of punishment if they shirked responsibility in tackling the virus outbreak.

On Monday, China has opened a 1,000-bed hospital built in record nine days in Wuhan city and started trials for new drug to contain the virus and is set to open another 1,300 bed hospital next to it on Wednesday.

The ruling Communist Party of China on Monday held its political bureau meeting presided by President Xi to review the steps being taken on various fronts to halt the spread of the deadly virus.

The outcome of the epidemic prevention and control directly affects people's lives and health, the overall economic and social stability and the country's opening-up, Xi said.

""Those who disobey the unified command or shirk off responsibilities will be punished,"" Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.

Xi said that the party and government leaders supervising them would also be held accountable in severe cases.

Chinese armament firms, including those building aircraft carrier and military aircraft, have postponed planned work in order to concentrate on controlling the risk of coronavirus, state-run Global Times reported.

Noted Chinese health expert Zhong Nanshan has said that based on the fresh evidence, the novel coronavirus, which is spreading rapidly in China and the world, may reach its peak in the next 10 to 14 days, contrary to earlier estimates of climaxing sooner.

This means that the cases would drastically increase in the next two weeks before slowing down.

Also, China has begun clinical trials to test a drug to treat the patients of the coronavirus which till now has no cure.

Currently, patients are being treated with a combination of antivirals and other measures, as scientists race to find a vaccine.

Some reports said drugs to treat HIV too was being tried to treat the patients.

The experimental antiviral drug, Remdesivir, to be tested in field trials is developed by US-based Gilead Sciences. It is aimed at treating infectious diseases such as Ebola and SARS, South China Morning Post reported.

260,04-2-20,Hong Kong confirms death of patient with coronavirus,"Hong Kong on Tuesday become the second place outside of the Chinese mainland to report the death of a patient being treated for a new coronavirus that has so far claimed more than 400 lives.

Medical authorities confirmed a 39-year-old man who was being treated for the virus died on Tuesday morning.

The man was a resident of Hong Kong who had travelled last month to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, returning home on January 23 via a high speed rail link.

Since emerging from Wuhan late last year, the coronavirus has infected 20,000 people across China and spread to more than 20 countries.

But so far only the Philippines and Hong Kong have reported a fatality outside of the Chinese mainland.

Most of the deaths in China have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, much of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks.

Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said further details about the death would be released later on Tuesday.

Multiple local media outlets, citing medical sources, said the man had underlying health issues that had complicated his treatment.

His death came a day after Hong Kong's leader announced the closure of all but two land border crossings to the Chinese mainland in a bid to halt the spread of the virus.

Currently 15 people have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong, many of them people who arrived in the semi-autonomous city from the mainland.

There has been growing public anger over the Hong Kong government's response to the outbreak, with calls to seal the border entirely. There is also an acute shortage of masks and a strike by some medical workers that entered its second day on Tuesday.

While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, a seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city.

The 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed almost 300 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city.

Distrust -- and at times open hostility -- towards mainlanders has been worsened by years of political unrest as Hong Kongers chafe under Beijing's rule, and protest for greater democratic freedoms.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hong-kong-confirms-death-of-patient-with-coronavirus-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/hong-kong-confirms-death-of-patient-with-coronavirus.html
261,04-2-20,Air Canada flight safely lands in Madrid with damaged engine,"An Air Canada Boeing 767 aircraft with 128 passengers on board made a safe emergency landing at Madrid Airport on Monday evening.

The Toronto-bound flight AC837 had departed from the Spanish capital in the early afternoon but had to request an emergency return after one of its two engines was damaged and a tire ruptured during takeoff.

Guido Fioravantti, from New York, said his father was on the plane and that he had confirmed the safe landing.

""Landed safely, everything is ok!"" Fioravantti told The Associated Press.

There was no immediate information on what had caused the malfunction The plane spent close to four hours flying in circles near Madrid, burning off fuel before the emergency landing.

Spain's Defense Ministry dispatched an F18 fighter jet to evaluate the damage done to the landing gear.

Emergency vehicles approached the aircraft on one of the tarmacs of the Adolfo Suárez-Barajas international airport soon after it landed at 7.13 p.M. (1813 GMT).

In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, the airline said the plane “experienced an engine issue shortly after takeoff” from the same airport, as well as a ruptured tire — one of 10 on the Boeing 767-300.

It added that the aircraft “is designed to operate on one engine and our pilots are fully trained for this eventuality.""

“Nonetheless, an emergency was declared in order to obtain landing priority,"" Air Canada said.

A spokeswoman with Spain's airport operator, AENA, told the AP that the airline had requested a slot for an emergency landing some 30 minutes after takeoff.

A spokesman for Enaire, Spain's air navigation authority, said the plane's landing gear did not fold up properly on taking off and that a piece of it may have damaged part of one of the engines.

The officials were not authorized to be named in media reports.

Spain's El Mundo newspaper's website published audio it said featured the plane's pilot explaining to the passengers the need to return to Madrid because a wheel had been damaged during the takeoff.

“Because we are a bit too heavy we have to get rid of fuel before being able to land,” the voice can be heard saying in Spanish.

Madrid residents posted videos online showing a plane flying unusually low over the Spanish capital's center and suburbs.

It was the second incident of the day at Madrid's international airport, the busiest in the country. Earlier on Monday, the airport closed for over an hour due to the reported sighting of drones in the vicinity.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/air-canada-flight-safely-lands-in-madrid-with-damaged-engine-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/air-canada-flight-safely-lands-in-madrid-with-damaged-engine.html
262,04-2-20,UN Security Council to meet with Kushner on Mideast plan,"The United States has requested a closed door UN Security Council meeting Thursday for President Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, to present the administration's new Mideast peace plan, diplomatic sources told AFP Monday.

Kushner intends to set forth the plan that Washington unveiled last week and to listen to the positions of the council's other 14 members, the sources said.

The meeting would take place a few days before Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas comes to the United Nations -- he is expected February 11 -- to express opposition to the US plan and to demand adherence to international law.

On the occasion of Abbas' visit, the Palestinians have indicated they plan to submit a draft resolution to the Security Council, through Tunisia, a non-permanent member of the council.

The resolution's content has not been divulged as yet, but the United States would likely oppose it, using its veto, if necessary, should it gain the support of nine council members, the minimum required for passage.

In late 2017, a Palestinian-inspired resolution condemning Washington's unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital received 14 votes in the Security Council, but the United States quashed it with its veto.

A similar resolution proposed during the UN General Assembly, a 193-member body in which no country has a veto, was approved by a vote of 128 in favor, nine against and 35 abstentions. The remaining 21 countries chose not to be present for the vote.

Kushner is the architect of the plan unveiled by the president a week ago, and rejected Saturday by the Arab League and by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Monday.

It makes numerous concessions to Israel, proposing the establishment of a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a suburb of Jerusalem. The Palestinians have long sought the whole of east Jerusalem as their capital.

The US proposal also gives consent for the annexation of Israeli settlements as well as the Jordan Valley, Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967.

The US mission at the United Nations would provide no details on the request for a Security Council meeting.

In a statement Saturday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said he has launched a campaign to persuade member countries not to support any Palestinian action that is hostile to the US plan.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-security-council-to-meet-with-kushner-on-mideast-plan-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/un-security-council-to-meet-with-kushner-on-mideast-plan.html
263,04-2-20,Democratic caucus results delayed by mobile app issues,"Problems with a mobile app appeared to force a delay in reporting the results of the Iowa caucuses, as the campaigns, voters and the media pressed party officials for an explanation and got few answers.

An Iowa Democratic Party official on Monday pointed to ""quality control"" as the source of the delays — but noted that about a quarter of the state's nearly 1,700 precincts have reported their data already.

The party also said the delay was not caused by a ""hack or an intrusion"". But other officials blamed technology. Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney said he heard that in precincts across his county, including his own, a mobile app created for caucus organizers to report results to the party was ""a mess"".

Precinct leaders were instead calling in their results to the Democratic Party headquarters, and ""they weren't answering the phones in Des Moines"" because, Courtney speculated, they were mobbed with calls.

The apps were barely working, forcing party aides to record results from the precincts via phone and enter them manually into a database, according to a person involved in processing the data who requested anonymity to discuss the party's internal process.

The slowdown came as the party attempted to report more data about the caucus than in years past — promising to release both a headcount of each candidates' supporters and the delegate winners from each site.

""The integrity of the results is paramount,"" Iowa Democratic Party spokeswoman Mandy McClure said in a statement. ""We have experienced a delay in the results due to quality checks and the fact that the IDP is reporting out three data sets for the first time. What we know right now is that around 25 per cent of precincts have reported, and early data indicates turnout is on pace for 2016.""

The problems were an embarrassment for a state party that has long sought to protect its prized status as the first contest in the primary race. The delay was certain to become fodder for caucus critics who call the process antiquated and exclusionary. President Donald Trump's campaign quickly seized on the issue to sow doubt about the validity of the results.

""Quality control = rigged?"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Monday evening, adding a emoji with furrowed brows.

Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, who ran a precinct in the Cedar Rapids suburb of Robins, said some app users may not have gotten the instructions on how to log into the system.

""If people didn't know where to look for the PIN numbers or the precinct numbers, that could slow them down,"" said Miller, who said he had no problem using the system to report his precinct's figures and it worked fine.

Helen Grunewald, a precinct caucus chairwoman in Benton County, said she had been on hold with the party trying to report her results for a significant amount of time.

Earlier in the night, however, Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said while there were some reports from precinct officials that they couldn't log into the mobile app, a team of trouble-shooters was working to address any technical issues.

""We've had an app before but we've also had a hotline before, and folks have had the option to do that, and so we expect that we'll be able to report the results in a timely manner this evening,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/democratic-caucus-results-delayed-by-mobile-app-issues-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/democratic-caucus-results-delayed-by-mobile-app-issues.html
264,04-2-20,Kenyan president says ex-president Daniel arap Moi has died,"Daniel arap Moi, a former schoolteacher who became Kenya's longest-serving president and presided over years of repression and economic turmoil fueled by runaway corruption, has died. He was 95.

Moi's death was announced by President Uhuru Kenya in a statement on the state broadcaster on Tuesday.

Moi, who ruled Kenya for 24 years, had been in hospital for over a month.

Despite being called a dictator by critics, Moi enjoyed strong support from many Kenyans and was seen as a uniting figure when he took power after founding President Jomo Kenyatta died in office in 1978.

Some allies of the ailing Kenyatta, however, tried to change the constitution to prevent Moi, then the vice president, from automatically taking power upon Kenyatta's death.

So wary was Moi of any threat during that uncertain period that he fled his Rift Valley home when he heard of Kenyatta's death, returning only after receiving assurances of his safety.

In 1982 Moi's government pushed through parliament a constitutional amendment that made Kenya effectively a one-party state. Later that year the army quelled a coup attempt plotted by opposition members and some air force officers. At least 159 people were killed.

Moi's government then became more repressive in dealing with dissent, according to a report by the government's Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission that assessed his rule.

Political activists and others who dared oppose Moi's rule were routinely detained and tortured, the report said, noting unlawful detentions and assassinations, including the killing of a foreign affairs minister, Robert Ouko.

“The judiciary became an accomplice in the perpetuation of violations, while parliament was transformed into a puppet controlled by the heavy hand of the executive,” the report said.

Corruption, especially the illegal allocation of land, became institutionalized, the report said, while economic power was centralized in the hands of a few.

In 1991, Moi yielded to demands for a multi-party state due to internal pressure, including a demonstration in 1991 during which police killed more than 20 people, and external pressure from the West.

Multi-party elections in 1992 and 1997 were marred by political and ethnic violence that critics asserted were caused by the state.

By the time Moi left power in 2002, corruption had left Kenya's economy, the most developed in East Africa, with negative growth.

Moi often blamed the West for bad publicity and the economic hardships many Kenyans had to endure during his rule.

As with his predecessor, Kenyatta, many government projects, buildings and currency notes and coins were named after Moi.

Fed up, Kenyans voted for a new constitution that was implemented in 2010 and made provisions to bar personality cults.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kenyan-president-says-ex-president-daniel-arap-moi-has-died-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/kenyan-president-says-ex-president-daniel-arap-moi-has-died.html
265,04-2-20,Siachen troops suffered from UPA-2 delay,"Troops guarding Siachen, world’s highest battlefield, in temperatures many degrees below zero were without adequate essential clothing and snow goggles from 2015 to 2016 due to delay in procurement in the previous four years (extending from UPA-2). In fact, the shortage of snow goggles touched 98 per cent.

The Modi dispensation came to power in June 2014.

Flagging these alarming facts, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said the troops also did not get high calorie rations necessary to maintain their energy requirements. This compromised the calorie intake by as high as 82 per cent.

Making these observations in its report on Monday, the CAG said troops in high altitude areas such as Siachen and Ladakh among others need to be provided high altitude clothing, equipment and special ration to enable the troops to effectively withstand the inclement weather and ailments caused from extreme cold weather conditions.

The Performance Audit findings of provisioning and procurement of these items during the period 2015-16 to 2017-18 said there were delays in procurement of high altitude clothing and equipment items up to four years leading to acute shortage of essential clothing and equipment items.

It led to critical shortage in snow goggles ranging from 62 per cent to 98 per cent. The troops were not issued ‘multi-purpose boots’ from November 2015 to September 2016 and had to resort to recycling of available boots.

Further, old versions of items such as face mask, jacket and sleeping bags were procured which deprived the soldiers from the benefits of using improved products. Lack of research and development by defence laboratory led to continued dependence on import, the report noted.

The high altitude clothing and equipment are issued to soldiers deployed above 6,000 feet and include items like boots, coats, goggles, sleeping bags, tents, mattress, snow shoes, gaiters, spare glasses.

The DG Ordnance Services under Master General of Ordnance in the Army headquarters is responsible for provisioning, procurement, receipt, storage and issue.

Referring to a case study of delays, the CAG said 1,16,732 camp mattresses outdoor were needed and the supply order was placed on a firm in June 2013. However, the firm did not supply any even after five years and the order was not cancelled due to non-supply.

As regards goggles, the CAG said no item was received against the supply order for 9,61,605 pairs even though the indent was placed on Ordnance Factory, Dehradun between December 2010 and May 2016. The goggles are an essential part of the high altitude gear as they protect soldiers from visionary ailments including snow blindness.

The CAG asked the Defence Ministry to conduct enquiry into various cases of irregularities in procurement of high altitude equipment and initiate action against those responsible for lapses.

As regards special rations, the Government watchdog said special scales of such rations are authorized to the troops to meet their daily energy requirements. However, substitutes in lieu of scaled items were authorized on “cost to cost’’ basis which resulted in supply of reduced quantity of substitutes. This compromised the calorie intake of the troops by as high as 82 per cent.

Quoting an example, the CAG said at Leh station in one instance it was noticed that the special ration items were shown as issued to troops for consumption without their actual receipt.

Explaining the significance of special rations, the report said the high altitude region has extreme conditions wherein temperatures fall below minus 50 degrees during severe winter conditions.

This causes loss of appetite due to various physiological changes leading to weight loss and reduction in performance. The normal ration scale is not sufficient for the calorific value required for the high altitude area.

The basic objective of giving special rations to the troops at 12,000 feet and above is to provide alternative food items to alleviate certain psychological and physiological conditions that the soldiers face under inhospitable conditions there, the CAG said.

The report said reasons like sanctioning costly substitutes in lieu of basic items on same cost resulted in reduced quantity of calorie intake of the troops. In order to overcome this issue, the CAG asked the concerned agencies to ensure calorie content is not neglected while providing cost to cost items and called for open tender system for concluding special rations contracts.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/siachen-troops-suffered-from-upa-2-delay-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/siachen-troops-suffered-from-upa-2-delay.html

267,04-2-20,"Shaw makes Test comeback, Agarwal replaces Rohit for ODI series","Opener Prithvi Shaw on Tuesday made a comeback into the Indian Test team for the two-match series against New Zealand while Mayank Agarwal replaced injured Rohit Sharma in the ODI squad for the series beginning here on Wednesday.

Shaw, who last played for India in October 2018, returns to the Test side after Rohit was ruled out of the series due to a left calf muscle strain. The two-Test series begins in Wellington on February 21.

With Rohit also ruled out of three-match ODI series beginning here on Wednesday, Mayank Agarwal replaces Rohit in the side and is in line to open alongside Shaw, provided K L Rahul continues to bat in the middle-order.

""Vice-captain Rohit Sharma sustained a left calf muscle strain during the fifth T20I against New Zealand at Tauranga on Sunday.

""He underwent an MRI scan in Hamilton on Monday. The opening batsman has been ruled out of the upcoming ODI and the Test series and will be referred to the National Cricket Academy for further management of his injury,"" said the BCCI in a statement.

Shaw, who had made a century on Test debut against the West Indies in October 2018, had last month received a maiden ODI call-up for the New Zealand series.

After serving an eight-month doping ban last year, Shaw showed no signs of rustiness and was instantaneously amongst the runs in domestic cricket with the double hundred against Baroda being the highlight.

Shaw has already been in New Zealand for more than two weeks with the A side and smashed a 150 against New Zealand XI in his first innings on the tour.

His India U-19 teammate Shubman Gill has expectedly retained his place in the Test squad following a match-saving double hundred for India A against New Zealand on Sunday.

Both Shaw and Gill are openers but the former is expected to open alongside Agarwal in the first Test at Basin Reserve. Gill, who smashed the double ton batting at number four, can also make the eleven as a middle-order batsman.

Gill, who has played two ODIs, was part of the Test squad in the home series against South Africa and Bangladesh but did not get a game.

Kuldeep Yadav, who did not make the eleven in the five T20s against New Zealand, has been dropped from the Test squad with the selectors going for two specialist spinner options in Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin.

The Chinaman played his last Test during the tour of Australia in January last year and during the home season, Ashwin and Jadeja were the preferred choice.

Pacer Navdeep Saini too has made his way into the Test side following impressive performances in limited overs cricket. Saini had received his maiden Test call-up for the one-off Test against Afghanistan in 2018 but is yet to make his debut. However, he has gone on to play three ODIs and 10 T20s for India.

Senior pacer Ishant Sharma, who had twisted his ankle during a Ranji Trophy game last month, has kept his place in the side but his participation in the series is subject to fitness.

India's Test squad: Virat Kohli (Captain), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vice-captain), Hanuma Vihari, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Mohd. Shami, Navdeep Saini, Ishant Sharma (subject to fitness clearance).",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaw-makes-test-comeback--agarwal-replaces-rohit-for-odi-series-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/shaw-makes-test-comeback--agarwal-replaces-rohit-for-odi-series.html
268,04-2-20,Injury-hit India look for context in ODI battle against subdued New Zealand,"Injuries to key players has opened the door for exciting youngsters such as Prithvi Shaw to make an impression in the Indian line-up against a low-on-confidence and depleted New Zealand in the three-match ODI series starting here on Wednesday.

This is India's third ODI assignment after the World Cup last year, having previously beaten West Indies (away) and Australia (at home).

The Black Caps, on the other hand, play their first ODI since that infamous loss at Lord's in the World Cup final against England.

The last time these two sides met in the 50-over format, New Zealand had knocked India out of the World Cup with an 18-run win over two days in the second semi-final at Manchester.

India extracted revenge with a 5-0 T20 whitewash that concluded on Sunday.

In the current context, stakes aren't that high as both sides prepare for the T20 World Cup later in Australia this year. In fact, the upcoming two-Test series later this month bears more significance than this ODI clash.

In the ODI series, neither side will be at full strength as a string of first-team players will be missing due to injuries.

India were dealt a major blow when Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the remainder of this tour owing to the calf injury he picked up in the final T20I. The Men in Blue are already missing Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Deepak Chahar.

For New Zealand, inspirational skipper Kane Williamson has joined the long list of injured along with the likes of Trent Boult.

Mayank Agarwal was named as Rohit's replacement for the ODI series on Tuesday afternoon. And skipper Virat Kohli outlined that they will stick to the strategy adopted against Australia in Rajkot, where KL Rahul kept wickets and batted at number five.

Kohli had more or less confirmed Shaw's ODI debut in that scenario, and now India will probably have two openers debuting.

The last time such a situation arose was 2016, when KL Rahul and Karun Nair opened for India on their debuts in Zimbabwe.

Sunil Gavaskar and Sudhir Naik (1974) against England and Parthasarthy Sharma and Dilip Vengsarkar (1976) against New Zealand are the other previous instances.

Such a move would set up India's batting line-up with Kohli at number three and Shreyas Iyer at number four.

In the nets on Tuesday, Manish Pandey batted along with Kohli and Iyer, ahead of Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant and Kedar Jadhav.

If Pandey plays, the lower order will be a curious mix with Dube, Jadhav and Ravindra Jadeja vying for the all-rounder's spot.

In the bowling department, three pacers will probably be the norm once again.

Kuldeep Yadav, who sat out the entire T20I series, is slated for a comeback given his performance against Australia at home.

New Zealand will have some re-think before finalising their playing eleven too.

Tom Latham will lead the side ahead of Tim Southee who was stand-in skipper during the last two T20Is. In Williamson's absence, they will look towards Ross Taylor for batting leadership.

The Black Caps will be rejuvenated though with the inclusion of all-rounder Jimmy Neesham while Colin de Grandhomme returns to the squad as well. Ish Sodhi is only there for the first ODI and the hosts could opt for a two-spinner attack given the slower surface at Seddon Park.

Keeper-batsman Tom Blundell and lanky pacer Kyle Jamieson are the only ones who don't have an ODI cap to their name.

Teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini.

New Zealand: Tom Latham (capt and wk), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Jimmy Neesham, Scott Kuggeleijn, Tom Blundell, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Hamish Bennett, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Kyle Jamieson, Mark Chapman.

269,04-2-20,"Shaw, Agarwal set to make ODI debut after Kohli says Rahul will bat in middle-order","India are set to field two debutant openers, Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal, in the first ODI against New Zealand here on Wednesday after skipper Virat Kohli confirmed that K L Rahul will continue to bat in the middle-order.

Regular opener Shikhar Dhawan was ruled out of the New Zealand T20s and ODIs last month after hurting his left shoulder during the home ODIs against Australia.

His partner and India vice-captain Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the three games and the following Tests on Tuesday due to a left calf muscle strain, necessitating a complete change in the opening combination.

Rahul will keep wickets and bat at number five like he did during the Australia series, Kohli said on Tuesday.

""Prithvi's definitely going to start and whoever the replacement is, we'll ask for an opener (which has already been decided with Agarwal replacing Rohit). KL will bat in the middle-order. We want him to get accustomed to that role and keep as well,"" said Kohli.

Kohl said Rohit's absence doesn't hamper the team's preparations as there are not many ODI series lined up in the year of T20 World Cup.

""I understand it's an unfortunate situation that Rohit can't be a part of this series. When you talk about one-day cricket and T20 cricket and Test cricket now, he's one guy who's always on the list first. But the thing is that we don't have any one-day tournaments to look forward to.

""It's if anything an ideal time for him to go away and rectify this as soon as he can and come back. He played the T20I series, so from the team's balance point of view heading into the World Cup year, it doesn't really hamper the combination as far as the T20s are concerned,"" he said.

New Zealand will also be missing Kane Williamson as also pacers Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson. Kohli said ODIs this year are all about opportunities to different players across both sides.

""Quite surprising (that Williamson is missing) because he said he felt better. But I know with the AC joint (left shoulder), I've had it as well. Unless you get into the action, it's very difficult to make a judgement of how much pain you feel. Especially for a batsman, if the shoulder is not right, it can hurt you.

""So I'm sure he's not in a shape to take the field. As I said, one-day games this year is all about whoever gets the opportunity what they can do in the team combination and not necessarily about whether the chances of winning or losing wary or not. That's what we are looking at as well,"" said the India captain.

Kohli said injuries to Dhawan and Rohit are a good opportunity for Shaw and Agarwal.

""Rohit's injury is unfortunate but someone who steps in, it's a chance for that guy to experience this kind of pressure and expectation, and for us to see who are the guys that cope with it. Kane has done it so many times, and you know what he can do.

""So someone who gets the chance, it'll be an opportunity for the team to see how he copes with that pressure. I see it that way. I see it as an opportunity for others rather than looking at it negatively,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaw--agarwal-set-to-make-odi-debut-after-kohli-says-rahul-will-bat-in-middle-order-2020-02-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/shaw--agarwal-set-to-make-odi-debut-after-kohli-says-rahul-will-bat-in-middle-order.html
