0,07-2-20,Social contract of social forestry,"Local problems require solutions based on different strategies. This is why the key person may or may not be a forester but one who links the community to the store of expertise and gets things done

There is an ongoing fierce debate in the country about successful strategies of natural resources management. At one end of the spectrum, we have the moral and political contract of Rousseau, where the Government has all the political legitimacy. Then there are views inspired by Hobbes, that individual actions are influenced only by their personal power and conscience. In the same vein today, we have staunch advocates of the predominant role of individuals vs the state in matters of management of forests, land, water bodies and other natural resources. The fact remains that poor forest governance can have significant negative impacts in development of outcomes on all the pillars of strategy, the environment, poverty-reduction and social development.

SD Richardson, late Chairman of Forest Education in the UN, once observed, “The greatest challenge in conservation is not the conservation of threatened or vanishing species or even biological diversity, it is the enhancement of soil fertility to enable sustainable development in a world reluctant to accept the steady state economics.”

One would like to add that there is no better means to maintain, sustain or enhance the productivity of the soil but for trees or perennial vegetation. Proper trees at the proper place are the key to maintaining, sustaining and enhancing soil productivity. This is also the answer to job-creation, reducing the disparity of income and for maintaining, or decelerating the rate of climate change, due to their unique capacity to sequester carbon.

Land is a finite and fragile resource in India. It requires a careful husbandry. The cost of soil erosion and degradation is seldom perceived because it is in various scales and magnitude. On site and off site, the cost of soil erosion can be loss of productive potential, reduction of infiltration rates, reduction in water holding capacity, loss of nutrients, increased tillage operation cost, reduced storage capacity of dams, reduced water supply and depletion of wildlife and so on. In case of rivers, health of forest greatly determines the quality and quantity of water. Riparian vegetation impacts metabolic functioning of biota. Branches and twigs often work as debris dams and often serve as important habitat.

There are large areas in India where sustainable agriculture is only possible with the aid of trees, whether as a part of crop rotation, shade providers or as a fodder. Trees have an important part to play in land restoration/reclamation. There are large areas in the country, particularly the so-called dry lands which have been so badly misused in the past that they are no longer capable of growing food and fodder for people who live and depend on them. In all these critical situations, their contribution will be decisive. This is about the most important job that trees have to do in India today.

Technological innovation in agriculture is often advanced as an answer to deteriorating productivity. Most “agricultural innovation” theses fail to explain why in many parts of the country, completely different technologies are being applied on lands, which are similar but adjacent. Small, independent farmers may be applying a traditional technology to sustain themselves right next to an adjoining stretch of land where modern, sophisticated technology is producing cash crops.

Similarly, it is oversimplification to regard deforestation/degradation as a consequence of population. Any incisive study or analysis of history will show that deforestation is nothing but manifestation of unjust social relations. In such a scenario, an area which promises great hope but also requires careful scrutiny is social forestry.

This connotes many concepts to many people, forests for socio-economic development, agroforestry, urban forestry, recreation forestry and forestry for rural development. These different names signify different functions of trees under different settings. But these reflect a growth of social consciousness about trees. But first what does social forestry mean? Though there is no clear or agreed meaning, it has come to cover any kind of forestry activity directed to social needs.

Agroforestry: A forester will often say that agroforestry has changed the landscapes in western UP, certain parts of Haryana and or Punjab. Yamunanagar in Haryana is a hub of forest-based industrial activity which served as a showcase of what agroforestry can do. The fact remains that the drylands of India constitute a unique challenge for development planning, observes economist Mihir Shah.

Biologists advanced various claims in favour of agroforestry like controlling soil erosion, maintaining organic matter, improving and maintaining the physical property of soil, addition of nitrogen, addition of mineral nutrition, reduction in soil acidity and alkalinity, addition biomass through tree root system, enhancement of mycrorhizal associations, imputed capture of rainfall and sunlight, control of damage from disease and so on. All can be true or untrue unless the choice of components, their arrangements and their management are optimised within an environmental conducive to it.

Agroforestry for sustainable agriculture: Agroforestry systems can provide several products, requiring different yardsticks for their measurements. They occur in different ways and on different scales of time and space. Different products may require different units of measurement. For example, crop per season, timber or poles after several years, non-timber forest products in different units; or tonnes of top soil saved, rainfall conserved. In short, both short and long-term benefits occur from different agroforestry systems (with tree-crop mixture). Short-term benefits occur in the shape of mulch and litter that affect root growth and the soil’s physical properties. Farmers need to be exposed to the fact that to measure a lasting benefit in natural capital, we shall have to consider time and space scale. Agroforestry can add to both efficiency, stability and resilience for sustainable agriculture, provided the benefits are considered in scale of time and space. Trees can influence beyond their immediate environment. Their roots may extend well outside their plots and trees on the upper side of the watershed affect downside farms, while trees in the valley affect the hydrology. Hence, while counting benefits of agroforestry, both goods and services need to be considered and there is no doubt that a right combination of trees and crops can be both efficient, resilient and sustainable. But agroforestry is not simply limited to a matter of solving technical problems. It is also necessary to understand the socio-economic and hence political context within which agriculture is practised. Research of this kind has become all the more important because day by day the area of land under traditional agriculture is dwindling and suitable use of trees can do so much to improve soil productivity. Such areas of research are just beginning to receive attention. Agroforestry at present is largely confined to the prosperous pockets of fertile land and the benefits are mostly accruing to rich farmers. How these benefits or gains get distributed among the landless, small farmers and contract labourers remain to be analysed with location-specific hard data.

There are various issues and innumerable location-specific problems and solutions that need to be addressed for which there is neither effective institution, nor capacity or proper policy instrument. The rural poor, who have either no land at all or insufficient land to support them, are increasing in number every year. The problem will not go away by ill-conceived schemes or absence of schemes. They can be mobilised to restore the land, water bodies or for the conservation of local biodiversity. City-trained extension purveying orders and advice to farmers often find their advice ignored. It makes more sense to convey new ideas through individuals chosen to represent them at their level of knowledge or literacy. What is required is total revamping or rejuvenation of the vanquishing ecosystem.

Recreation forestry: This is another dimension of social forestry, which requires careful nurturing, because its users are by and large opinion makers of society. They are influential, with ability to mobilise public/political opinion. The demand for outdoor recreation and social cohesion is catching speed and city dwellers love to get first-hand experience of forests. Forested landscapes in India are few and far from the reach of city and village dwellers. Hence, there is great demand for forested landscape for city dwellers like Kukrail in Lucknow, or other big cities. It requires skill, experience in anticipating the clear aim and the demands of the people or special interest groups, the finance to be put in and the returns.

Urban forestry: Is another conspicuous kind of social forestry, which has shown great potential and which is another pointer to social consciousness about trees. The main purpose of the urban forest is shade, screening and aesthetic. The composition of urban forested landscape is also often on socio-economic strata. Hardy and economically useful species are selected (such as moringa, neem, jamuns, eucalyptus) for slums or for low-income areas. People living in the slums are generally not bothered with trees except for a few species that provide fodder or shade for their temporary shops or homes. Urban forests of affluent areas generally have well-planted, well-tended trees. Urban trees are important for their benefits to city dwellers, climate amelioration and engineering, architectural and aesthetic uses. But except a few cities, management of urban areas generally reflects a lack of skill and experience, in addition to financing and proper monitoring and, of course, information, education and training of stakeholders.

Trees have manifold roles to play. Forest policy expert Bjorn Lundgren had rightly observed that there is a range of local problems that requires solutions based on different strategies. This is why the key person may or may not be a forester but the one who links the local community to the store of expertise and acts as a catalyst in getting things on the way. It matters little whether he/she is called an activist, village representative or what have you. It is through such people that foresters or others can gain an understanding of problems and suggest feasible solutions.

1,07-2-20,Be reformist not protectionist,"In view of the economic slowdown, populist, protectionist policy measures have to be discarded for a pro-market, pro-reforms mindset

The Union Budget 2020-21 came at one of the toughest times the Indian economy is facing in recent times. Domestic demand for goods and services, export order books, India’s gross domestic product and growth projections, are depressed, if not taking a southern dive. Add to this the binary issues of inflationary pressure and burgeoning fiscal deficit. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did a tight, long, rope walk on a burning coal pit on February 1, while having a truck load of complex policy decisions on her head. She did manage to put up a show but spectators to this annual mega policy ombudsman event weren’t impressed.

The question is what went wrong and is there scope for course correction during the year? In a nutshell, markets, specially those players who have significant cross-border transactions, didn’t seem to think that the trade and industrial policy direction announced in the Budget was progressive, bold and reformist. Many would agree that despite the current regime coming in with a promise of making India investment, business and trade-friendly, it has gone ahead and erected tall, if not taller, wall of tariffs around its companies, markets, products and small and medium-sector enterprises. Coupled with this are a steady stream of ambiguous to opaque, regulatory and policy frameworks which leave little space for businesses and trade to prosper.

The usual rhetoric heard in many Government circles is India’s small and medium sector businesses need to be cushioned, indigenous manufacturing of products is mandatory and, with or without a life-threatening virus, China’s march in domestic and regional markets has to be contained. Also, new-age data-driven economy is somehow a threat to, and against, national interests.

A brief pause here, and an assertion that many, and all of these narratives are global in nature, and India has simply caught on the winds, which may or may not be the best-fit solution for a recessionary world economic order.

However, an equally important policy document, which was drafted by the same Ministry officials and presented to the world a day prior to the Budget, the Economic Survey, somehow lies forgotten. Consider this edited excerpt, from the Economic Survey which makes a strong case for free trade, by stating “laser-like focus...as an India that harbours misplaced insecurity on the trade front is unlikely to grab this opportunity, our trade policy must be an enabler. In fact, contrary to recent fears, careful analysis that controls for all confounding factors shows that India has gained from trade agreements.”

Even if one were to avoid getting into details of the Economic Survey, just reading the chapter headlines like Undermining Markets: When Government intervention hurts more than it helps, Privatisation and wealth creation and finally, Wealth Creation: The invisible hand supported by hand of trust are clear indicators of a reformist out-of-the-box, economic welfare path to prosperity.

Contrast this with the Budget document, which states that imports under Free Trade Agreements will be scrutinised for adherence to rules of origin clause. Similarly, import tariffs on countless items have been scaled up each year, without a status check on readiness of domestic producers to supply similar quality products at same, if not, cheaper rates. Add to this, the promise of reviewing all customs duty exemptions list by year end. The Budget speech punched with terms like, “imports through free trade agreements” pose a “threat to domestic industry” and many instances of “undue claims of benefits” have been found, harbingers to open a new bureaucratic line of checks and penalty, plus an additional delay at ports of entry. Coupled with this could be significant retaliatory tariffs from countries, whose goods are directly impacted and it gets into a spiraling trade tariff, mostly unfruitful solution finding exercise.

What do successful companies, especially those operating in multi regulatory regimes do when faced with problem of this stature? First, they assess the problem statement, skim out extra or avoidable flab, hold a cross-functional in some cases, cross-geography brainstorming session and perhaps create a war room. Finally, with a “Back to Market” strategy, they focus the best of talent to address key strategic issues within fixed timelines. If, the calibrated strategy fails, the cycle is repeated quickly to minimise loss of business and mostly get back on the growth path.

In the Government’s case a similar policy goal has to be clearly chalked out with an inter-ministerial team headed by a Cabinet Minister. Policy experts and industry representatives have to be given a place on the table and their views counted. Political showers of choicest barbs have to be set aside while darting towards a new India with a $5 trillion economy. Populist, protectionist policy measures have to be discarded for a pro-market pro-reforms mindset. Equal partnership responsibilities along with sweet rewards once a while will do a lot more towards millions of jobs and billions in investments than appearing nonchalant to large investors. Investor guarantee, more important with strategic trade partner companies, coming up with tailor-made solutions for each will be a game changer. Most important, creating India’s economic ambassadors from the business community, if necessary, providing them delegation status, will reassure “the hand of trust, behind invisible hands of market.”

2,07-2-20,Nations must act now to end STIs,"Sexually transmitted infections pose a major public health problem in the region. All stakeholders must refocus attention, resources and energy in this direction

There are two things everyone should know about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). First, almost all STIs can be prevented through the use of a highly-effective technology — condoms. The four most common STIs — chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomonas vaginalis — can be cured by antibiotics. Second, STIs don’t always show symptoms. Untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause infertility. Syphilis in a pregnant woman can cause foetal and neonatal illness and death while human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer. When access to appropriate products and services is provided, they are greatly empowering: Practise safe sex, get tested and where necessary, use effective treatment. By working to ensure all people can access the products and services needed to prevent, detect and treat STIs, member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region have made significant progress against them. In the mid-’90s the region accounted for more than a third of all new STI infections globally. By 2012, it accounted for an estimated 11 per cent. In 2016, Thailand eliminated mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and HIV. In 2019, Maldives and Sri Lanka achieved the same. From Bangladesh to Indonesia and on to Myanmar, the region’s member states have rolled out innovative policies to tackle STIs. India in particular has made significant inroads against them, with strong success at the sub-national level. However, the region’s battle against STIs continues as new challenges have emerged. As a recent WHO report outlines, several gaps and constraints — including inattention and a lack of resources — are undermining STI control and causing diseases to increase in specific areas and communities. This cannot continue. As health authorities and donors increasingly promote HIV services, it is imperative that STIs are given the attention, resources and energy required to sustain and accelerate the region’s advances and promote health for all.

Our goals are clear. By 2030 we must reduce the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea by 90 per cent based on the 2018 levels. Congenital syphilis should amount to no more than 50 cases per 100,000 live births. All countries should achieve and sustain 90 per cent coverage of the HPV vaccine. To make the necessary progress, which will help end STIs as a major public health problem, several areas should be of focus.

To start with, STI control should be repositioned as a public health priority. Resources, staffing and planning should be allocated independent of HIV programmes. Public awareness, engagement and participation should be promoted. The common ground and potential synergies in STI and HIV control efforts should be better grasped and programmes should be integrated. A clear line should be drawn from where each country is, to where it needs to be. To help do that, we must share and learn from member state successes. All countries in the region have implemented successful policies aimed at a range of outcomes, from eliminating mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and HIV to increasing STI testing among key populations. Each country has much to offer. Together we must leverage expertise to overcome barriers and drive down the STI burden. Crucially, all gaps in STI data must be filled. To that end, basic STI surveillance must be carried out, with all pregnant women and patients from key populations screened for STIs routinely. Standard case reporting procedures should be developed and followed, allowing authorities to track the efficacy of interventions and recalibrate them as and where needed.

To protect against HPV, which is a cause of cervical cancer in women, two doses of the HPV vaccine should reach all girls between the ages of nine and 14. To date, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives have introduced the vaccine nationally, while in India, Sikkim is the only State to make it part of its routine schedule. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and several Indian States have conducted pilot projects. We must closely guard the region’s progress against STIs. We cannot afford for it to be reversed. As together we strive to reduce the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea by 90 per cent by 2030 and achieve and sustain 90 per cent coverage of the HPV vaccine, all stakeholders must refocus their attention, resources and energy on the task at hand. WHO will continue to support Member States in their efforts to do that, and to ensure all people are empowered to practise safe sex, get tested and, where necessary, use effective treatment. The end of STIs as a major public health problem is possible. Together we must act.

3,07-2-20,Far from Home,"Of late, the Delhi police has come under a lot of criticism. But we must not forget that it takes orders from its captain, who has been spending all his energy campaigning

When the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA Government won the 2019 Lok Sabha election, there was an air of inevitability about who would occupy the Home Minister’s chair. Rumours and reports were circulated weeks prior to the official announcement that the man in the hot seat would likely be Amit Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-hand man, the one he often looks up to for guidance. This aspect was most visible during his first and only press conference last year. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that Prime Minister Modi gave such an important post to arguably his most trusted cadet.

On taking over the post of the Home Minister, Shah stated and projected his views that he wanted to establish a strong country during his tenure and that he intended to protect the citizens from threats — both external and internal. Indeed, this was a lovely thought: A strong India where citizens feel safe. The problem, however, is that this idea has all but been yet rhetoric of the Modi Government. Words were either left hanging in the air or were forgotten after being printed on a saffron pamphlet. The performance of the Home Minister ever since his appointment last year has been egregious, even by the most liberal benchmark. I would go so far as to say that it has been an unmitigated disaster.

The reasons for his unequivocal failure to fulfil his responsibilities can be attributed to “incompetence” or “negligence” bordering ineptness. In this week’s article, I will highlight some of the major failings of the Home Minister ever since he took charge. I will also suggest some ideas and the possible causes of the prevailing situation on the ground.

The most obvious and visible example of Shah’s failure has been on account of the performance and conduct of the Delhi Police, which falls under the Home Ministry. With elections in Delhi nearing, the police conducted itself in the most “irresponsible” manner. A perfect example of the police’s shocking behaviour and the Home Ministry’s inexplicable silence was the events that unfolded on December 15, 2019, when it forcefully entered the premises of the Jamia Millia Islamia university and allegedly assaulted students after a mob set several buses on fire near the college. The police alleged that they entered the university campus to identify the agitators. However, ground reports stated that the police forcibly entered the university campus without any permission from the administration and lobbed tear gas inside the campus even as the students were studying inside the library.

The Jamia incident was indeed shameful but at least the police forwarded an argument that they barged into the university to “identify the agitators.” A few weeks later, even this pretence of impartiality and fairness was done away with. On January 5, an armed mob entered the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and attacked both the students and the teachers. At least 23 people were injured during this incident and one of the images that stood out from the entire episode was of a “helpless” police standing outside the university campus even as the mob ran rampant inside. What was all the more shocking was that a month after this attack, the special investigation team unearthed precious little about the violence and the police’s “muted” response. This despite the fact that a leading television channel carried out a sting operation and unmasked some of the prime instigators of the violence, who happened to be members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a Right-wing student’s organisation associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP. Despite these obvious leads and evidence, no arrests have been made by the police. What a shocker!

The image of a “helpless” police force came to the fore once again when a man, armed with a gun, fired shots at a protest while shouting slogans like “kisko chahiye azaadi, main doonga azaadi.” This incident happened right in the centre of the capital. All of these incidents do raise some uncomfortable questions for the Home Minister. However, what was all the more deplorable was that the videos and images that were circulated widely on social media showed visuals where the police stood by and just observed the shooter brandishing a gun as if it was a regular day in the park and the police wanted to bask in some sun. What was even more unbelievable was that the shooter featured a live video on Facebook moments before the incident. Loudly and proudly he claimed how he was going to take action against protesters.

How ironical it is that the police acted with alacrity while entering the Jamia university campus to identify miscreants but showed bamboozling levels of helplessness while dealing with the incidents of violence at JNU and then with the shooter. It boggles one’s mind as to how the police can blow so hot and cold depending on the event. But then what can they do? After all, they take orders from the Home Ministry and, therefore, Shah is the captain of their ship. The police cannot act against the instructions of its captain or any other privileged deputies even if party members raise slogans like “Desh ke gadaaron ko, goli maaro saalo ko.” A free and fair police would have registered an FIR against BJP MP Anurag Thakur for raising such disgusting and vile slogans. A competent Home Minister would have come down strongly against such statements, which have visibly deteriorated the law and order situation in Delhi for which the buck stops with Shah.

But we must not forget that we live in interesting times where the Home Minister of the country is actually the face of the BJP for the Delhi elections. All his time and effort has been spent on disparaging the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The Home Minister spent all his energy fighting this election on hatred, even if the consequence of this approach is that the safety of regular everyday citizens of Delhi has been put at risk.

The BJP tried to tilt this election by inflaming people rather than by talking about “work” (as AAP has done). Shah has been too busy to notice that while the BJP has been flinging lit matches to create a fire in Delhi, it is his home, ie, the Home Ministry, that has lost most. However, when all the din and noise finally settles on February 11, the damage done to his prestigious post will be lost on no one.

4,07-2-20,Policing lessons,"EC raps Delhi cop for controversial remarks on shooter as the force stands trapped between its image and Govt mandate

The Delhi Police is indeed in a Catch-22 situation. At one end, it has to listen to its political masters and demonstrably act in a manner that suits their political narrative, as is its wont. On the other, its pliancy in handling protests and dissent — sometimes as an unsparing oppressor and sometimes as a silent observer — is costing its image. And that had been built over long years of professionalism, one that made it a force to be emulated and trusted. Today, in a polarised society, where there are daily encounters between an aggressive establishment and an unrelenting dissent, its credibility has been the worst casualty. So it comes as no surprise that the Election Commission has been issuing demarches against it. On Sunday, the poll panel removed the deputy commissioner of police, South-East Delhi, Chinmoy Biswal, after two firing incidents were reported from Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia University amid protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). This was for allowing the situation to drift out of hand. Now it has ordered the Delhi Police not to assign officer Rajesh Deo any poll-related duty for making controversial statements that the shooter of Shaheen Bagh was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a claim confidently run down by the boy’s family, who said that he had sympathies for the BJP instead. Clearly, here the police found itself in a pickle for jumping the gun and, through selective briefings, appeared to take sides in a routine propaganda war. Sometimes, the forces themselves have not been too happy with the way they have been used as executors and even punished for doing their job. One is reminded of the thousands of personnel who held an unprecedented 11-hour protest at the gates of the police headquarters, demanding action against lawyers who allegedly attacked their colleagues at the Tis Hazari Court some time ago. The problem is that successive regimes have tried to mould the police to translate their authority on the ground and ensure mass subservience through fear. Still, there was some remnant of character in the institution’s leadership. Now even that is not allowed or cut to size. The politicisation of the police is not new or peculiar to Delhi. The State police forces have been known to change colour with every regime change. In this respect, the UP police has acquired the distinction of being more loyal than the king over the years, a behavioural discipline that explains its current bias towards a particular faith and arresting its practitioners during the anti-CAA agitation. And if the political establishment gives an open-ended licence with vengeful rhetoric, then the consequent police action is but a corollary of this endorsement. Within the first one-and-a-half years of assuming power, the Yogi Adityanath Government had earned the dubious distinction of recording 67 deaths in 1,500 police encounters. The UP police, one of the most decorated and prized in the immediate years after Independence, is a classic case of how politics can ruin abilities and rectitude. Emergency did greater harm to the institution countrywide. Through regimes, a caste and communal orientation was also given to an institution born of a colonial legacy that taught compliance. This has completely lowered the status of the police.

Does that mean that the police forces are so compromised that they cannot ensure tenets of justice or do what they are mandated to do by the Constitution, namely maintain law and order and look after public interests? The job of the police is to prevent subversion of civic life, not abet conditions that challenge it. Policemen are trained to handle crowds, not mishandle the situation, ensure minimal use of force but maximum enforcement of discipline. Even when crowd behaviour goes out of hand, no authority or political master can hold personnel to account for containing an explosive situation, for they are empowered to prevent anarchy of any sort. Why do we need the police if not to stand apart with its split second judgment and sensitivity, one that knows how to deal with an angry people and grade responses as situations evolve? The job of the police is to restore normalcy. Neither should it try to colour its actions with political logic, as some remarks made by policemen during protests have shown, nor should it be seen as using force to teach protesters a lesson. That restraint and assessment make a force stand apart no matter who is in Government. Perhaps, we need to relearn lessons for enforcement of law and order.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/policing-lessons-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/policing-lessons.html
5,07-2-20,Blowing cold and hot...,"The 2020 Auto Expo at Greater Noida has been a strange show. Chinese carmakers came with none of their executives but there were some homegrown surprises

Tata Motors has always put on a show at the Auto Expo thanks to their extensive range of commercial vehicles that they have always had the largest floor area at the Expo for years. The Auto Expo has been where their Chairman Emeritus, Ratan Tata has dropped some of the most significant cars in the Indian automotive history. The Tata Indica in 1998 and of course, the Tata Nano in 2004.

However, this year, nobody really expected Tata Motors to do all that much. Their big launch for the year, the Altroz had already been launched last month. But then again, never doubt the ability. Surprisingly, Tata revived a brand name that had been moribund for over a decade, the Sierra. Yes, India’s “original” Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) had been reimagined for the electric vehicle future and well, Tata Motors ace designer Pratap Bose thought it should become a mobile lounge of sorts.

Well, even Tata Motors executives admit that the Sierra won’t end up with polished wood floors and a lounge set-up, but well, the sliding door could stay. Yet, for some of us it was another car at the Tata Motors stand that caught the eye, the ‘HBX’ compact SUV. While that will wear another badge when it comes into production, this sub-compact SUV is almost certain to make it onto Indian roads in a slightly modified form by late 2020. And it is this sub-compact SUV segment, that is below four metres in length and the compact-SUV segment (between 4.2-4.4 metres in length) that saw the most action at the expo.

In addition to the Tata HBX concept and Kia’s Sonet concept, both sub-compacts gearing up to take on the market leaders, the Hyundai Venus and Maruti-Suzuki Vitara Brezza. Talking of the Brezza, it also got a refresh at the expo, now featuring Suzuki’s K15 engine with 103 horsepower, a mild hybrid system and a proper automatic gearbox. And Kia’s Sonet, while also a concept for now, is almost in final form according to Kia’s Global Design chief Karim Habib. The Sonet, which is almost certain to retain that name, is expected to hit Indian roads around the festive season. It is a smart-looking car and very likely will become a segment leader. Kia also revealed the price of the Carnival MPV, which has been priced at a very impressive range between Rs 25-34 lakh, the top Carnival model has garnered nearly 70 per cent of the 3,500 orders. Quite impressive!

The Volkswagen Group, now headlined by Skoda in India had a media night on the Monday before the start of the Expo but between Skoda and Volkswagen some pretty neat cars on display. Volkswagen showcased their 2021-bound Taigun Compact SUV alongside the longer T-Roc and the seven-seat variant of the Tiguan. Skoda showcased their Vision-IN concept which will form the basis of their upcoming Compact SUV, the Taigun and Vision-In based on the MQB-A0 platform form the basis of the Group’s ‘India 2.0’ strategy but one can question whether 2021 is going to be too late for any launch.

The Chinese were also at the Expo in force, between MG Motor, the brand used by Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corporation (SAIC) showcasing several exciting new models including their full size SUV the Gloster. But the real surprise was Great Wall Motors, the Chinese manufacturer that has just bought the General Motors factory in Talegaon. They showcased the entirety of their range including several Haval brand SUV’s. Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus outbreak most executives from the Chinese operation could not make it to India for the show. That and the fact that manufacturers like Audi, BMW, Ford and Honda staying away as well as all of India’s top two wheeler companies made the Expo have a slightly cold feel about it.

6,07-2-20,An economic epidemic,"The Coronavirus has not only dented the Chinese economy but has had a cascading impact everywhere

The world is a global village and our economies are inextricably and inexorably linked to each other. So make no mistake, the economic costs of a pandemic, like the one the world is facing right now due to the Coronavirus outbreak, are huge, not just for China but for the world economy at large. Economists have estimated the annual losses from outbreaks such as that of the Coronavirus to be around $500 billion or 0.6 per cent of the global income, both in terms of lost income and the loss of human capital due to large-scale fatalities. A 2016 study by the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that disease outbreaks would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century, which comes to over $60 billion per year. The scary part is that we are just getting started because the impact of the contagion is deepening. To begin with, global stock markets have taken a hit and are lower than they were two weeks ago with shares of industrial commodities plunging because China is a major buyer. Shares of airlines and hotels tanked over fears of travel disruptions as did those of luxury and consumer goods. Several overseas airlines have stopped flights, hotel chains have been offering refunds while global retailers like Ikea and Starbucks have shut shop.

Disruptions in international supply chains are set to deepen as China is an important supplier for the global motor industry, the electronics sector, mobile phones and computer firms. In fact, Hyundai has already suspended production because of problems with the supply of parts from China. Copper, an important material for the construction industry, is also cheaper by about 13 per cent, which will hit emerging and developing economies like India as they are its biggest supplier. Crude oil is also at its lowest level in more than a year and dropped by 15 per cent in the last two weeks due to the fall in demand from China. Not just this, the organisers of the Tokyo Olympics are a worried lot with just a few months to go and so are those of the Milan Fashion Week as Chinese fashion houses Angela Chen, Ricostru and Hui cancelled their runway turns. This is bad news as the Chinese are the world’s biggest buyers of high-end luxury goods. On the bright side, shares of pharmaceutical firms and medical devices rose as did the prices of gold as a safe asset. The Chinese virus has already slowed down the global growth rate by 0.2 per cent. India’s manufacturing sector, which is dependent on Chinese imports, needs to now really “make in India.”",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-economic-epidemic-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/an-economic-epidemic.html
7,07-2-20,DefExpo: Yogi promises bright future for youths,"Promising a bright future for youths working in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that over 35 lakh jobs would be thrown open in the state after projects taken up under DefExpo 2020 and Investors’ Summit took a final shape.

“Uttar Pradesh is a land of opportunities and provides immense possibilities and ways of investment. At the same time, this state will provide jobs to educated and skilled workers. In 2018, we organised Investors’ Summit in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced construction of defence manufacturing corridor. These two events will open up employment opportunities to 35 lakh people,” Yogi said while addressing a seminar organised by UPEIDA and FICCI at DefExpo 2020 here on Thursday.

Yogi said that industrialists could succeed in making India self-dependent in defence production and also help develop their business and the state.

“Our policy is much better than of other states and it will attract investment here,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that what made UP important was that the Eastern and Western dedicated freight corridors passed through the state.

“The junction of the two is at Burari (UP) and investors who invest here would definitely benefit from it. We will develop 17 cities as ‘Smart and Safe Cities’ in UP. In these, integrated command and control centres will be established and there will be huge investment possibilities,” he said.

Yogi further said that if an industrial institution had to prove itself, then there were immense opportunities for it too.

“Road connectivity of the state is very good because of its direct connectivity to the national capital and it is also connected with the world by air,” he said.

Yogi said the UP government was developing infrastructure facilities in the state at a fast pace.

“Expressways are being constructed on a large scale. Presently, work on Purvanchal Expressway is in progress and it will become operational by the year end. In addition, work on Bundelkhand Expressway will be started from February. Also, survey for Ganga Expressway from Meerut to Prayagraj has been completed and construction will begin by the end of this year,” the chief minister said.

Speaking on the occasion, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that UP would play an important role in fulfilling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of making the country a $ 5-trillion economy.

“Uttar Pradesh is steadily moving on the path of development. Rail, air and road connectivity has improved here and single window system is working better in the state,” he said.

The defence minister said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was working as an able captain, so investors would no longer face difficulties in UP.

“India will be established as the third major economic power in the world by 2023 under Prime Minister Modi and UP will contribute significantly to it,” Singh stressed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/defexpo--yogi-promises-bright-future-for-youths.html
8,07-2-20,"Dhindsas to challenge Akalis, plan rally at Sangur","The Dhindsas have decided to challenge the Akalis on the same ground from which the foundation of their expulsion was laid.

Within a week after the Dhindsa father-son duo was thrown out of the Akali Dal by dubbing it as the “decision of the masses” taken in the party rally at Sangrur—the bastion of Dhindsas, the Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Parminder Singh Dhindsa have decided to hold a massive rally at the same place to challenge the Badals.

For the same, and to further garner the support in his favour, the Dhindsas are working along with the Akali Dal’s Taksali faction which has the former SAD leaders Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Ratan Singh Ajnala, Sewa Singh Sekhwan, among others.

Unhappy with the party’s functioning and the current leadership, the traditional Akali leaders raised a banner of revolt against the SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s leadership and the party’s dented image following the allegations of sacrilege incidents, pardon to Dera chief, among others.

SAD’s “disgruntled” old guard also opposed and gave a call to free the party from the rule of a single family — the Badals. However, they were eventually shown the door out of the party.

SAD’s senior leader Daljit Singh Cheema said that the decision regarding their expulsion was taken by the people at the SAD’s rally at Sangrur and the core committee had only gave its stamp of approval.

Notably, the five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who has been out of state’s political scene ever since the SAD-BJP combine lost the power after 2017 state assembly polls, came out of hibernation to take on the Dhindsas’ attack against his son.

Badal, the SAD patron, did not campaigned aggressively during 2019 parliamentary elections, limiting himself to Bathinda — home constituency of his daughter-in-law Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Then he also did not attend the party event to mark SAD’s 99th foundation day. But, he turned up at Sangrur rally to counter the attack of his once party colleague.

Now with the Akali Dal finally expelling the father-son duo from the party’s primary membership, the Dhindsas are working mutually with the SAD Taksali, gaining support in all regions of the state.

Taksalis already enjoys respectable hold in Majha with the top leaders hailing from the same region. Dhindsas, who are strengthening its support base in Malwa region of which Sangrur is the part, are also working on the SAD’s “disgruntled elements” to muster support in the region.

It has been learnt that a meeting would be held next week to further put in order all the efforts to give it a final shape, and strengthen the Taksali faction ahead the 2022 polls. Strategy could also be devised in relation to the impending elections to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).

Notably, during 2007 and 2012 assembly elections, Doaba played a crucial role in forming SAD-BJP coalition Governments. During 2017 elections, SAD faced a massive defeat in Malwa and Majha, and got just five seats in Doaba. From entire Malwa region, only nine candidates could win, and Majha has Bikram Singh Majithia as the only winner.

Now, SAD has four MLAs from Doaba after it lost Shahkot assembly segment in bypolls following the death of SAD MLA Ajit Singh Kohar.

Sources in SAD Taksali maintained that the party’s functioning would now be more organized and soon a rally would be organized, along with the Dhindsas, in Sangrur to official declare a war against the Badals.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dhindsas-to-challenge-akalis--plan-rally-at-sangur.html

17,07-2-20,HAL gets modification document from DGCA for upgraded Dornier-228,"Two days after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath declared that the Uttar Pradesh government would purchase Dornier civil aircraft, the HAL on Thursday received the modification document from Director General of Civil Aviation for its Dornier-228 civil aircraft.

The document was handed over to state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd by DGCA Joint Director General G Rajshekhar during the ongoing DefExpo-2020 in Lucknow.

Two civil Do-228 aircraft were produced by the aeronautical agency for launch under regional connectivity scheme UDAN. But to meet the prospective operator’s requirement of a transport aircraft flyable under commercial pilot licence, their maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) had to be reduced from 6,200kg.

The HAL said in a statement on Thursday that its engineers undertook efforts to reduce the weight below 5,700 kg.

“Besides, HAL Do-228-201 (Upgraded) civil aircraft would also be equipped with a digital cockpit to ensure accurate readings, precise information and ergonomic data displays with feedback loops and capability for self-check to alert pilot in emergencies,” the HAL statement further stated.

The glass cockpit architecture-enabled aircraft will be the most sought-after ‘new age aviation technology’, it added.

Also, the incorporation of civil-certified turboprop minus 10 engine ensures more reliable torque sensing system, higher component life, lighter weight and higher time between overhaul as compared to previous minus 5 engine.

“The integration of five blade propeller to the aircraft would significantly reduce noise levels, aid faster engine start, less lubrication and better damping characteristics,” said the statement issued by the HAL.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hal-gets-modification-document-from-dgca-for-upgraded-dornier-228.html

21,07-2-20,Release data of 11L jobs given to youth as promised by CM: SAD,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday asked Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to prove his claim of providing 11 lakh jobs given to youth or apologize to them.

“After the lies and theatrics in Delhi, the youth of Punjab are waiting with baited breath for Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to release the data of 11 lakh jobs given to the youngsters by the Congress Government in Punjab,” said senior SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal.

He said: “Now that the Chief Minister has recuperated sufficiently after a day’s campaign in Delhi, he should release the data of 11 lakh jobs which have been given to youth in Punjab so that he could be felicitated appropriately. If he cannot do this, he should apologize to the youth and Punjabis for mouthing lies in Delhi for petty political gains.”

Giving details, the SAD leader said , “It is a fact that after farmers, the youth have also got demoralized by the CM’s failure to fulfill the Ghar Ghar Naukari promise and some of them have even starting to take their lives in despair”.

“Forget creating new jobs, the Government has failed to fill up more than 50,000 vacancies which have been created in the last three years,” he said adding that the Government has also refused to regularize 27,000 contractual employees.

Regarding placement drives of private technical institutions which had been appropriated by the Government, Grewal said, “Youth have started boycotting the Rozgar Melas of the Congress Government because they are being offered jobs even below the prescribed daily wage. There have been instances where not one youth has come forward to participate in the Rozgar Melas,” he added.

Stating that the Chief Minister could not get away with this deceit, Grewal asked Capt Amarinder to disclose why his Government had failed to implement the Rs 2,500 per month unemployment allowance which had been promised to youth while campaigning in Delhi.

“You even denied central scholarship funds to scheduled castes for more than a year. In your dispensation school girls are being denied cycles and students even winter uniform,” he added.

Stating that the chief minister should not shy away from Punjabis and also share his “achievements” with them, Grewal said that it was sad that Capt Amarinder had chosen to befool the people of Delhi with outlandish statements.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/release-data-of-11l-jobs-given-to-youth-as-promised-by-cm--sad.html

41,07-2-20,Railway allocation disheartens north Odisha,"Intellectuals, elected representatives and general Public of north Odisha are disappointed with the railway allocations made for the State as they don’t include any new project for their region or any fund allocated for pending projects.

The two proposed projects, Digha-Jaleswar rail route and the Bangiriposhi-Gorumahisani, of north Odisha have been pushed to the cold storage again, despite completion of surveys.

While the Jaleswar-Digha rail line proposal was approved in 2009-10, no expenditure outlay is made till date. This route would boost the tourism, besides trade and commerce of the region.

The Bangiriposhi-Gorumahisani and Tata rail line of Mayurbhanj district has faced the same fate. Although survey and land acquisition for the said project is completed, it is yet to see the light of the day due to lack of funds.

When completed, this project would connect Baripada and Tata and Delhi by lessening travel period by a few hours.

Despite assurances by the railway authorities a number of time, running of a passenger train between Baleswar and tribal-infested Nilgiri has not materialised yet. There is no mention of train between Baleswar and Nilgiri in the current budget too.

It may be noted that during his period as MP from 2009 to 2014, Srikant Jena had taken a lot of initiatives for running a passenger train on rotation. Even, the then Railway Minister, during his visit to Baleswar, had promised to fulfil the longstanding demand.

It is pertinent to mention here that current Union Minister Pratap Sarangi belongs to Nilgiri.

“North Odisha is grossly neglected in the Union Budget for railway. Due to neglect and apathy of the Central Government, the region couldn’t progress to the expectations,” said Senior Citizen Forum secretary Laxmidhar Behera.

Expressing unhappiness, former MP RK Jena said, “Two important proposals, a freight corridor connecting Kharagpur and Vijayawada and the Digha-Chandaneshwar-Baliapal-Basta-Rupsa-Bangritosi-Baripada-Tatanagar rail corridor, were accepted by the Railway Ministry during my period. Sadly, no allocation is made for these two projects.”

“We expect some allocations for pending projects of north Odisha in the upcoming Supplementary Budget,” said Jena.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/railway-allocation-disheartens-north-odisha.html

Hearing the cries, neighbours of the family reached the spot and rushed the injured to the Bandhamunda Railway Hospital. But after condition of Nagendra and his family members turned critical, they were shifted to the IGH here.

The injured were identified as a Railway Engineering Department employee Nagendra Pandey, wife Sangeeta, younger brother Bidyakanta and mother Sulochana .

Five months back, the accused youth Santosh Sonee, who has a jewellery shop in the area, encroached upon the land of Nagendra and began constructing his house. When Nagendra opposed Santosh’s move, a dispute erupted between them. But after mediation of locals, Nagendra and Santosh reached an amicable settlement.

It could help a city gain its Ease of Living (EOL) status and a citizen can administer it both online and offline.

To facilitate an awareness among the citizens of Bhubaneswar, which has already got the distinction of topping the Smart City Challenge in the past, Bhubaneswar Smart City Limited (BSCL) CEO and Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary on Thursday urged the public to go for the citizens perception survey and rate the city as it has a plethora of services which are of the best quality across the nation.

The survey, which has already started on February 1, would continue till February 29 and a citizen can go and click at the link http://eol2019.org/Citizenfeedback to submit the ratings. During the process the citizen has to fill his/her name, phone number and click one of the several answers given in the choice to rate their city’s facilities and services.

The all-India EOL survey, which is to be implemented across all 100 Smart Cities will ultimately map how our city stands as a urban settlement to provide a decent quality of life for all.

46,07-2-20,Panchayat polls a survival challenge for State Cong,"The deadly fall of the Congress vote share to below 20 per cent level in 2019 was a surprise to the party leaders in Odisha. The BJP succeeded in pushing the Congress to the third position in the State to become the second player. Interestingly, when the survival fight was going on between the Congress and the BJP, the BJD managed to re-occupy its voters’ space of 2014 election and retain its first position. The Congress got further marginalised later, in Patakura and Bijepur by-polls. Such a steep electoral decline of the party raises doubts on its rapid revival.

Since Independence, the Congress was in State power several times such as during 1947-67,1972-77, 1980-90 and 1995-2000. However, the party has been losing elections steadily since 2000. From its Assembly strength of 26 in 2000, the party had reached an Assembly strength of 9 in the last election. The birth and the growth of the regional party, BJD, since the 1998 Parliament elections, has been the key factor for the marginalisation of the Congress in Odisha. The BJD, the new version of the erstwhile sole anti-Congress party, the Janata Dal, took over the State by surprise in 2000 Assembly election, trouncing the ruling Congress and has been continuing since then.

The grand old party thus settled with the LoP status in the Assembly since 2000. The 2019 poll sadly stripped off the LoP status from the Congress party and offered it to the BJP.

The second challenge to the Congress in Odisha has been the BJP. The BJP could not stand before the mighty Congress and the giant Janata Dal during the 1980-2000 period.

The party suddenly rose to the 2nd power position in the State after the 2000 election when it became the junior partner to the BJD-BJP alliance Government. The BJP lost electoral strength again in the State in 2009 election, after the fall of the alliance. The BJP could not recover from the fall in 2014 election. However, the BJP began to revive in the State after 2014.

The third reason for the repetitive electoral debacle of the Congress since 2000 is the perpetuation of factionalism in the State unit which led to leg pulling of the successive PCC presidents, suspension and defection of important leaders and conspiracy to defeat important candidates. One such victim was former Congress MP and BJD MLA Soumya Ranjan Patnaik. He was a PCC president material but was suspended from the party just before the 2014 election due to alleged conspiracy. It damaged the image of the party before the poll. Another leader who was the LoP in the State Assembly, Bhupinder Singh, left the party before 2014 poll, feeling neglected. Defection and suspension of senior leaders continued unabated till 2019 general elections.

In fact, the party failed to create an effective State leadership after the three-time former CM late JB Patnaik, left Odisha to assume Assam Governor’s job . Some consider it to be the suicidal decision of the party so far as the State electoral prospect is concerned. To fill up the gap, the party experimented with age, caste, region, factional-groups etc. criteria to choose a capable State leader, but in vain.

While the Congress had been continuously losing its booth level strength and the constituency leaders, it also became financially weaker day by day. During the UPA’s time, the Odia Ministers did not spend money in the State to revive the party. After 2014, when the Congress lost polls and the BJP assumed power in Delhi, its Odia Ministers invested money to strengthen the State BJP. Thus the BJP grew faster during 2014-2019 period. The Congress had no effective strategy to counter the financially strong BJD and the BJP.

No political success or failure is permanent for a party in a democracy. The BJP has already chosen its State president for Odisha and the district presidents and has begun the preparation to fight the 2020 -urban and 2022 panchayat polls. On the other hand, the Congress High -Command has asked the OPCC president to continue in his role though the later had resigned after the last poll debacle. The party might face the 2022 panchayat poll under a new State- leader. It is left to the party High Command to either perpetuate the incumbent OPCC chief or choose a leader from the first generation group such as Rama Chandra Khuntia, Bhakta Das, Narasingha Mishra, Sarat Pattanayak and so on or from the second generation such as Pradeep Majhi, Prasad Harichandan, Chiranjib Biswal, Tara Prasad Bahinipati, etc., or from the third generation like Mohammed Moquim, Saptagiri Ulaka and so on. It might examine the regional, caste and age criteria.

The party has to find a leader who shall be able to harmonise different factions, run team work, provide minimum finance to run the party, move to 147 Assembly constituencies, create booth organisations and lead mass movements against the misrule of the State and the Union Governments.

The Congress should also learn from the two models of Barabati-Cuttack and Khariar Assembly seats where the voters have chosen the party in 2019 poll after decades. As demanded by a section, Barabati-Cuttack MLA ,Mohammed Moquim, may be given the party’s State leadership responsibility if the party chooses a third generation leader.

However, only leadership change may not help the party without massive reforms. Assembly constituency-level leadership development, including bringing back some of the dropped- out leaders shall be useful. Money-based reform models may not help, as trust- deficit of the voters and the cadres have become the current challenge for the State unit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/panchayat-polls-a-survival-challenge-for-state-cong.html
47,07-2-20,"Rly share less by Rs 220 cr in State, BJD raises concern","The ruling BJD, of late, raised concerns on Thursday over the reduction in the overall 2020-21 Budget allocations for railway projects in the State.

BJD national spokesperson Sasmit Patra said, “The reduction in the overall allocation for the State is a cause of serious concern as Odisha remains one of the least rail-coverage States in the country despite the State contributing maximum revenue.”

He expressed disappointment as no new railway project has been introduced in sectors that were suggested by the State Government with a commitment to share cost.

“We expected to get sanction for projects like Puri-Konark; Bargarh-Nuapada; Jajpur-Aradi-Dhamra; Chakulia-Buramara, Gunupur-Therubali (new line) where State has committed assistance,” he said.

The BJD spokesperson, however, welcomed the proposed Gopalpur-Sambalpur line and said, “This will be a big economic booster to the area if executed in time.”

Patra also welcomed introduction of more Tejas-type trains and expected that more numbers of such trains would be introduced in the State as well. He suggested that the Railways improve their expenditure and track record in completion of the delayed projects.

The Centre has allocated Rs 4,373 crore for 2020-21 against Rs 5,993 crore, including NTPC’s Rs 1,400 crore for the Jharsuguda-Barpalli coal corridor. As the NTPC-assisted project has been completed, the State would actually get Rs 220 crore less amount this time compared to last year.

Though the Railways earns more than Rs 10,000 crore from the State annually, the allocation continued to remain less than Rs 5,000 crore.

Congress MLA Suresh Kumar Routray criticised the Centre for less allocation in the railway sector in Odisha.

“The East Coast Railway is earning the highest amount of revenue from Odisha. But the Union Government is providing a very dismal amount to the State. The allocated funds are also not being untilsed,” alleged Routray.

However, BJP State president Samir Mohanty was prompt to react over the railway allocation and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for it. “So far, the Modi Government has allocated Rs 29,121 crore for Odisha,” he said. Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also praised the Prime Minister and the Union Railway Minister for the “better” allocation for the State.

An official said that all projects in Odisha have got more allocations for 2020-21 compared to the last year. Apart from projects, Rs 1,165 crore has been sanctioned to enhance safety of people by constructing road over bridge (ROBs) and road under-bridges (RUBs).

Former Union Minister Srikant Jena expressed unhappiness saying the State is getting an amount between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 3,000 crore even as it gives over Rs 20,000 crore to the Railways every year.

“While no new railway line has been sanctioned for Odisha, paltry allocations have been made for pending projects. Our money is being utilized for development of railway infrastructure and we have been neglected,” Jena alleged. He demanded that the Railways establish medical colleges at Rayagada and Keonjhar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rly-share-less-by-rs-220-cr-in-state--bjd-raises-concern.html

54,07-2-20,MLA accuses Min of facilitating land grabbing,"Not long after the differences between two MLAs from Haridwar district were resolved, another controversy has erupted between two MLAs of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haridwar district. The Haridwar Rural MLA from the BJP, Swami Yatishwaranand has accused Cabinet Minister Madan Kaushik of being involved with those indulging in property grab.

He leveled this allegation regarding the case of Gurukul College where members of the rival sides confronted each other over the possession of the property. Yatishwaranand sat on a hunger strike along with his supporters in protest against the alleged occupation on Thursday. Cabinet Minister Madan Kaushik has been accused by Yatishwaranand of grabbing the assets of the Ashrams in Haridwar. Yatishwarananda alleged that Kaushik is shielding those involved in the scholarship scam, land mafia elements and other criminal elements. Yatishwaranand said that he was busy in the election programme in Delhi for the last three days.

Taking advantage of this situation, some allegedly anti-social elements broke the lock and took possession of the property in Gurukul college.

On the other hand, those accused by the Haridwar Rural MLA state that he had been removed from the governing body of the institution for his anti-institution activities. They allege that he is trying to usurp the property himself and leveling hollow and false charges.

Yatiswaranand alleges that only after getting the protection of Madan Kaushik, the people of the other party broke the locks in his absence and occupied the office of the institution.

People on the other side say that Swami Yatishwaranand was expelled in 2018 due to anti-institution activities. Both sides are accusing each other of causing controversy over land grab.

55,07-2-20,Candid Notes,"Imitator leader

Once considered a strong pillar of Harish Rawat camp, Pritam Singh drifted apart from his leader ever since he was handed over the reins of Congress party in the Himalayan state. He also tied up with Indira Hridayesh to pose a challenge to the powerful faction in the party led by Rawat but the stature and style of the former CM always outmanoeuvres him. At times it appears that despite all his efforts to tread a separate line in the politics of the state, Pritam Singh follows Rawat in whatever he does. Most recently the former CM was seen with the anti CAA protesters in Dehradun, attended the protest of the Aganwadi workers and followed it up with meeting CM, TSR on these issues. These visits forced a laid back Pritam Singh into action and toeing the line of Harish Rawat, he attended the exactly same protests where Rawat had gone a day earlier and also met the CM. It is amply clear that despite his utterances to take a break from politics of the state, Harish Rawat keeps plunging himself into the issues of the state and sets tempo for his detractors within the party and outside it.

Saffron Babu

An officer of education department has become so excited on being appointed head of the Sanskrit education in the state that he has changed his entire getup. Instead of the normal office attire, the Babu has started wearing Dhoti, Kurta, a necklace of Rudraksh and applies a large round vermilion Bindi on his forehead. For those who bear testimony to the no nonsense approach of the officer in his long career, the new avatar is not only striking but is also raising questions on the motive behind this image makeover. The talks going on in the department suggest that by donning saffron, the Babu is out to impress the political dispensation of the Himalayan state which incidentally is also of the same hue. His new avatar is also being linked with his post retirement plans. However, it appears that the minister of the department who unsuccessfully tried to enforce a dress code on the teachers of government schools is pleased to see the Babu in the colour of his liking.

Wise decision

An officer recently handed over the responsibility of the department concerned with the administration of the state secretariat has impressed with his decision to purchase new furniture for various offices of state secretariat from the workshop of Dehradun jail. Apart from being less costly, the new wooden chairs would also help in correcting the sitting postures of the Babus and prevent them falling prey to the agonising backache. It has been proved that the revolving chairs made up of non wooden material which have become part of office furniture nowadays have taken a toll on health of those using them. By purchasing furniture manufactured by the inmates of the jail, the officer has also closed the path of any shoddy business in the deal. In another decision which is equally praiseworthy, the officer is planning to install new computers in the offices and hand over the old systems to the education department for being used in the government schools of girls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-02-07.html

The Congress leader has written a letter to the Director General (DG) of Uttarakhand police, Anil Kumar Raturi on the issue. He said that it is surprising that the SIT is yet to take any action on the accused of scholarship scam even as the Uttarakhand High Court (HC) has rejected their anticipatory bail. The SIT has filed the case against these accused in the scholarship scam but is dithering to arrest them. Dhasmana claimed that the SIT is under pressure of the influential people in the case. He said that the biggest example of this pressure on the SIT is exhibited in the case involving son of BJP MLA from Dehradun cantonment, Harbans Kapoor. Dhasmana said that a case has been registered against son of the BJP MLA and his request to order stay on his arrest has been turned down by the Uttarakhand HC.

57,07-2-20,Harish Rawat backs protesting e-rickshaw drivers,"Former Chief Minister and senior Congress leader, Harish Rawat came out in support of the protesting members of Devbhumi E-Rickshaw Owner and Driver Welfare Society. Addressing the media at the protest site, Rawat said that restrictions imposed on e-rickshaw drivers by the administration will surely prove very detrimental to the interests of the drivers.

According to Rawat, “The restrictions on the e-rickshaw drivers are destroying their families and the kind of restrictions imposed by the government on these poor drivers will surely prove seriously detrimental to them. I have come here because of my sympathy and concern for these drivers. I have also talked to officials regarding this matter.” While addressing the protesting drivers at the protest site, Rawat said that if the decision will not be taken in the favour of the drivers, the whole Congress party will come out in their support. “Harish Rawat told us that he has talked to Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Traffic, Kewal Khurana and asked us to meet the DIG.

We have been given time to meet him on Saturday. Rawat has assured us that if the imposed restrictions are not lifted, his whole party will support us in our protest”, said the district president of Devbhoomi E-Rickshaw Owner and Driver Welfare Society Ravindra Tyagi.

On Thursday afternoon, some e-rickshaw drivers also started begging at the protest site and later on the nearby road to demonstrate their helplessness. According to one of the drivers Mohan Sharma, “We cannot feed our families by driving and picking passengers from lanes or colonies. By restricting our entry on main roads, the government wants us to either die from hunger or beg on the roads, so we are just practising for that day to come because if the government will not change its attitude, we’ll certainly be forced to beg for our children.”

Another driver Sewak Kumar added, “We hardly earn Rs 300 per day and we are fined with Rs 2,000 if we mistakenly enter into a no-entry zone for e-rickshaws.

Talking to The Pioneer, Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said that MCD has given its response to UEPPCB concerning the management of the plant in Sheeshambada. The board has been informed about the status of works and procedures being observed at the plant.

It will be recalled that the protest of the locals at Sheeshambada pertaining to the improper management of garbage has been going on for more than two months. When few locals gheraoed chief environment officer Sudarshan S Pal on Monday and raised questions about the dumping of the garbage by MCD without No Objection Certificate (NOC), he had informed the locals that a notice had been issued to the MCD by the board on February 1 to which the MCD had been asked to respond within fifteen days.

Last month the leachate treatment plant was also set up to treat the leachate generated in the plant and according to municipal commissioner enzymes are sprayed six times a day to sterilise the area.

However, locals state that it is making no difference to the situation in the area, and in fact, the chemicals used to disinfect the area are more harmful to the environment. According to one of the residents Satpal Dhani, “The dirty water generated from the waste management plant is still overflowing and being discharged outside the plant which has amplified the chances of water pollution in the area as the filthy water is mixing with the groundwater.”

It is pertinent to mention here that the locals are consistently alleging that the improper treatment of garbage is leading to various health issues among the residents of Sheeshambada and therefore they want MCD to shift the plant elsewhere or to completely shut it off. However, MCD officials have refuted the claims.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-submits-response-to-ueppcb-notice.html

Shah rana hectic schedule during the poll campaign and capped it with a massive road show in Muslim dominated Seelampur area.

Addressing three roadshows, he asserted that the BJP would emerge victorious in the elections as people will vote for country’s security, development and good governance.

Amid chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ at his roadshow in Hari Nagar, a group also raised goli maro slogans. However, policemen asked them to stop.

“Shaheen Bagh is the joint venture of the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress. Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi are worried that Shaheen Bagh should not be discussed. I want to ask them why the security of the country should not be an electoral issue? Why are the people sitting in Shaheen Bagh demanding ‘Jinnah Wali Azadi’ and why the tukde-tukde gang is supporting them?

“Shame on these people. I want to tell all of you that tukde-tukde gang is going to get a shock, because you are going to press the button on the lotus symbol on February 8 for the development of Delhi and the country,” he said at a road show in Seemapuri constituency in North East Delhi.

Later addressing a road show in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar constituency, seeking votes for party candidate Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, Shah said, “Remember that a year ago, there was a terrorist attack in Pulwama and our forces took revenge by conducting an air strike.

“You all know that the people of Delhi as well as the whole nation was saluting the valor of the army, but do you know who was the most sad. First Rahul Gandhi, second Arvind Kejriwal and third was Imran Khan sitting in Pakistan”.

Shah said Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi and Imran Khan had a problem with the surgical strikes. “All three had a problem with the surgical strikes. I want to ask whether such people should be handed over the power in Delhi? These people are very dangerous for the security of the nation.

“On the other hand, the central government is constantly working for the public interest, providing housing, gas connections and basic facilities to the people,” he said.

Addressing public meetings in Adrash Nagar, Tri Nagar and Jangpura, BJP’s National president JP Nadda said that this election is dedicated to clean, healthy, beautiful safe and developed Delhi.

69,07-2-20,Jharkhand-origin settlers are ‘lesser tribal’ in Assam,"At least 50 lakh members of the tribal community in Jharkhand have been sandwiched between Bodoland movement and Government’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) push in unrest-hit Assam, tribal rights activists have said. These tribal families were taken to the northeastern state as bonded labourers for the tea estates by British companies during the pre-independence era and have settled there since then sans the Scheduled Tribe status.

“Neither are they considered tribals in Assam, nor Assamese. They are fighting for their existence and it is getting difficult for them by the day as the Government has even made it clear that non-tribal people cannot live on tribal land in Assam anymore,” said Salkhan Murmu, a former two-time MP from Jharkhand.

Albret Kongari, 32, a Jharkhandi tribal living in Assam’s Dibrugarh since birth, said that Jharkhandi tribals are not allowed to visit Bodo territories in Assam. “We also do not have ST status, because of which we do not get reservation in jobs and rights over land,” he said. However, Kongari and his family have not been affected by the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Our documents have been verified and all my family members have made it to the NRC,” he said.

Murmu has written a letter to President Ramnath Kovind asking him to intervene in the matter and ensure the status of Scheduled Tribe to the Jharkhandi tribals living in Assam. “When the country is opening its doors for members of Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian communities facing religious persecution in neighbouring countries, why not give Jharkhandi tribals their rights in Assam?” said Murmu.

The Bodo Peace Accord signed on January 27 has no mention of Jharkhandi tribals, Murmu added.

The Accord brings an end to militancy in the name of Bodo land and gives special privileges to Bodo tribe of Assam, which forms about 6 per cent of the total population in the State. “The 50 lakh odd Jharkhandi tribals also need support of the Government. We can either give them tribal status in Assam or bring them to Jharkhand with ST status,” Murmu said.

Continued on Page 4

Murmu, in his letter to Kovind, has raised concern over the future of Jharkhandi tribals in Assam fearing that they might even lose their citizenship due to the implementation of NRC. However, a child rights activist working in Assam said that most of the Jharkhandi tribals in Assam were included in the NRC as they have been working in the tea estates there for more than a century and have necessary documents. The Jharkhand tribals there fall in minorities and Other Backward Classes (MOBC) category.

Former member of the Tribal Advisory Council , Ratan Tirkey, said that giving tribal status to Jharkhandi settlers in Assam has been a long-pending demand. “Santhali and Oraon tribes have been residing in Assam for more than 150 years now. Despite Oraons and Santhalis getting tribal status across India as per the constitution, they are considered non-tribals in Assam,” Tirkey said.

He said that the members of the Jharkhandi tribal community in Assam easily outnumber the Bodo tribe members in Assam, and Jharkhandi tribals have also played a pivotal role in developing the northeastern state. “In 1988, I had gone to Assam to meet Bodo leaders as they had declared around 600 villages Bodo area despite a sizeable population of Jharkhandi tribals in those villages,” said Tirkey, adding that not giving ST status to Jharkhandi tribals in Assam also served the political interests of some parties as Jharkhandis alone form a huge share of the vote bank in Assam.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jharkhand-origin-settlers-are----lesser-tribal----in-assam.html

“To establish the case, the police have presented circumstantial and forensic evidence, key among them being the gunpowder residue on Mahipal’s hand and on the car’s steering wheel, cellphone location of the accused and the victims, details of the phone call made by the accused to the judge and co-gunman after the incident and videos that viral on the social media, two eyewitnesses who had also shot the incident videos, dying declaration statement of Ritu, CCTV footage installed at the arcadia market, bullet cells of .38 revolver (weapon used in the crime) and bloodstains of the victim’s collected from the PSO’s uniform,” Hooda said. The wife of the judge succumbed to her injuries on October 13, while Dhruv was declared dead after ten days at the private hospital.

The entire incident was recorded by bystanders show the accused trying to haul Dhruv’s body into the white Honda City. Later he was arrested one and a half hours from Gurugram-Faridabad road.

The whole incident occurred in a span of 10 minutes and after committing the crime the SPO informed the judge about the crime. At that time during the probe, it came to fore that the gunman was facing matrimonial problems and was short-tempered. He was also running two cabs with a cab agitator company and was involved in many other things.

Police had also dismissed rumours that the accused was ill-treated by the judge or his relatives and also the reports that have reportedly claimed his conversion to Christianity. Officials said he was treated well and the judge treated him as a colleague.

Mahipal had been posted as Sharma’s PSO for one-and-a-half years and had no previous record of misconduct, police had said. Terming the case one of “cold-blooded murder”, police said that the incident occurred in the spur of the moment after Ritu and Dhruv rebuked Mahipal for being untraceable when they returned to their vehicle after shopping.

The charge sheet in the case had been filed on December 26, 2018, and charges were framed on January 9 last year. During the hearing, Mahipal claimed he was not guilty and requested a trial.

The SIT had submitted a 300-page charge sheet before the court on December 26, listing 64 witnesses, two eyewitnesses including the judge, Krishan Kant, and a fellow additional session’s judge.

A forensic report later confirmed that this sample matched with the gunpowder on the weapon that was used for the crime. Call details of the accused and victims show that all of them were present in the same place at the same time, the police said.

The case was filed on the complaint of Additional Session’s Judge (ASJ) Krishna Kant Sharma at Sector-50 police station.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pso-who-killed-judge---s-wife--son-found-guilty.html

The doctors claim that Ranvir Singh (age ,73 years), a resident of Rohtak district of Haryana had lost his vision in the year 1990 due to infection in both of his eyes.

A few years ago, he had undergone an eye surgery at a hospital in Rohtak, but it could retrieve his eye sight. The doctors at AIIMS Rishikesh used the technique of corneal transplant to restore his image that was lost years ago.

The head of department (HoD) of Ophthalmology, Dr S K Mittal said on examination, it was decided that corneal transplant in his right eye can result in restoration of eye sight.

The medical director of eye bank and a specialist in cornea transplantation, Dr Neeti Gupta said that due to corneal opacity and cataract he was not able to see. ""The team took the risk and did corneal transplant with cataract surgery and implanted intraocular lens in the same sitting and the team is also happy with the result. Some time ago, an eight year old girl from Haldwani, had also underwent a successful corneal transplanted in her right eye,'' she said. Dr Gupta added that during the last five months in AIIMS, 62 people have successfully undergone cornea transplant. Congratulating the doctors for the unique feat, the director of AIIMS, Rishikesh, Ravikant said that the old man, who has started seeing again after 30 years has been discharged from the hospital.

76,07-2-20,None in BJP worthy of becoming CM: Kejriwal,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said he was ready for a debate on all the issues, including the Shaheen Bagh protest, if the BJP declares its Chief Minister candidate. Hitting out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for “refusing” to debate, Kejriwal while referring ‘Gita’ said that a true Hindu can never run away and be scared of facing challenges.

Addressing the media, Kejriwal said that no one in the BJP is worthy of becoming the Chief Minister of Delhi. “I challenged the BJP to declare their CM candidate and for an open debate. The people of Delhi are scared that their vote might lead to someone like Sambit Patra as the CM of Delhi,” he said.

“I had invited Amit Shah Ji for an open debate on any issue concerning the people of Delhi but unfortunately he was not ready to have a debate with me and answer the questions of the people. “Today is the last day of the election campaign in Delhi. I want to congratulate the people of Delhi for changing the basis of politics in the country. It is time to transform politics and to establish a new form of politics based on work,” he said.

In the last 70 years, no party has ever asked for votes on the basis of work done by them and no government asked for votes on the basis of bringing transformation in education and health sectors,” he said, adding that his is for the first time, AAP is asking for votes on the ground of work done by it in the last five years. Kejriwal said that the BJP was designated with the responsibility of handling MCD, but they ensured that Delhi became the ‘garbage capital of India’, over the last 15 years.

“The people of Delhi gave them the responsibility of the Delhi Police but the grave law and order situation in Delhi is visible to all. Now, they have started denigrating our work by releasing misleading videos of government schools and mohalla clinics as they lack issues to discuss in the context of the capital,” he added.

Targeting the opposition, he said “Since their strategy of spreading lies did not work, they invited 200 MPs, 11 Chief Ministers and 70 Union Ministers to defeat a Chief Minister of a state but all of them have failed to make an impact.

“The politics of religion and corruption should be substituted by the politics of work. If we want to make India a 21st century nation, we need to build schools, hospitals, universities, construct roads and highways, conduct research and use scientific temper to design solutions to problems. This will take the country forward. Hindu-Muslim rants would not take the country forward,” he added.

Hitting back at the BJP for mocking him for reciting the Hanuman Chalisa on a show, Kejriwal said, “I request all BJP leaders to recite ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. It will grant a calm and peaceful mind and the tone and tenor of their speech will develop discipline and restraint. “I want to build a 21st century nation, where there are schools, hospitals, industries, employment, roads, transportation, science and technology and research. This will take the country forward. But by their Hindu-Muslim rants, they will take the country backward by 200 years,” he added.

Responding to a question regarding ED allegation against Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, Kejriwal said, “If this is true, why are they not arresting Sanjay Singh Ji? ED is acting as a mouthpiece of the BJP. It is also playing politics on the directions of the BJP and Amit Shah Ji.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/none-in-bjp-worthy-of-becoming-cm--kejriwal.html
77,07-2-20,"Sanjay accuses BJP of distributing cash, liquor","Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of distributing cash and liquor in some of the areas, AAP senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said the party has formed 272 teams in all the wards of Delhi to keep a track on such incidents and to deal with BJP’s political propaganda.

“We have received inputs that money and liquor are being distributed in some areas. Considering it, we have deployed teams equipped with cameras to record such incidents. Anyone who comes across such incidents can contact us on 9355015501,” he said.

Singh also said that the AAP has filed a complaint to the Election Commission regarding the news that many 240 BJP MPs are staying at different Assembly constituencies and demanded an action.

Referring to media reports, he said that BJP’s 240 MPs will be staying in different Assembly constituencies from February 4 to 8. This is gross violation of Model Code of Conduct as no MP and Cabinet Minister can stay in Delhi after election campaign ends unless he is a resident of Delhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sanjay-accuses-bjp-of-distributing-cash--liquor.html
78,07-2-20,"Cong may spring surprise, says Surjewala","Accusing the BJP and the AAP of spreading false propaganda, lies and using abusive language as campaigning for the February 8 polls closed on Thursday, people of Delhi will have an opportunity to reflect upon governance issues which will help Delhi transform into ‘Congress Wali Delhi’.

Senior party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said the Congress may spring a surprise in Delhi like it did in the elections in neighbouring Haryana last year.

“Some news channels were giving us just two seats in Haryana but we won 31. It is going to happen again,” he said. Terming the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, and the ruling AAP in Delhi as “Jhoothon ki Sarkar aur Jhoothon ke Sardar”, Surjewala accused them of failing in areas of health, pollution mitigation, education, clean drinking water supply and public transport in the national Capital.

Surjewala said that while Congress built 36 schools per year, AAP built only six per year while promised 500 new schools. “AAP promised regularization of guest teachers, but miserably failed them. There are 11000 vacancies yet to be filled.Congress added six universities; six deemed universities, 22 new colleges, 20 professional colleges, five ITI’s and 12 Polytechnic in its 15 years rule. Modi-Kejriwal duo has failed to add even a single university, college or institute,” he said.

“The Congress government increased the number of hospitals from 18 to 39 and the number of beds increased from 4000 to 12000, the number of doctors went up from 440 to 2400 and dispensaries increased from 180 to 550. Why is it that Modi ji or Kejriwal failed to add even one new hospital, he said.

The Congress leader also slammed Union Home Minister and BJP’s star campaigner Shah for his assertion that the party was going to win more than 45 seats in Delhi, Surjewala said “who told this to him - ‘Prabhu’ (god) or EVM (electronic voting machine)”.

He accused Shah of being a synonym for ‘dhong prapanch’ (hypocrisy) and said his attempts at electoral success in Delhi will fail as they did in Haryana and Maharashtra.

The Congress is contesting the elections in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), giving it four assembly seats. The Congress, which ruled Delhi for three terms in a row till 2013, drew a blank in the Assembly polls in 2015.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-may-spring-surprise--says-surjewala.html

80,07-2-20,"JVM expels Pradeep, inches closer to merger with BJP","The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) on Thursday expelled another legislator, Pradeep Yadav who could have been roadblock in party’s merger plan with BJP. Yadav, who represents Poreyahat Assembly constituency for around decade has remained with Babulal Marandi for most of his political career.

The expulsion of Yadav was announced by Abhay Kumar Singh the party’s principal general secretary, the post which Yadav was holding in party before the constitution of new working committee last month. Announcing the expulsion of Yadav from party, Singh said, “Pradeep Yadav has been expelled from party for anti-party activities. His activities were against party line. The party had issued him show cause notice for anti-party activities and he was given 48-hours to reply but even after completion of deadline no reply came from Yadav so he has been expelled from party.”

The show-cause was issued on the instruction of party president Babulal Marandi, who is said to be keen to merge his party in the BJP. In the recently held Assembly election, the JVM won three seats, Poreyahat, Mandar and Dhanwar the seat which Marandi represents in Assembly. Bandhu Tirkey representing Mandar has already been expelled from party for anti-party activities. Both Tirkey and Yadav are opposed to merger in the BJP and both are in touch with the Congress. Yadav and Tirkey had forced Marandi to extend support to the Hemant Soren-led government. Later, the JVM withdrew support to the government.

Yadav toeing the line of other opposition leaders against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), and National Register of Citizens (NRC) too has been questioned by party high command.

Yadav’s visit to New Delhi where he had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi along with Bandhu Tirkey too has been found unsavory with JVM leadership.

However, Yadav has challenged his expulsion from party. Yadav talking to media persons on Thursday said, “I have no information about my expulsion as I had not received any show cause notice from party high command.” Yadav fringed ignorance about Abhay Kumar Singh in JVM.

Yadav who has remained with Marandi for most of political career said, “The motive with which Babulal Marandi is executing entire exercise will not pay him results.

As per 10th schedule of Constitution for merger of any party with another party two third majority is needed and after the expulsion of two MLAs there is no power left with Marandi to take any decision about merger of party.”

Yadav has remained with Marandi both in good and bad times but in last few months differences between the two leaders have cropped up over merger with BJP.

Both Pradeep Yadav and Babulal Marandi come from RSS background. In 2000 when the separate State was carved out of Bihar with Babulal Marandi becoming first chief minister, Yadav was in Marandi’s Cabinet. Yadav, who has been representing Poreyahat for around two decades, left BJP in 2006 when Marandi formed his own party JVM (P).

However, most of the leaders who were with Marandi such as Ravindra Rai, Inder Singh Namdhari, Praveen Singh, Deepak Prakash left JVM, but Pradeep Yadav stayed with him. Also in 2015, when six MLAs out of eight JVM made a split joining BJP, Yadav at time too remained with Marandi.

Sources said that Yadav who has bitter experiences with BJP was said to have strongest opposition with JVM merger with BJP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm-expels-pradeep--inches-closer-to-merger-with-bjp.html

82,07-2-20,Court seeks 4 rapists’ response on Tihar’s plea for fresh death warrants,"A Delhi court has sought response by Friday of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case on an application seeking issuance of fresh death warrants against them.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmendra Rana sought the convicts’ response on an application moved on Thursday by the Tihar Jail authorities for the fresh death warrants. In its application, the states said the President has already dismissed the mercy petitions of three convicts and that no application by any of the four is currently pending before any court.

Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition -- the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. Pawan also has the option of filing a mercy plea.

The authorities also informed the court about Delhi High Court’s February 5 order which directed the convicts to take steps within a week, if they wished, to avail any remedy available under the law.

“It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that, keeping in view a week’s time given to the convicts by high court, the fresh dates for execution of death warrants...May kindly be fixed specifying the date and time for execution/ hanging of convicts Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh and Akshay in the interest of justice,” the application said.

The warrants, issued by the trial court on January 7, was later postponed “sine die” by it on January 31, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks.

The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear on Friday the Centre’s appeal challenging the Delhi High Court’s verdict dismissing its plea against stay on the execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

Additional Solicitor General K M Natraj, appearing for the Centre, on Thursday mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari.

Natraj told the court that jail authorities are unable to execute the convicts in the case despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.

The Delhi High Court Wednesday held that all the four convicts are to be executed together and not separately while setting a week’s deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies.

If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions/ authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.

Hours after the high court’s verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the apex court. The high court said all the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case have to be executed together, not separately, and faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps for issuance of death warrants after rejection of appeals of the convicts by the Supreme Court in 2017.

A lawyer associated with the matter had said the grounds taken for challenge in the top court are almost the same as taken in the high court while filing the appeal against the trial court order.

He had said the Centre has stated in the petition in the apex court that the convicts can be hanged separately as Mukesh has exhausted all his remedies, including the mercy plea.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/court-seeks-4-rapists----response-on-tihar---s-plea-for-fresh-death-warrants.html
83,07-2-20,Coalition failed to fulfil promises: BJP,"State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo today said that the political parties of ruling coalition Government had made big promises in their manifesto, but they are now feeling technically unable to fulfill these promises. Therefore the government has also started making excuses.

Pratul said that the Chief Minister is constantly saying that the treasury is empty, while everyone knows that the highest revenue collection is in the month of December, January, February.

“But most of these months are used by Hemant Soren by attending the Congress court in Delhi and not focusing on revenue collection. If from the first day the Chief Minister had paid attention to the revenue collection, the Government would have achieved its target this year,” he said.

Pratul said that it seems that the Congress has given the fund collection target to the coalition Government of Jharkhand for the election of Bihar. And, therefore, all the tenders in recent days have been cancelled, he added.

“The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in its manifesto had never spoken of taking a limited written examination to regulate the para teachers.

This means that the Government has reversed its promise. The Government should tell that those who will not be able to pass the examination will not be regular.

Similarly, the Congress and the JMM had already promised to take a decision in the Cabinet to declare the loan waiver of the farmers. Despite more than one month of formation of government, no decision has been taken on this issue so far.

The BJP is ready to support the Government on positive issues even today.

But a Government whose foundation is laid on the massacre of tribals, communal riots and hooliganism committed by the relatives and supporters of ministers, cannot be expected to take positive steps,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coalition-failed-to-fulfil-promises--bjp.html
84,07-2-20,‘Sarkar Apke Dwar’ building trust in Govt,"State government’s ‘Sarkar Apke Dwar (Government at your doorstep)’ initiative is not only bridging the gap between bureaucracy and commoners, but also building trust in the Government machinery among rural residents of far flung villages in Jharkhand, Deputy Commissioners actively involved in running the campaign said on Thursday.

Dhanbad Deputy Commissioner Amit Kumar said that as many as 728 written requisitions were submitted by common villagers to the Sarkar Apke Dwar team in a Dhanbad Panchayat earlier this week. “Most of the cases we have come across so far were related to beneficiaries who have not received compensations or other benefits from the Government. Land disputes also form a heavy chunk of the complaints registered during our visits to the Panchayats,” Kumar said.

Under Sarkar Apke Dwar, the Deputy Commissioner and Deputy Development Commissioner of all the 24 districts in Jharkhand visit Panchayats twice every week and listen to the grievances of common villagers. The team of officials that visits the Panchayats tries to address most of the issues on the spot and sets short deadlines for issues that require time for redressal. The process has been in place for quite some time. However, it has become more methodical under the current Government, say DCs.

“We get around 500 complaints during each visit. The number of complainants has also increased as people are gradually becoming aware of the campaign,” said Kumar. “The process has become more orderly now, and we get a list of complainants prior to visiting the villages,” he added.

In January, Chief Secretary DK Tiwari directed all the DCs and DDCs to organise Sarkar Apke Dwar visits twice every week. He asked the DCs to visit the villages with their team on Wednesdays and the DDCs to do the same on Saturdays. He also asked the District Administrations to prepare a timeline for issues that cannot be fixed on the spot and follow up regularly.

Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray said that the initiative has seen a warm response in rural and suburban Ranchi. “We have visited at least 50 places under the campaign and villagers have come out in large numbers to share their problems,” said Ray. “Most of the problems in Ranchi were related to Indira Awas Yojana and other welfare schemes,” he added.

Under the initiative, officials not only solve problems of villagers, but also spread awareness about the various Government schemes. The campaign also aims at making the largely illiterate villagers attuned to the Government’s ways of functioning.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---sarkar-apke-dwar----building-trust-in-govt.html
85,07-2-20,Lens on dozen Jharkhandis amid coronavirus fear,"At least a dozen Jharkhand residents, primarily students pursuing higher studies in China, are under scanner over coronavirus threat across the globe, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said on Thursday.

Fifty per cent of the suspects in Jharkhand so far are from Garhwa. Out of the 12 suspects who have travelled from China to Jharkhand, six are from Garhwa, three from Ranchi, two from Jamshedpur and one from Jamtara, said IDSP Director Rakesh Dayal. However, samples of only two suspects, both from Ranchi, were tested and they came out negative, he added.

“None of the suspects in Jharkhand have shown any symptoms of the viral infection so far. All Jharkhand residents who have travelled to China in the recent past are under scanner,” said Dayal, adding that the samples of only those suspects who show symptoms of viral infection will be sent for testing. However, samples of all Jharkhand residents who have visited Wuhan city in China since the Coronavirus outbreak will be mandatorily sent for tests as per the protocol, Dayal said.

Wuhan city in China is the epicenter of the Novel Coronavirus – a mysterious new virus that has killed more than 25,000 people across the world and infected at least 1.5 lakh. The virus has infected people in the USA, UK, Thailand, India and many other parts of the world. India has reported only three cases of the deadly virus so far, all from Kerala – a State that has declared Novel Coronavirus as a State emergency.

“We have to understand that any person travelling from China to Jharkhand will be put under scanner in order to prevent the virus from spreading. By now, we have not come across any Jharkhand resident with a travel history to Wuhan city of China. The people under scanner here visited other provinces of China,” said Dayal.

By now, Jharkhand has sent samples of two suspects to the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) in Pune and both were tested negative for Coronavirus. Jharkhand sounded a precautionary alert for Coronavirus, which infects the respiratory tract of patients and causes symptoms similar to common flu, on January 24.

Since there are no international airports in Jharkhand, the State does not have a provision for screening passengers for the virus at the airport. However, agencies in the cities from where these passengers will take a connecting flight to Ranchi will inform the concerned department here if any person is suspected to have contracted the virus, officials said.

According to the official website of the World Health Organisation (WHO), on December 31, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, it is not known how it may affect people, One week later, on January 7, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This new virus was temporarily named 2019-nCoV.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lens-on-dozen-jharkhandis-amid-coronavirus-fear.html
86,07-2-20,CACP talks to farmers to formulate farm produce prices,"In an attempt to provide proper prices to the farmers for their agricultural produce Agricultural Co Operative and Farmers Welfare Department, Agricultural and Farmers Welfare Ministry, Government of India held a meeting on Thursday for formulation of price policy with officials of Agricultural Departments of five States of West Zone including West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Chairman, Vijay Paul Sharma presided the meeting and discussed thoroughly on every aspects with the officials of the various departments and the farmers visited the State Capital from those states to attend the meeting.

After listening views and suggestions of participants, Paul said that it is necessary that the farmers should get proper price of their produces because after facing so many hurdles they provide food grains for the people. “The Government focusing on every aspect so that the farmers should get more than their production costs income of the farmers should be increased. It is our effort to asses production costs of different crops in different states because the production cost varies according to the areas. Production cost has been increased over the years and the selling prices of the products not increased in similar way,” he added.

Paul said that the department fixes prices of crops after assessing labour, transport, fuel, fertilizer, seed, irrigation and other costs. “The farmers should develop their own Farmers Producers’ Organisation (FPO) to get proper prices. Once they start this practice their problem of farm produce will decrease heavily,” he added.

The CACP Chairman highlighted three main problems the farmers are facing first Infrastructure second Market and third Scarcity of Institutions. He appealed that the concerned officials should focus on these three problems and assured that it will be addressed as early as possible.

91,07-2-20,"Latehar police intensify poster war against Maoists, poppy growers","Latehar police have intensified its poster war against CPI Maoists and the poppy cultivators. Big posters with names of dreaded Maoists like Khudi Ganjhu, Nandkishore Yadav, Dinesh Nageshiya etc and a note of admonition to poppy cultivators are being pasted on the walls of the houses of the people.

Sources said the house owners do not resist police move in pasting posters on their walls but they wait for Deepawli festival to come when their walls have a wash of either lime or cow dung when they will get rid of it.

A Balumath resident preferring anonymity said, “Police paste , Maoists write. Our walls are their posts. And we the inmates of our houses just remain a silent spectator to this war of words between the police and the Maoists.”

Sources said the poster war is all around Latehar district but it is most evident in Balumath and Herhunj police stations just because of its proximity to Chatra district which still holds immense notoriety for extremism and poppy cultivation.

Tourists’ hub Netarhat is also witnessing police’s posters against Maoists. Sources said 13 hard core Maoists operative in Latehar district with cash reward on their heads fill the size of the police posters.

SP Latehar Prashant Anand said poster wars have unnerved the Maoists and the poppy growers as well.

Their real faces now stand unmasked. The posters tell people not to yield to the pressure of the Maoists if they ask for cell phones, bikes or force individual to become their courier as it is too perilous for those who so toe the line of the extremists.

However police have most intelligently refrained from depicting graphically or by word exploitation of girls and women at the hands of the Maoists in posters prepared by the police sensing it will rub the sentiments of the common people on this sensitive issue the wrong way.

Sources said police poster is conspicuously silent over the sex exploits of the Maoists.

Anand said police posters urge parents not to give their children to extremists as then their future will be devastated by the extremists.

He further said posters make aware extremists also of the state new surrender policy for them.

SDPO Balumath Ranveer Singh said that there is a decline in the cultivation of poppy in Latehar’s two police stations Balumath and Herhunj where now farmers who used to grow poppy on their raiyyati lands are abstaining from doing this.

SDPO Singh said it is all because of police tightening the noose around such farmers.

However, Singh conceded acres of forest land or gair majrua lands which are close to any water body are still vulnerable locations for poppy growing as here the grower has no risk of law taking action against him since forest land/ gair majrua land is never the cup of any individual but of the state’s landed property.

Ranveer Singh said police use drones in inaccessible areas to locate patches of poppy cultivation and once it is established the crop is destroyed. Singh said tractors are used to crush the crop but where tractors cannot ply cops and chowkidars use sticks to beat the poppy plants.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/latehar-police-intensify-poster-war-against-maoists--poppy-growers.html

Early in the day, Congress party retaliated to BJP’s charges of lawlessness in the State by releasing picture of one of the accused arrested by the police as Ramesh Junapani, the village sarpanch and a BJP leader.

However, BJP State president, Rakesh Singh, claimed that the accused could be associated with any particular party, but this does not lessen the gravity of the outrageous incident of Dhar.

Singh alleged that Chief Minister Kamal Nath only discharged his responsibility through a tweet and his cabinet colleagues did not visit the bereaved family in Indore.

Notably, a mob beat up seven persons and the Government machinery remained idle for hours, he added saying the victims had intimated the nearby police station but they were beaten up by hours by a mob but only a group of three constables had reached the spot after the incident.

Congress media cell in- charge, Shobha Oza, however, alleged that mob lynching is a tradition founded by the BJP. It may be Una, Dadri or Jharkhand, why always BJP leaders pop up in connection to these incidents. Here in MP Taliban-style rule won’t prevail as it’s now Kamal Nath Government, she affirmed.

“When Congress Governments in 2018 had formulated anti-mob lynching laws, it was the BJP that opposed it vehemently,” claimed Oza.

Meanwhile, Congress party also released old pictures of BJP leader, Ramesh Junapani, identifying himself as a BJP leader on social media and sharing space with Shivraj Singh Chouhan in several photographs.

118,07-2-20,Sheena Bora murder: HC grants bail to Peter Mukerjea,"In what came as a big relief to him, the Bombay High Court on Thursday granted bail to former media baron and prime accused Peter Mukerjea in the Sheena Bora murder case, after observing that prima facie there was no evidence to prove his direct involvement in the crime.

Justice Nitin W Sambre of the High Court granted bail to Mukerjea on a surety of

Rs 2 lakh, after restraining him from travelling abroad without prior permission from the court and directing that he should not contact his children Rahul Mukerjea and Vidhi Mukerjea and other witnesses in the case. The court ordered Mukherjea to deposit his passport with the CBI.

65-year-old Mukherjea will not be able to walk out of the prison immediately, as Justice Nitin W. Sambre of the high court has stayed his order granting bail to the former for a period of six weeks to enable the CBI to appeal against the order.

The bail order is of significance to Mukherjea, considering that the Judge observed that there was no evidence to infer that Peter Mukerjea was involved in the commission of the crime. “When the incident took place, the applicant (Peter Mukerjea) was not in India. The trial in the case is already underway. The applicant is in jail since over four years and has recently undergone bypass surgery,” Justice Sambre averred.

In another important observation that comes as a relief to Mukherjea, the Judge noted: “Except for statement of the approver in the case, Shyamwar Rai, there is no reference to Peter Mukerjea in any evidence. There is no other evidence to show his involvement in the conspiracy.”

The Prosecution’s case is that key accused Indrani, along with her first husband Sanjeev Khanna and her driver Shyamvar Rai — who later turned an approver in the case —had allegedly “kidnapped” Sheena Bora between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm on April 24, 2012, from Bandra (west) in their car. Sheena was allegedly strangulated in the car on the same evening and that on the following morning they carried the body of the deceased packed in a bag (which had they kept in the rear side of the car) to the jungles Gogade Khurd village off the Khopoli-Pen Road, where they doused the bag with petrol and set it on fire.

Sheena was daughter of Indrani from her first live-in relationship with Siddhartha Das.

Peter, who was not present at the site of crime, has been charged with having been involved in a conspiracy hatched by Indrani to eliminate her daughter. He has also been charged with destruction of evidence in the case.

Virtually pulling up the investigators for arraigning Mukherjea as an accused in the case that too after six months after the arrest of two key accused, the Judge said that on April 24, 2012, on which Sheena was murdered, there was the direct involvement of Indrani Mukerjea and her previous husband Sanjeev Khanna in the offence, as alleged by the CBI.

Refusing to accept the Prosecution’s contention that Mukerjea had conspired to kill his step-daughter Sheena as he was unhappy with the relationship between her and his son Rahul Mukerjea, Judge Sambre noted: “This court has perused various emails exchanged between the applicant and Rahul Mukerjea. It is difficult to infer there was any criminal intent on part of Peter Mukerjea to indulge in the crime in question... The applicant was only trying to counsel his son, being a responsible father”

Having taken into consideration that the trial is currently underway in the case, the Judge noted in his order granting bail to Mukerjea: “The applicant is in jail since more than four years and has recently undergone bypass surgery. Considering these circumstances, this court is granting bail”

Indrani, who was arrested on August 25, 2015 for her alleged role in the murder of her daughter Sheena, is the key accused in the Sheena Bora murder case.

The CBI — which took over the investigations into the Sheena Bora murder case from the Mumbai police on September 29, 2015 — had on November 19, 2015 filed a comprehensive charge-sheet, running into 1,000-odd pages, against Indrani, her former husband Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai.

On the same (November 19,2015) evening, the CBI arrested Peter Mukherjea in connection with the sensational crime.

Initially, there were four accused in the Sheena Bora murder case – Indrani, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna, her driver Shyamvar Rai and Peter Mukherjea. Of them, Rai was granted pardon and made an approver in the case on June 20, 2016.

On February 16, 2016, the CBI filed filed a supplementary charge-sheet against Peter in the Sheena Bora murder case for various offences in connection with the killing of his step-daughter.

Mukherjea has been charged with having been part of the conspiracy to kill his 24-year-old step-daughter Sheena.

On January 17, 2017, a Special CBI court framed charges against Indrani, Peter Mukherjea and her former husband Sanjeev Khanna in the Sheena Bora murder case, thus paving way for the start of the trial.

While Khanna and Mukherjea are currently lodged in Arthur Road prison, Indrani is in Byculla women’s jail.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sheena-bora-murder--hc-grants-bail-to-peter-mukerjea.html

126,07-2-20,Mega Credit Linkage Mela held at Khariar,"A mega block-level Credit Linkage Mela was held at Khariar in Nuapada district by ICDS & Mission Shakti on Thursday. MSME Minister Dibyasankar Mishra was chief guest.

The fair was like an interface between the Government represented by the Minister, elected representatives like MLAs, ZP Members, PS representatives, Government officials and bankers on the one hand and hundreds of women SHG members on the other. It created ample opportunities for the SHG members to know about the Government’s policies and programmes and the procedures of their implementation.

At the outset, the District Social Welfare Officer presented a detailed picture on the activities and achievements. She informed that a total of 10,881 women SHGs have been formed till today in the district, out of which 6,498 have already received seed money of Rs 15,000 each; and under the digital empowerment programme, 3,759 WSHGs have been provided with android phone. She also informed that hundreds of WSHGs are engaged in management of Government activities through convergence like paddy procurement, supply of pre-school uniform, electricity meter reading and dues collection and MDM management, etc.

A total of 194 WSHGs are engaged in various income-generating activities like pisciculture in panchayat tanks, poultry, mushroom and vegetable cultivation.

Expressing resentment over noncooperation of the Utkal Grameen Banks in loan linkage, the DSWO said that due to lack of cooperation from banks especially the UGBs, the achievement in bank linkage is less than 50% (1,097 groups linked out of 2,626 proposed last year.) Clarifying about the scheme of ""zero-percent interest loan"" to WSHGs by banks, the DSWO informed that the SHGs have to repay the interest to the banks at prescribed rate which would be reimbursed at the end of the year by the Government.

127,07-2-20,WB Govt edgy ahead of Guv speech in House today,"With no love lost between Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar the Bengal Assembly may on Friday turn out to be an arena of confrontation between Raj Bhavan and Nabanna (State Secretariat).

This particularly became clear after Dhankhar on Thursday dropped hints of a history being created “when I will address the Assembly tomorrow.” The Governor has already drawn flak from the Trinamool Congress Government for reportedly expressing his desire to go through the Budget before its being laid on the table.

“I have been in politics for the past several decades but never saw a Governor acting like this. Never saw a Governor wanting to read the Budget before its being tabled in the House. It seems that he is working with some purpose,” State Law Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said on Friday.

Though the State Government had been trying for the past a few days to reach out to Dhankhar with senior Minister Partho Chatterjee meeting him at the Governor’s House and the Government offering him the State chopper —which it had refused on earlier occasions — for a short trip to Shantiniketan the Governor tended to be in no mood to forget previous altercations.

“There were learned governors before me, they all were iconic people but when I address the Assembly tomorrow I will be making history. My predecessors were all born before Independence and I am the first Governor to be born after the Independence. I will create history tomorrow,” the Governor said raising eye brows.

According to established practice the Governor reads out the speech prepared by the State Government which includes its own policies in the said speech.

However, Dhankhar reminded that he too was within his rights to put in his own views.

The State Government was well within its rights to put forth its achievements in the Governor’s address to the House, he said. “But as Governor, as constitutional head of the state, I have also my own rights and I have given my suggestions (accordingly). I won’t disclose what those suggestions were. I think it will be incorporated in my speech. I will act as per the Constitution,” he maintained.

His comments came a day after he had said that he might make changes to the speech he is scheduled to read out at the beginning of the Budget session on February 7.

The TMC promptly reacted with Bhattacharya accusing the Governor of deliberately trying to create problems. “We all know he is deliberately trying to create trouble and that is why he has crossed his brief on several occasions. He is acting as per orders of the central Government,” the Minister said.

The State Government and the Governor had not been in good terms ever since he took charge last year. The face off commenced after Dhankhar alleged ignored the Government’s advice and personally went to rescue Union Minister Babul Supriyo to Jadavpur University where he was gheraoed by the agitating students.

Thereafter on a number of occasions both sides traded charges alleging non-cooperation and interference in each other’s domain.

The Chief Minister often alleged that the Governor was acting as a BJP’s agent and was running a parallel Government at the instance of New Delhi.

However the Chief Minister extended olive branch a few days ago offering the state helicopter —which was earlier denied to him — for trips to Shantiniketan and Farakka. “We hope things pass off peacefully keeping in view the lofty tradition of our State,” said a Minister.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wb-govt-edgy-ahead-of-guv-speech-in-house-today.html
128,07-2-20,‘Will do more yoga for Rahul’s danda’,"A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's remark that the ""youth will beat up Modi with sticks over lack of jobs in the next six months”, the Prime Minister on Thursday countered him wittily saying he would increase the number of surya namaskars so that his back can bear the beatings.

Modi also took a dig with his ""tubelight"" jibe at Rahul for his delayed reaction during his reply to a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's Address even as he made some made tongue-in-cheek remarks at other Opposition members.

Outside the house, Rahul reacted saying the PM did not talk about the main issue of unemployment and alleged that he was distracting people by talking about other things like Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan.

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, the Prime Minister said: ""In 70 years, no Congress leader has ever become self- sufficient.

I heard one leader's manifesto yesterday. He said 'we will beat Modi with a stick in six months'. I can imagine that it is a difficult prospect, so it will take six months to prepare.

""In these six months, I will do more surya namaskar so that my back is ready for the beating. I have been subjected to abuses in the past 20 years, I will make myself gaali-proof (abuse-proof) and also danda-proof (stick-proof),"" Modi said.

Addressing an election rally in Delhi, Rahul had on Wednesday said, ""The PM is delivering speeches, but six months later, he will not be able to even leave his home. The youth of India will

beat him up with sticks

and make him understand that this country will not be able to make progress

until jobs are provided to them.""

When Rahul got up from his seat and questioned Modi on the issue of unemployment, the Prime Minister said he was waiting for the Congress leader's reaction but it took him 30-40 minutes. ""I have been speaking for 30-40 minutes but it took this long for the current to reach. Many tubelights are like this,"" Modi said prompting ruling NDA members to burst into laughter.

Modi also took several digs at leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for frequently rising from his seat and interrupting him, saying that he is publicising 'Fit India' campaign of his Government in Parliament.

Responding to Chowdhury on the issue unemployment, Modi said he will resolve unemployment in the country but not his and of his party's.

On Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's criticism of the Government, Modi suggested that Tharoor should have some soft corner for Kashmir after all he was ""son-in-law"" of the region, referring to his late wife Sunanda Pushkar.

Hitting back at Modi, Rahul said, ""All youngsters of this country want that after studies - school, college university - they get employment.

We asked the Prime Minister repeatedly that you have given a one and a half hour speech and if for 2 minutes you can tell the youth about employment and what your Government has done about it.""

""You would have seen, youngsters saw, that the Prime Minister could not give a reply,"" the former Congress president said while speaking to reporters outside Parliament.

Earlier, the Government used to talk about economy, Make in India, USD 5 trillion, but the Prime Minister now does not talk about the biggest issue facing the country and is distracting the people by talking about other things, ranging from the Congress and Nehru to Pakistan and Bangladesh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---will-do-more-yoga-for-rahul---s-danda---.html
129,07-2-20,Modi slams Cong for GST rollout delay,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked the Congress for the delay in implementation of the Goods and Services Tax , saying that it was only after he took office that the outstanding issues were resolved, paving the way for the rollout of the unified tax regime.

""GST has seen a lot of changes. It is a big achievement for the country. If you had this much knowledge and a clear vision then why didn't you implement GST? Why did you keep it hanging?"" PM Modi said in Rajya Sabha as the opposition broke erupted in protest.

""I had said that you should address the manufacturing states issues in order to implement GST.(Arun) Jaitley ji addressed these issues. The issues that I raised as a CM (Chief Minister), I have worked on them as a PM,"" he added.

The Central Government had launched the GST in 2017, its biggest ever tax reform, aiming to replace more than a dozen federal and state levies and unify the sprawling economy.

The move improved economic efficiency but critics say the complexities of the new regime have driven many small enterprises out of business and forced hundreds of thousands out of jobs. The Congress, which had accused the BJP of holding up the GST when it was in the opposition, has been one of the sharpest critics of the implementation of the tax reform by the PM Modi's Government, saying that bungled implementation had hurt the economy.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-slams-cong-for-gst-rollout-delay.html
130,07-2-20,Misconception about right to internet in country: Min,"The Government on Thursday said there is a misconception about the right to internet being a fundamental right and emphasised that the country’s security was equally important.

In an effort to clarify the issue, Communications and Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""The Supreme Court has clearly stated that no lawyer argued that right to Internet is a fundamental right. This kind of misconception needs to be corrected. What the Supreme Court has stated is that for communication of your ideas and views the use of Internet will also to be held a part of your fundamental right of speech and expression.""

He also said no one can deny abuse of internet for spreading violence and terrorism, and Pakistan has been doing it in Kashmir and ISIS prospered because of Internet. ""While right of Internet is important, security of the country is equally important"" Prasad said adding there have been attempts to create unrest in Kashmir from across the border through Internet.

He made this observation in the Rajya Sabha in response to a question whether it is a fact that the apex court declared use of internet as a fundamental right and took a serious view of the internet lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir.

He emphasised that the Constitution which provides rights lays equal stress on its regulation, saying ""Use internet but you cannot create violence. And weaken unity, integrity and security of nation.""

In reply to a supplementary question by Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, Prasad said having been a former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir he had also been on the hit list of terrorists and was well aware of abuse of Internet.

Whether it is a BJP government or a non-BJP government, internet has been restricted on several times on account of its abuse and ""what the Supreme Court has done is they have said temporary suspension of rules must be periodically reviewed"", he said.

The minister said a committee at the Centre comprising the Home Secretary, the Law Secretary and the IT Secretary reviews it periodically while there are committees in states too.

Prasad said law and order is a state subject and decisions are taken based on ground situation which are reviewed periodically. He also said the use of internet is subjected to reasonable restrictions for public order, for security and integrity of India.

On Jammu and Kashmir, he said he had recently visited Kashmir and on demand of apple growers at Sopore, which produces 300 varieties and sends out 450 trucks daily, had initiated the process of making it an e-mandi. Moreover, voice, SMS and landline services have been restored in Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, while broadband is functional in Jammu division.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/misconception-about-right-to-internet-in-country--min.html
131,07-2-20,Opp blames Modi Govt for putting country's economy in dire straits,"The Opposition on Thursday accused the Modi Government of putting the economy in a critical State.

Initiating the debate on the Budget in Lok Sabha, Congress MP Manish Tewari said the country's economy was affected with coronavirus but the Centre was giving medication for common cold.

Tewari said that BJP Government is responsible for the lowest GDP and acute unemployment in the country. His remarks were countered by former Union minister Jayant Sinha who said that the Opposition was looking behind whereas the government was looking ahead at a five-trillion dollar economy.

""India's economy is in very critical stage...The economy has been affected with coronavirus while the government was giving the medication for common cold,"" Tewari said initiating the discussion on Union

Budget 2020-21. He accused the government for the PSU selling spree to meet the fiscal deficit target, blaming the Government's move to divest BPCL, Air India and LIC.

He claimed India's economy would be affected due to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Population Register (NPR), and urged the government to rise above

partisan politics. Sinha countered the attacked of the Opposition, stating that the Congress is seeing through the rear view mirror and looking back and ""we (BJP) are looking ahead at five trillion dollar economy"".

Claiming that crony capitalism was at its peak during the UPA rule, he said that under the rule of the Congress there was ""billionaire raaj"". ""We removed the UPA era 'billionaire's raj' and replaced it with 'people's raaj',"" he said. Stating tha budget was for the common man and a ""feel good"" budget, he said, ""We have to look forward.""

DMK leader K Kanimozhi accused the Modi government of not only painting the contemporary India ""saffron"" but going back in history to paint the past in the Hindutva colour as well. She asked as to how the government will meet its targets as proposed in the budget when economic growth is only 5 per cent.

Criticising the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission on divisions of tax revenue between the Centre and states, she said they are unfair to states which have controlled population growth due to their consideration of demography as a basis for its proposals. She also criticised the move to ask states to pay for defence allocation, saying it comes under the Centre's purview and its expenditure should

be borne by it.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-blames-modi-govt-for-putting-country-s-economy-in-dire-straits.html
132,07-2-20,TMC: Take adequate steps to curb misuse of antibiotics,"Issues like contaminated drinking water in many part of the country due to unchecked industrial waster in rivers, arsenic problem and check on online business in food delivery sector figured prominently in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Besides these matters, Elders, especially from Trinamool Congress(TMC) demanded the Government take adequate steps to curb misuse of antibiotics.

Raising the issue, Manas Rajan Bhunia said the central Government should conduct a survey to ascertain the situation.

A recent study shows that India is the top victim of misuse of antibiotics and micro-biologicals. The West Bengal Government is already scrutinising the matter, he said.

On the issue of arsenic content in water, Ahamed Hassan(TMC)called for a proper solution to address this problem and demanded adequate funds to undertake research in this area. Around nine districts are affected in West Bengal. Similarly in Bihar, ground water in 17 districts has arsenic content beyond the permissible limits, he said.

Expressing concern over quality of portable water, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar (BJP) urged the Government to direct all bodies concerned to ensure monitoring of water treatment plants and ensure they run in full capacity.

He said 80 per cent of the source of potable water is polluted including Yamuna and Ganga in Delhi-NCR region and causing various diseases like cancer and tuberculosis. Tomar attributed unchecked industrial waste dumped in rivers as one of the main causes of unfit water. Mahesh Poddar (BJP) expressed concern over rise in cancer cases in the country and urged the government to create more awareness in this regard.

Drawing the attention of the house to food delivery business through e-commerce, K Somaprasad(CPM) said it was uncontrolled and there was no check on the quality and hygiene of food. It was causing a grave danger to the consumers and called for regulations. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu also expressed concern and Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said he will summon a meeting soon in this regard.

Congress members said there is a need to further tighten the existing laws or bring a new one in order to protect rights of tribals on their forest land.

Raising the issue, Madhusudan Mistry said over the years, there has been ""tardy"" implementation of a law that protects forest land of tribals and forest dwellers.

Another Congress leader P Bhattacharya said the existing law enables gram sabhas to protect rights of scheduled tribes (STs). However, the gram sabhas were taking decision on eviction and giving land to private parties, he claimed and called for amendment in the concerned law or bring a new one to protect rights of tribals.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tmc--take-adequate-steps-to-curb-misuse-of-antibiotics.html
133,07-2-20,India can evacuate Pak students from China,"In the backdrop of coronavirus outbreak in China, India on Thursday said it canconsider evacuating Pakistani students from Hubei province ""if such a situation arises"" and if resources are available. Making this clear, the Ministry of External Affairs, however, said Pakistan had made no request for it till now.

Hundreds of stranded Pakistani students in the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city have made desperate pleas to the Imran Khan Government to evacuate them from China's worst-affected Hubei province, urging his administration to take a leaf out of India's book.

Asked about the pleas by the Pakistani students and whether India could help in their evacuation, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, ""No such request has been received by us from the Government of Pakistan. But if such a situation arises and keeping in mind the resources available, we can look into it."" However, he did not clarify what would be the specific pre-conditions for considering the request.

India airlifted 654 people, including seven Maldivians, on Saturday and Sunday from Wuhan. The Health Ministry said all the evacuees have tested negative and no new case has been reported.

Watching the Indian students leave, the Pakistani students posted videos on social media asking their Government to do the same.

In one of the videos, a Pakistani student while showing the Indian students boarding the bus to go to the airport, said while India was evacuating its citizens, the Pakistan government says ""you live or die we will not evacuate or facilitate"" their journey home. Shame on you Pakistan government. Learn from India how it takes care of its people,"" he said in the video that went viral.

Pakistan has more than 28,000 students in China, including 500 in the worst-hit city of Wuhan. China has praised Pakistan for resuming flights to the country, a day after it received special medical kits from Beijing to detect the deadly virus cases.

Kumar also said all existing e-visas from China are no longer valid. Similarly, normal visas that have been issued are also no more valid. However, those who have compelling reasons to visit India, can contact the Indian embassy or the nearest consulates to apply for visa.

As regards reports about restrictions on airlines, the spokesperson said, ""I am not aware of any restriction imposed by government on the operation of any commercial flight between India and China.""

He also said airlines are free to take the decision based on their own assessment on ground.

On the visa issue, Kumar said e-visa is available for certain categories of visits to India and diplomats do not fall in that category. A diplomat visa is applied at the embassy. So, it may not impact the diplomatic process, he said",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-can-evacuate-pak-students-from-china.html
134,07-2-20,Nine-judge Bench to decide if SC can refer legal issues in review jurisdiction,"A 9-judge Constitution bench said Thursday it will answer the contentious legal issue on February 10 whether the Supreme Court can refer questions of law to a larger bench while exercising its limited power under review jurisdiction in the Sabarimala case.

The bench, headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, said it will pronounce the order on Monday as also frame larger issues for evolving of a judicial policy to deal with discrimination against women in various religions.

The 9-judge bench said it would commence day-to-day hearing from February 12 on the issues which were referred by a 5-judge Constitution bench headed by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi (since retired) on November 14, 2019.

Besides Sabarimala case, the verdict had also referred issues of entry of Muslim women into mosques and dargahs and of Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agiary, to the larger bench.

The bench, also comprising Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S A Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said it would answer preliminary objection raised by some senior lawyers with regard to its power of reference to a larger bench while exercising authority under review jurisdiction.

During day-long hearing, senior lawyers like F S Nariman, Rajeev Dhavan, Indira Jaising and Shyam Divan vehemently argued that the 5-judge bench was wrong in making a reference to a larger bench without deciding the review petitions challenging the 2018 Sabarimala verdict, which had allowed women of all age group to enter the hill-top shrine.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nine-judge-bench-to-decide-if-sc-can-refer-legal-issues-in-review-jurisdiction.html

Rs 77 crore from hideouts purportedly belonging to a financier of Tamil films in Chennai and Madurai in searches held on Wednesday.

This was revealed by a press release by the official spokesperson of the Central Board of Direct Taxes on Thursday.

The Pioneer had reported on Thursday that Tamil cinema’s reigning superstar Joseph Vijay (Thalapathy to fans and followers) was picked up by the Income Tax Department from a location in Neyveli, taken to his residence in East Coast Road in Chennai and was questioned about certain financial dealings for hours.

Though no names were furnished by the CBDT spokesperson, the release said the searches were held ‘in the case of four major players in the film industry including a producer, a prominent actor, his distributor and financer based in Tamil Nadu’.

The release said that the common thread among all these entities were the success of a recent film which was a box office hit collecting around Rs 300 crore. “About 38 premises of the group were covered in search and survey actions spread over Chennai and Madurai”, said the release.

The release issued by the CBDT on Thursday was silent about the name of the actor. But it said that the prominent Actor’s investment in immovable properties and remuneration received from the said Producer for acting in the film is the subject matter of investigation in the present search. “Searches in some of the premises are still continuing, “ the release said.

Large number of property documents, Promissory notes, post dated cheques taken as collateral security were recovered during the search and have been seized. “As per evidence detected during the search , it is estimated that the concealment in this case is likely to exceed Rs 300 crore,” said the CBDT spokesperson.

The release further stated that all documents in original recovered from the hide out place was under scrutiny. It also said that the IT department was checking and analysing the documents seized from the residence and premises of the film producer.

Though the release is silent about the name of the film, it has become clear that the film in question is Bigil starred by Vijay and which according to the fans of the superstar grossed Rs 300 crore in box office.

Some of the film news portals too added to the curiosity of the IT Department by publishing news that Vijay presented gold rings to each of the 400 crew members of the film.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/it-raids-on-movie-financier-yield-rs-77-cr-cash-in-tn.html
136,07-2-20,Ram temple work to begin in April this year: Trustee,"The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will commence either on Ram Navmi or Akshaya Tritiya in April, Swami Govind Devgiri Maharaj, a trustee of Shri Ram Janambhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust said here on Thursday.

The exact date, however, will be finalised in the first meeting of the Trust, he said.

Swami Devgiri Maharaj was talking to reporters here, a day after the Modi government constituted an independent 15- member Trust, including him, to oversee the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.

“I welcome Modi government’s decision to form a trust for the establishment of Ram mandir in Ayodhya. The construction of the temple will commence either on Ram Navmi (April 2) or Akshaya Tritiya (April 26) this year as discussed during a meeting at Prayagraj,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ram-temple-work-to-begin-in-april-this-year--trustee.html
137,07-2-20,Mosque site too far: Muslim litigants of Ayodhya case,"Muslim litigants of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case here expressed dissatisfaction over the location of the site granted for building a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid, saying it is too far from the city centre.

The UP Government has given the allotment letter to the Sunni Waqf board for the land in Dhannipur village in Sohawal tehsil in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 18 km from the district headquarters, state government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told reporters on Wednesday.

Speaking to PTI on Thursday, litigant Mohammad Umar said the site was not a prominent place.

“The Supreme Court directed that land should be allotted at any prominent place in Ayodhya, but the allotted land is 25 kilometers away in a village and off the road, so this is not prominent place,” he said.Another litigant, Hasbullah Badshah Khan, said, “The 1994 Supreme Court judgment in the Ismail Faruqi case clearly mentioned that the mosque and temple will be inside the 67-acre precinct. According to the November 2019 SC judgment, land for the mosque was to be given at an important place in Ayodhya. The plot identified is under Raunahi police station and in Sohawal tehsil, it is not even in Ayodhya.”

Reacting to the allotment of the land by the Uttar Pradesh Government, Zafaryab Jilani, executive member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said renaming a town and extending its municipal limits does not mean that the land offered is still in Ayodhya.

“The Uttar Pradesh Government had renamed Faizabad district as Ayodhya during Diwali celebrations last year. In all court documents part of the litigation all this while, Ayodhya was a small town, a town of Faizabad. This Ayodhya cannot be equated to the new district created by the government now,” he said.

“Merely renaming a town and extending its municipal limits do not mean the land offered is still in Ayodhya,” Jilani said.

He claimed that though the land was being given to the Sunni Waqf Board, Muslim organisations, including the AIMPLB, as also the Muslim community, have denounced accepting the alternate land for Babri Masjid. The Supreme Court in a historic verdict on November 9 last year in the politically sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case backed the construction of a Ram temple by a government trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.

Based on this verdict, the Centre had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to allocate 5 acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board.

The dispute over the site of Babri Masjid, a three-domed mosque built by or at the behest of Moghul emperor Babur, dates back centuries with Hindus contending that the invading Muslim armies had razed an existing Ram temple to erect the mosque.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mosque-site-too-far--muslim-litigants-of-ayodhya-case.html

The move was necessitated as their six-month preventive custody was ending on Thursday.

Official sources privy to these developments in Srinagar claimed, the PSA order was signed late night by the concerned authorities after which both the leaders were duly informed about the same.

Three other leaders Ali Mohd Sagar, Bashir Ahmed Veeri of National Conference and Sartaj Madni of PDP were also booked under PSA by the concerned authorities on Thursday.

Sitting MP from Srinagar,and former CM and Union Minister Dr Farooq Abdullah, is already detained under PSA act by the J&K administration. He is currently lodged in his residence located on the Gupkar road in Srinagar.

141,07-2-20,PM lists steps taken after abrogation of Art 370,"Listing out the steps taken in Jammu & Kashmir post abrogation of its special status under Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said an anti-corruption bureau has been established in the Union Territory for the first time.

Replying to the debate in Rajya Sabha on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament, Modi said for the first time in decades, people of Jammu & Kashmir got benefits of reservation besides putting in place a comprehensive start-up, trade and logistics policy.

There were BDC (Block Development Council) polls and RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) came into being there, Modi said.

He attacked the Opposition for not offering any ""constructive suggestion"" during the debate, saying they made a ""virtue out of stagnation"".

Modi said one member said the decision to abrogate the special status for Jammu & Kashmir in August last year was taken without discussion. ""This observation is not correct. The entire nation has seen the detailed discussions on the subject. MPs have voted in favour of the decisions.""

""People do not forget things easily. I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha about the manner in which proceedings regarding the creation of Telangana took place"" when the House was locked and televised address stopped when the Bill to bifurcate Andhra Pradesh was passed, the PM told the joint session.

The Prime Minister further said there is ""unprecedented peace in Northeast"" countering the Opposition charge of unrest in the region following an amendment to the citizenship law.

Many Central laws were not implemented due to the special status provided to the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir under the Article 370 of the Constitution.

Even the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was implanted in the style of Ranbir Penal Code. The erstwhile State was the only one to have a separate constitution and flag as per the provisions of Article 370.

However, the status of J&K changed after the Article 370 was nullified by the Parliament and the then State was reorganized into two Union Territories-Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Following the reorganisation of the erstwhile State into two UTs, a number of the leaders from the Valley were put under detention as a preventive measure and the Opposition has been crying foul over the move.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-lists-steps-taken-after-abrogation-of-art-370.html
142,07-2-20,Ten defectors who helped BJP gain power gets Cabinet berth,"Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday rewarded with Cabinet berth 10 defectors, who helped the BJP bring down the Congress-JD(S) coalition and come to power.

The Cabinet expansion led to dissatisfaction among a section of ‘native’ BJP leaders who were left out of the exercise as the party sought to contain dissidence in the face of intense lobbying for berths by several contenders.

The then disqualified Congress-JD(S) MLAs who had shifted loyalty to the BJP and won the December by-elections, were sworn-in at a simple ceremony at the Raj Bhavan with the Governor Vajubhai Vala administering oath of office and secrecy.

The ten are: ST Somashekar (Yeshwantpur constituency),Ramesh Jarkiholi (Gokak), Anand Singh (Vijayanagar), KSudhakar (Chikkaballapur), Byrathi Basavaraj (KR Puram), AShivaram Hebbar (Yellapur), BC Patil (Hirekerur), K Gopalaiah(Mahalakshmi Layout), KC Narayana Gowda (KR Pet) and Shrimant Balasaheb Patil (Kagwad).

Thursday’s much-awaited expansion takes the strength of the Cabinet to 28, with six vacancies now.

In the first expansion, last August, 17 Ministers were inducted. The latest exercise wasn’t a smooth affair for the Chief Minister and it was not without a twist.

Yediyurappa had announced on Sunday that 13 aspirants,including the 10 who were sworn-in on Thursday and three BJP old-timers would be inducted.

The three who were expected to get Cabinet berths were Umesh Katti, Arvind Limbavali and CP Yogeshwar.

A section of the BJP had opposed making Yogeshwar a Minister, pointing out that he had lost the Assembly elections and not a member of either House.

Late on Wednesday, Yediyurappa said induction of BJP old-timers had been put off following directions from the party’s central leadership.

The decision to take none of the ‘native’ BJP leaders into the Cabinet in the current round came after intense lobbying from several aspirants which threatened to go out of hand at one stage, party sources said.

The ten newly-inducted Ministers were among the then 16 Congress-JD(S) MLAs who brought down the coalition Government headed by HD Kumaraswamy.

Among these disqualified MLAs, 13 had contested the by-polls in December and 11 had won.

The one who had been left out in the Cabinet expansionis Athani MLA Mahesh Kumathalli who has been promised by theChief Minister “some other big responsibility.”

Apparently displaying their resentment, Katti and Kumathalli skipped the swearing-in ceremony.

While Katti’s name was doing rounds ever since the Chief Minister announced on Sunday that three old-timer BJP leaders would be inducted in his Cabinet.

Health and Family Welfare Minister B Sriramulu, who had made no secret of his ambition to become a Deputy Chief Minister, was also conspicuous by his absence, along with Yogeshwar.

Kumathalli was aggrieved that he didn’t secure the

berth.

“It is difficult to make him (Mahesh Kumathalli) Minister now. I will call him and discuss with him. We will try to give him some other big responsibility,” Yediyurappa had said on Wednesday night.

Sriramulu later clarified that there was no discordin the party and Yediyurappa was his leader.

He also said he was busy distributing invitations for his daughter’s wedding and had sought the approval of the party leaders to skip the swearing-in ceremony.

“There is no discord in the party. As some people arebuilding the narrative of native and outsider, I don’t believein such differentiation,” Sriramulu told reporters.

There was a section within the BJP, especially M PRenukacharya, which opposed induction of Yogeshwar.

As the Thursday’s exercise was meant to honour the promise made to those who helped BJP come to power and make Yediyurappa chief minister, the caste consideration did not matter much.

Reacting to Cabinet expansion, former Chief Minister and Congress leader Siddaramaiah said he is not happy that those who defected from Congress and the JD(S) became ministers because it was “anti-democracy” and they had betrayed their parties.

“They had won the election and now became Ministers, so I will congratulate them. I want them to do pro-people works,”Siddaramaiah, however, added.

When asked that his ‘good-old friends’ have become ministers, former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy said, “I am happy. They had put in lotsof efforts to fulfill their aspirations. Let them do some good work for the people.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ten-defectors-who-helped-bjp-gain-power-gets-cabinet-berth.html
143,07-2-20,Saudis refuse to take Pak bait on Kashmir,"India on Thursday reacted strongly to the reference to Jammu & Kashmir in a Pakistan-Malaysia joint statement, while Pakistan's effort to call an immediate meeting on Kashmir by Saudi Arabia-led Organisation of Islamic Cooperation(OIC) seems to have not yielded desired result after Riyadh showed reluctance to the move.

Upset with Malaysia move, India urged that country's leadership to develop a better understanding of facts and acknowledge that Pakistan remains an epicentre of global terrorism. According to media reports in Pakistan, there were plans to convene a meeting of the foreign Ministers of the OIC on Kashmir by Saudi Arabia, in an apparent move by the kingdom to please Pakistan which skipped a recent summit of Muslim nations in Malaysia. The summit was seen by Riyadh as an attempt to create a new bloc to replace the 57-member grouping led by it.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had confirmed Pakistan's participation in the summit hosted by Malaysia, but skipped the event at the eleventh hour due to pressure exerted by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — key financial backers of the cash-strapped country.

The report by Dawn News came ahead of the bloc's senior officials' meeting in Jeddah on February 9 to make preparations for the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM).

Islamabad's feeling of unease with the OIC over its failure to get the CFM's meeting appears to be growing, as Riyadh was showing reluctance to convene the meeting on Kashmir on Pakistan's request, the report quoted a diplomatic source as saying.

The Jeddah-headquartered bloc, which is the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, has usually been supportive of Pakistan and often sided with Islamabad on the Kashmir issue.

Prime Minister Khan voiced frustration over the OIC's silence on Kashmir during his visit to Malaysia.

Although there has been a meeting of the contact group on Kashmir on the sidelines of UN General Assembly session in New York and a report by the OIC's Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission on the alleged rights abuses in Kashmir, no progress could be made towards the CFM's meeting.

Support from Riyadh is considered a must for any move at the OIC, which is dominated by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries from the Gulf. The kingdom has made several proposals to Pakistan to avoid the CFM including holding of a parliamentary forum or speakers' conference from Muslim countries and, according to a source, a joint meeting on Palestine and Kashmir issues. Pakistan has persisted with its proposal so far.

Soon after Pakistan's absence at the Malaysia summit, Saudi Arabia showed flexibility in December on the proposal for the CFM on Kashmir. The Saudi flexibility, however, was short-lived as Riyadh reverted to its traditional position on Kashmir.

India, in a major diplomatic achievement in March last year, addressed the OIC meeting in Abu Dhabi for the first time. India's participation came despite strong demand by Pakistan to rescind the invitation to then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to address the grouping of the OIC which was turned down by the host UAE, resulting in Pakistan's Foreign Minister Qureshi boycotting the plenary.

Reacting strongly to the reference to Jammu and Kashmir in a Pakistan-Malaysia joint statement, India on Thursday urged the Malaysian leadership should develop a better understanding of facts and acknowledge that Pakistan remains an epicentre of global terrorism.

Making these observations, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said here India completely rejects the references made with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral and inalienable part of India.

""We once again call upon the Malaysian leadership to develop better understanding of the facts, including that Pakistan remains an epicentre of global terrorism, which continues to recruit, train, arm and finance cross-border terrorism against India,"" he said.

His reaction came after a joint statement issued by Malaysia and Pakistan at the end of Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit recorded that the Pakistani premier had raised the issue of Kashmir during talks with his Malaysian counterpart.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/saudis-refuse-to-take-pak-bait-on-kashmir.html

A senior official of the state Tourism Department said the exact number of cancellations was not yet available, but agreed that repeated instances of floods and epidemics were affecting the industry.

""As of now, the exact numbers are not available. But industry sources told us that many hotel bookings, including that of KTDC (Kerala Tourism Development Corporation), have been cancelled,"" the official told PTI.

KTDC help desks at various centres were receiving enquiries from people wanting to know the situation in the state, he said.

""As of now, the situation in Kerala is under control. There is no need to worry. But still the people are worried and some have cancelled their bookings,"" the official said.

""There are 15-20 per cent cancellations after the reporting of the coronavirus cases. But there are bookings also,"" Jose Dominic, CEO of the CGH Earth Group of Hotels, told PTI. ""We (Kerala) have a reputation that we will put travellers' health first before commercial interest,"" he added.

Travel and tour operators, however, fear the state's tourism sector is likely to be severely hit, especially because the Kerala government has declared the outbreak a 'state calamity' and Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran recently admitted that the sector has suffered a setback.

E M Najeeb, senior ice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), said tour programmes and packages are being cancelled widely in the state and declaration of the epidemic as a 'state calamity' by the government would adversely impact the economic situation.

""We completely appreciate the steps taken by the government to protect infected persons, create awareness among the public and tackle the situation. But as far as the tourism industry is concerned, such measures will scare the people. Not only tourism, all business activities of the state will be affected,"" Najeeb told PTI.

146,07-2-20,Markets extend winning run on RBI stance,"Equity indices marched higher for the fourth session on the trot on Thursday after the RBI left the policy rates unchanged but maintained its accommodative stance to shore up growth.

The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 163.37 points, or 0.40 per cent, higher at 41,306.03. The broader NSE Nifty rose 48.80 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 12,137.95.

In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review of 2019-20, the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously voted to keep the repurchase or repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent while retaining its accommodative stance.

The central bank also kept the GDP growth estimate unchanged for the current fiscal at 5 per cent but projected a pick up to 6 per cent in the next financial year.

To boost credit growth, it also relaxed cash reserve requirement for banks for every new loan extended to loans for automobiles, residential housing and small businesses till July 2020.

Rate-sensitive financial, banking and auto stocks rallied, with BSE Finance spurting up to 1.21 per cent. However, realty settled in the red.

IndusInd Bank was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, climbing 4.85 per cent, followed by SBI, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Axis Bank and Hero MotoCorp.

On the other hand, Infosys, Titan, ITC, Kotak Bank and Asian Paints slipped up to 1.73 per cent.

Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose up to 0.81 per cent.

“Monetary policy action from the central bank on rates came on expected line while measures to spur growth in credit came as a surprise. Removal of CRR for loans made to specific sector and open market operations will support the economy with more credits at lower rates.

“Inflation rate is forecasted to subsequently reduce in the coming months and provide more room for RBI to cut interest rates as and when necessary,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while the pause decision may be on expected lines, the central bank has several instruments up its sleeves, hinting at use of unconventional tools such as the ones used by the US Fed after the global financial crisis in 2008.

Global markets darted up after China slashed tariffs on some US imports.

147,07-2-20,Rice exports likely to dip by 18-20% in FY20,"India’s rice exports is expected to witness around 20 per cent decline this fiscal, due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and tighter trade norms, a report said on Thursday.

According to a report by the US-based trade finance company Drip Capital, export of rice has witnessed a significant decline across the world owing to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — one of the biggest export market.

Following this, India’s rice exports is likely to go down by 18-20 per cent in 2019-20, the report said.

“Exports so far are looking bleak with Iran, the biggest export market, seeing a 22 per cent fall in shipments.

148,07-2-20,"Experts hail RBI measures to boost economy, improve money supply","Economists and financial experts have welcomed RBI’s widely expected status quo on repo rate, and other announcements to spur economic growth and ensure money supplies effectively.

The RBI on Thursday kept the key policy rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent. This follows a cumulative 135 basis points (bps) cut in repo rate since February to December 2019. The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unanimously decided to keep the repo rate unchanged.

Bank of India MD and CEO AK Das termed the RBI policy quite progressive and forward looking. “Notwith-standing unchanged policy rates, introduction of Term Repo opens up ways to transmit the signal rate changes,” he said.

“Measures like DCCO extension for realty, MSME window expansion for restructuring and CRR exemption for incremental funding to key segments are growth oriented and promise to provide the much needed impetus to bank lending,” Das said.

According to Rajni Thakur, economist, RBL Bank, MPC’s decision was on expected lines.

“The changes in development and regulatory policies however were a positive surprise and could potentially turn out to be a big support to the troubled sectors in the economy,” Thakur said.

Specific announcements in terms of CRR relief or long-term durable liquidity for banks push the overall credit availability in the financial system. Whether these steps manage to improve demand conditions is another question all together, she added.

Upasna Bhardwaj, economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said very aptly, MPC has addressed the growth concerns through pushing transmission via tweaking the liquidity framework, providing long term liquidity operations and incentivising credit to select sectors. “We expect these measures to aid transmission with the shorter end of the yield curve expected to rally meaningfully. These measures should help availability of funds at lower costs and aid sectors in stress,” Bhardwaj said.

ICRA economist Aditi Nayar said: “The tone of the MPC’s statement was rather dovish, especially given the reiteration that policy space is available for future action.

“The accommodative stance will be maintained for as long as necessary to revive growth, in spite of the headline inflation having breached the upper threshold of the MPC’s medium term target.”

The RBI also raised upwards the retail inflation projection for last quarter of this fiscal to 6.5 per cent citing high input cost for milk and pulses besides costlier crude oil prices amid rising geo-political tensions. Nayar said the statement suggests the near certainty of at least one additional rate cut, even if its magnitude is modest, the timing of which will depend on how quickly inflation appears to be reverting towards 4 per cent.

Umesh Revankar, MD and CEO, Shriram Transport Finance said the attention-grabbing aspect of the policy is marginal improvement in IIP, manufacturing index (PMI) and service index. These numbers depict beginning of increasing activity though still under wait and watch radar to bring in any further excitement, he said.

“We believe that all the policy decisions along with pro-consumption budget corroborates that there would be better demand from the consumption side. Once that increases, automatically there will be better credit demand,” Revankar said.

The expansionary monetary policy stance was necessary and is an assurance that there will be no reversal of easing and that the RBI will not hike rates immediately, opined Rumki Majumdar, economist, Deloitte India.

Engineering Exports and Promotion Council (EEPC) Chairman Ravi Sehgal said RBI measures to provide one-time restructuring window for advances to MSMEs would help growth revival in the employment-oriented sectors.

“With global markets being subdued, exporters, particularly those in the SMEs are facing challenges. The RBI measures through loan restructuring and providing CRR incentives to the banks to lend to MSMEs would certainly help the exporting sector,” he said.

Ample liquidity with the banks should lead to lowering of interest rates as part of effective transmission of earlier reductions, he added.

Anarock Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said the extension for restructuring of project loans by a year is a major relief to the real estate sector. “Loans for projects that have been delayed for reasons beyond the control of their promoters have been extended by another one year without downgrading the asset classification. This is a big move and will bring the much-needed relief to the cash-starved real estate sector - and to both developers and HFCs from the liquidity perspective,” Puri said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/experts-hail-rbi-measures-to-boost-economy--improve-money-supply.html
149,07-2-20,China to cut tariffs on $75 billion in US imports,"China on Thursday said it will halve punitive tariffs on $75 billion in US imports from February 14, a month after Beijing and Washington signed a truce in their long-running trade war. The reduction will apply to levies of five per cent and 10 per cent that were imposed on more than 1,700 items in September, according to the State Council Tariff Commission.

Products that had been hit by the 10 percent tariffs included fresh seafood, poultry and soybeans.

Tariffs also applied to items such as tungsten lamps for scientific and medical purposes, as well as some types of aircraft. The move is aimed at ""promoting the healthy and stable development of China-US economic and trade relations"", the Commission said in a statement. It added that the reduction will kick in at 0501 GMT on February 14 — the same day Washington is expected to halve tariffs on USD 120 billion worth of Chinese products.

The Commission added it ""hopes that both parties will be able to abide by their agreement, strive to implement its relevant content, (and) boost market confidence"". Other retaliatory tariffs, however, remain in place. The US and China in January signed a partial deal that dialled down tensions in their bruising trade war, with Beijing agreeing to buy an additional USD 200 billion in American goods over the next two years.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/china-to-cut-tariffs-on--75-billion-in-us-imports.html

In the FIR, only 35 people have been named and the rest are unidentified, police said. The FIR lists sedition among the charges.

The protesters accused the police of thrashing them. Police, however, said they used tear gas shells to tackle the protesters when they became unruly.

“The FIR has been registered against 35 named and over 100 unidentified persons involved in anti-CAA protests on Tuesday near Jauhar park in Bilariaganj area. Of them 20 have been arrested,” Superintendent of Police, Triveni Singh, said

He said Tuesday’s protest against the CAA was led by Ulema Council national general secretary Tahir Madni, who was arrested on Wednesday.

The officer said a reward of Rs 25,000 each has been announced on absconding Ulema Council leaders Nurul Huda, Mirza Shane Alam and Osama.

He alleged that the protesters used foul language against Hindus and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

An NGO in Azamgarh has alleged that nineteen people including minors were beaten up and arrested from Bilariaganj area when they were ‘peacefully’ protesting against the amended citizenship law.

“The women were peacefully protesting at Mohd Ali Park. When the women got up from the spot to offer namaaz, the policemen started hurling abuses at them. They even threatened them. The policemen started creating tensions. They beat up the protestors and also pelted stones at them,” Zakir from Al Falah Front, the NGO, said here.

“Women have been beaten up severely, pulled by their hair. One Sharavari Bano was brutally beaten up in front of protestors. She is under treatment at Azamgarh hospital now,” he said.

152,07-2-20,"Kerala CM: No NPR, but will proceed with census","Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday assured the State Assembly that the National Population Register will not be implemented, but the State will go ahead with the census process.

As the Congress-led Opposition UDF and the treasury benches sparred over the NPR, Vijayan said the State cannot cancel the Centre’s notification asking officials to start the enumeration process.

“But we can stay it. We have stayed the NPR process. Since the opposition leader is insisting, the Government will look into it.

We stand by the decision that census will go on. We will not implement NPR. The questionnaire for that is different,” the Chief Minister told the House.

The Government had in December itself ordered stoppage of all activities in connection with NPR in the state considering ‘apprehensions’ of the public that it would lead to NRC in the wake of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Opposition trooped out of the House after Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan refused to allow a notice for adjournment motion urging the Hovernment to temporarily halt the census activities until concerns related to the National Population Register (NPR) were cleared.

The UDF MLAs left the hall even as the chief minister assured the House that all activities related to NPR was put on hold and the State Government had issued direction to the district collectors to stop all NPR related works.

“The census work is nothing new to the State. It is a normal process. Information will only be collected for the census.

The chief secretary has also issued directions to district collectors in this regard,” Vijayan said, replying to an adjournment motion moved by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA K M Shaji.

According to Shaji, NPR and the census require similar data and it was a huge mistake to say that only the census activities will take place.

“The State Government has claimed that it has decided to avoid two questions from the census data questionnaire. But the centre itself has said they don’t require answers to those questions.

The census officials have been appointed and now they will directly report to the centre and not the state government,” Shaji said.

However, Vijayan countered Shaji saying opposition’s attempt to raise the matter in the House was part of “some agenda” as the State Government had made it clear that it will not allow NPR in State. “I would like to make it clear that no detention camps will be opened in Kerala. Enumeration with regard to NPR will not be implemented.

We have issued specific direction on the matter and if any official goes beyond such directions, strong action will be taken,” Vijayan said.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala said they understand the importance of the census process, but cannot allow it to held without addressing the concerns regarding it. “We cannot halt census proceedings. But we cannot simply move forward without addressing the concerns.

Until the confusion and the concerns are cleared, we need to stop the census process,” Chennithala said.

The Congress leader also said even though the chief minister and his party were of the opinion that the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) should not be implemented, two students are now in custody and were being probed by the NIA under UAPA. The veteran leader later told reporters that they were not against the census.

“The President of India says NPR will be implemented, Prime Minister says it will not be implemented, while the Home minister says it will be implemented. It is totally confusing. We need clarity in this matter first,” he said. The state had on January 16 directed all its officials to ensure that NPR was not mentioned while sending the communication on Census 2021. PTI

District collectors were also asked to personally ensure this as the government had in December last year stayed all matters relating to NPR in the state, which were to be conducted along with the first phase of census operations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-cm--no-npr--but-will-proceed-with-census.html

154,07-2-20,Puducherry BJP MLAs oppose any Assembly resolution against CAA,"Puducherry:The BJP in Puducherry on Thursday opposed the Congress Government’s move to table an anti-CAA resolution in the Assembly in the coming sitting, claiming such a course would be violative of Constitution.

A delegation of BJP MLAs, led by its leader V Saminathan, submitted a petition in the office of assembly Speaker VP Sivakolundhu urging him not to permit the Government to table any motion to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the House scheduled to meet on February 12.

The petition was signed by all the three legislators—Saminathan, S.Selvaganapathy and KG Shankar. Saminathan later told reporters that both the Houses of Parliament had already passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill which had since become an act with the President’s assent.

Puducherry functioned under the direct administrative control of the Union Home Ministry and therefore there could be no tabling of any motion againstCAA in the assembly and any debate thereto will be violative of the Constitution, he said.

Besides, the Union Territory Act 1963 also laid down that theterritorial assembly can debate only matters that fell in the domain of the State or concurrent lists of the Seventh schedule of the Constitution.

As citizenship fell under the purview of the Central list, the territorial assembly has no power to discuss it,he said adding any motion to opposethe CAA would be an infringement on the Constitution under which all the MLAs had taken the oath and pledged to uphold it. Chief Minister V Narayanasamy has recently said the government would move a resolution opposing the CAAin the assembly on February 12 Rs come what mayRs .",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/puducherry-bjp-mlas-oppose-any-assembly-resolution-against-caa.html
155,07-2-20,BJP accuses Lalu’s son Tej Pratap of misogyny over Nitish Kumari jibe,"The BJP on Thursday accused RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav of misogyny for his remarks berating Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and asking them to replace Kumar in their names with ‘Kumari’, often used with the names of girls.

Yadav, the elder son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, put his foot in the mouth at an anti-CAA, NRC, NRP rally where he flayed the JD(U), which is headed by Kumar and BJP, to which Sushil Kumar Modi belongs, for the dramatic realignment of the two parties in July, 2017.

“I therefore say Nitish Kumar, whom my father had aptly named palturam (turncoat), can also be called Nitish Kumari. And his companion Sushil Kumar Modi, the bearer of the saffron flag, called Sushil Kumari Modi. They cannot take us head on ... They sit in their homes wearing bangles,” Yadav jeered before the crowds.The RJD rally was held at Masaurhi in rural Patna late on Wednesday night and video clips of it were beamed by local TV news channels.

BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand reacted angrily, demanding an apology from the RJD leader. He reminded Yadav of the allegations of domestic violence that his estranged wife has levelled against him.

“Was Tej Pratap trying to say that those whose names are suffixed with Kumari and who wear bangles deserve no respect? His tasteless remarks and the applause they received from his supporters are proof that misogyny runs deep in the RJD,” Anand said.

He said Yadav’s “misogynistic” remarks lend credence to the charges his wife has levelled against him. He demanded that the RJD leader apologize to the chief minister and his deputy.

“If he is trying to emulate his uncouth father, he must beware he may similarly land in jail one day, the BJP spokesman said.

Modi is scheduled to visit Assam on Friday and address a public rally at Kokrajhar after the Bodo peace agreement, which was signed in New Delhi on January 27.

Guwahati Police Commissioner Munna Prasad Gupta told PTI that the two IEDs were found in the busy Paltanbazar and Panbazar areas of the city late on Wednesday night.

“The bomb squad took the IEDs away from the populous location and those were detonated safely later. We suspect it is the handiwork of ULFA(I),” he added.

158,07-2-20,Finance ministry expects at least 80 pc of taxpayers to move to new tax regime,"The finance ministry expects at least 80 per cent of the taxpayers to move to the new income tax regime, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said on Friday.

The budget 2020-21 has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments.

""We feel at least 80 per cent of the people will come to the new scheme,"" Pandey said during an interaction with opinion makers in the financial capital.

He said the government did an analysis of 5.78 crore taxpayers before the budget and found that 69 per cent of them would save on tax payouts under the new system, while 11 per cent were found to be favouring the old regime.

Of the remaining 20 per cent taxpayers, there will be people who want to avoid the hassle of paperwork and may wish to switch over to the new regime, he said.

The government was in a “catch-22” situation because it wanted to lower tax outgoes for the people and ensure that it eases the process of tax, but did not want to disturb the system due to which it made a beginning by giving people options, he said.

He noted that corporates were also given similar option when the taxes were reduced in September, and that 90 per cent of corporates have embraced the exemption-free approach for lower tax rate now.

“A large majority of people will find the new regime advantageous,” Pandey said.

The government introduced new tax slabs with reduced rates for an annual income of up to Rs 15 lakh for those foregoing exemptions and deductions under a simplified tax regime. The new income tax system is optional and a taxpayer can choose to remain in the existing regime with exemptions and deductions.

Those earning up to Rs 5 lakh will not pay any tax either in the old regime or in the new regime.

""To provide significant relief to individual taxpayers and to simplify the income tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo all the deductions and exemptions,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharmam said in the budget speech.

Under the new tax proposal, people with an annual income of up to Rs 2.5 lakh will not have to pay any tax. For income between Rs 2.5 lakh to 5 lakh, the tax rate (as earlier) is 5 per cent.

Further, those with an income of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh will have to pay a reduced tax rate of 10 per cent; between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh 15 per cent; between Rs 10 lakh and 12.5 lakh 20 per cent; between Rs 12.5 lakh and 15 lakh 25 per cent; and above Rs 15 lakh 30 per cent.

""The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers. An individual who is currently availing more deductions and exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in the old regime,"" the minister said, adding the proposal will entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 40,000 crore per annum.

Observing that there are about 100 tax exemptions and deductions, she said 70 of them are being removed in the new simplified tax regime, while the remaining will be reviewed and examined in due course.

Many analysts said the move will deter individuals from investing in almost all asset classes like home, mutual funds and also even taking a medical insurance. Analysts also expect majority to continue with the old slabs as that get them additional deductions.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finance-ministry-expects-at-least-80-pc-of-taxpayers-to-move-to-new-tax-regime-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/finance-ministry-expects-at-least-80-pc-of-taxpayers-to-move-to-new-tax-regime.html
159,07-2-20,Trump acquitted,"The Republican-controlled Senate has acquitted Donald Trump in his high-profile impeachment trial, giving the US President a major political victory in an election year but not before bitterly dividing the country and costing millions of dollars to the tax payers.

The Senate voted on Wednesday 52-48 to acquit Trump of abuse of power and 53-47 to absolve him of obstruction of Congress, the two charges he faced. The vote along party lines foiled the Democratic Party’s determined bid to overthrow Trump from the White House ahead of the November 3 presidential election.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the articles of impeachment on December 18 after charging Trump with pressuring Ukraine to smear former US vice president Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential election, using nearly USD 400 million in military aid as leverage.

Though Trump, 73, has been acquitted, he will become the first impeached President to seek re-election.

A two-thirds majority vote was needed to remove Trump, which was always going to be a long shot in a 100-member Senate controlled by his Republican Party with 53 seats. “For now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation,” The New York Times reported. “The outcome represented a political triumph for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell...,” The Washington Post noted.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the Opposition Democrats. “Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J Trump. As we have said all along, he is not guilty,” she said.

“The Senate voted to reject the baseless articles of impeachment, and only the President’s political opponents — all Democrats, and one failed Republican presidential candidate — voted for the manufactured impeachment articles,” Grisham said.

Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said, “The do-nothing Democrats know they can’t beat him, so they had to impeach him. This terrible ordeal was always a campaign tactic to invalidate the 2016 votes of 63 million Americans and was a transparent effort to interfere with the 2020 election, only nine months away.”

Democratic Party accused the Republican-dominated Senate of ignoring the facts, “the will of the American people and their duty to the Constitution”.

“Today, the President and Senate Republicans have normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances of our Constitution,” said Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

“The President will boast that he has been acquitted. There can be no acquittal without a trial, and there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence,” she said, a day after the powerful Democrat tore her copy of Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress.

“By suppressing the evidence and rejecting the most basic elements of a fair judicial process, the Republican Senate made themselves willing accomplices to the President’s cover-up,” Pelosi said.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer described it as a sad day for the country. “The US Senate, acting as a court of impeachment under our Constitution, did not remove a president who abused his power and invited foreign interference in the upcoming election to benefit himself personally,” he said.

“The bipartisan vote in favour of holding him accountable and preserving, protecting, and defending our Constitution against a clear, impeachable offense was, unfortunately, not enough to overcome a partisan firewall of senators who chose loyalty to President Trump over loyalty to their oaths,” Hoyer said. In her statement, White House Press Secretary Grisham said it was yet another witch-hunt that deprived the President of his due process and rights and was based on a series of lies.

“Representative Adam Schiff lied to Congress and the American people with a totally made up statement about the President’s phone call. “Will there be no retribution? Speaker Nancy Pelosi also lied to the American people

about the need to swiftly pass impeachment articles they dreamt up, only to

sit on them for a month before sending over to the Senate,” she said.

“In the Senate, the Democrats continued to make their political motivations clear — Rep. Schiff proclaimed the issues ‘cannot be decided at the ballot box’ — proving once again they think they know better than the voters of this country.

This entire effort by the Democrats was aimed at overturning the results of the 2016 election and interfering with the 2020 election,” Grisham said. According to an estimate from the Heritage Foundation, the House of Representatives inquiry, cost taxpayers an estimated USD 3.06 million.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-acquitted.html

162,07-2-20,Coronavirus death toll rises to 564,"China on Thursday denounced as “rumours and lies” the reports of a much higher death toll and infected cases in the coronavirus outbreak that it said has killed 564 people as the authorities finished work on a second hospital to treat thousands of patients suffering from the disease.

Overall 564 people have died in China due to the virus on Wednesday and 28,018 confirmed cases have been reported from 31 provincial-level regions, the National Health Commission reported on Thursday.

On Wednesday, 73 people died — the highest casualty in a single day — due to the virus and the new confirmed cases of the epidemic went up by 3,694, it added.

Chinese officials said 19 foreign nationals living in the country have been confirmed of contracting the novel coronavirus as of Thursday, but did not disclose their nationalities.

China also said it has lodged diplomatic protests with countries whose airlines have cancelled flights to Chinese cities alleging that they are spreading panic in the wake of deadly coronavirus.

Seventy of the deaths reported on Wednesday were from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, where

China is building a large number of hospitals at frantic pace, including converting stadiums, auditoriums and schools into hospitals to cope up with the cases.

China on Thursday opened a new 1,500-bed makeshift hospital especially built for virus patients days after a 1,000-bed hospital started functioning with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms in Wuhan. Chinese officials argue that the death toll and confirmed cases are rising in Hubei province because of lack of enough hospitals and beds.

State-run China Global Television Network, or CGTN, showed new tent hospitals coming up in the city to treat patients besides a host of mobile clinics.

Meanwhile, China vehemently denied a Taiwan media report that Beijing is under-reporting the death toll and infected cases from the virus outbreak. Tencent, which runs popular social media APP weChat, over the weekend seems to have “inadvertently released what is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths, which were astronomically higher than the official figures,” Taiwan News reported.

When asked to comment on the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing online on Thursday that “we have noted some rumours and lies on this epidemic, which are worse than the virus itself”.

“You may have noted that even WHO Director-General has repeatedly called on people to not believe in rumours or spreading them. In some countries, relevant departments have been stepping up efforts to bring to justice to those creating and spreading rumours,” she said.

“There have been big problems in China’s response to the coronavirus that have worsened the outbreak,” Roth told reporters in Geneva, although he also said China deserved credit for sharing the DNA sequence of the virus early on.

164,07-2-20,Chinese doctor who first warned about coronavirus outbreak dies,"Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, one of the eight whistle-blowers who warned other medics of the coronavirus outbreak but were reprimanded by the police, died of the epidemic on Thursday, official media reported.

Li, a 34-year-old doctor who tried to warn other medics of the epidemic, died of coronavirus on Thursday in Wuhan, the state-run Global Times reported. He was the first to report about the virus way back in December last year when it first emerged in Wuhan, the provincial capital of China’s central Hubei province.

He dropped a bombshell in his medical school alumni group on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and quarantined in his hospital. Li explained that, according to a test he had seen, the illness was a coronavirus — a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which led to 800 death in China and the world in 2003.

Li told his friends to warn their loved ones privately. But within hours screenshots of his messages had gone viral - without his name being blurred. “When I saw them circulating online, I realised that it was out of my control and I would probably be punished,” Li was quoted as saying CNN recently.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/chinese-doctor-who-first-warned-about-coronavirus-outbreak-dies.html
165,07-2-20,"GST evasion: Centre, State tax officers to share taxpayers info to tighten enforcement","Central and state tax officers will share information about taxpayers for enforcement action as the government looks to tighten enforcement measures to check GST evasion.

167,07-2-20,RBI raises CPI inflation projection to 6.5% for Jan-Mar,"The Reserve Bank of India has raised upwards its retail inflation projection for the last quarter of the current fiscal to 6.5 per cent on increase in prices of milk, pulses amid volatile crude oil prices and termed the overall outlook on price rise as ""highly uncertain"".

Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors like food inflation, crude prices and input costs for services, RBI said.

On food inflation, RBI said it is likely to soften from the high levels registered in December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during the fourth quarter of this fiscal as onion prices ease following arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its last bi-monthly monetary policy revealed on Thursday. The RBI has kept the key repo rate unchanged to 5.15 per cent.

""Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20 (January-March 2020); 5.4-5 per cent for H1:2020-21 (April-September 2020); and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21 (October-December), with risks broadly balanced,"" RBI said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-raises-cpi-inflation-projection-to-6-5--for-jan-mar.html
168,07-2-20,RBI rules out printing more money to cover fiscal deficit,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said the central bank has no plans to monetise the rising fiscal deficit. This is the third consecutive year that the government has revised its fiscal deficit target.

The budget has pegged fiscal deficit at 3.8 per cent for the current fiscal year, up from 3.3 per cent projected in the previous budget; and at 3.5 per cent for FY21, up from 3 per cent estimated in the July 2019.

The government has already crossed the fiscal deficit at 132 per cent of the estimate as of December end.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-rules-out-printing-more-money-to-cover-fiscal-deficit.html
169,07-2-20,RBI keeps interest rates unchanged,"The Reserve Bank on Thursday expectedly kept interest rates unchanged amid uncertain inflation outlook but left the door open for more easing in future even as it took steps to spur credit growth in an economy facing its worst slowdown in more than a decade.

With all six members of the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-led Monetary Policy Committee voting unanimously, the repurchase or repo rate was maintained at 5.15 per cent while retaining its accommodative stance.

With food prices driving retail inflation to a more than five-year high of 7.35 per cent in December, the central bank raised its inflation projection for the six months to September to 5-5.4 per cent from 3.8-4 per cent previously while terming the outlook on price rise as ""highly uncertain"".

The RBI cut its policy rate by 135 basis points over five straight meetings last year, before hitting the pause button in December on inflationary concerns.

The RBI stuck to its prediction of 5 per cent GDP growth in the current fiscal - the lowest in 11 years but lowered its growth forecast for the first half of the coming financial year to 5.5-6 per cent from its December projection of 5.9-6.3 per cent. For the full 2020-21 fiscal, it put the GDP growth at 6 per cent, which is at the lower end of the 6-6.5 per cent expansion projected by the government's Economic Survey.

To boost credit growth, it scrapped the mandatory requirement for banks to set aside cash of 4 per cent for every new loan extended to retail automobiles, residential housing, and small businesses till July 2020.

Also, in a major relief to the real estate sector, the RBI extended the restructuring of project loans by a year. Loans for projects that have been delayed for reasons beyond the control of their promoters have been extended by another one year without downgrading the asset classification. This aligns with the treatment accorded to other project loans for the non-infrastructure sector.

The move will bring much-needed relief to the cash-starved real estate sector.

At a news conference, Das said while the pause decision may be on expected lines, the RBI has several instruments up its sleeves, hinting at the use of unconventional tools such as the ones used by the US after the global financial crisis in 2008 to boost growth as rate cuts were not effective enough.

""It has to be kept in mind that the central bank has several instruments at its command that it can deploy to address the challenges the Indian economy faces in terms of sluggishness in growth momentum,"" he said.

The MPC said that while easing global trade tensions should encourage exports and spur new investment, the outbreak of the new coronavirus may impact tourist arrivals and global trade.

""Downside risks to global growth have increased in the context of the outbreak of coronavirus, the full effects of which are still uncertain and unfolding,” Das said.

The MPC said economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. ""Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo.""

On the announcements made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget last week, the MPC said, ""the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21, should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending.""

It said though there has been a 0.50 per cent fiscal slippage in FY20, that has not increased the market borrowings, and also noted that the government has budgeted for a Rs 70,000 crore increase in the gross borrowings in FY2021 when it has managed to crimp the fiscal gap to 3.5 per cent.

However, in the current year, the government will miss the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent as it witnessed shortfall in tax revenue due to economic slowdown and a cut in the corporate tax rate.

""The Union Budget 2020-21 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. While the emphasis on boosting the rural economy and infrastructure should help the growth momentum in the near-term, the corporate tax rate cuts of September 2019 should help boost the growth potential over the medium-term,"" the MPC said.

There is a need for ""adjustment"" in interest rates on small saving schemes, the MPC said, adding that the external benchmark system adopted from October 1, has strengthened monetary policy transmission.

The government is likely to revise small savings rates downward in the coming quarter beginning in April.

Commenting on the policy, Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India said: ""The RBI decided not to cut rates and to be in a wait-and-watch mode in the February policy meeting while continuing on with an 'accommodative' stance. This is because inflationary nor demand pressures for goods other than food in the near future may remain low owing to weak demand and excess capacity issues.""

The expansionary monetary policy stance was necessary and is an assurance that there will be no reversal of easing and that the RBI will not hike rates immediately, she said, adding the current slowdown in the economy is driven by liquidity issues, slow credit off-take, and weak rural demand.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged.html
170,07-2-20,UK High Court to set terms in Chinese banks' claim against Anil Ambani,"The High Court of England and Wales here on Friday will set the terms for the ""conditional order"" of a payment into court it had granted to three Chinese banks last year against Reliance Communications boss Anil Ambani.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd Mumbai Branch, on behalf of itself, China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China, had sought summary judgment against Ambani over an alleged breach of a personal guarantee on a debt refinancing loan of around USD 925 million in February 2012.

Ambani denies providing authority for any such guarantee, resulting in the High Court action in the UK – the jurisdiction agreed to as part of the terms of the loan agreement.

At the last hearing in the case in December last year, Justice David Waksman said he was ""very nearly prepared"" to grant judgment against Ambani because he found the Reliance Communications (RCom) chief's evidence ""inexplicably incomplete, implausible and highly unlikely"".

""I think it is highly probable that at trial his defence will be shown to be opportunistic and false… I consider that this is a plain case for the making of a conditional order,"" Justice Waksman said, as he granted a conditional order in principle to the Chinese banks.

The order means the Commercial Division of the High Court will hear arguments this week on Ambani's financial means and set an appropriate amount as an effective court deposit, pending a full trial in the case.

The focus of Ambani's evidence at the hearing last year revolved around a Power of Attorney (POA), which he claims he was unaware was being required as security by the banks.

There are references to a non-binding ""comfort letter"" and RCom executives, including Hasit Shukla, who allegedly kept him in the dark over the true nature of any personal guarantee.

""The essential thrust of Ambani's evidence is not merely that he was unaware that the POA was in respect of a guarantee, he was never aware at any stage that this was being required as security by the bank. He had no inkling of it at all,"" notes the judgment dated December 16, 2019.

""A truly remarkable feature of Ambani's case is that he has himself proffered no explanation as to why he should have been deceived in this way, nor has he provided any evidence as to what he did when he discovered, in early 2017, the existence of the guarantee signed by Shukla,"" the judge noted.

According to court documents, RCom had sought the loan from the Chinese banks in order to meet its obligations under certain foreign currency convertible bonds due to mature on March 1, 2012. It went on to default on the payments agreed under the loan arrangement and between February and November 2017, the banks made various demands for payment.

On May 24, 2019, the banks eventually issued an application for summary judgment, alternatively for a conditional order requiring Ambani to pay into court all or some of the sum claimed ""on the basis that on any view his defence is improbable"".

Following the hearing on Friday, the judge may give his verdict on the amount to be paid into the court or reserve judgment to be handed down at a later date.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-high-court-to-set-terms-in-chinese-banks--claim-against-anil-ambani-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/uk-high-court-to-set-terms-in-chinese-banks--claim-against-anil-ambani.html
171,07-2-20,Budget 2020 provides 'discreet and considered' stimulus: FM,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the budget presented by her last week provides a ""discreet and considered"" stimulus.

Speaking to industry representatives in the financial capital, Sitharaman said the budget draws on experiences of all the past instances of a slowdown in growth where the government has had to provide for a booster.

It can be noted that some constituencies have expressed disappointment with the budget for not having any big announcements, especially at a time when growth has slipped to a decadal low.

""Based on the experiences that we had in the last round of government trying to provide stimulus, We've essentially made sure that we are doing it in a very discreet and considered manner,"" Sitharaman said at the interaction.

""We kept the macroeconomic fundamentals in mind and made sure that the necessary stimulus which was the demand of the time, both for increasing consumption and also for ensuring investments in long-term asset building as a means to providing stimulus will be taken up,"" she added.

Accompanied by all the secretaries in the ministry, Sitharaman said unlike the past instances of providing for a stimulus, the remedies that the budget have provided are ""very focused, very clear that it is going in a well chalked out path with a clear intention of spending responsibly in building capital assets"".

She pointed out that the rural and farm sector had got attention through the 16-point agenda, startups have been given a fillip and infrastructure investments have also been taken up.""The remedy is a considered remedy. I'm sure discerning people will be able to see why it is so,"" she said.

Sitharaman said divestments are necessary to get transparency in the working of companies by making necessary disclosures.

She added that the government will only sell those companies where it sees no strategic rationale in running those.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/budget-2020-provides--discreet-and-considered--stimulus--fm-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/budget-2020-provides--discreet-and-considered--stimulus--fm.html

176,07-2-20,Bayern survive late Hoffenheim comeback,"Thomas Mueller weighed in with a goal and an assist as holders Bayern Munich edged a 4-3 thriller with Hoffenheim on Wednesday to reach the German Cup quarter-finals.

Mueller’s golden run continued at the Allianz Arena to leave him with seven goals and nine assists in the 14 games since Hansi Flick replaced Niko Kovac as coach last November.

Not to be outdone, Mueller’s strike partner Lewandowski claimed two goals in the third-round tie.

However, Hoffenheim’s Israeli forward Munas Dabbur caused Bayern a few nervous moments with two late goals as the visitors threatened a fightback from 4-1 down.

“In the second half, we gave too much ball away and let them come back into the game,” admitted Bayern winger Serge Gnabry.

“We have to look at that, however we had a lot of fun going forward in attack.”

It was Mueller who had calmed Bayern’s early nerves, forcing an own goal from Benjamin Huebner to equalise after Bayern defender Jerome Boateng had turned the ball into his own net.

Mueller then gave Bayern a 2-1 lead before Lewandowski netted either side of half-time to extend their lead before Hoffenheim’s late fightback.

178,07-2-20,Archer out of IPL with stress fracture,"Top England fast bowler Jofra Archer was on Thursday ruled out of the upcoming Indian Premier League due to a stress fracture in his right elbow.

The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that Archer, who plays for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, will also miss England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka. He is expected to be out of action for three months.

“Archer underwent further scans on his injured right elbow yesterday in the UK which confirmed a low grade stress fracture,” said the ECB in a statement.

“He will now commence an injury rehabilitation programme with the ECB medical team with a view to be ready for the international summer campaign starting in June against the West Indies in a three-match Test series,” it added.

Archer experienced discomfort in his right elbow during the series in South Africa when he could only play the Boxing Day Test.

The 24-year-old Barbados born pacer has represented England in seven Tests and 14 ODIs, taking 30 and 23 wickets respectively. He has also played a T20I.

His absence is a big blow to the Rajasthan Royals ahead of the IPL beginning next month.

In 21 IPL games, Archer has picked up 26 wickets at an average of 23.69.

Mahmudul Hason Joy rose to the occasion with a 100 off 127 balls, helping Bangladesh overcome the 212-run target in 44.1 overs.

After losing the openers cheaply in the chase, Joy paired up with Towhid Hridoy (40) first before teaming up with Shahadat Hussain (40 not out) to share a 101-run stand for the fourth wicket and fashion a resounding win.

New Zealand had recovered to make 211 for eight from 74 for four, courtesy an unbeaten 75 offf 83 balls from Beckham Wheeler-Greenall.

Shoriful Islam was the pick of the bowlers for Bangladesh, taking three wickets for 45 runs in 10 overs.

The final between defending champions India and Bangladesh will be played here on Sunday. Like India, Bangladesh too are unbeaten in the tournament.

Bangladesh captain Akbar Ali said his team will have to play its best cricket to upstage India.

“We will play it as a normal game. We can’t take the pressure of thinking that this is our first final. India is a very good side, and we have to play our A game. We have to do the best in all three departments. Bangladeshi cricket fans are crazy, and I hope we will continue to get the same support that we've been getting,” said Ali at the post-match presentation.

One can expect a close finish considering India scraped through by five runs in a low-scoring Asia Cup final against Bangladesh in September.

Hacked, directed by Vikram Bhatt, is one such story. It revolves around a successful businesswoman (played by Hina Khan), who is tracked by a 19-year-old lover (played by Rohan Shah). The film highlights how cyber-security and online privacy is in danger these days and how easily anyone can be a target.

Actor Hina Khan tells us that Vikram narrated many such real incidents. One of his friends was stalked so much that she was forced to move to a different city. Many are still unaware of her whereabouts. “It’s so sad. You can’t use your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or any social media account because a hacker might get to know where you are. You are terrified for the rest of your life. It’s very unfortunate that a lot of them have taken their lives because they can’t deal with it,” says she.

It’s important to realise that it is easy for hackers to steal your passwords. We use email every day and nothing much has changed since the first one was sent in 1971. However, its use is more widespread which has made it easier for individuals to access other people’s emails and see what is being sent. We are now much more vulnerable to hackers stealing information such as your contact lists, confidential information and bank details, feels Hina.

Fan of using public WiFi? Yes, it’s convenient and free but have you ever questioned whether is it secure? While shooting, she learnt that she needs to be careful while logging on to a public network. She says, “Most WiFi hotspots don’t encrypt the information you send over the internet and if the network requires a password, it’s most likely not a secured network. If a stranger comes to your place and you give access to your WiFi, s/he can hack all the devices in your house. So now I don’t give my password to anyone. All this is so scary.”

Hina feels that somewhere even we are responsible. “We want to put our best foot forward on social media, when it comes to pictures, tweets and everything. I go to gym, click pictures, post them. We also store our intimate moments in our galleries. We should not be doing that. When we are not going to post it, why risk it? It’s very important to talk about these things. We might get stuck in relationships where there are trust issues. There are ways to navigate these but we don’t do that and get carried away,” she points out.

While such shows are intended to make the audience aware of online crime, do they also give ideas to people who have a negative mind? Actor Rohan Shah says, “Anyone will watch what they find interesting. You cannot say that you are putting those ideas in someone’s head as in order to teach how to deal with such situations, you have to show them too, isn’t it? You cannot make everyone among the audience think the same way. They will eventually think different no matter what. It only depends on the person and the way s/he looks at things. Technically, koi kisi ko sikha nahi sakta unless voh khud sikhna nahi chahta. A teacher can only share things and it’s the student who will grab only what he likes.”

Hina agrees with Rohan and says, “When we make any film, there’s always evil and good. You can’t just have good in the film and expect it to succeed. Do we get inspired by evil? No, right? So it’s up to the person. Such films are a learning experience for people and not to put them on the wrong path.”

It’s the first time that Rohan is playing a dark and negative character. So how did he prepare for it? Were there any references that he had to take up? He says that to learn the technicalities of the character, there was a team. “I just had to prepare for the emotional quotient, which is to understand the mind of the character. Why is he doing such things? My prep was only to realise what and why. There were no references as such. My script was my only Bible.”

The Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actor tells us that she didn’t give any audition for Hacked. When Vikram narrated the script, she wasn’t convinced at the first go. “I was very confused. I never thought I would debut in a film with such an impactful topic. Also, this film has been co-written by an ethical hacker. Eventually, all this moved me,” says she.

Well, it all seems perfect on the outside but a lot of uncertainties and challenges have gone behind Hina’s success in the industry. She believes that god has been kind on her. Her mantra is to never stop working. “I believe in the amalgamation of hard work and destiny. They can make you reach where you wish to,” says she. So how does she cope up with the negative criticism and trolling towards her work? She tells us that you can’t really do anything about people. She adds, “I just pity them because all they need is attention. It’s like — kuch toh log kahenge, logon ka kaam hai kehna.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/you---re-being-watched-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/you---re-being-watched.html
181,07-2-20,End of the Golden Age,"Kirk Douglas rose from poverty to become the king of Hollywood and lived an American story of reinvention and perseverance

He was born Issur Danielovitch, a ragman’s son. He died Kirk Douglas, a Hollywood king. Douglas, the muscular, tempestuous actor with the dimpled chin, lived out an epic American story of reinvention and perseverance, from the riches he acquired and risked to the parts he took on and the boundaries he defied. Among the most popular, versatile and recognisable leading men of the 20th century, he could will himself into a role or a favourite cause as mightily as he willed himself out of poverty.

Douglas, who died at 103, was a force for change and symbol of endurance. He is remembered now as a final link to a so-called Golden Age, the father of Oscar winner Michael Douglas and a man nearly as old as the industry itself. But in his prime, he represented a new kind of performer, more independent and adventurous than Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and other greats of the studio era of the 1930s and 1940s, and more willing to speak his mind. His career began at the peak of the studios’ power and ended in a more diverse, decentralised age that he helped bring about.

Reaching stardom after World War-II, he was as likely to play cads (the producer in Bad and the Beautiful, the journalist in Ace in the Hole) as he was suited for the hero-slave in Spartacus, as alert to the business as he was at home before the camera. He was producing his own films at a time most stars were content to act and was working with an enviable range of directors, from a young Stanley Kubrick to a middle-aged John Huston, from a genius of noir like Jacques Tourneur to such master satirists as Billy Wilder and Joseph L Mankiewicz.

Acting served as escape and as confession. His favourite among dozens of films was the contemporary Western Lonely are the Brave, which came out in 1962 and included a line of dialogue Douglas called the most personal he ever spoke, “I’m a loner clear down deep to my very guts.”

He never won a competitive Oscar, but he received an honorary one, along with a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute, an honorary Golden Globe and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. His standing came in part from his role in the downfall of Hollywood’s blacklist, which ruined the careers of writers suspected of pro-Communist activity.

By the end of the 1950s, the use of banned writers was widely known within the industry, but not to the general public. Douglas, who years earlier had reluctantly signed a loyalty oath to get the starring role in Lust for Life, delivered a crucial blow when he openly credited the blacklisted Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo for script work on Spartacus, the Roman epic about a slave rebellion that was released in 1960.

The most famous words in a Douglas film were said about him, not by him, in Spartacus. Roman officials tell a gathering of slaves their lives will be spared if they identify their leader. As Douglas rises, a growing chorus of slaves jump up and shout, “I’m Spartacus!” Douglas stands silently, a tear rolling down his face.

Critic David Thomson dubbed Douglas “the manic-depressive among Hollywood stars, one minute bearing down on plot, dialogue and actresses with the gleeful appetite of a man just freed from Siberia, at other times writhing not just in agony but mutilation and a convincingly horrible death.” While filming Lust for Life, he was so caught up in Vincent Van Gogh he feared becoming suicidal himself.

Issur Danielovitch took the name Kirk Douglas as he worked his way through the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, choosing “Douglas” because he wanted his last name still to begin with “D” and “Kirk” because he liked the hard, jagged sound of the “K.”

In March 2009, he appeared in a one-man show, Before I Forget, recounting his life and famous friends. The four-night show in the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City was sold out. “You know, I never wanted to be a film actor,” Douglas had said. “My goal in life was to be a star on stage. Now I know how to do it. Build your own theatre.” —AP",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/end-of-the-golden-age-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/end-of-the-golden-age.html
182,07-2-20,In touch with yin,"Tera Vita, the new kid on the block at Khan Market, with its ultra-feminine decor and cheese-laden menu is the place to hang out with your women friends, says Saimi Sattar

Petite, feminine, pretty, candy floss — some of the words that come crowding around as soon as we ascend the steps to reach Tera Vita, a new restaurant in Khan Market. Done up in shades of pink and blue, the restaurant has small niches, quirky posters and more which add to its hip young image ideal for a girls’ night out. It has an old-world charm which transports you to a corner of Europe. Certainly a place where you can click Instagram-worthy images.

The brain behind the restaurant is the very young and affable Chahat Jain, who tells us it was two things that inspired her to start the place. Having travelled the world, she felt that there were certain segments in food that lacked authenticity in India and she wanted to plug that gap. The second factor was that her elder brother is one of the founders of Grub Fest, the most successful food festival, held in the capital. “I had a job at hand but the joining date kept getting delayed. My brother wanted me to be a part of his team but I wanted to strike out on my own,” she says.

First, she started out with a food delivery service and then decided to start a dine-in. the result was Tera Vita. The restaurant is named ‘Tera’ after the Roman goddess of the ‘Earth’ Terra, while ‘Vita’ translates as ‘Life’ in Italian. “Everything here, from the colours and furniture to the posters and artefacts have all been selected by me. In fact my family tried to take off some load and bought some pieces but it was not what I had in mind and got it all changed,” she says.

Coming to food, the first thing that grabbed eyeballs was Invisible salad because of its name. I noticed the ingredients only later and that made me certain that this was the dish I wanted to go for. A mix of green apple, goat cheese, mesclun greens and candied nuts, tossed in a sundried tomato paste made for a mix that was healthy and decadent at the same time. While the greens and the fruit made it nice and crunchy, it was the goat cheese which added a smooth texture, a slightly salty taste and creaminess to the melange. I could practically make a meal out of this.

Next up was the Charm brocolli, which was served with harissa, sour cream and peanut crumble which combined both crunch and smooth texture. However, it was the Heaven brulee with its warm Italian goat cheese, roasted beetroot, peeled mandarins and roasted walnuts that had my heart. Not only did it walk the tightrope between the textures but also balanced the flavours with equal panache. The tart mandarin, slightly sweet beetroot, nutty sweet walnut and salty cheese were polished off the plate in record time. This one is certainly a winner on hands. And incidentally, also the owner’s favourite

Another one would be the House prawns, cooked with nothing more than roasted garlic, onion and olive which was served with sourdough crisps. while the prawns were cooked just right, the garlic added a pungent flavour while onions and olives make for value additions.

Certainly the place to head to when you head out with your girl gang next time.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-touch-with-yin-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/in-touch-with-yin.html
183,07-2-20,Make it count,"Changing numbers reveal inexact science of calorie labels

Almonds used to have about 170 calories per serving. Then researchers said it was really more like 130. A little later, they said the nuts may have even less.

Calorie counting can be a simple way to help maintain a healthy weight — don’t eat and drink more than you burn. And the calorie labels on food packaging seem like an immutable guide to help you track what you eat. But the shifting numbers for almonds show how the figures printed on nutrition labels may not be as precise as they seem.

Last month, Kind said it was lowering the calorie counts for its snack bars, even though the ingredients weren’t changing. The company cited studies that indicate nuts have fewer digestible calories than previously believed.

Conducted by government researchers with funding from nut producers, the studies show the inexact method of determining calorie counts established more than a century ago. The widely used system says a gram of carbohydrates and a gram of protein each have four calories, while a gram of fat has around nine. Companies can also subtract some calories based on past estimates of how much of different foods are not digested.

But based on anecdotal comments, researchers suspected more of the nutrients in nuts may be expelled in the bathroom than previously estimated. “If they’re not digested, then maybe the calorie content is not correct,” said David Baer, a co-author of the nut studies at the US Department of Agriculture, which funded the research along with nut producers like the Almond Board of California.

To test the hunch, Baer and colleagues gave 18 people meals with and without raw almonds and instructed them to return daily with their urine and stool packed in dry ice. The contents were analysed to calculate that a serving of almonds has about 130 digestible calories, rather than the widely used figure of 170.

A few years later, in 2016, another study by Baer and colleagues also looked at the effects of food processing. They found cooking and grinding helped break down cell walls in almonds, freeing more calories for digestion. Roasted almonds had slightly more digestible calories than raw almonds. When the nuts were ground up into almond butter, nearly all the calories were digested.

Notably, the second study also found raw almonds had even fewer digestible calories than suggested by the first study. Baer attributed the discrepancy to variations in how people digest foods and natural differences in almonds themselves.

“It’s unlikely you’re going to get the exact same number every time you repeat the experiment,” he said. The almond studies are among several Baer has co-authored on the digestibility of nuts. Another last year was funded by the Global Cashew Council and found cashews had fewer calories than estimated.

Despite his findings, Baer said he thinks the calorie counts used for most other foods are fairly accurate. And even though the US Food and Drug Administration lets companies use different methods to determine calorie counts, the agency says products aren’t supposed to have more than 20 per cent more calories than what’s stated on labels.

That’s why health experts said that the calorie counts on nutrition labels are still valuable: They offer general guidance for people trying to keep their weight in check. But it’s even more important to pay attention to overall diet and not get hung up on small caloric differences, experts said. “That’s not what’s going to make or break someone’s attempt at weight management,” said Elizabeth Mayer-Davis, a University of North Carolina nutrition professor.

Mayer said that the studies on the calories in nuts wouldn’t affect her general advice that they can be part of a healthy diet. She said it’s more important to pay attention to how they’re prepared, such as whether sweeteners are added. Kind’s founder, Daniel Lubetzky, said he hopes the studies will help overcome the reluctance some might have about eating nuts because of their relatively higher calorie counts. The studies also mean the company’s most popular bar can now drop from 200 to 180 calories, which could be a marketing advantage that sways decisions at the grocery store. “It can’t hurt.” Lubetzky said Mars, which took a minority stake in Kind in 2017, said it doesn’t have plans to update the calorie counts for M&M’s with almonds. The Almond Board says it’s not aware of other companies yet using the lower numbers.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/make-it-count-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/make-it-count.html

185,07-2-20,Surya ton leads Mumbai’s fightback,"Suryakumar Yadav blazed his way to 134 to lead Mumbai’s fight back on the third day of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy game against Saurashtra after the domestic giants conceded 73 runs first-innings lead.

After losing opener Bhupen Lalwani (3) early, Surya (134 off 130 balls, 17x4, 3x6) and Jay Bista (46) wiped out the deficit in just 16 overs to keep Mumbai in the hunt at the SCA Stadium in Khandheri.

Surya notched up his 14th first-class 100, as he played his usual aggressive game, while Bista played second fiddle.

The duo added 119-runs for the second wicket and their partnership brought Mumbai back into the contention in what is a must-win game.

Surya got a life at 44 and he made optimum use of it.

All-rounder Shams Mulani was promoted to number four and he added 98 runs for the third wicket with Surya as Mumbai looked to gain the upper-hand.

But left-arm orthodox spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, who troubled Surya, won the battle after trapping him in front of the wicket.

In-form Sarfaraz Khan joined Mulani and the two remained unbeaten when stumps were drawn with Mumbai at 285 for 3, extending the lead by 212 runs.

Earlier, resuming at the overnight 257 for 6, Saurashtra overhauled Mumbai’s first-innings score of 262.

A gritty unbeaten 84 by Chirag Jani helped the hosts take a 73-run first innings lead.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu defeated Baroda by an innings and 57 runs at Motibaug Ground in Vadodara with right-arm medium pacer K Vignesh taking a fifer in the second essay.

Due to Vignesh’s heroics with the ball, Tamil Nadu dismissed the hosts for 259 in their second innings to register an emphatic win and picked up seven points.

His haul included the key wicket of captain Krunal Pandya, who made a defiant 74 (95 balls, 10 fours, 2 sixes), having him caught in the deep by substitute M Siddharth and Deepak Hooda (4).

The 25-year-old medium-pacer, who made a comeback into the team after being dropped for the match against Railways (which Tamil Nadu won comprehensively), said it was good to be back in the squad and among wickets too.

“The wicket was good and we had to really bowl well in the second innings because it slightly eased out after we batted,” Vignesh said.

Anuj raises Delhi hopes

New Delhi: Wicketkeeper batsman Anuj Rawat’s stroke-filled hundred gave Delhi a slim chance of an outright win after Gujarat got the all-important first innings lead in group A encounter.

In reply to Delhi’s 293, Gujarat scored 335 after starting the day at 269 for 4 with Manprit Juneja (124, 190 balls) and Dhruv Raval (94)’s 221-run stand for the fifth wicket proving crucial in a 42-run lead.

However left-handed Anuj, a former India U19 captain, then took the attack back to the opposition camp with a superb 133 off 194 balls that had 15 fours and two sixes.

Delhi ended the day at 228 for four with a lead of 186 runs going into the final day.

While the chances of an outright win on a good batting track might not be more than 25 percent but Anuj’s innings certainly gave Delhi a glimmer of hope if they can get a lead of 275 by lunch and get 60 overs at opposition.

“That’s the plan. The wicket is good for batting but it is slightly up and down at times. But yes, bowlers need to bend their backs,” said the student of Rajkumar Sharma, who is also Virat Kohli’s coach.

Goa return to top

Sovima: Goa dished out an all-round performance to thrash Nagaland by 229 runs inside three days to return to the top of Plate table.

With a cushion of 142-run first innings lead, Snehal Kauthankar (68 not out from 63 balls; 9x4s, 1x6) and skipper Amit Verma (66 from 73 balls; 6x4s, 2x6s) put together 103 runs in 95 balls for the fourth wicket to declare their second essay at 221 for four, setting a stiff 364 target for the hosts

In reply, only three Nagaland batsmen reached double digit scores as they were folded for 134 in 36.4 overs to suffer their second defeat this season.

Stuart Binny top-scored with 58 but there was little support from the other end with Shrikant Mundhe (38) being the other batsman to reach double figures.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/surya-ton-leads-mumbai---s-fightback.html

187,07-2-20,T20 WC has potential to turn around women’s cricket: Lanning,"Four-time champion Australia’s skipper Meg Lanning believes the upcoming ICC Twenty20 World Cup has the potential to turn around the fortune of women’s cricket across the globe.

The ICC Women’s T20 World Cup will be hosted by Australia from February 21 to March 8 and Lanning said with so much hype and buzz around, the tournament has the potential to infuse life into women’s cricket.

“This tournament can be a real turning point for women’s sport around the world, it’s a really big event, there’s a lot of talk around it — certainly more hype than I’ve ever experienced before — so hopefully that’s a sign of everyone jumping on board and getting involved,” Lanning wrote in her column for the ICC.

“Hopefully we can look back on this tournament as a real moment from which women’s sport takes off.”

The event will kickstart with title-holders Australia taking on India in the tournament-opener in Sydney and Lanning said their only goal is to feature in the March 8 final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

“Having taken in an incredible atmosphere at a sold-out MCG, the chance to lead my country in front of a full house would be an honour to experience,” she said.

“There are a few hurdles to get over before we can think about the MCG, but to play there in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Final, on International Women’s Day, would be amazing for all of us.

“We’re very aware of what we need to do to get there, there’s a lot of hard work involved and we need to make sure we start off well in that first game against India and go from there. There are no guarantees in this sport,” she added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/t20-wc-has-potential-to-turn-around-women---s-cricket--lanning.html

190,07-2-20,Sena praises Kejriwal for AAP govt's 'ideal' work in Delhi,"A day before the Delhi Assembly polls, the Shiv Sena on Friday heaped praises on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for his government's ""ideal"" work in the last five years, and said the Centre should have replicated the 'Delhi model' of development in other states.

The Sena said Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah should have felicitated Kejriwal for fulfilling the promises in Delhi, but instead of doing that senior BJP leaders and ministers are raking up the 'Hindu vs Muslim' issue in a bid to win the elections.

""PM Modi and Amit Shah are leaving no stone unturned in Delhi Assembly elections. They (BJP) could not come to power in Maharashtra and lost in Jharkhand. Therefore, the BJP wants to win Delhi and there is nothing wrong in it,"" the Sena said in an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

""With the aim of winning the Delhi polls, 200 MPs from across the country, chief ministers of all the BJP-ruled states and the entire Union Cabinet are in the arena. Despite that Kejriwal has clearly emerged stronger than them,"" it said.

There could be differences of opinion on Kejriwal's views and style of functioning, it said, adding, ""But despite having limited power in hand and the hurdles created by the Centre, his government's work in the fields of healthcare, education, civic amenities is ideal.""

PM Modi and his cabinet should have replicated this 'Delhi model' in other states and utilised Kejriwal's vision across the country, the Sena said.

""Instead, all efforts were being made to prove Kejriwal wrong. If anybody is doing good work in a state and even if that person does not follow your ideology, the country's leader should still praise him and implement his good work elsewhere. But there is no magnanimity left in politics now,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party added.

""Children from poor families study in government-run schools in Delhi and such schools have turned ideal. The mohalla clinics there are doing good work. Water and electricity tariffs were either waived or halved. It means the promises that Kejriwal had given were fulfilled.

""PM Modi or Amit Shah should felicitate Kejriwal for fulfilling the promises, but instead of doing that senior BJP leaders and ministers are raking up 'Hindu vs Muslim' issue in their bid to win the elections,"" the saffron party said.

During the poll campaign, the BJP accused Kejriwal of being a 'terrorist', the Shiv Sena said, adding, ""If they have proof, why don't they take action against him?""

The party also lashed out at Modi for devoting his campaign speeches to the issues of Batla House and Article 370.

""Modi said in his speech that those who ask for the proof of surgical strikes should be punished through voting. But if the voters in Delhi do not listen to him, then will he dub them as anti-nationals and dismiss the new government? The BJP should not lower the stature of the PM's position. The PM should exercise restraint,"" it said.

""There is no presence of Congress in Delhi. The BJP is trying to make lotuses bloom in a dried-up lake...But Kejriwal is seeking votes on the basis of his performance in the last five years. This is a different experiment in the politics of the country, which should be welcomed,"" it said.

A bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi did not heed to the request of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was seeking issuance of notice to the four convicts on the Centre's plea, saying it would further delay the matter.

The bench, also comprising justices Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna, told Mehta that it would hear him on February 11 and it may consider whether notice was required to be issued to the convicts.

194,07-2-20,Nirbhaya case: Delhi court dismisses Tihar's plea seeking fresh date for execution of convicts,"New Delhi, Feb 7 (PTI) A Delhi court Friday dismissed the pleas of Delhi government and Tihar jail authorities seeking fresh date for execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana took note of the Delhi High Court's February 5 order permitting the convicts to exercise their legal remedies within one week.

""It is criminally sinful to execute the convicts when law permits them to live. The High Court on February 5 has permitted the convicts, in the interest of justice, to exercise their legal remedies within one week from same order,"" the court said.

""I concur with counsel for convicts that death warrants cannot be executed merely on basis of surmises and conjectures. The application is bereft of merit. Same is dismissed. State is at liberty to move appropriate application as and when required,"" the judge said.

In its order, the high court was critical of the delay caused by the authorities in seeking issuance of death warrants for the convicts as also of the ""delay tactics"" adopted by the convicts.

""All the authorities concerned were sleeping"" and waited till December 2019 ""for reasons best known to them"" to seek issuance of death warrants, the high court said.

The Delhi government moved the trial court for issuance of black warrants two years after the Supreme Court in 2017 had dismissed the review petition against the confirmation of death penalty.

During the day's proceedings, the lawyer appearing for the convicts termed the application as ""pre mature"" and said ""the State is in hurry to hang the convicts"".

The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

In the application, the authorities said the President has already dismissed the mercy petitions of three convicts and that no application by any of the four is currently pending before any court.

Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition -- the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. Pawan also has the option of filing a mercy plea.

The authorities had also informed the court about the Delhi High Court's February 5 order which directed the convicts to take steps within a week, if they wished, to avail any remedy available under the law.

""It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that, keeping in view a week's time given to the convicts by high court, the fresh dates for execution of death warrants...May kindly be fixed specifying the date and time for execution/ hanging of convicts Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh and Akshay in the interest of justice,"" the application had said.

The warrants, issued by the trial court on January 7, were later postponed ""sine die"" by it on January 31, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks.

The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Six people including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile -- were named as accused.

The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013.

Ram Singh, the prime accused, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years.

The juvenile was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. He, when released, was 20 years old.

Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were sentenced to death in September 2013 by the trial court.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--delhi-court-dismisses-tihar-s-plea-seeking-fresh-date-for-execution-of-convicts-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--delhi-court-dismisses-tihar-s-plea-seeking-fresh-date-for-execution-of-convicts.html
195,07-2-20,Indian Eves eye batting improvement,"The Indian women’s cricket team will have to address its batting woes when it takes on England Women in a crucial league match of the T20 tri-series here today.

A mid innings slump led to India’s four-wicket defeat in their previous match against hosts Australia. This was after beating England by five wickets in the tournament-opener last week.

Except for opener Smriti Mandhana (35) and captain Harmanpreet Kaur (28), Indian batters showed complete lack of application on a pitch offering extra bounce at Canberra. India lost their last six wickets for 21 runs to concede the match with seven balls to spare.

The Indian bowling attack did all it could, stretching the game till the penultimate over but there were not enough runs on the board.

The tournament, which is an important preparatory event ahead of the T20 World Cup, is intriguingly poised with all the three teams on 2 points from as many matches after one win and one defeat each.

The Indian batters, especially in the middle and lower order, will need to produce a much-improved show against England to brighten their chances of reaching the final.

“Our lower order definitely needs to bat a lot better, especially when the top-order doesn’t get runs. However, really appreciate the performance of bowlers,” Harmanpreet said.

Harmanpreet, who has been the top run scorer for her side, will have to once again lead from the front while hoping that young Shafali Verma fires on top of the Indian innings.

Another key middle-order batter Veda Krishnamurthy is due a big innings after two failures while one-down Rodrigues also needs to come good on Friday for an Indian win.

The England team was lucky to have won against Australia via Super Over in their previous match but it batted well in both the matches.

A lot will depend on captain Heather Knight who has been in red-hot form with two back-to-back half centuries.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-eves-eye-batting-improvement.html
196,07-2-20,No impact of T20I result on ODI unit: Nicholls,"New Zealand batsman Henry Nicholls on Thursday said the ODI squad did not carry the baggage of the T20 side which was blanked by India and that reflected in its highest run chase in 50-over cricket.

Riding on Ross Taylor’s 21st hundred, the hosts chased down their highest total in ODIs on Wednesday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

“We didn’t feel it as part of the group coming in. So I wasn’t feeling any pressure and there is no need to prove anything. It was a small ground and a big chase, so it was nice we were able to do that,” Nicholls said in Auckland on Thursday.

“It was great, our biggest chase ever in ODI cricket and it was good to be able to contribute in it. In the past, playing India in India, we have had a couple of chases around the 300-mark and others we got close to. It was nice to do that again at home, and to actually win the game, it was great,” he added.

Taylor smacked an unbeaten 109, with Tom Latham knocking 69 off 48 balls. Their partnership broke India’s bowling strength in the middle overs. Nicholls paid rich tribute to the two senior batsmen.

“Having someone like that at number four, especially with Kane Williamson not being there as well, the experience he brings is immense. It is not just about the runs, because batting with him in the middle, you keep having those conversations that help your batting too.

“The dimensions of the ground helped us and he certainly likes batting there. It was a great partnership and great knock from him. Ross being there till the end to be not out and win the game was immense for us.”

On Lathham’s knock, he said: “Tom and I have played together for a long time, so I have certainly seen him play like that before. He is very versatile and adaptive to the game scenario and conditions. The way he started, well it was slow, 2 off 10 balls or something.

“But he managed to put the pressure back on Kuldeep (Yadav) and their other spinners. Being captain he led from the front and that partnership changed the game for us,” said Nicholls.

The batsman said he will continue to open as long as the management wants, despite suggestion that Latham could move up top given his form.

“Opening is not too different. I am used to batting in a few different spots. I was opening a bit for Canterbury coming into this series. So I am trying to form a new partnership up top with Martin Guptill, and get those platforms in,” he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-impact-of-t20i-result-on-odi-unit--nicholls.html
197,07-2-20,Babar set to be named as Pak ODI skipper,"Top Pakistan batsman Babar Azam is set to be named captain of the national ODI squad after having already replaced wicketkeeper batsman Sarfaraz Ahmed as skipper in the T20 format.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in October had dropped Sarfaraz from the Test and T20 squads in a surprise decision while naming Azhar Ali as captain in the longer format and Babar for the shorter version.

But the PCB didn’t name a captain for the ODI format as Pakistan’s next 50-over assignment will be a lone match against Bangladesh on April 3 here.

Critics, however, pointed out that any decision to replace Sarfaraz as captain in ODI format is not going to be easy as the wicketkeeper-batsman led Pakistan to six straight wins last year starting with the World Cup league stage matches.

The Board and selectors have already faced some criticism over replacing Sarfaraz as captain and also dropping him as a player after he took Pakistan to the world number one ranking in this format.

“There is no way the PCB or selectors can now justify not keeping Sarfaraz in the ODI team or replacing him with Babar Azam. It would be great injustice with a fine captain and a player,” former chief selector and head coach Mohsin Khan said.

He said it was acceptable to change Sarfaraz as captain in Test cricket but not to drop him as a player for the Test and T20 formats.

“There was pressure on Sarfaraz as captain for all three formats but he is still the ideal choice for the white ball formats,” Khan said.

Former Test batsman Ramiz Raja noted that given Babar’s status as being the number one batsman for Pakistan in all three formats, he appeared to be the logical choice to lead in ODIs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/babar-set-to-be-named-as-pak-odi-skipper.html
198,07-2-20,Pace Perfect,"Pakistan counting on fast bowlers to dominate depleted Tigers

Pakistan’s confidence is boosted by Bangladesh appearing vulnerable without Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan for the first Test starting on Friday.

Mushfiqur withdrew from the Test because of security concerns, while allrounder Shakib is suspended.

Pakistan captain Azhar Ali said on Thursday they must reap the advantage at Pindi Cricket Stadium.

“Test matches are always played on your strength and at the moment we feel our fast bowling is our strength,” Azhar said.

“They are missing a couple of key players and on current form we can say we have an upper hand. You take advantage in your home conditions.”

Young fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi, along with Mohammad Abbas, snared 16 wickets between them in December when Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 263 runs in the second test at Karachi.

The Pakistan top order also cashed in, as Azhar, Abid Ali, Shan Masood and Babar Azam scored centuries at Karachi.

Abid, who also scored a century on debut in the washed out Rawalpindi Test against Sri Lanka, has a chance to match former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin’s record of three centuries in his first three Tests.

Bangladesh still has some claws, including opening batsman Tamim Iqbal, who scored a triple century last week in a domestic first-class game; Liton Das, who will keep wickets in the absence of Mushfiqur; Mohammad Mithun and captain Mominul Haque.

“We have to play our best game to beat Bangladesh,” Azhar said.

“Even though they don’t have senior players, they have (other) players who can give match-winning performances. We have to not give them a chance.”

Pakistan has 80 points in the world Test championship, while Bangladesh has none after losing both of its tests against India in India.

Mominul said they were still confident even without Mushiqur.

“When you don’t have one of your best players, sometimes it’s a bit difficult, but on the other hand you can say it’s a good opportunity for a new player,” Mominul said.

“(Our) expectation is we are going to play good cricket here. We are not good enough overseas, so we have to try to improve ourselves here.”

Bangladesh has split its tour of Pakistan into three legs. Pakistan won the Twenty20 series 2-0 in January. After this first Test, Bangladesh will return from April 3-9 for a one-off one-day international and the second Test at Karachi.

202,07-2-20,"CBI arrests OSD to Delhi deputy CM Sisodia, searches premises of another IAS officer","The CBI on Friday carried out searches at the premises of IAS officer Udit Prakash Rai in connection with the arrest of Gopal Krishna Madhav, OSD to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, in a bribery case, officials said.

Over a dozen more officers of the Delhi government are also under the agency's scanner in the case, they said.

Sources said the agency has not found Sisodia's involvement in the case so far.

The officials said Madhav, posted in the GST department of Delhi government since October 2019, was arrested on Thursday evening on the basis of information provided by a middleman, nabbed on Wednesday, who allegedly collected bribes from transporters on his behalf.

During questioning, Madhav alleged the involvement of Rai, a 2007-batch IAS officer of Assam–Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh–Goa–Mizoram–Union Territories (AGMUT) cadre, following which the agency carried out searches at his premises, they said.

The agency is also carrying out searches at the offices of Madhav and other officials of the GST department located at the ITO area, the sources said.

The agency arrested Madhav in an operation on Thursday evening, ahead of the crucial Delhi elections, after middleman Dheeraj Gupta, nabbed on February 5, claimed that he was collecting money on behalf of the former.

In addition to searching Rai's residence in Civil Lines here, the agency is also carrying out searches at the residences of Madhav in Rohini and Dheeraj Gupta in Wazirabad area, the sources said.

A transporter had approached the CBI claiming that GST officials of the Delhi government were demanding bribes for releasing trucks.

Claiming that he had good connections with high-ranking GST officials, Gupta demanded Rs 3.5 lakh for getting the transporter's two trucks released, they said.

The agency registered an FIR against Gupta and carried out a trap operation on Wednesday in which he was arrested while receiving Rs 2.26 lakh of the bribe amount, the officials said.

""CBI has arrested Dheeraj Gupta, a private person, who is a resident of Delhi and Gopal Krishna Madhav, Goods and Services Tax Officer in Trade and Taxes Department of Government of NCT Delhi who is also the OSD to Deputy CM of Delhi, in a bribery case of Rs. 2.26 lakh,"" a CBI spokesperson said.

During the questioning, Gupta claimed that he was collecting the bribe for Madhav, a Delhi Andaman and Nicobar Island Civil Service (DANICS) cadre officer in the trade and tax department, officials said.

""It was alleged that the private person (Gupta) was acting as a middleman on behalf of some GST department officers including for the public servant (Madhav) for collecting illegal gratification from transporters for not charging GST from them,"" the spokesperson said.

Madhav was immediately taken to the headquarters where he was questioned in detail by the CBI officers, officials said.

Gupta has been sent to judicial custody by a special court while Madhav will be produced before the court on Friday, they said.

Madhav, who joined the service as Head Clerk in August 2003 in the Education Department, was posted as officer on special duty (OSD) in Sisodia's office since 2015, they said.

203,07-2-20,"Compound in cabbage, cauliflower may help fight fatty liver disease: Study","A natural compound found in widely consumed vegetables such as cabbage, kale, and cauliflower may help treat fatty liver disease, a study claims.

The study, published in the journal Hepatology, demonstrates how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be controlled by indole, a natural compound found in gut bacteria, and in cruciferous vegetables.

It also addresses how this natural compound may lead to new treatments or preventive measures for NAFLD, the researchers said.

""We believe healthy foods with high capacity for indole production are essential for preventing NAFLD, and are beneficial for improving the health of those with it,"" said Chaodong Wu from Texas A&M AgriLife Research in the US.

""This is another example where altering the diet can help prevent or treat disease and improve the well-being of the individual,"" Wu said.

NAFLD occurs when the liver becomes ""marbled"" with fat, sometimes due to unhealthy nutrition, such as excessive intake of saturated fats.

If it is not properly addressed, the condition can lead to life-threatening liver disease, including cirrhosis or liver cancer, the researchers said.

Gut bacteria can have an effect -- either positive or negative -- on the progression of fatty liver disease, they said.

These bacteria produce many different compounds, one of which is indole.

This compound, a product of the amino acid tryptophan, has been identified by clinical nutritionists and nutrition scientists as likely having preventive and therapeutic benefits to people with NAFLD.

The US National Cancer Institute also notes the benefits of indole-3-carbinol found in cruciferous vegetables, including their anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting properties.

The latest study examined the effect of indole concentrations on people, animal models, and individual cells to help determine indole's effect on liver inflammation and its potential benefits to people with NAFLD.

It investigated the extent to which indole alleviates NAFLD, incorporating previous findings on gut bacteria, intestinal inflammation, and liver inflammation.

The researchers investigated the effects of indole on individuals with fatty livers.

In 137 Chinese subjects, the team discovered people with a higher body mass index tended to have lower levels of indole in their blood.

The levels of the compound in those who were clinically obese were significantly lower than those who were considered lean, the researcher said.

In those with lower indole levels, there was also a higher amount of fat deposition in the liver, they said.

""This result will likely extend to other ethnicities, though ethnic background may have some influence on gut bacteria populations and the exact levels of metabolites,"" said Qifu Li, also a physician at Chongqing Medical University in China.

To further determine the impact of indole, the research team used animals fed a low-fat diet as a control, and high-fat diet to simulate the effects of NAFLD.

""The comparisons of animal models fed a low-fat diet and high-fat diet gave us a better understanding of how indole is relevant to NAFLD,"" said Gianfranco Alpini, a former professor at Texas A&M Health Science Center.

Alpini, now the director of the Indiana Center for Liver Research, said treatment of NAFLD-mimicking animal models with indole significantly decreased fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/compound-in-cabbage--cauliflower-may-help-fight-fatty-liver-disease--study-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/compound-in-cabbage--cauliflower-may-help-fight-fatty-liver-disease--study.html
204,07-2-20,Assess coronavirus epidemic in 'calm' manner: Chinese Prez Xi tells Trump,"Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on Friday with his US counterpart Donald Trump on the novel coronavirus outbreak and asked him to assess the epidemic in a ""calm"" manner, urging America to adopt and adjust its response measures in a ""reasonable way"" to China's intensified efforts to contain the dreaded virus that has claimed over 630 lives.

Xi, in his first phone call with Trump since the coronavirus outbreak in December, told the US President that China had launched a ""people's war"" against the epidemic that has been wreaking havoc in China and across the world.

People's war is an ideological concept developed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong which meant a prolonged struggle with the support of people while fighting for a particular cause.

Xi told Trump that the Chinese government and the people were making their maximum efforts to contain the outbreak.

""We have adopted the most comprehensive and strictest prevention and control measures through mobilising and rapid responses. We have declared a people's war against the epidemic through prevention and control,"" Xi was quoted as saying by state-run CCTV.

""We are fully confident and capable of fighting the epidemic. The long-term trend of China's economic development will not change,"" the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted the official television as reporting.

Xi asked the US side to respond reasonably to the novel coronavirus outbreak, state-run Xinhua news agency said in its report.

Noting that China's prevention and control efforts are gradually yielding positive results, Xi stressed that Beijing had full confidence and capability to overcome the epidemic.

China hopes that the US will assess the epidemic in a ""calm"" manner, and adopt and adjust its response measures in a ""reasonable way"", Xi said, adding that the two sides can maintain communication, strengthen coordination and work together to contain the epidemic.

The death toll in China's novel coronavirus epidemic continues to mount. A total of 636 people have died so far, while the total number of confirmed cases has crossed 31,000, Chinese health officials said on Friday.

Ahead of Xi and Trump phone call, China has accused the US of creating global panic with travel bans and evacuation of diplomats besides flight cancellations.

""The US government has not provided any substantive help to the Chinese side yet. On the contrary, it was the first to withdraw its consulate staff from Wuhan, the first to suggest the partial withdrawal of embassy staff, the first to announce a ban on entry by Chinese citizens after the WHO made it clear that it doesn't recommend or even opposes travel and trade restrictions against China,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the media on February 3.

The two leaders also talked about the phase-one economic and trade agreement the two countries signed recently, and agreed to push forward the bilateral relations.

US President Trump launched a trade war with China in 2018, demanding that Beijing reduce massive trade deficit.

His demands included an intrusive verification mechanism to supervise Beijing's promise to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets.

The two countries signed phase one deal last month which reportedly contained provision for verification mechanism for IPR enforcement.

On Thursday, China sliced tariffs on USD 75 billion worth of US products which is in reciprocation for the Trump administration's plan, announced last month, to halve tariffs on about USD 112 billion in Chinese goods, in view of the phase one deal.

Analysts say the tariff cuts scheduled to take effect on February 14 may be the latest sign that the trade war between the world's two largest economies is easing.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/assess-coronavirus-epidemic-in--calm--manner--chinese-prez-xi-tells-trump-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/assess-coronavirus-epidemic-in--calm--manner--chinese-prez-xi-tells-trump.html
205,07-2-20,"China's novel coronavirus toll soars to 636, total confirmed cases over 31,000","The death toll in China's novel coronavirus epidemic has risen to 636 with 73 new mortalities reported, mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province, while the total number of confirmed cases has crossed 31,000, Chinese health officials said on Friday.

Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, reported 69 deaths on Thursday while Jilin, Henan, Guangdong and Hainan provinces reported one each, China's National Health Commission said.

As many as 73 people died on Thursday, while another 3,143 new cases of infection were reported, taking the total number of confirmed cases of infection to 31,161 from 31 provincial-level regions, the commission said.

A total of 1,540 patients infected with the virus have been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Thursday, it said, highlighting that a large number of people are getting cured.

The Chinese officials said 19 foreign nationals living in the country had been confirmed of contracting the novel coronavirus as of Thursday, but did not disclose their nationalities.

The deceased on Thursday also included Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, one of the eight whistle-blowers who warned other medics of the coronavirus outbreak but were reprimanded by the police.

Li, the 34-year-old doctor, died due to coronavirus on Thursday in Wuhan.

He was the first to report about the virus back in December last year when it emerged in Wuhan.

He dropped a bombshell in his medical school alumni group on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and quarantined in his hospital.

Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumour-mongering by the Wuhan police.

He was one of the several medics targeted by the police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak.

Meanwhile, China on Thursday opened a new 1,500-bed makeshift hospital especially built for virus patients, days after a 1,000-bed hospital started functioning with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms in Wuhan.

Chinese officials argue that the death toll and confirmed cases are rising in Hubei province because of lack of enough hospitals and beds.

Officials also started setting up tent hospitals and mobile clinics to treat the growing number of patients.

China also lodged diplomatic protests to countries over cancellation of flights to China due to virus fears.

""As some countries have taken such excessive steps as suspending flights, ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) has also issued bulletins and encouraged all countries to follow WHO recommendations,"" a spokesperson said.

""We deplore and oppose those countries who went against WHO's professional recommendations and ICAO's bulletins and have lodged stern representations with them,"" she said.

Several international airlines, including Air India and IndiGo, have cancelled flights to China over fears of the virus spreading across the world, a move which Beijing described as being against WHO guidelines.

Many countries including India and the US have also announced travel bans.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-s-novel-coronavirus-toll-soars-to-636--total-confirmed-cases-over-31-000-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-s-novel-coronavirus-toll-soars-to-636--total-confirmed-cases-over-31-000.html
206,07-2-20,Trump celebrates impeachment acquittal at White House,"US President Donald Trump on Thursday celebrated his impeachment acquittal at the White House along with his fellow Cabinet members, Republican lawmakers and family.

A day after he was acquitted by the Senate on the two impeachment charges – abuse of power and obstruction to Congress – Trump appeared confident, energetic and combative as ever against his opponents.

""We went through hell, unfairly, did nothing wrong, did nothing wrong. I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit,"" Trump said in the East Room of the White House Thursday afternoon.

""This is really not a news conference. It's not a speech. It's not anything. It's just we're sort of -- it's a celebration because we have something that just worked out. I mean it worked out,"" he said.

In his speech that lasted for over an hour, Trump called members of Congress ""warriors"", recognizing the way they handled the impeachment.

""They're warriors. And there's nothing from a legal standpoint. This is a political thing. And every time I'd say, this is unfair; let's go to court. They say, sir, you can't go to court. This is politics. We were treated unbelievably unfairly. And you have to understand we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit,"" he said amidst laughter.

""We then went through the Mueller report. They should have come back one day later. They didn't. They came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money,"" he said.

""People came to Washington to help other people bright-eyed and bushytailed they say. They came, one, or two or three people in particular, but many people. We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it,"" he added.

Trump alleged that Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy, open borders, sanctuary cities. ""They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy is raise taxes. They want to raise taxes,"" he said as he slammed top Democratic leaders including the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

""I've always said they're lousy politicians, but they do two things. They are vicious and mean, vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago. When she said, I pray for the president, I pray for the president. She doesn't pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite. But I doubt she prays at all,"" she added.

207,07-2-20,"Uber loses $1.1B investing in food delivery, driverless cars","Uber continued to lose money as it builds up its food delivery business and develops technology for driverless cars, but revenue for its rides business nearly tripled as the company picked up more passengers around the world.

The ride-hailing giant lost $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, about 24% more than the same time last year. The loss amounted to 64 cents per share, which was slightly better than what analysts were expecting. Analysts polled by FactSet predicted Uber would lose $1.18 billion, or 67 cents per share, during the quarter.

Uber brought in $4.1 billion in revenue, up 37% from a year ago. Its revenue grew around the world, although the biggest gain was in the U.S. And Canada, where Uber pulled in 41% more than last year.

But its Eats business lost $461 million in the quarter before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down 66% from the same time last year as Uber put money into growing the business in a highly competitive food delivery market.

""2019 was a transformational year for Uber and I'm gratified by our progress, steadily delivering against the commitments we've made to our shareholders on our path to profitability,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, in a statement. “We recognize that the era of growth at all costs is over. In a world where investors increasingly demand not just growth, but profitable growth, we are well-positioned to win through continuous innovation, excellent execution, and the unrivaled scale of our global platform.”

In Uber's last earnings call, Khosrowshahi said the company's goal was to turn a full-year profit in 2021.

The fourth quarter was marked by painful disclosures at Uber.

In December, the company released a long-awaited report, in which its riders reported more than 3,000 sexual assaults during 2018.

The same month, Uber agreed to pay $4.4 million to end a federal sexual harassment probe about its internal corporate culture. But those announcements did not take a toll on the stock, which has been inching up over the past two months.

Uber's stock cratered after its IPO, falling 42% to a low of $25.99 in November. But it recovered some ground over the last month, reaching $37 on Thursday, about 18% below its IPO price.

Its losses in the fourth quarter included $243 million in stock-based compensation.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uber-loses--1-1b-investing-in-food-delivery--driverless-cars-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uber-loses--1-1b-investing-in-food-delivery--driverless-cars.html
208,07-2-20,US kills top al-Qaeda leader Qasim al-Rimi in Yemen: Trump,"President Donald Trump has confirmed that in a major counterterrorism operation in Yemen the US forces have killed Qasim al-Rimi, a founder and leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the jihadist group that claimed responsibility for a mass shooting at an American naval base.

Rimi, 46, a deputy to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was placed on the United States' most-wanted terrorist list after taking over al-Qaeda's Yemen affiliate in 2015.

US government had offered a USD 10 million reward for information on Rimi.

""His death further degrades al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the global al-Qaeda movement, and it brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security,"" Trump said on Thursday.

He said the major counterterrorism operation was carried at his direction.

""Rimi joined al-Qaeda in the 1990s, working in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden. Under Rimi, AQAP committed unconscionable violence against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire numerous attacks against the United States and our forces,"" Trump said.

""The United States, our interests, and our allies are safer as a result of his death. We will continue to protect the American people by tracking down and eliminating terrorists who seek to do us harm,"" he said.

While Trump confirmed that Rimi had been killed, he did not say when the US operation was conducted or divulged any details about how it was carried out.

The AQAP has long been considered al-Qaeda's most dangerous branch for its attempts to carry out attacks on the US mainland.

Rimi had said in an 18-minute video that his group was responsible for the December 6 shooting at US Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida, in which a Saudi Air Force officer killed three American sailors.

He called the shooter Mohammed Alshamrani a ""courageous knight"" and a ""hero"", according to media reports.

The shooting focused public attention on the presence of foreign students in American military training programs and exposed shortcomings in the screening of cadets.

In January, the US sent home 21 Saudi military students, saying the trainees had jihadist or anti-American sentiments on social media pages or had ""contact"" with child abuse images, including in internet chatrooms.

Rimi was considered a potential successor to al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian leader of al-Qaeda's strategic operations who is reportedly believed to be in Pakistan.

This is the third major strike by the US under Trump administration and that too in recent months. In October, the US killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In January, it killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-kills-top-al-qaeda-leader-qasim-al-rimi-in-yemen--trump-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-kills-top-al-qaeda-leader-qasim-al-rimi-in-yemen--trump.html

No one was injured in the incident, which some protesters alleged to be a repeat of intimidation tactics after the firings near Jamia Millia Islamia and at Shaheen Bagh.

According to the police, Shabir (50) was at his garments shop when two men arrived on a motorcycle and fired two rounds. The Jafrabad police rushed to the spot after the incident.

""A case has been registered and an investigation initiated,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast) Ved Prakash Surya said.

He said police are trying to find out if any CCTV camera was installed in the area and obtain footage of the alleged incident to ascertain the sequence of events and establish the identity of the suspects.

""The firing was not in connection with the anti-CAA protests. We suspect it to be a case of some personal enmity,"" a senior police official said.

The incident took place barely 400 metres from the site where people have been protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act since last month. Some agitators claim it to be a threat tactics and with every such incident, and alleged the accused are changing their modus operandi.

Nihal Ashraf, one of the protesters at Jafrabad, said, ""The armed men fired three rounds in the air and fled the spot. They were on a scooter without a number plate unlike the Jamia incident in which the vehicle used by those who fired had number plate. They two men fired after moving a few metres ahead of our protest site"".

Mohd Irshad, a Jamia student, said a youth fired outside the Jamia Millia slamia on January 30 and also shot a student in front of the police.

""He (youth outside Jamia) provoked and then fired. In the second incident on February 1 at Shaheen Bagh, the assailant fired from a few metres away from the main gathering to cause disturbance.

""In the third incident again outside Jamia on February 2, the assailants shot in the air from the opposite road so that they could not be caught like the previous two accused. However, the police got their vehicle number. Therefore, the assailants at Jafrabad got a vehicle without a number plate,"" he said.

Protests resumed after sometime.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2-men-on-bike-fire-in-air-near-anti-caa-protest-site-in-delhi--personal-enmity--say-cops-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/2-men-on-bike-fire-in-air-near-anti-caa-protest-site-in-delhi--personal-enmity--say-cops.html
211,07-2-20,PM's remarks about Kerala untrue: Chief Minister,"Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday voiced his strong objections to the statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the Upper House of Parliament about the Chief Minister and the CPI-M, terming these as being untrue and protest worthy.

Making a sharp attack on Modi, Vijayan wrote in a Facebook post that Kerala is not willing to concede ground to those who want to instigate communal polarisation in nthe state.

During the debate in the Rajya Sabha earloier this week on the motion to thanks to the President, Modi had said that while Vijayan, on the one hand, was warning about extremist elements infiltrating the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests, the latter's party -- the CPI-M -- was, on the other hand, supporting extremists in Delhi.

On Friday, Vijayan wrote: ""People were warned of such infiltrators, proper caution was also exercised. The discriminatory CAA, which is a plan forged in the kiln of RSS for achieving communal goals, must be resisted with the bulwark of secularism. In this, Kerala is a model for the whole country. Our secular State has the strength to fend off any sort of infiltrators in this movement as well"".

""The unity that we see in these struggles is a hallmark of the secularism of Kerala. This spirit has inspired the protests in Kerala against CAA, which seeks to confer citizenship on the basis of religion. This State is not an arable land for any kind of communalism,"" he added.

Vijayan also said that the protests against the unconstitutional and discriminatory CAA have seen the coming together of people from all walks of life.

""My remarks on extremist organizations like SDPI were made in good faith. Kerala is guided by the belief that secularism is the only means for defeating the communal agenda of RSS. And we will resist anyone who attempts to pollute this struggle with the poison of communalism,"" Vijayan said.

""The Prime Minister must rectify his statement that maligns the protests in Kerala. It is unbefitting for a Prime Minister to be a part of those who are disappointed with the fact that Kerala is leading the struggle against the communalism of both RSS and SDPI,"" he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-s-remarks-about-kerala-untrue--chief-minister-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-s-remarks-about-kerala-untrue--chief-minister.html
212,07-2-20,Opp fueling anti-CAA anarchy: PM,"Modi invokes Nehru to back succour for persecuted minorities in Pak

Charging the Opposition with instigating anti-CAA protests and spreading “falsehood”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday warned that agitations against laws passed by Parliament and State Assemblies may lead to “anarchy”. He justified action against PDP and NC leaders in Jammu & Kashmir suggesting that his Government cannot be with those supporting “open secession” and lampooned Congress campaign of “save Constitution”.

In a speech laced with humour, “shayari” and verbal wallops at the Opposition leaders, Modi quoted the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru, to buttress the case for the CAA saying it was he who first spoke of “pressure” on and “safety” of minorities in East and West Pakistan and need to change the law to grant Indian citizenship to “minorities” coming from Pakistan. Modi sought to ask the Opposition benches whether Pandit Nehru was “communal” to raise the issue of the plight of “minorities” in the neighbouring country.

“This was not only Mahatma Gandhi’s but also Nehru’s sentiments. Was Pandit Nehru communal? Did he discriminate between Hindus and Muslims? Did he want Hindu rashtra?” Modi asked, asserting that several reports, including those of parliamentary panels, had recommended a law like the CAA.

Modi referred to the 1950 Nehru-Liyaqat agreement on minority security and non-discrimination against “religious minorities”. Why did Nehru not use “all citizens”? he asked to counter protests against exclusion of Muslims in the agreement. He said an year ago before this agreement, Nehru wrote a letter to Assam Chief Minister Gopinath to distinguish between Hindu refugees and Muslim migrants from Pakistan. Modi quoted Nehru’s statement in the Lok Sabha on November 5, 1950 that affected minorities coming to India have right to citizenship and “law needed to be changed.”

Drawing attention to the persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan from the very beginning, the Prime Minister gave the instance of freedom fighter Upendra Nath Dutta — a member of All India Congress Committee — who had stayed in Pakistan but returned to India after exposing abject persecution of minorities in that country.

The PM quoted Dutt saying in the Constituent Assembly “so far as the side of Pakistan concerned, minorities are practically liquidated. Those who live in East Pakistan live in total frustration”. Modi also gave another instance of Jogendra Nath Mandal, a backward caste leader also the first Law Minister in Pakistan who also likewise returned to India after observing that minorities were being successfully driven out of West Pakistan and the same was being done in the East Pakistan.

As he accused the Congress of telling “lies” and spreading “false propaganda” on the CAA on account of its vote-bank politics, the Prime Minister assured that the CAA will not “discriminate” between Hindus and Muslims and cause no damage to minorities.

Taking a jibe at the Congress on its “save Constitution” pitch, he recalled unconstitutional measures during Emergency, placing of National Advisory Council above Prime Minister and PMO and recently violating Supreme Court’s advise against violent agitations.

Modi also accused the Congress of discreetly instigating anti-CAA agitation. “Khoob parda hai, chilman se lage baithe hain, saaf chhupte bhi nahin, samne aate bhi nahin” (Closeted to screen but would not come out in open), Modi recited a romantic poem to nuance his political message.

So much criticism of the CAA has been made ironically by those who love getting photographed with the group of people who want “tukde tukde” of India, he said.

Modi likened Congress’ stand to that of Pakistan, saying Islamabad spoke the same language for decades to mislead and incite Indian Muslims and that task is now being performed by those “thrown out of the power”, he said.

On Kashmir, Modi quoted PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti, NC’s Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah’s “secessionist” comments and their warning against abrogation of Article 370 and asked “can anyone see them adhering them to the Constitution.

“These are people who do not trust people of Kashmir but we trust people of Kashmir and therefore removed Article 370 and developing it,” the Prime Minister said affirming his Government’s commitment to the Constitution.

Amid thumping of benches by ruling BJP members and their allies, the Prime Minister invoked the Constitution to warn against street protests against decisions taken by Parliament and Assemblies. The Congress was expected to be a responsible Opposition, but it has taken a wrong turn, he said.

“What will then happen? Can the country run this way? This is road to anarchy... Such a way can put you (Opposition) in trouble as well. I am giving this warning as we all should be concerned about the country,” the Prime Minister said.

Modi said his Government and party is determined and decisive and fast-tracking decision as “we are on walking on a beaten track followed by the Congress”. “If we were to take your path of 70 years, we would not have been able to terminate Article 370”.

The Prime Minister said if his Government worked as per the old ways, the Ram Janmabhoomi issue would have remained unsolved, Kartarpur Sahib corridor would not be a reality and there would be no India-Bangladesh land agreement.

Modi also touched on the issues of economy, unemployment and farmers distress. On the economy, the Prime Minister said the Government has kept the fiscal deficit in check, price rise is also under control and there is macro-economic stability.

Modi said the agriculture Budget, which was earlier Rs 27,000 crore, has now been increased by five times to about Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The agriculture budget has risen five times during the tenure of the NDA Government.

The Prime Minister said driven by politics, some States are not allowing farmers to benefit from the PM Kisan Scheme.

“I appeal to them, let there be no politics in farmer welfare. We all have to work together for the prosperity of farmers of India,” he said.

He said the PM-KISAN Samman Yojana is transforming the lives of many farmers. Several farmers have benefited due to this. In this scheme there are no middlemen and no extra file work.

Modi said the FDI in April-September 2018 stood at USD 22 billion, while in April-September 2019 it increased to USD 26 billion. This reflects confidence of foreign investors in India, he said.

Referring to the North-East, Modi said for years, distance became a reason to ignore this region. Things have changed now and the region is becoming a growth engine as great work has been done in so many sectors and Ministers and officials are regularly visiting the North-East.

“The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opp-fueling-anti-caa-anarchy--pm-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-fueling-anti-caa-anarchy--pm.html

The party launched a website amitshahkaultachashma.com on which seven comparative images are uploaded.

The seven pictures of a Mohalla Clinic, a night shelter, playground, three visuals of Government schools and one of the streetlight initiatives uploaded on the website convey the situation in Delhi before and after the AAP came to power.

“Throughout his campaign, Union Home Minister Amit Shah blamed the AAP for not delivering its promises. Whereas the fact is that the party has not only fulfilled the 70-point manifesto as promised in 2015 but also delivered much more,” the AAP said in a statement.

The fundamental idea of this satirical campaign is that the BJP is unable to see the development delivered by the AAP dispensation because its glasses are tainted, it said, adding that the AAP has depicted how its has worked hard to develop Delhi Government schools by upgrading infrastructure, introducing the happiness curriculum, and creating a positive environment.

The visuals depict how the Mohalla Clinics have changed the health infrastructure of Delhi, it said, adding the concept is an inspiration for other States.

218,07-2-20,2nd T20I: Jolted India aim to bounce back against resurgent New Zealand,"Some of their bowling and fielding frailties exposed in the series-opener, India will aim for quick course correction when they take on a resurgent New Zealand in the second ODI here on Saturday.

Flying high after the 5-0 whitewash of New Zealand in the T20 series, India were brought to the ground after the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series with a four-wicket win in the first ODI.

The Black Caps chased down their highest-ever total in ODI cricket at Seddon Park and the toss will be crucial once again at the even shorter Eden Park where the side batting second will have a clear advantage.

New Zealand opted to bat here in both the T20Is, but India chased well in both instances albeit in different circumstances.

India find themselves in a familiar situation after the loss in Hamilton. But the visitors have come from behind against the West Indies and Australia to win their last two ODI series and Virat Kohli's men will look to do the same here.

Like in Chennai against the West Indies, or in Mumbai against Australia, India's loss at Hamilton was down to their lack of ability to take wickets in the middle overs.

The opposition batsmen took advantage to hit big and the Indian attack didn't have any answers.

In the first ODI, skipper Virat Kohli turned to Jasprit Bumrah every time he went searching for a wicket. This over-dependency is something India would want to address in their composition.

India's fielding too will be under the scanner. In each of those losses at Chennai, Mumbai and Hamilton, it was poor despite flashes of individual brilliance.

The general fielding standards have gone down since the Bangladesh series and there is a need for a collective all-round effort from the visitors to bounce back.

Generally, high catches are tougher in the windy conditions in New Zealand, and the odd lights at Eden Park won't help either.

At the nets, the Men in Blue on Friday had an optional training session.

Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur both didn't just bowl, but also batted in the nets.

Thakur was expensive in his outings at Eden Park during the T20Is, and he didn't impress in the first ODI either and India could think of replacing him with Saini.

The other contemplation will be about Kedar Jadhav's role in the side. Selected primarily to bring balance to the playing eleven with his part-time spin, Kohli didn't give him a single over in Hamilton.

Perhaps it was due to the short boundaries. In that light, bowling Jadhav at Eden Park makes even less sense. It could merit giving Shivam Dube a go here, or even playing a full-time batsman in Manish Pandey.

Rest of the batting line-up picks itself with the new opening pair of Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw settling in well in their first outing and the team management will hope the duo can add a few more runs than last time.

For New Zealand, a change in personnel has worked wonders after their T20 whitewash.

Stand-in skipper Tom Latham's batting in the middle worked for them, and Henry Nicholls confirmed he will continue to open the innings with Martin Guptill.

Ross Taylor has been in rampaging form and he will look to continue the good work on Saturday.

Regular skipper Kane Williamson is still days away from fitness, while Scott Kuggeleijn is ruled out of the second ODI due to illness.

Auckland pacer, the six-foot-eight tall Kyle Jamieson will make his debut on home ground on Saturday, replacing Ish Sodhi in the side.

Teams:

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini.

New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt), Tom Latham (wk), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Jimmy Neesham, Scott Kuggeleijn, Tom Blundell, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Hamish Bennett, Tim Southee, Kyle Jamieson.

219,07-2-20,"Sridhar concedes downward curve in Indian fielding, points out lack of practice time","India's fielding hasn't been particularly good in the ongoing series against New Zealand, coach R Sridhar said on Friday but refused to blame tight schedules for the ""downward curve"" despite conceding that hectic travelling is affecting the side's practice plans.

Sridhar said India's fielding has at best average in the last four months. He said fatigue could be a contributing factor to losses during this time period, including the one in the first ODI against New Zealand at Hamilton on Wednesday.

""...The West Indies series at home was somewhere we really dropped. We were average, to say the least. But definitely we have not lived to the standards as we did in the world Cup or even in the build-up to the World Cup in the last couple years,"" said Sridhar on the eve of the second ODI here.

Sridhar said they have accounted for the downturn in fielding standard by a grading system privy to the support staff. He said the team management keeps a sharp eye on the workloads and practice schedules of all players.

""We keep reminding the players about attention to basic detail...In a T20 game, each fielder has to be his own captain. He need not wait for the captain to move him or the bowler to move him in a certain direction or to a certain position,"" he said.

""We try and tell them to think ahead of the game, you as a fielder captain yourself, see which way the breeze is, which way the batsman's tendencies to hit are, what's the bowler's plan and position accordingly.

""So we empower the fielders so that they can become their own captain and they can take decisions on their own because the captain has got too much on his plate at certain times. That's what we speak about,"" he added.

India's fielding regime has been impacted by the constant travelling on this tour. There was only one full session before the T20 International series whereas the other three sessions have all been optional.

""That's the nature of the current schedule, we have to take it. We have to play around it but we hardly had a session during the entire T20 schedule. There is not much we can put in in terms of technical work on the ground...,"" he pointed out.

""Apart from that, we do have a look at the videos and see what led to an error. It need not always be a technical error every time there is a fumble or a dropped catch. We need to know whether it could be a tactical position error or the mind not being in the right place, so many things that can lead to it,"" he explained.

""It is a tight schedule but it is not a complaint and it is not an excuse at all. We need to be better.""

Speaking about workload management, Sridhar said the current fitness levels of the players are so good that they are able to adapt pretty quickly

""We do monitor their workloads. We will be lying to ourselves if we say no, they are fresh as a daisy every time they go on to the park. They are not, because they are travelling and playing games,"" he said.

""But the current fitness levels of this team is really good, so that in turn helps to recover from the workload and fatigue quickly and be fit on the park. But we do keep that in mind but I don't blame fatigue for the down curve,"" he added.

Talking about the poor moments in the first ODI, the coach said, ""Overthrows, I mean, you are talking about Manish (Pandey) -- he took a chance. He had to do it, and we needed a wicket at that time.

""You can bargain four runs for a wicket and it was the best player who was there at that time. These things happen, you can't look too deep into that.""

But Sridhar minced no words in his criticism of Kuldeep Yadav's dropped catch of centurion Ross Taylor.

""...That catch should have been taken. Probably it was after his first over, maybe he was thinking about his previous over, could be anything. It could not be a technical aspect at all.

""We are trying to get better but we were average. There is no doubt about that. We can get better,"" he said.

Sridhar said players will be spoken with to figure out the problem areas.

""There are a lot of things we need to address. We will actually have dialogues with the player and see what is more important for a player and then go about it in that way,"" he said.

""We do the listening more than the talking. We take the feedback from the players and if there is anything to be added, we surely add our perspective and then the best possible decision is taken to get the best out of the player each time he goes out on the park,"" he added.

Despite the downturn in fielding form, there have been moments of individual brilliance in every match or series. Virat Kohli has affected two stupendous run outs, one with a nearly blind throw at Wellington (Colin Munro), and then at Hamilton (Henry Nicholls).

""The kind of intensity he brings on to the field, I always say to the younger boys who come, he is a ready-made template for you to copy. Watch him, see what he does,"" Sridhar said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sridhar-concedes-downward-curve-in-indian-fielding--points-out-lack-of-practice-time-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/sridhar-concedes-downward-curve-in-indian-fielding--points-out-lack-of-practice-time.html

221,07-2-20,Freebies give AAP an edge over spirited BJP,"The Delhi Assembly election campaign which started as a three-corner fight among the incumbent AAP, the BJP and the Congress has now narrowed down to a direct fight between the AAP and the BJP with the Congress appearing to have given up hope with its low-key canvassing for the February 8 election.

Hard-selling its five years of development works and freebies provided to Delhiites, AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejrwial is hopeful of retaining power.

However, the AAP is facing a stiff challenge from the BJP under the stewardship of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Besides promising freebies like Rs 2/kg atta, the BJP tried to capitalise on the anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh.

The AAP throughout the poll campaign played safe by not getting drawn into the Shaheen Bagh debate and kept its focus on development works and freebies. It used other tactics to corner the BJP by raising the question of the saffron party’s inability in not announcing its CM candidate.

It is too early to jump to any conclusion about the election outcome, poll pundits think the AAP is likely to retain majority in the Assembly.

However, observers feel that aggressive campaigning by the BJP is likely to help it improve on its 2015 tally of three seats. A few even predict that the saffron party may get closer to the half-way mark in the Assembly.

The Congress, whose prospects are dim, is likely to increase its vote share in five boroughs, including Delhi Cant, Kasturba Nagar, and Muslim-majority Mustafabad, where party workers hope to gain strength.

The action packed political battle of the national Capital's turf has transformed into rich versus poor as the BJP's trump card — Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has not been accepted by the majority populace.

Despite different social demography — national Capital has been divided in three groups which are: Higher income group, middle and lower. As per the data analysis of previous results of the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha elections both, it is estimated that 60-70 per cent vote share will of higher income group may go to BJP, 20-25 per cent with AAP and 5-10 per cent to the Congress and other parties. In the middle income group, 50-60 per cent of voters appear to be inclined towards the BJP while 40 per cent are with AAP and 5-10 percent with Congress and others. However, in lower income group, a high 85 percent of vote is very likely to go to AAP, 10 percent to BJP and five percent with congress and others.

Delhi plays host to people from 'different socio-economic background and from different region of the country. What is pretty discernible in the highly surcharges political arena, is the changed in narrative among the common people.

Previously, Delhi was primarily a city of Punjabis, Sikh, Baniya, Muslims, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and,Hindi speaking Poorvanchalis from Uttar Pardesh and Bihar ). Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Badal is not fighting elections with the BJP, due to its differences on CAA, the hardcore Sikhs and Punjabi (Khatri) voters appear to have tilted towards AAP.

According to Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parabandhak Committee, Sikhs have glorious past of battles with Mughals, and at the community has this confidence to take on Muslims if there was a need. Sikh sangat is miffed with the thought of Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sagh (RSS) that Sikhs are part of Hinduism. With statements of BJP's political leaders, like - 'shoot the traitors' have developed a sense of fear among Punjabi Sikhs and refugees too. Punjab Assembly had recently passed a resolution against CAA. Hari Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Tilak Nagar , Jangpura and few other Punjbai dominated seats are witnessing a tough battle.

Baniya plays a crucial role in Dehi's politics but the low cash flow in market, sealing of shops in market areas have broken local economy in streets. While watching this contest a close fight between Modi and Kejriwal, Baniyas have maintained the subtle balance with Kejriwal for Delhi and Narendra Modi in Centre. Moreover - Kejriwal who himself is a Baniya, has a strong networking with the community here.

Thirdly, the Poorvanchal factor has become dominant in Delhi elections. AAP had won 13 seats by fielding Poorvanchali leaders in 2015 elections. Analysis of the available trends indicate that the 'upper caste ' among poorvanchali migrants to Delhi have shown their unconditional support to the BJP in Lok Sabha elections and this time also, Barhamins and upper castes may go with BJP. Poorvanchalis other the upper castes may go the AAP.

Kejriwal's 'governance model' and his ability to convince the people by the delivery of the promises made in the party manifesto. Construction of more than 12 attached community bathrooms/washrooms which were one or two in Shiela Dikshit's regime, free electricity and water, availability of doctors for primary health services in Mohalla clinics, improvements in Delhi government run hospitals, accreditation of parents in government school as a vital board member have strengthened AAP and people are showing unconditional support to the party irrespective of national concern as a family is saving Rs 2000 -3000 per month with free DTC travel in buses plus water/electricity.

Another important factor which is expansion of EWS quota in high end private schools possible due to active participation of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

Fourth - Musilm and SC voters both contain 22 assembly seats in Delhi. In previous 2015 assembly elections, the overall vote hare for AAP was 54 percent. Interestingly SC and Muslim vote share was highest overall with vote percentage 68 and 77 percent respectively while OBC vote are was 60 percent, Sikhs - 57 , non -literates - 67 , poor 66 and migrants from Bihar and Jharkahnd vote share was 64 percent while 59 percent of vote percentage was from young people(18 -35 years), on contrary - overall BJP's vote percentage share was 33 percentage where Baniya vote percentage was 60, Jat -59 ,Brahmin -49 , Rajputs -44 , Upper Class 43 , migrants from Punjab , Haryana - 42 , college educated 39 and elderly (60 + years ) was 36 percent. In 1993 elections, BJP gained maximum support of SC community. Delhi has 12 constituencies reserved for SC candidates. Interestingly, In 1993, BJP won with 42.80 percent of votes while Congress was first runner with vote percentage -34.50, In 1998, BJP managed to get 34 percent vote while Congress attained power with 47 percent vote share. In 2003 , Congress won with 48.10 percent vote share while BJP got 35.20 percent vote while in 2008, Congress again won with vote share percentage 40.30 while BJP got 36.30 percent, In 2013 with induction of AAP , BJP won in triangular fight and managed to gain 33.30 percent and AAP was first runner with 29.70 followed by Congress. In 2015, AAP managed to win with 54.50 percent of vote and BJP was first runner with overall vote percentage -32.30 percent.

While BJP's stakes are high in these elections but no projection of Chief Ministerial candidate has put voters in dilemma who are unwilling to cast their vote to Congress and Kejriwal is the only choice for them and keeping this fight between class versus class as like Modi in Center , Kejriwal also has ended caste politics in Delhi. The elections results would provide fodders of the pollsters as they sit back to analyse the overall poll data of Delhi.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/freebies-give-aap-an-edge-over-spirited-bjp-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/freebies-give-aap-an-edge-over-spirited-bjp.html

224,07-2-20,Actress Jameela Jamil comes out as queer,"Actress and radio presenter Jameela Jamil has came out as queer on Twitter.

""The Good Place"" star had added a rainbow to her Twitter name years ago, but she had never revealed her sexuality officially, reports cnn.com.

""I kept it low because I was scared of the pain of being accused of performative bandwagon jumping, over something that caused me a lot of confusion, fear and turmoil when I was a kid,"" Jamil said.

Jamil said that it was scary to come out as a South Asian actress in her 30s, and that Twitter was not the place she wanted to do it.

This week, Jamil has been addressing backlash surrounding her involvement in ""Legendary,"" an upcoming HBO Max ballroom competition show.

Ballroom culture came out of New York City as black and Latino gay men and trans women created support systems for one another called houses. Houses gather at balls, safe spaces with competitions celebrating skills including fashion, dance and vogue.

""Transparent"" and ""Pose"" actress Trace Lysette criticised the decision to hire someone who was not part of the culture.

""I interviewed for this gig. As the mother of a house for nearly a decade it's kind of kind blowing when people with no connection to our culture gets the gig. This is not shade towards Jameela -- I love all that she stands for. If anything, I question the decision-makers,"" Lysette said on her Twitter handle.

Jamil went on to say in the post: ""I know that my being queer doesn't qualify me as ballroom. But I have privilege and power and a large following to bring to this show, (as does the absolutely iconic Megan Thee Stallion,) and its beautiful contestants and ballroom hosts.""

225,07-2-20,'Malang' is about wanton mush and gritty mayhem,"""Malang""; Cast: Anil Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Disha Patani, Kunal Kemmu; Direction: Mohit Suri; Rating: * * * (three stars)

""Malang"" must be the most stylishly executed Bollywood thriller in a while, also the most twisted. It is really an old-school revenge thriller that manages a few clever spins despite an overall adherence to loud, larger-than-life masala.

Mohit Suri's ""Malang"" is a wanton play of oomph and machismo, mush and mayhem, melody and melodrama, anchored by a very filmi tale of revenge. The film teams a hero who's beefed up in search of a saleable image with a heroine who doesn't have to try too hard to look sexy. The element of unpredictability is buoyed by a set of key characters who have a deeper layer beyond what they superficially seem to be.

""Malang"" is about a romance that has been messed up by the bad guys, and the evident scope of retribution it opens up for the hero.

If that core idea sounds cliched, Aniruddha Guha's screenplay maintains suspense by opting for a parallel narrative structure while unfolding what lead to violent revenge in a flashback track, and how it is executed in the presentday sequences.

The story takes off on a Christmas eve, with a mysterious man, Advait (Aditya Roy Kapur), calling up an encounter specialist cop named Agashe (Anil Kapoor) to inform the police of his intention to unleash a series of killings before the night ends.

Soon, it becomes clear that Advait is targeting only policemen. It is upto Agashe and the seemingly idealistic cop Michael Rodriguez (Kunal Kemmu) to find out why, and also nab the killer before it is too late.

While the suspense builds up with brutal urgency in the presentday track, the flashback picture that moves parallely is one of sunny romance.

The flashbacks are soaked in the sun and sands of Goa, and they usher Disha Patani into the picture as Sara. Vikas Sivaraman's camera virtually lays out a pretty pamphlet in motion for Goa Tourism as Advait and Sara paint the club circuit red. The film also gives fleeting peek into Goa's psychedelic drug scene (incidentally, the choice of words to convey the statutory warnings accompanying scenes of drugs and smoking is often inadvertently hilarious).

Mohit Suri's storytelling gets able aid from Devendra Murdeshwar's editing. The film has been adequately cut, especially the thriller portions and the scenes of violence.

Over the years, an important aspect of any Mohit Suri film has been the soundtrack. This time, Suri has used five composers for five songs and, mercifully, we are spared Bollywood's onging remix/recreation fetish. But surprisingly, the music of ""Malang"" hardly contributes to the film. You would be struggling to recall any of the songs beyond the title track.

Aditya Roy Kapur is either in beach mode (when he is frolicking with Disha Patani in or around the Goan party circuit) or in the beefcake mode (when he is gunning for vengeance in a red hoodie). The action avatar is clearly Aditya's attempt at an image makeover and, although imagined with over-the-top absurdity, the actor does a fine job portraying Advait. For Disha Patani, this is her strongest role yet, and she is impressive in the way she retains the allure about her character.

Few in Bollywood relish portraying grey shades as Anil Kapoor. In ""Malang"", he is unapologetically wicked, executing villainy with wry humour.

For Kunal Kemmu, this is his most remarkable act since his child artist performance in 1998's ""Zakhm"" -- which says a lot about how underutilised the actor has remained over the years. Essaying a character that metamorphoses quietly into a totally different human being, Kunal admirably blends complex emotions with understated ease.

Like most of Mohit Suri's protagonists over the years, the characters of ""Malang"" are all temperamentally quirky and morally flexible, which makes them interesting to watch. The problem is elements of formulaic familiarity seem to have crept into Mohit Suri's idiom of filmi fiction.

226,07-2-20,"Facebook, Instagram users just copy friends' eating habits","Our Facebook or Instagram friends implicitly influence our eating habits as social media users are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables -- or snack on junk food -- if they think their friends do the same, say researchers.

The research by the UK-based Aston University's School of Life and Health Sciences found that study participants ate an extra fifth of a portion of fruit and vegetables themselves for every portion they thought their social media peers ate.

Conversely, the Facebook users were found to consume an extra portion of unhealthy snack foods and sugary drinks for every three portions they believed their online social circles did.

The finding suggests we eat around a third more junk food if we think our friends also indulge.

""This suggests we may be influenced by our social peers more than we realise when choosing certain foods. We seem to be subconsciously accounting for how others behave when making our own food choices,"" said Aston University student Lily Hawkins who led the study alongside supervisor Dr Jason Thomas.

In the study, published in the scientific journal Appetite, the researchers asked 369 university students to estimate the amount of fruit, vegetables, 'energy-dense snacks' and sugary drinks their Facebook peers consumed on a daily basis.

This information was cross-referenced with the participants' own actual eating habits and showed that those who felt their social circles 'approved' of eating junk food consumed significantly more themselves.

Meanwhile, those who thought their friends ate a healthy diet ate more portions of fruit and veg.

Their perceptions could have come from seeing friends' posts about the food and drink they consumed, or simply a general impression of their overall health.

There was no significant link between the participants' eating habits and their Body Mass Index (BMI), a standard measure of healthy weight, however.

""If we believe our friends are eating plenty of fruit and veg we're more likely to eat fruit and veg ourselves. On the other hand, if we feel they're happy to consume lots of snacks and sugary drinks, it can give us a 'licence to overeat' foods that are bad for our health, said Hawkins.

The researchers said the next stage of their work would track a participant group over time to see whether the influence of social media on eating habits had a longer-term impact on weight.

""The implication is that we can use social media as a tool to 'nudge' each other's eating behaviour within friendship groups, and potentially use this knowledge as a tool for public health interventions,"" wrote the researchers.

With children and young people spending a huge amount of time interacting with peers and influencers via social media, ""the important new findings from this study could help shape how we deliver interventions that help them adopt healthy eating habits from a young age - and stick with them for life,"" noted Professor Claire Farrow, Director of Aston University's Applied Health Research Group.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook--instagram-users-just-copy-friends--eating-habits-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/facebook--instagram-users-just-copy-friends--eating-habits.html
227,07-2-20,You can now disable Netflix's annoying autoplay feature,"Streaming giant Netflix is finally doing away with the annoying feature that autoplayed previews when users scrolled through the video streaming platforms content.

The company will also let users turn off the autoplay feature that starts the next episode of a show they are watching.

People can choose to disable autoplay in two different formats: one that automatically starts the next episode in a series and one that autoplays previews while browsing.

Netflix rolled out an option to disable autoplay with episodes in a series way back in 2014, but this new setting specifically relates to the autoplay previews on the homepage, The Verge reported on Wednesday.

It is pertinent to note that there have been Reddit discussion threads, YouTube videos, and Twitters posts from annoyed customers who have asked the streaming giant to do away with the autoplay features.

One person was so frustrated that they created an entire Twitter account just to ask Netflix to please stop. The company is now pointing subscribers to an updated help page on its website to learn how to disable the annoying function, the report added.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/you-can-now-disable-netflix-s-annoying-autoplay-feature-2020-02-07.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/you-can-now-disable-netflix-s-annoying-autoplay-feature.html
