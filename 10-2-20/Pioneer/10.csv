0,10-2-20,An electric future,"The Auto Expo revealed new electric vehicle concepts but we should still be wary of a headlong rush into electrification

From Mercedes-Benz’ EQC luxury electric car to the micro-urban electric runabouts shown by Chinese manufacturers, Tata and Mahindra’s latest electric offerings alongside future concepts as well as those from Maruti-Suzuki and Hyundai and tens of start-ups showcasing Chinese-made electric two-wheelers, one can clearly say that the 2020 Auto Expo held over this past weekend was “electrifying.” But even Bollywood icon Shah Rukh Khan, who attended, highlighted that there are certain problems with electric cars that need to be solved and rightly pointed out that battery disposal is a problem if there is large-scale electric adoption. There are other problems too. India has little or no charging infrastructure and will need to dramatically enhance not just the front-end charging aspect of the electric car but also the back-end of the electrical grid as well as accelerate the shift from inefficient thermal plants to renewable sources. But this ignores the biggest elephant in the room, that India does not have the manufacturing skills and supplier base currently to make the overnight shift to electric cars and motorcycles. Almost all the electric cars and two-wheelers on display at the Auto Expo were more Chinese than Indian and given the current jobs crisis, the Government has to be very measured about how quickly it forces the industry to change. The automotive sector today provides millions of jobs and companies like Bajaj Auto, Royal Enfield as well as Maruti-Suzuki and Hyundai are “Make in India” success stories. On top of everything, electric cars are still far too expensive. The premium for an electric car, even while considering its ridiculously low operating costs, is not something you can make up over the eight years that the battery is guaranteed for by most manufacturers.

Make no mistake, electric vehicles (EVs) are a sign of the future and it is a shift that every motorist, no matter how much of a petrolhead he/she is, will have to make. These vehicles emit no direct pollution and with improvements in battery technology, they are very handy daily commutes. However, they are expensive and while battery power might make sense on less complex two and three-wheel vehicles, on cars, batteries take up almost two-thirds of the cost. Chairman Emeritus of Tata Group Ratan Tata rightly pointed out on his Instagram on the eve of the Auto Expo that hybrids should also be part of the solution. From a cost perspective for end consumers, these make the most sense — smaller battery packs, no range anxiety as one still has the petrol engine, better fuel economy and a pleasant driving performance kick as well. Several new supercars are all hybrids. Maruti-Suzuki has a hybrid version of its Swift hatchback on display as well. It might have looked the same but it was offering 50-60 per cent higher fuel economy than the standard petrol variant for about a lakh rupees more, a cost you could make up in about three years of ownership, which should be a win-win in the short run. India has to think of less polluting automotive solutions but it must not lose sight of the fact that despite our aspirations, most Indians are not rich and may not be able to buy into the electric dream just yet. Costs are something that our policy makers have to keep in mind and not close the door to more affordable options.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-electric-future-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/an-electric-future.html
1,10-2-20,Kolkata’s unlikely icon,"As Bengal’s first Indian cabaret dancer, Miss Shefali chronicled her times and even challenged them

Somehow, when you remember Ms Shefali, you would describe her as Calcutta’s, not Kolkata’s, queen of cabaret. Not because Calcutta sounds more anglicised. But because she iconised the rebellion and swing of the 1960s, the first Indian to perfect a sensuous Western dance form and own it on her terms, a diva who danced with her long open hair and unbound passion, a working class girl who mastered high society niceties to win appreciation but was rooted to reality and a seductress, who led the night to the dawn. And in the fullness of herself, she was the forever dreamcatcher. Hence, always attributed with the mystique of a “Miss.” She commanded a legion of fans, from the legendary Satyajit Ray to Amitabh Bachchan, with nimble-footed ease. And in many ways symbolised the transition of Calcutta, the fairy lights of nightclubs topping the prosperity of trading houses and industries, crashing with the last vestiges of European withdrawal and the pangs of a post-Independent economy coming to terms with itself. Born Arati Das, she was a child of the Partition, the youngest of three sisters in a refugee family from across the border, landing in Calcutta in a morass of despair. With the family finding feet as household helps, Das, too, landed in an Anglo-Indian home, where she watched the dancers at evening parties as she served and waited tables. Self-taught, she started performing cabaret at the age of 12 at Firpo’s. There was no looking back since, as she trained and disciplined herself in more dance forms like cha cha, the Charleston and so on, learnt to speak like her audience and even toppled the experts in popularity. Such was her single-minded zeal to be the best in a desperate lunge for survival. She embodied the angry young woman, much before the angry young man was born, she was the rebel much before students were. And as Bengal lapsed into the desolateness of a political and industrial upheaval — with labour unions, strikes, joblessness and the rise of the Left — she became one of the many faces of the proletariat, breaking many barriers with her self-made destiny. She paralleled the intellectual renaissance of the times and even questioned its culture club hypocrisy, one that saw cabaret as a risque indulgence rather than a practised art form and one she elevated with her sense of dignity. A performance discipline she developed, what few know, from being a trained classical dancer as well. If liberalism of the intelligentsia was about being open to influences, then it desperately failed Ms Shefali, who has documented the denial in her autobiography Sandhya Raater Shefali (Shefali of the Evenings and Nights). A wallflower that could be coveted but not coopted in the bhadralok environs of Kolkata. For all the spectacularity about her rise, she remained an outcaste and an upstart. Except for Ray, who cast her in two films, Seemabaddha and Pratidwandi, and who ensured her welfare, no help came her way.

As live acts dwindled and the city’s club culture died out, Das did reinvent herself with the times, taking to the stage and even folk plays or jatra. Over time, she slipped into bad times. A realist, she refused marriage to suitors, knowing full well that nobody would look after her extended family and scaled down her lifestyle. No Government recognised her, leave alone help her. In her last days, a city jewellery house, which helps ailing artistes, set aside a monthly pension of `5,000 for her treatment. In her timeline, she lived the rise of Calcutta and the fall of Kolkata. There’s now talk of a web-series and film on her life. Sadly, she wasn’t celebrated in life, a power to herself than being empowered.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kolkata---s-unlikely-icon-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/kolkata---s-unlikely-icon.html
2,10-2-20,The Parliament’s prerogative,"It is the right of the House to incorporate a provision saving the Bill passed by the Assembly and pending before the council at the time of its abolition or not

The Andhra Pradesh Government has forwarded a resolution passed by the State Assembly for the abolition of the Legislative Council to the Parliament. This move by the State Government came after the Legislative Council resisted the Bill relating to creation of three capitals passed by the Assembly by referring the same to a select committee.

For the uninitiated, the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Government moved a historic Bill in the Legislative Assembly to have three separate capitals for the three arms of the State, with Amaravati as the legislative capital, Visakhapatnam as the executive capital and Kurnool as the judicial capital of Andhra Pradesh. With this decision, the upcoming city of Amaravati prematurely ceases to be the sole seat of power as was envisioned by the previous Government.

Termed as the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020, the new Bill seeks to relocate the secretariat, offices of the heads of the Government departments and Raj Bhavan at Vizag, which is designated as the executive capital. By becoming home to the offices of Chief Minister, Governor and the entire top-rung of the official establishment, the port city of Vizag would become the new capital of Andhra Pradesh for all practical purposes.

Designated as the judicial capital, Kurnool city will have the State High Court and other judicial institutions under the new scheme of arrangement under the new legislation. The three cities are located in three distinct regions of the State — Andhra, North Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema. Initially, the passage of the Bill was deemed only a formality, as the ruling YSR Congress Party commands a strength of 151 out of 175 seats in the State Assembly. Now, the fate of the Bill referred to the select committee by the Legislative Council, is in question when the State Assembly has passed a resolution for its dissolution. There is an argument that the Bill would not lapse on dissolution of the council.

We have been witnessing various other State Assemblies passing resolutions for abolition or creation of the Legislative Council as required under Article 169(1) of the Constitution of India. Though some of the States had passed resolutions, they were not pursued. In this background there is a necessity to examine the constitutional provisions and the legislations that were made by the Parliament earlier, abolishing or creating the Legislative Councils pursuant to the resolutions passed by the State Assembly.

Article 168 of the Constitution provides for two Houses, namely the Legislative Assembly (Lower House) and the Legislative Council (Upper House). However Article 169 enables the State Legislative Assembly to pass a resolution for abolition of the Legislative Council i.e, the second chamber of the legislature.

The procedure contained in the said Article shows that the Parliament may by law act upon the resolution passed by the Assembly. Article 169(2) contemplates that the law made by the Parliament under Article 169(1) shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law and also contain incidental and consequential provisions as the Parliament may deem necessary.

The word “may” used in Article 169(1) shows that the Parliament has discretionary powers either to accept or reject the resolution passed by the Assembly. It cannot be construed that on a resolution passed by the Assembly for abolition or creation of the Legislative Council the Parliament automatically accepts the same.

In 1985, before the State of Andhra Pradesh was split into two and the State of Telangana was born in 2014, the Assembly passed a resolution for abolition of the Legislative Council and the same was abolished on May 31, 1985 by making a law called the Andhra Pradesh Legislature Council (Abolition) Act, 1985. Section 7 of the said Act deals with the pending Bills. It contemplates that the Bills which originate from the Legislative Council and are pending at the time of abolition of the council, shall lapse and the Bills which originated from the Assembly and are pending in the council shall not lapse on its abolition. The then Chief Minister NT Rama Rao prevailed in pursuing the case with the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

By making a law under Article 169(1) the name of the State having a Legislative Council shall be deleted from Article 168(1)(a) of the Constitution by amendment of Article 168(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court in Kesavanand Bharathi’s case had examined various provisions facilitating amendments to the Constitution viz. Article 4, Article 169, V and VI Schedules of the Constitution and Article 368 of the Constitution.

The apex court had held that in case of the amendments which may be made in exercise of the powers under Article 4, Article 169, Para 7 of the Fifth Schedule and Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule shall not be deemed to be amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of Article 368. Therefore, the procedure contemplated under Article 368 of the Constitution for deletion of the name of the State contained in Article 168(1)(a) is not required to be followed. It is sufficient if a law is made under Article 169(1) of the Constitution.

Now, the issue that arises for consideration is with regard to the fate of pending Bills before the council on its abolition by making a law under Article 169(1) of the Constitution.

A Parliamentary Committee that went into the Bills introduced in respect of creation of Assam and Rajasthan councils suggested that the Center evolve a national policy for creation and abolition of Legislative Councils in States so that the second chamber does not depend on the “whims and fancies” of the newly-elected Government and the status of the council cannot be of a temporary nature depending upon the mood of the State Government.

Earlier when the law was made under Article 169(1) of the Constitution in relation to the abolition of the council in some States, a specific provision was incorporated with regard to the fate of the Bills pending before it at the time of abolition. Such a provision contemplated two instances.

First, the Bills that originate from the Assembly and which are pending in the council for consideration shall not lapse on abolition and shall be deemed to have been passed before such commencement by both Houses of the Legislature of the State. Second, the Bills that originate in the council and are pending at the time of abolition shall lapse.

This means that if a Bill is passed by the Assembly and is pending before the council at the time of the abolition of the council, the Bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses. Article 169(2) of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to incorporate provisions in the law made under Article 169(1) for abolition of the council as may deem necessary. It is the prerogative of the Parliament to incorporate a provision saving the Bill passed by the Assembly and pending before the council at the time of its abolition or not.

The Constitution of the country empowers the Parliament to take into consideration the nature of consequential provisions to be incorporated in the Act while abolishing the council. The totality of the circumstances may be taken into account while incorporating such a provision.

It is the prerogative of the Parliament to incorporate the nature of the provision vis.vis the fate of the Bill pending in the council. It is not mandatory that a saving provision protecting the Bills passed by the Assembly and pending before the Legislative Council should contain in the law made under Article 169(1) of the Constitution.

The Constitution does not mandate any such provision to be contained in the Abolition Act. It depends upon the persuasion of the State Government and if the Bill is referred to a Parliamentary Committee, the recommendation of the same would decide the fate of the council.

If the Legislative Council is not abolished and it does not agree with the Bill passed by the Assembly, the procedure contemplated under Article 197 of the Constitution may be invoked by the State Assembly by again passing the Bill and transmit the same to the council. Irrespective of the decision of the council, the Bill is deemed to have been passed.

3,10-2-20,Roadmap for better healthcare,"As the US-India trade deal inches closer we need to look into creating strong policies that promote innovation coming to our shores

Healthcare in India is in dire need of policy disruptions by looking into the future with a mechanism that will transform the way the country treats its patients and regulate drugs and medical devices. A balanced policy approach seems to be the only solution, with focus on quality treatment and patient safety, working towards the overall development of the healthcare sector. With the US-India trade deal inching closer towards clinching a milestone that would benefit bilateral ties between the two countries, the current time is particularly important for healthcare in the country. That takes us to the question, what does the US-India trade deal mean for the medical device sector? If approached right, the deal will benefit India, giving the industry the much-needed impetus and encourage innovation in medical devices to address the unmet needs of this sector. The importance of trade relations between the two countries can be better understood from the fact that the US was the second-largest trading partner of India in 2018 and the single-largest export destination for India. The bilateral trade between the US and India reached $142.1 billion by 2018 when it had a trade deficit of $24.2 billion with respect to India.

According to the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, 2019, India’s tariff rates on other members of the WTO remain the highest of any major economy. With the ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, there are speculations that suggest that a move to remove blanket price caps for high-end medical devices could be on the anvil, with the authorities inclining towards a scientific method like Trade Margin Rationalisation (TMR) to encourage fair trade. The move will not only aid innovation in medical devices but also create an environment that prospers growth in the sector. Even as media reports suggest a 30 per cent cap on trade margins, domestic players have written to the Prime Minister to take a step against TMR.

What does TMR mean for India? The country needs to understand that TMR is nothing but a bridge between quality and affordability. Let’s understand how. Trade margins essentially mean a price cap on the upstream margins rather than products downstream. The idea is to incentivise innovation coming into the country. It is the difference between the price at which the manufacturer sells to trade and the price borne by the patients (MRP). As the Government looks at TMR as a possible scientific approach to give the domestic and international players a level playing field to address the existing gaps in the healthcare system, it is important that this is done with the right approach. For instance, if calculated at the landed cost, it will discourage investors as it will not consider, a foreign firm’s expenses in India. It is an overly narrow and unfair framework that could negatively impact investment in enhancing capabilities and bringing quality products to Indian shores. Hence, for TMR to be fair, it is imperative that the Government considers the global company’s subsidiary as a domestic firm, with added costs not borne by the typical domestic firm, for purposes of the trade margin approach. What we need to understand at this juncture is that India depends on 80 per cent imports of medical devices to meet its existing needs. Now, for companies to continue investing, we need to take into account the expenses borne by them on financing sales and collection costs, training clinicians, providing technical support to clinicians or patients for the product and more. They also pay Indian corporate taxes and other normal expenses for developing and serving the market here. Now, if their efforts are not incentivised, it will discourage innovation from coming to our shores. For instance, doctors rely on globally-accepted standards of quality equipment coming from innovators around the world. If a patient needs a gold-standard heart stent and it is not available in the market because of an unfavourable regulatory or pricing regime, it will hit patient safety. For over two years now patients have been distanced from global innovation in health technology and premium quality stents and implants due to a price cap imposed on them. As we look at TMR as a possible solution, it is imperative that we look at measures like TMR from an approach that offers transparency in the pricing matrix. If the Government wants to check if intermediaries are making excessive profits by raising service charges to offset any reduction in revenue from sales of medical devices, a mechanism should be devised to counter it. We are just a decade away from 2030 — a target India has set for itself to achieve Universal Health Coverage. To achieve the same, the promises of affordable and accessible healthcare will take a hit if India is not able to provide its patients with the devices they need to address their concerns. We need to look into creating strong policies that promote innovation coming in to raise the standard of healthcare. The equipment used to derive conditions of the patients needs to be accurate beyond doubt. The world is looking at us as a medical hub and we must encourage it. We need better healthcare polices to address the evolving needs of our population. At a time when advanced technology is fighting disease burdens globally, we cannot turn a blind eye to these innovations.

4,10-2-20,How should the state deal with PTM?,"Imran Khan’s PTI needs to find common ground between Pashtun nationalism and the state’s evolving post-Islamist narrative

On January 27, the Peshawar police arrested Manzoor Pashteen, the chief of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM). PTM is a Pashtun human rights outfit that was formed in 2014 in the erstwhile Fata. This area, which was only recently made part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, has been the main theatre of a war between Pakistan’s armed forces and the militant Islamist groups that had come to dominate Fata in the early 2000s and onwards. After 2007, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) rose as a conglomerate of 13 Islamist outfits operating near the Pak-Afghan border. The umbrella group’s aims included the overthrow of the Pakistani state, and the imposition of Sharia rule.

Apart from attacking Government and civilian targets through suicide bombings and assassinations, the TTP also indulged in kidnapping, extortion, robberies and profiteering from the flow of drugs through the territories that it came to occupy.

The bulk of TTP’s leadership and fighters came from various Pashtun tribes. But from 2015, TTP’s dominance in Fata was greatly reduced through a concentrated military operation led by General Raheel Sharif. This war was a continuation of sorts of the manner in which various areas of Fata in particular and KP in general, were unceasingly impacted by the tumultuous fallout of the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The insurgency, bankrolled by the US and Saudi Arabia and directly facilitated by Pakistan, was promoted as a “jihad.”

PTM’s leadership and supporters are not comfortable with the fact that religious militancy in KP had begun to be described by some as the new face of Pashtun nationalism. PTM insists that this perception was engineered by those who were threatened by the original “secular” Pashtun nationalism of men such as Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan.

There is enough evidence to demonstrate that, indeed, a large number of Pashtuns were involved in various Islamist outfits. But PTM has often responded to this by lamenting that Pakistan, after “manipulating Pashtuns” to fight a “holy war” in Afghanistan, has usurped their constitutional rights in erstwhile Fata, especially after overpowering the TTP. It also accuses the state of allowing religious militants to operate there.

PTM is, in fact, a contemporary version of classical Pashtun nationalism. This nationalism was overshadowed by the rise of political Islam and then militancy among various Pashtun tribes during the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan.

PTM claims that “state-backed” religious militancy was used to neutralise Pashtun nationalism and replace it with a narrative that explained this nationalism in the context of Islam. This, PTM believes, diverted the core intent of Pashtun nationalism (i.e., gaining rights) and made it to mean a way to strive for an Islamic state.

Interestingly, those at the helm of PTM today are calling for a military solution to the militant problem that had gripped KP and Fata. Therefore, the military operation which kicked off in earnest in late-2014 was applauded. The militants were driven out but the areas in which the operation took place experienced severe population displacements and destruction of property. This is when PTM upped the ante and claimed that the Pashtuns of these areas were not only being abandoned but that they were being treated as former TTP collaborators.

The state did win the war. But it seems unsure exactly how to formulate its approach towards PTM. Although still opposed to the classical idea of Pashtun nationalism, the state is now equally opposed to the militant religious dimension that was added to it from the 1980s onwards.

So where to go from here? The answer may lie in how, decades ago, the state and Government amicably resolved the commotion caused by Sindhi nationalism which surfaced in the late 1960s, thanks to the intellectual and political efforts of a literary organisation called Bazm-i-Sufia-i-Sindh, that was headed by scholar and politician GM Syed.

This sentiment attracted thousands of youths across Sindh. Nevertheless, during the 1970 election, a majority of Sindhis voted for the PPP, the Left-leaning party led by Bhutto. Bhutto, a proud Sindhi, was a federalist and a staunch Pakistani nationalist. But despite the victory of a federalist party in Sindh, Sindhi nationalism continued to mushroom. In 1972, one year after the acrimonious departure of the Bengali-majority East Pakistan, Syed declared Bhutto Punjab’s puppet and formed the separatist Jeeay Sindh party.

Julien Levesque, in his essay for the June 11, 2013 issue of South Asia Multidisciplinary Academic Journal, writes that, as a response, the Bhutto regime allowed greater cultural expression to the country’s ethnic groups, in a bid to bring them within the ambit of Pakistani nationalism.

Bhutto was particularly successful in appropriating the Sindhi nationalist narrative in the context of Pakistani federalism. This became apparent when, in 1975, his Government held a large conference on Sindhi culture. Hamida Khuhro’s 1981 book, Sindh through the Centuries, chronicles the proceedings of the conference. From it one can see how, through intellect and dialogue, Sindhi nationalism was neutralised by the Government. Interestingly, it is also due to this that a majority of Sindhis see PPP as a bridge to the economic and political benefits of federalism.

From 2013, Imran Khan’s PTI has been popular in KP. Khan presents himself as a Pashtun. PTI thus could have (and still can) play the kind of role Bhutto’s PPP played in this context. The aim should be to amicably defuse the resurgence of classical Pashtun nationalism in the province.

But the problem is that Khan too reiterates the conflicted understanding of Pashtun nationalism which describes it as being a synthesis of Islamic and tribal conservatism. He needs to understand that PTM is trying to alter this very perception. PTM has constantly rooted its arguments in the Constitution. Even though it is largely invested in reviving the classic Pashtun nationalism, its leadership has often suggested that the only thing that keeps Pakistan’s many ethnic groups together as a nation is the Constitution. One wonders, how is this thinking seditious?

More than the establishment, it has to be Khan’s party to intellectually and politically engage with PTM and direct its narrative towards the larger national narrative. The state itself is trying to create a new post-Islamist narrative. Despite what some may insist, the fact is, there is now no dogma in this context. This should be seen as an opportunity by PTI to help find a common ground between PTM’s Pashtun nationalism and the state’s evolving post-Islamist narrative.

5,10-2-20,Autonomous regional council for KBK demanded,"A new forum has been set up to demand formation of an autonomous regional council for the KBK region (undivided Koraput, Kalahandi, Balangir and Kandhmal districts).

The forum that was formed here comprises leaders of Rayagada, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Kalahandi, Nuapada, Balangir, Suabarnpur, Boudh and Kandhamal, the 10 districts under the KBK region, who were present at a meeting here.

The forum would fight for fulfilment of aspirations of the people of the region. Formation of an autonomous council is allowed under the Constitutional framework, forum convenor and senior lawyer N Ahmed said.

According to the decisions taken, the forum would be a non-political organisation and people from all walks of life from the KBK region would be a part of it, he said.

In addition, a decision was also taken to collect all data concerning the region and its people, contribution of revenue of the region to the Government, funds allotted to the region, poverty, backwardness and economy of the region, deprivation of basic needs, state of health, education, employment problems and regional imbalance, Ahmed said.

The forum alleged that successive Governments have failed in providing basic needs to the people of the region even after 72 years of Independence.

Congress leader Pradeep Majhi said people of the region have not got the rights and benefits which have been assured in the Constitution. As a result, a big gap has been created between the KBK region and other areas in the State.

Former Nabarangpur BJP MP Parsuram Majhi said a team should be set up to visit the existing autonomous councils in other States. Congress leader and former Union Minister Bhakta Charan Das made an elaborate presentation of the socioeconomic issues concerning the people of the region. The need of the hour is an autonomous regional council for the region and to launch a peaceful movement to get it, Das said.

The regional imbalance between the KBK region and rest of the State is clearly visible in every sphere, former Kandhmal MP Nakul Naik said.

A number of former legislators of the region also spoke in support of creation of an autonomous regional council for the KBK region.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/autonomous-regional-council-for-kbk-demanded.html
6,10-2-20,‘BJD responsible for Cong infighting’,"While the Congress high command is worried over the internal squabble in the Odisha Congress, a recent report by two senior leaders of the AICC on the activities of some dissident leaders is being widely discussed among party workers.

The report says Naba Kishore Das and some other Congress leaders had switched over to BJD before the last Assembly elections and subsequently awarded important posts, including Ministerial berths. Now, the BJD has engaged these leaders to engineer infighting in the Congress.

Cuttack-Barabati MLA Mohammed Moquim’ s name was proposed by some dissidents for PCC president post, with the strong backing of Bapi Sarkhel, which expanded the infighting. It is reported that some BJD leaders backed this move, with an assurance to protect the business interest of both the Congress leaders. After getting this report, the Congress high command is worried on the future of the party in the State.

“The BJD is also trying to allure some dissidents to join it before the municipal and panchayat elections,” said the report. While the BJD and the BJP now are in a same political block, the Congress has got a scope to act as a real opposition. Above all, the Congress and its alliance captured the Government in the neighboring States of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Particularly, these two States have political impact on Odisha on many counts.

In this circumstance, a united Congress has a chance to fight back the ruling party, asserted the report. The Congress high command would take very important decision based on the report soon, said a reliable source.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---bjd-responsible-for-cong-infighting---.html
7,10-2-20,Hijacking the narrative,"Under the aegis of Trump, the Republican movement of classical conservatism has veered sharply towards hard protectionism, isolationism, populism and above all confrontationism

Various polls that seek to ascertain the greatest President in the US’ history have almost always ranked Abraham Lincoln as the nation’s most esteemed leader. Lincoln, the quintessential statesman, was also the first Republican President who is remembered for his Gettysburg Address, which posited the Grand Old Party’s (GOP as the Republican Party is known) progressive commitment towards liberty, equal rights, republicanism and democracy. Beyond unmatched statecraft with dignity, aplomb and humility, Lincoln was known to be personally sympathetic, magnanimous and accommodative of “others.”

The Republican Party of Lincoln was indeed founded on the noble impulses of anti-slavery, social progression and liberality. Today, the same party has an incumbent President in the White House, Donald Trump, who enjoys the highest-ever approval rating for any President from within the same party i.e, 95 per cent (such polls are a 20th and 21st century phenomenon only). The Republican movement from classical conservatism has veered sharply towards hard protectionism, isolationism, populism and above all, confrontationism.

In this era of Republicanism, forget basic courtesies afforded by Opposition party colleagues, even own partymen are not spared. Take the example of Trump’s public anger against former Republican-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, “Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election.” Romney’s ostensible crime was that he had taken a position on Trump’s impeachment notice by stating, “The best we can do in the Senate is strive to meet the obligations outlined by our founding fathers — to honour our Constitutional duty and fulfil our oath to do impartial justice.” This style of language and expression is clearly out of place in Trump’s Republican Party.

Trump is no versed Republican ideologue and has brazenly changed party affiliation five times, including that to the principal Opposition party, the Democrats. In 2004, he had said, “I probably identify more as a Democrat.” He returned to the Republican Party only in 2012 and by 2016, won the presidential contest as a Republican candidate. Political and personal flip-flops notwithstanding, today, Trump has firmly ensconced himself at the centre of redefining his party’s moorings that has very little bearing to the one under Lincoln. The party’s perfunctory “11 principles of American renewal” includes one on “values”, which ironically states, “Our country should value the traditions of family, life, religious liberty and hard work.”

Trump’s complete grip on the Republican Party’s fate is exemplified by party Chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, who is a personal nominee and Trump’s sworn loyalist even though she is the niece of fellow Republican Senator, Romney. For good measure, McDaniel (she had presciently dropped her middle name) tweeted obligingly, “This is not the first time I have disagreed with Mitt and I imagine it will not be the last. The bottom line is President Trump did nothing wrong and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him.”

So what explains the phenomenal success of a President who is known to lie more frequently than a human washes hands? Washington Post’s fact-checker had documented 10,796 presidential statements in 869 days that were either misleading or outright lies. This calculates to more than 12 lies a day. Trump slams any inconvenient fact or query as “fake news.” He incredulously stated, “What you’re seeing and what you

are reading is not what’s happening.”

Clearly, Trump’s brashness and bravado at “getting even” with the historically-perceived snootiness and indulgences of the intelligentsia (read Democrats or the progressive/moderate elements within the Republican Party) appeals to the most basic of basic instincts — among those who are made to believe that they are sufferers of “historical injustices.” This spirit of “undoing the past” is carefully reposed and invoked in the rallying cry of “Make America Great Again.” It resonates subliminally and powerfully as it cuts across societal faultlines and feeds the latent racist, anti-immigrant, protectionist and nativist instincts. Constituents feel redeemed and vindicated as Trump tramples on the sophisticated logic and concerns of those who disagree.

A reclaimed sense of identity is inherent as Trump pooh-poohs climate change, abuses allies, disengages from multilateral bodies like the UN and in the world of a new Republican Party even own members are not spared the venom. At the funeral ceremony of the iconic Republican Senator Warrior John McCain, where Trump was specifically not invited, his daughter lamented, “The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.”

Of the major candidates challenging Trump for the Republican nomination in the 2020 presidential bid, the number one challenger is Bill Weld with just 1.31 per cent of popular votes as against 97.15 per cent for Trump. The number two challenger, Joe Walsh, with 1.08 per cent popular votes conceded, “I think it’s important that there’s a Republican out there every day who says, this is not my Republican Party. This is not what I believe in. I’m not cruel. I’m not bigoted.” Yet, it is Trump who will emerge as the inevitable pick of the Republican Party in 2020. The Trump stranglehold over the Republican nomination is complete and as the date of electioneering beckons, personal, moral and ideological integrity becomes increasingly immaterial in the face of hard factors like winnability. Above all, “the only other option”, which is assiduously painted as abject surrender, may hem with immigrants and basically enfeeble the American Dream.

Besides Lincoln, the party, which prided on the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D Eisenhower and such-like distinguished statesman, is now poised to re-host an ideological suspect, who has left no stone unturned to personally polarise and divide the nation as its winning candidate. Now, Trump is the first sitting President to seek re-bid after being tried for impeachment. Fear-mongering, personalised insults, innuendoes and brooking no contrarian opinion within his party has done the trick.

Kutsira village under Kari gram panchayat in Subarnapur district is a prime example of the scheme’s failure. Power meters were installed in the houses of consumers in the village some months ago. But electricity connection has not been provided yet.

Bhagyasini Guru, a window of the area, said, “Many people of our area had applied for electricity connection under Saubhagya Yojana a year ago. Although meters were installed at our homes, we have not got electricity connection.”

Fed up with the development, many people drew a service cable from their neighbour’s house to their premises and started tapping electricity.

Many such cases are being reported from many villages of Tarbha block. Although meters have been installed, people here have not got electricity connections. If this is the state of affairs in a village near the district headquarters, then it is not difficult to guess the situation in far flung rural pockets, said social activist Dillip Kumar Patra.

Although Wesco claims it has provided electricity connections to all households,the non-electrified houses in Tarbha and Binka blocks have put a big question mark over the agency’s claims.

“The State Government has always made false claims regarding the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and deprived poor people of getting pucca houses,” alleged BJP State secretary Prithviraj Harichandan at a Press meet here.

Harichandan alleged that the State Government has not yet been able to prepare a list of eligible people for pucca houses. Out of its first list of 27,49,716 beneficiaries, 13,65,035 had been found ineligible.

He demanded that the Government make it public as to how many houses would be build under different

schemes of PMAY, Biju Pucca Ghar, Mineral Funda and Construction Worker’s Welfare Fund.

Reacting to the BJP, BJD spokesperson and MLA Pratap Deb said, “BJP leaders have been making such allegations for the last five years.

They should first tell people why the Union Government has slashed its share from 90:10 to 60:40 under the Awas Yojana.”

He said the order would have adverse consequences in future leading to terrorism in Ayodhya. Requesting the Government, political parties and people, Saraswati requested the SC to reconsider the matter as it would create a situation leading to terrorism against Hindus’ places of worship.

He said the SC judgment for construction of a Ram Temple at Ayodhya seemed favourable to the wish of the Government, some political parties and people at large, but the decision of the court to hand over land for a mosque would further intensify the Hindu-Muslim conflict. He said that as a seer, it is his duty to let everyone know the ground reality and requested the court to revisit its decision.

21,10-2-20,Poor workers insured with ESIC left in lurch,"The sudden decision of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) authorities to ban the secondary care referral of the insured persons to other hospitals has shocked and irked the insured persons dependent on ESIC.

With thousands of industrial workers getting affected with this sudden withdrawal of secondary care referral, trade union, CITU State secretary in a statement here threatened for a mass agitation demanding immediate lifting of the ban.

Sources said ESIC, a Government of India body, takes care of the health issues, mainly of the private sector employees. Accordingly, ESIC runs dispensary, model hospitals and the insured persons and their family were earlier being referred to by ESIC Model Hospital, Rourkela, for secondary care treatment and in some cases, when super speciality treatment was required, patients under ESIC, were being referred to super speciality hospitals for their treatment.

The secondary care referred was stopped by ESIC from February 1. Significantly, the employee’s contribution rate (from July 1, 2019) is 0.75 percent of the wages and that of employer is 3.25 per cent of the wages but before that, the employee’s contribution rate was 1.75 per cent and employer’s contribution was 4.75 per cent.

Although there has been a ESIC model hospital at Rourkela, the hospital doesn’t not have facilities like ultrasound, ECG and other essential facilities, for which it refers the patients to other tie-up hospitals of the city.

The patients were getting treatment there without making any payment, as a secondary care measure but after the secondary care referral facility has been stopped by ESIC, the insured persons, particularly workers with meager salary, are left in the lurch.

“It is really painful to know that secondary care referral has been stopped by ESIC. ESIC Model Hospital at Rourkela does not have required facilities for patients and now a worker with very small salary like me, have to run to local hospitals and testing centres that I can ill afford to,” said B Majhi, a worker of an industry.

Deputy Superintendent, ESIC Model Hospital, Rourkela, Jayanti Behera said, “We have informed the difficulty faced by the patients to our higher authority.”

The accused, a resident of Kantigadia-Malandapur village, was arrested on Saturday based on a complaint lodged by a 23-year-old woman at the Panikoili police station, a police officer said.

As per the complaint, the woman had met the accused last year, following which they got into a relationship, during which the man had allegedly clicked several obscene photographs of her.

36,10-2-20,Paddy unsold; discontent among B’swar farmers,"Strong discontentment is brewing among the farmers of north Baleswar as they are not able to sell their paddy to the Government agency, even after two months of harvesting, due to apathy of the Civil Supplies Department and lack of coordination between the societies and millers.

The farmers who have obtained token even are not able to sell their paddy. As a result, there are reports of distress sale. The middlemen active in the area are buying their paddy for Bengal traders at much less rate than fixed by the Government.

While MSP for paddy has been at Rs 1,810, sources said the farmers allegedly were selling their produce at Rs 1,350 per quintal. According to sources in Jaleswar block, paddy cultivation for the Kharif season was undertaken in about 21,000 hectares of land.

The Civil Supplies department in the process of procuring paddy from them had issued token to 5,497 farmers till date while 2,297 farmers could sell their paddy. Yet the leftout 3,200 are waiting with tokens to dispose of their paddy.

The farmers alleged that although they were reaching societies with paddy yet due to lack of effective monitoring by the Civil Supplies Department, they were not able to sell the paddy. Some of them alleged millers were taking their produce by deducting 12 kg per quintal from them.

Meanwhile, the farmers bodies of north Baleswar drawing attention of the district Collector have demanded his intervention to resolve their issue.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/paddy-unsold--discontent-among-b---swar-farmers.html

39,10-2-20,Sambuddhi Yoga: Equanimity of mind,"Bhagavad Gita attaches great value to equanimity. Importance of equal-mindedness has repeatedly been stressed in various shlokas of this sacred scripture.

Krishna says in shloka 2.14 that joy and sorrow, like heat and cold, arise from the contact of senses with their objects and do not last for ever. Hence, one should learn to endure them. When it is said that pleasure and pain etc. arise from the contact of senses with their objects, it implies that such pairs of opposites relate only to the body and the mind ; and not to the soul within.

Whereas joy of the soul is self-existent, everlasting and independent of particular causes and effects ; the sensations of material delight and distress change from time to time. Since such feelings of the senses are temporary, one should learn to accept them with mental calmness and evenness of temper.

In shloka 2.15, it is stated that he who is not troubled by pleasure and pain and remains the same in both, such a man of patience is considered to be eligible for eternal life. In other words, the one who does not lose his patience during favourable and unfavourable circumstances ; and maintains evenness of his mind, such a serene person becomes fit for achieving liberation from material bondage.

Further, in shloka 5.22 Krishna states that the wise do not indulge in enjoyments that arise out of contact of the senses with their objects, as the pleasures so derived are transient ; and eventually lead to sorrow.

In this shloka, the teacher has analysed the nature of worldly pleasures. An element of inadequacy is inherent in such joys because they are finite. At some point in time, they have to come to an end. Moreover, they cannot satisfy one for long. Ultimately they prove to be a source of misery. Hence, one should not be lost in such enjoyments.

Krishna taught that one should perform his duty sincerely without bothering about success and failure etc. In shloka 2.38, he advised Arjuna that treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss ; and victory and defeat alike, he should get ready for the battle. In this manner, he would not incur any sin. The same theme has further been elaborated in shloka 4.22 wherein it is stated that the one who is beyond dualities of pleasure and pain etc., who is content with whatever comes his way, who is free from envy ; and who is the same in success and failure - such a person is not bound by action. In shloka 2.48 Krishna reiterated that one should do his duty abandoning all attachment ; equipoised in success and failure. He further stated that such evenness of mind is called yoga.

It has been explained in shlokas 2.56 and 2.57 that intelligence of the one who is able to face ups and downs of life with equal ease, remains steady. He is not shaken by prosperity or adversity and praise or blame etc. He welcomes both with equal-mindedness.

The state of perfect equanimity is the state of blessedness in which one establishes himself in unity with Pramatman, the Supreme Self. It has been stated in shloka 5.20 that the one who neither rejoices on getting the pleasant nor is perturbed by the unpleasant, who is of stable mind ; and who is free from doubt - such a knower of Brahman is forever established in Him. It has further been stated in shloka 6.7 that the Supreme Self remains established in the consciousness of a jit-atman (the one who has conquered all senses including the mind). He remains at peace in joy and sorrow, heat and cold, honour and dishonour etc.

The importance of equanimity of mind also becomes clear from the fact that in shloka 13.10, constant equal-mindedness with regard to that which is desirable and to that which is undesirable has been declared, along with some other traits, to be the spiritual knowledge (gyan - wisdom).

In some other shlokas, equanimity of mind has also been held to be an important ingredient for being such a devotee who is dear to God, and for the one who is good doer of work (sattvic karta). Similarly, remaining the same in honour and dishonour has been held to be an essential trait for those who want to transcend the three modes of material nature.

Thus, it can be said that sorrows of the world do not shake the one who has gained inward freedom. To progress on the path of spirituality and also in day to day life, equanimity of the mind is considered to be most essential. But, a question is often asked as to how can such an equanimity be cultivated. Answer to this question can be found in shloka 6.35 wherein Krishna concedes that the mind being restless is very difficult to curb. At the same time, he has assured that it can still be controlled by constant practice and detachment.

When such an attitude of detachment becomes spontaneous, one attains perfect calmness of mind, irrespective of the external circumstances.

To sum up, when a man of patience and steady intelligence is able to face the ups and downs of life with equal-mindedness and remains joyfully and blissfully immersed in his work ; without any worry about success and failure etc., he attains perfect serenity of mind. He remains at peace with himself and others. Such a person of even mind experiences eternal bliss.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sambuddhi-yoga--equanimity-of-mind.html
40,10-2-20,Punjabi movie ‘Shooter’ banned in Punjab,"Punjab Government on Sunday banned the controversial Punjabi movie ‘Shooter’, based on the life and crimes of notorious gangster Sukha Kahlwan, besides registering a case against its producer KV Singh Dhillon and others for allegedly promoting violence, heinous crimes, gangsterism, drugs extortion, threats and criminal intimidation.

Cases have been registered under sections 153 (deliberately provoking with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity), 153B (imputation, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 160 (punishment for committing affray), 107 (conspiracy), 505 (public mischief) of the Indian oenal Code (IPC), at State Special Operation Cell (SSOC) Mohali as per FIR dated February 9, 2020, said a police spokesperson.The FIR said that the movie ‘Shooter’ is likely to instigate youngsters to take up arms, and disturb peace and harmony.

The movie, glorifying slain gangster was to hit the screens on February 21. Notably, gangster Sukha Kahlwan was facing more than 20 cases, including those pertaining to murder, kidnapping and extortion, before he was gunned down by another gangster Vicky Gounder and his aides on January 22, 2015, while he was being brought back to Patiala jail after a court hearing in Jalandhar. Sukha used to describe himself as “sharpshooter”.

The FIR was registered after the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh directed the state Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta to look into the possible action that could be initiated against KV Singh Dhillon, who had reportedly promised in writing, back in 2019, that he would shelve the movie, originally titled ‘Sukha Khalwan’.

The DGP had also been asked to look into the role of the promoters, directors and actors of the movie. It has been learnt that the film was originally named as ‘Sukha Kahlwan’ on the name of the gangster. But, after the Mohali police received a complaint in October 2019 about the movie glorifying the notorious gangster, film producer KV Dhillon gave it in writing to the Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) that he would shelve his plan to go ahead with the movie.

In his letter, Dhillon had written that “since you are of the opinion that the content of the film may hurt law and order situation, I am discontinuing the film project.”Now, the film is scheduled to release under the title ‘Shooter’. The protagonist in the film has been named ‘Sucha’.

The decision to ban the movie comes less than 10 days after the Mansa Police registered a case against Punjabi singers Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu (Sidhu Moose Wala) and Mankirat Aulakh for propagating violence and crime through a video clip uploaded on social media.

This is not for the first time that a film on a gangster is being made in Punjab. Two films glorifying the character of slain gangster Rupinder Gandhi were released in the past five years.

MOVIES, SONGS PROMOTING CRIME, VIOLENCE, DRUGS, GANGSTERISM NOT ALLOWED: CM

Taking a tough stand, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has also made it clear that the Punjab Government will not allow any movies, songs, etc that seek to promote crime, violence, drugs and gangsterism or crime in the State, which had flourished during the Akali regime, under the patronage of SAD leaders.

Any such productions or compositions would be dealt with severely in the future too, warned the Chief Minister.

The Congress Government has come a long way in the past three years to restore the state’s law and order, which had hit a new low under the previous SAD-BJP regime, said the spokesperson, adding that the Chief Minister had directed the police to ensure that nothing is allowed to disturb Punjab’s peace and communal harmony.

BAN ANNOUNCED AFTER DETAILED DISCUSSION

The state police chief on Sunday maintained that matter of banning this controversial movie in Punjab had been discussed at a meeting with the Chief Minister on Friday, along with a proposal from ADGP Intelligence Varinder Kumar, recommending a ban on the movie, whose trailer, released on January 18, suggested that the film was highly radical.

In view of the expected repercussions of the movie on the youth and apprehensions of disturbance of public order, “it would be appropriate if the release and screening of the movie be banned in the state of Punjab”, the ADGP had further stated, in a letter to the state’s Additional Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Department of Home Affairs and Justice.

The Producer had earlier given his commitment after the Mohali police received a complaint about the movie glorifying gangster Kahlwan. But instead of abandoning the project, the producer evidently went ahead with the film, which was now scheduled for release on February 21 under the new title with a new name for its leading protagonist, said the DGP.

TRAILER GETS 71L VIEWS ON YOUTUBE, SONG CROSSED 20M

The movie’s trailer has already received about 72 lakh views on the YouTube channel, while its song “Shoot da Order” has also crossed record 20 million views.

Sukha’s character was played by debutant actor Jayy Randhawa, and the movie’s poster shows Jayy in the same attire as that of the slain gangster.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjabi-movie----shooter----banned-in-punjab.html
41,10-2-20,"Jakhar visits Talwandi plant areas, promises action","Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Sunday visited Raipur village in Mansa district to listen to the grievances of villagers affected from Talwandi Sabo thermal plant pollution.

The villagers demanded closing down of the plant alleging that fly ash emitting from it during night is affecting their lives and many villagers are affected with cancer, lungs and heart problems.

Taking note, the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Jakhar said, he would ensure that the issue of thermal plant waste affecting human lives is resolved.

The villagers told Jakhar their problems due to thermal plant ash and the way it was affecting human health. Many of them were suffering from serious health problems.

Having listened to the problem of people, he said that the previous SAD-BJP government, in lieu of monetary gains, had sold off Punjabis’ health to thermal plants.

“The pact Akali Dal signed with thermal plants is bleeding the state exchequer by siphoning large amount of money being given to them, whereas in the national market, power was available at much cheaper rates,” he said. Jakhar added that SAD chief Sukhbir Badal had even compromised the sarb sanjhi gurbani by giving its sole transmitting rights to the party owned TV channel. Despite being born in the family of farmers, Sukhbir had signed such agreements that have compromised our future.

“Due to legal modalities signed by previous government, this thermal plant cannot be closed down. But now as per the orders of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), it is mandatory for all thermal plants located within 300 kms area of Delhi to implement pollution control technology,” he said.

As per orders, this was to be done by December 31, 2019. But the Mansa based Banawali thermal plant has not installed this technology and hence it has become easier to legally interfere with the working of plant, he added.

Jakhar said that these plants were bane for the state and he would convey the pain of people living around it to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

He added that the people's woes will be heard, and the way Capt Amarinder protected Punjab waters, he will protect the environment too and will also save the state funds that are being wasted away due to wrong agreements.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jakhar-visits-talwandi-plant-areas--promises-action.html

The event began with Mahasu Vandana which was followed by Harul Nritya and Jhenta by folk singer of Jaunsar-Bawar region Arvind Rana. Rana explained that Harul Banko Jaunsar is a dance which is performed by both men and women together on sacred occasions whereas Jhenta is performed only by women to celebrate on special occasions. Child artists Daksh Chauhan and Vedansh also showcased their talent by singing Jaunsari folk songs.

Representing the significance of agriculture in the Jaunsar culture, Sri Mahasu Lok Kala Kendra Dal led by Akash Verma performed the folk dance Jimdar followed by a performance by folk singer Sitara Verma.

Soon after, the famous folk singer Vicky Chauhan from Himachal Pradesh got the crowds to dance to many of his hit songs including ‘Jhumke Jhumke’ and ‘Sahi Pakde Hain’ among others.

During the performance, Chauhan said that in his career of about 15 years, he never wore any traditional dress while performing on stage but by wearing the traditional Jaunsari attire in this event he felt more connected to tradition and culture. Chauhan interacted with the audience during his performance, also participating in traditional folk dances along with the crow while singing folk songs.

Hathi Nritya, one of the anticipated performances of the event presented by the group of noted folk artist Nand Lal Bharti was also performed at the Jaunsar Mahotsav.

Talking about the history behind Hathi Nritya, Bharti said that Hathi Nritya is performed specially in the occasion of Diwali. When people heard about lord Rama’s return to Ayodhya after his exile, people celebrated by dancing with an elephant made out of wood, since elephants are not found in the mountainous regions like Jaunsar-Bawar. Since then, it is an integral part of Jaunsari culture and the person who is the head of the village sits over the wooden elephant.

This performance was followed by singer Abhinav Chauhan who sang his own song ‘Kodo ka Kodua’ . Artistes from Pauranic Lok Kala Manch Lohari Lokhandi performed the folk dance Gundiya Rasu and Harin Nritya. Talking about the performance, Kundan Chauhan, the head of the group said that Gundiya Rasu is a sword dance that also shows the glimpses of Chakravyuh from Mahabharata. Historically it is performed after the victory in a war, but now it is performed on special occasions. Besides, Harin was an avatar of the lord Mahasu Maharaj, so it is performed in his honour.

One of the last folk performances was Pandav Nritya by the team of Bhajan Verma. He said that Pandav Nritya is based on the incident when Lakshagrah was burnt down, seven ‘Bilrishi’ who were brothers who actually constructed Lakshagrah palace died there by accident so it is said that they cursed Kauravs.

When Pandav Nritya is performed, the souls of those Bilrishi and Pandavas come and bless the people.

The event concluded with a second round of performance by Vicky Chauhan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jaunsar-mahotsav-enthralls-with-a-mix-of-culture---history.html
54,10-2-20,CM offers tips to students how to focus on exam,"In the seventh episode of his monthly radio programme ‘Lokvaani’, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel affectionately addressed the children on the topic ‘Exam Management and Dimensions of Career for Youth’.

Chief Minister told children to utilize their time in positive manner, to keep their diet light and go for little exercise as well.

Chief Minister advised children to stay away from distractions such as mobile phones, television etc, so as to give rest to eyes and mind.

Baghel said that children should give their best to prepare for the exams, because it’s the effort that matters more than the score.

While giving tips to children about stress and time management during exams, he advised parents to not pressurize children to score higher marks, and rather help them in their preparation by being supportive.

Children from various cities and villages across the state asked questions to Chief Minister, to which he responded affectionately one after the other. He said that he wished he could spend maximum time talking to children, as it reminds him of his childhood.

Overcome Fear, Be Confident in your Hard Work

Baghel encouraged children by saying that the ones, who aim to fly, do not fear falling off. Chief Minister gave tips to overcome anxiety and fear by saying that one should at first understand the psychology of this fear.

Rs Rs The more you think about your fears, it would become more difficult to start overcoming it. The question is not just fear of studying, it is about the choice whether you want to be courageous or you want to be stuck in fear. Certainly, everyone always wants to be identified as brave. I feel, the main reason behind fear is lack of preparation, and second biggest reason is one is afraid to expect more that they have worked for. One should develop the habit of factual and logical way of thinking. Instead of stressing about the time that is gone, one should focus on utilizing the time available in the best possible manner. One should keep their diet lighter, and go for mild exercises during exam time, and also stay away from mobile phones, television so as to give rest to eyes and mind,’’ the chief minister advised to students.

Create a Time-Table to Study

Baghel advised children to not burden themselves with all the study material, and instead make time table, which will help you to focus on one subject at a time.

Besides, one should also find time to do some work of their interest, like humming a song, prayers or bit of sports/exercise. There are various such measures to keep the fear at bay and stay motivated.

In response to a question by student Sahil Rizvi, Baghel said, Rs Rs I have always believed that one should give their best while preparing and leave the rest’’. Answering question to Mukesh Sahu’s question, Chief Minister said that there is no doubt that with limited resources, it is difficult to manage. But I’d like to say only one thing, you should focus on studies and continue to make your parents proud, said Chief Minister to Mukesh, who comes from a labourer family.

Children requested Chief Minister to address parents and advise them on helping reduce stress during exam time.

Madhya Pradesh was number one in farmers' suicides, youth unemployment and physical atrocities against women.

We are creating a new profile of the state to attract industry. The establishment of an industry increases economic activity and a large number of employment opportunities.

He said those who have misunderstandings about CAA should think with an open mind and get their misconceptions cleared as the new law is not a threat to any Indian citizen.

Talking to reporters here, Naqvi assured Indian Muslims that their citizenship was ""100 per cent protected"".

Asked about Muslim leaders from the Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh quitting the BJP in protest against the CAA, Naqvi said, ""The BJP is a big political party. The BJP has neither put up a board of 'no exit' nor of 'no entry'. People come to the BJP and those who don't want to stay in the party go away.""

To another question, the Union minister denied that the BJP failed to convince its Muslim leaders that the CAA was in the country's interest.

""We appeal to those having misunderstanding about CAA to think with an open mind and clear their misconceptions. They should also think why a 'bogus bashing brigade' was spreading fake information about CAA to create an atmosphere of fear and confusion in a particular community,"" he said.

Notably, BJP's lone Muslim corporator Usman Patel in the saffron party-ruled Indore Municipal Corporation on Saturday announced his resignation from the ""changed"" BJP, which he said was indulging in ""politics of hate"" over CAA.

In a letter to the district BJP unit, Patel said he was resigning from all posts in the party with which he was associated for last 40 years. Naqvi said the new law was not a threat to any Indian citizen.

Responding to Rahul Gandhi's 'danda' jibe against Prime Minister Modi, Naqvi further added that a person with ""normal state of mind"" would never make such a statement.

""I want to give advice to Sonia Gandhi Ji to send Rahul Gandhi to a political playschool where he can learn A, B, C, D of politics and the decorum and dignity as well so that he doesn't use such a language. A person with a normal state of mind won't make such a statement,"" said Naqvi.

The Union Minister further reacted on the current issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) said that a ""bogus bashing brigade"" is trying to create an atmosphere of fear among the people.

""The bogus-bashing brigade is creating an atmosphere of fear regarding this issue. They are creating a fake and fabricated environment. PM Modi has repeatedly asserted that the citizenship of any Indian won't be taken away from them. CAA law has been formed and it won't be taken back,"" said Naqvi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa-is-not-a-threat-to-any-indian-citizen--naqvi.html

He further said the JMM and Congress alliance’s one of the electoral promises was loan waiver of farmers, but the Soren Government instead of waiving the loan of farmers, has decided to discontinue welfare schemes such as the Krishi Ashirvad Yojana for the farmers.

Highlighting some of the recent incidents which have brought bad name to health department, Singh said, “Reports of incident where a man was seen carrying the body of a child in polythene bag and death of patient in ambulance which was struck in traffic jam as supporters of health minister Banna Gupta were welcoming minister in Jamshedpur has brought bad name to state.” The BJP leader claimed that there is an atmosphere of fear among the people after the massacre of seven tribals in Burugulikera.

Despite such a big incident in Jharkhand, no assurance was given to the bereaved families from Government side, at the same time Chief Minister Hemant Soren diluted the incident saying that “both the victims and culprits in the Burugulikera incident are people of State,” while in the eyes of law the culprits are only criminals. He also condemned Soren Government for withdrawing sedition cases against Pathalgadi supporters which, he said, has lead to Burugulikera incident. Singh said that while on other BJP is always sympathetic towards people who lost their lives in such incident. He said, “BJP took quick notice to such incidents and also sent a delegation to Burugulikera to find out the main reason behind killings of seven tribals, but the administration with ulterior motives prevented the delegation from reaching the incident site.” He said that BJP MPs from state not only raised the issue in Lok Sabha, but also staged a dharna near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Parliament.

He further said that unorganized crimes have increased rapidly since the Grand Alliance formed the government, now people are reluctant to go to Palamu and other such districts at night, and the main reason for this is the promotion of anti-social elements by the government. State Vice President Shri Aditya Sahu and MLA Mr. Viranchi Narayan were also present in the press conference.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-blames-govt-for-poor-law-and-order.html

76,10-2-20,Fear is the Key,"Case One: Local newspapers blare about the suicide committed by a girl student by jumping off a 10 storeyed building. She had failed in Mathematics in the Final Exams. She was not able to face her parents who were struggling financially to provide good education to her. This was one of the innumerable cases of student suicide caused by fear of failure and ability to face the society.

Case Two: A multistoried building caught fire and a few persons got seriously sick because of smoke and asphyxiation till the fire was brought under control. But a few persons met their tragic end as they jumped out of the building since they were morbidly scared of fire and just could not face it. They just needed to escape anyhow as they could not face the fire bugbear.

Case Three: A person bitten by snake is rushed to the Hospital Emergency where he isdeclared dead. However, it came out later that the snake was non-poisonous and he had died of fear and shock.

We often hear or read stories of gory killings, torture in the name of preventing witchcraft where out of sheer superstition innocent women are subjected to most inhuman torture and shame. At root is the society’s fear of witches and the social mandate to ensure safety of their members from the dreaded claws of so-called witches. All the above illustrations point at one common factor in the tragedies- fear.

It is true that fear is one of the most overbearing and domineering emotions that we face. It is the proverbial stick which is deep-rooted in human psyche and to a large extent controls thinking and actions of the human-folk. No wonder it manifests itself in various ways like fear of death, fear of punishment, fear of uncertainty, fear of failure etc.

Fear of examinations is another fact of life and it is distressing to see how many children, for the fear of getting a rebuke or failure in examinations, end their lives tragically only because the fear and comparisons with other students makes them so unsure of themselves that they start considering examinations as an anathema and accept failure as a fait accompli leading to serious consequences.

If we go back to our childhood days we can recall the admonitions, warnings and threats let loose on us by the elders. “Don’t do this- Stay away from that, or else …..” We were not sure what ghosts, hobgoblins, demons or curse will confront us – the innocent fearlessness was made a victim and children were taught to be scared and fall in line lest the threatening stick comes into play. And what the fear bugbear did was to convert and channelize the inherent imagination and creativity into a mechanism of creating ghosts and demons. The fear psychosis of eternal dreaded villains like Dracula, Frankenstein or spooky ghosts did play a role in shaping the delicate minds and instil fear in them from the very beginning.

What is at the root of this fear – it is lack of knowledge or understanding which leads to fear.

Nature abhors vacuum: is an adage we have heard but it appears that if not reasonably justified or occupied with logical explanation, more often than not, this vacant space is filled with all kinds of negative thoughts as we have been conditioned to think since the beginning. This dissuades one from delving deeper into the subject and accepts things as they are. Presence of the unknown or the vacuum appears to be the basic cause of fear.

Many socio-cultural sanctions, customs and more emanate from such fears and these customs are sometimes so strong that people are ready to die or kill rather than clarify issues. An example will explain: It was said earlier “Do not look at the moon or sun during eclipse or you will be cursed.” Today we understand that there may be a scientific reason for not looking directly at the sun during solar eclipse since the ultra-violet rays may damage your retina but since the people had no understanding of the phenomena they simply attributed it to God or a demon.

In due course, science has explained many of these phenomena and people have started to see the reality. The Western world has promoted the spirit of enquiry and scientific inquisitiveness and this explains the maximum inventionsand discoveries coming from the West as they are able to motivate and channelize the creativity of people.

It has been after decades of education and unabated learning as well as willingness to compete with the West in the field of Science & Technology that countries like China, Japan and South Korea are forging ahead in the world of Patents and intellectual property and are contributing to technological innovation.

Visualize the time when homo-sapiens were cave-dwellers and did not even know how to create fire. The fall of night was the biggest curse as they would not know how to handle darkness. The only solace was the moon probably but again the deep forests inhabited by all kinds of carnivorous animals, poisonous reptiles and insects would wreak havoc in their lives. One of the biggest discoveries for them was to create fire.

Once they learnt to create the fire torch they solved several problems that of food, safety from wild animals and darkness.And this happened when they moved from fear to fire and learnt to master the fire. As civilization progressed, fear got metabolized into various kinds of phobias.

It is said every human being suffers from at least two phobias be it acrophobia (fear of heights), claustrophobia (Fear of closed spaces), nyctophobia (fear of darkness), ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) or hydrophobia (fear of water) or many other phobias.

These phobias are irrational or imaginary or abnormal fear or hatred towards a thing. Sometimes the entire society which consists of individuals behaves in a very biased and irrational manner towards a thing or a phenomenon based on superstition or fear.

Bertrand Russel remarked “Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom”.

There are numerous examples where you find persons, especially the older ones, who are morbidly scared of computers or new technology.

This is because now they have to adapt to new technology and change themselves accordingly.

And the word “Change” scares them infinitely. Experts opine that resistance to change is caused by (1) Loss of the known and (2) Fear of the unknown.

In the first instance whatever expertise the person had gathered becomes meaningless when the paradigm shifts. Secondly, the eerie feeling of what unknown shock or danger is going to unfold makes them restless and incapacitated. Hence to quell the fear of change, careful planning is required to be done.

When companies introduce new systems or technology they have to give ample training and education to their employees to enable them to accept the change and reap the advantage and not try to jeopardize and stymie the introduction.

But how is the fear factor exploited by some is worth noticing. We know it is used sparingly by teachers, parents and in some cases abundantly by politicians, police, societies and even film makers.

Teachers and parents use it to control the unruly child or student lest he or she creates problems for himself/herself or other children.

Politicians create fear by raising the bogey of war, enemy, religion, unemployment, poverty and failure of economy to sway the voters.

It is widely used by them to exploit the hidden fears and generate public opinion for or against a cause howsoever impertinent it may be for the social good.

The objective is to garner the votes or mould opinions using the fear factor. The police have to create fear in the minds of criminals and habitual offenders, and rightly so, to keep them at bay for the sake of peace and harmony in the society. Film makers, as we know, play upon the mental fear and fetishes in the viewers to churn out successful crime and psycho- thrillers and block-busters. From the point of view of governance and administration, it is fear of quick and strict action that prevents public in countries like Singapore from dirtying their city which helps the authorities to keep the city spic and span.

In fact, the fear factor has been successfully converted into respect for rules and law of the land in the Western world such that people at large have inculcated the habit of cleanliness, honesty and transparency. However, there are exceptions in every society.Fear, although used for some good of society, has limitations. It is a closed approach and shuns creativity. If some of the best inventions or discoveries were ever made, they were the outcome of an uninhibited spirit of enquiry laced with courage and adventure.

Today if we call the greatest inventors of all times we recall the names of Thomas Edison, GrahamBell, Leonardo da Vinci, Louis Pasteur, Newton, Einstein, Benjamin Franklin etc. But noneof them – and the list is long- worked under any kind of threat or fear. It was their love for the subject, passion for their creative art or science, perseverance to get the result of their dream that led to achieve the near impossible outcomes for the benefit of mankind.

They never worked under duress but gave the most outstanding results. Fear of death and punishment can also make people work but there is a limit to which they can go in such circumstances since their heart is not in the work. Fear sure is to be confronted and conquered for one to progress unabated.

Someone rightly said “The fear of facing your fears is harder to overcome than the fear itself.”

The fear factor is real and needs to be addressed strategically and squarely by one and all.

77,10-2-20,Vishwanathan Anand interacts with city students,"Country's first Grandmaster who has inspired generations of chess champions, Viswanathan Anand, enthralled the packed hall at city’s Beldih Club with a rare insight into his life.

Releasing his book, Mind Master, Anand said, “While the book is biographical, it is a slightly different format. Instead of a linear flow of events from the start of my career, the book covers lessons in my journey that I have found to be the most important. It also covers tournaments that have been great learning experiences for me.” India has 65 grandmasters today, but it was not the case 23 years ago when Anand became India’s 1st grandmaster in December 1987. Since then, the five-time world champion has been an inspirational ambassador of the sport. He asked youths to get devoted towards their goal l.

Earlier in the day, Anand interacted with over 200 children from the city including several from the Tata Steel Chess Centre who have represented the country at the international stage. The excitement was palpable as the young chess enthusiasts interacted with their hero at the JRD Stadium.

The day marked the end of the Tata Steel Literary Meet series for 2020. Starting with the Tata Steel Bhubaneswar Literary Meet from January 11-13, followed by the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet from January 22-26 and concluding with Tata Steel Jharkhand Literary Meet in Ranchi from February 1-2. The events this year have seen packed audiences entertained by a host of icons of literature and other artistic pursuits. The sessions were filled with engaging dialogue and thought-provoking debate on a host of relevant and contemporary issues.

Luminaries who were part of this year’s events included Nobel Laureate Abhijeet Banerjee, actors Ayushmann Khurrana, Pankaj Kapur and Amol Palekar, as well as legends of music, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, TM Krishna and Usha Uthup.

“It’s fitting that we have the Curtain Call for the 2020 Literary Meet series here in Jamshedpur. This year we’ve seen a best-ever turn out in the three events at Bhubaneswar, Kolkata and Ranchi. The overwhelming response, level of engagement and positive feedback we have received from literary enthusiasts has been very gratifying,” said Chanakya Chaudhary, Vice President, Corporate Services, Tata Seel.

“Like every year, the Tata Steel Literary Meet series offered a range of sessions to cater to diverse literary and cultural preferences. The success of the 2020 series gives us the confidence that this is an ideal platform to connect with the community and enrich the art, literature and cultural heritage to build a sustainable tomorrow,” Chaudhary added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vishwanathan-anand-interacts-with-city-students.html

82,10-2-20,Hutar villagers seek freedom from extremism,"The poor at Hutar —a hamlet situated 34 Kilometers away from Daltonganj and separated from Latehar district’s Barwadeeh police station by rain fed Koyal river, the only source of water here— demand no entry of Jharkhand Jan Mukti Parishad (JJMP) and Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC) extremists’.

Sources said this is the paradigm shift in the attitude of the poor who were seen as the harbour of the extremists but now the same ask police to curb and contain them as these people have seen the ‘real faces’ of the extremists.

The Pioneer is not naming the villagers this correspondent spoke to in order to ensure their safety. One of them said “Restrict the entry of extremists of JJMP and TPC and then our lives will be easier here.”

Another villager seconded him. “There is a police picket at Hutar. With its presence here we feel safe but there is still something big and hard to be done to check the coming and going out of the extremists,” he said.

Koyal river between Palamu and Latehar and the huge dense jungles are the factors that extremism is still here, said many villagers. This river turns out to be the life line of the extremists, they added.

Sources said five years back no villager had enough courage to speak names of the extremists or their outfits but today the villagers pointedly say “JJMP’s Mahesh Bhuiyan is a name of terror here. This tall man is ruthless.”

A dalit woman told the SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta, “They come in groups and demand money.” She said she has faith in Gupta and thus she spoke about the rebels.

Gupta asked the woman to call other women and chase the rebels with batons to which this woman looked around for affirmation of it by other sitting women but many of them presented a look of distancing from the idea.

Gupta then said in a very tough tone, “Do not worry. Our cops will neutralize the extremists. Just keep us informed. We will see that they are gone from here.”

A villager there said “Just four or five days ago one bad soul having murder charges asked the forest personnel raising nursery there to cough up money which was denied.”

The mukhiya of Hutar Ramesh Bhuiyan urged the SDPO to bail out the villagers due to the fear of the extremists.

Hutar police picket is around 20 Km from the nearest police station Ramgarh and the stretch of 10 Km of it is not even road by any standard said a local Rajesh Ram a dalit.

Cops at Hutar police picket have learnt to live with two things – the arduous life and dirt.

So stung was the SDPO Gupta by the dirt around that he asked the picket in charge Manoj Kumar Mandal to keep the building neat and clean and if he finds the filth around next time he will take all inmates of this picket to task.

The picket is in two storeyed building originally meant for sub health cente which has beautiful tiles inside the building with anti slippery stair case but the cops here hardly bother to keep the building clean.

Cops and villagers at Hutar have similar problem – the crisis of safe drinking water. The fluoride content in the underground water is beyond permissible limit but as there is no other way around villagers drink the same water.

Cops are a bit luckier. They buy cans of 20 litres of purified water for drinking while for other chores of life the cops depend upon the same high fluoride content water.

Vivek Kumar, a cop here said, “Safe drinking water is a luxury. There is no dearth of water for us to wash ourselves, utensils and food items but for drinking there is a crisis.”

SDPO Gupta said, “Such pickets located at cut off areas need our attention most. I remain in touch with my cops here. I will see what better can be done.”

Gupta has promised one net and volley ball to the cops here to play and keep fit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hutar-villagers-seek-freedom-from-extremism.html

The senior party leaders received assembly-wise feedback from leaders finding out the reasons behind defeat of party in Assembly elections.

Former MLA Yogeshwar Mahto Batul said, “There are several reasons for the defeat. The party assessed the reasons for the same. Our government was dedicated towards the overall development of the state but we did not get the expected results."" Batul also said that BJP also failed to counter the false propaganda or rumour spread by opposition leaders on the other hand BJP gave a corruption-free and development-driven government in the state.

The BJP only managed to win 25 seats in the 81-seat assembly, where a party needs 41 seats for a majority.

On the other hand, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led alliance, which also comprises of Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), bagged 47 seats.

A senior leader requesting anonymity said, “There are many reasons behind the defeat of BJP in election. Selection of wrong candidates in Assembly election was one of the reasons behind defeat of Saffron party.” The leader said, “Before the Assembly election BJP five MLAs from Opposition camp joined the party this gave a wrong message and the results was that majority of MLAs who joined BJP lost the election.” The leaders also discussed that going in election alone without having tie-up with AJSU party too gave a wrong message as there was split of voters at last hour. The BJP and ASJSU party contested alone with BJP winning 26 seats while AJSU won two seats.

At the meeting the senior leaders also gave ideas how to strengthen the party at grass-root level highlighting the schemes and work of BJP government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-assesses-state-assembly-poll-rout.html

His remarks came after Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh questioned the ""delay"" by the Election Commissioner in giving the final voter turnout figure for the Assembly polls, and said it was suspicious.

Earlier, Singh said that this is perhaps the first time in the country's history that the Election Commission is not ready to release voter turnout data even after 24-hours of voting for the Delhi Assembly elections.

However, the Election Commission announced the final voter turnout in the Delhi which was 62.59 per cent soon after AAP allegation. In the 2015 Assembly polls, Delhi had recorded a voter turnout of 67.47 per cent.

Addressing the media, Singh has said that the party can smell a deep conspiracy as the Election Commission has not yet announced the polling percentage. ""Till now, whenever the elections have been held, the Election Commission (EC) used to declare the percentage of the voting. It has been 24 hours since the voting of the Delhi Assembly completed, but the EC is not ready to announce the voting percentage.

Fearing a ""deep conspiracy"" behind the move, he demanded the EC to explain why it has not announced the voting percentage. ""This is the first time in the history of 70 years, the Election Commission is not ready to announce the voting percentage"", he said.

""Voting for the assembly elections in Delhi was held yesterday. The entire country and people of Delhi are waiting that the Election Commission would officially hold a press conference to announce the percentage of the turnout in the Delhi Assembly Elections 2020,"" he said.

Singh said that the poll body used to announce the voting percentage on the same day be it Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha but for the first time in the history of 70 years, such a strange thing happened. ""I remember that when the elections were held by the ballot papers, the EC used to announce the voting percentage even at such times. It is clear to understand that a conspiracy is being hatched inside,"" he alleged.

""It is not a lengthy process to calculate and announce the voting percentage. After the voting is over, the polling officers send the details of polling taken place at every booth, to the EC. After compiling the information given by all polling officials, the EC declares the voting percentage,"" he said.

Singh further said that the EC declared the voting percentage of the Lok Sabha elections held across the country but is not ready to provide voting percentage of just 70 legislative assemblies in Delhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ceo-defends-data-delay--says-took-time-to-ensure-accuracy.html

Also, the BJP leader said, the voting was ""sluggish"" in initial hours and picked up in the late afternoon when BJP workers actively urged voters to reach polling stations.

BJP's candidate from New Delhi Assembly constituency Sunil Yadav has claimed that AAP contender on the seat and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is going to ""lose"" the polls.

""We fielded the best candidates on all seats, campaigned sincerely and are positive of good performance,"" said Sharma who himself contested from Vikaspuri seat.

If Congress sources are to be believed, the party hopes to win some seats provided the minorities voters chose it over the AAP. ""There are nearly 10 seats that Congress has a good chance of winning. However, it will depend on how the minorities' voters cast their votes,"" they said.

Delhi poll body organised a number of nukkad nataks (Street Play), awareness programmes.

The initiatives of Election Commission to educate the voters, especially the first-timers and provide the voting opportunity to each and every citizen by extending the facility of postal ballots for the first time to the employees working in Government departments, including Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) failed to get the desired result.

The polling day, which began on 8:00 am on Saturday witnessed fewer voter turnout with only 4.33 polling per cent at 9 pm, 7.21 per cent at 11 pm. However, the poll percentage gained momentum after 3 pm with 41.15 per cent. The tentative voter turnout was 62.59 per cen. However, it was low compared with 67.17 per cent of the 2015 polls.

provided to Railway Employees. However, even after the facility the election commission only received 19 Form 12D under this category.

Besides, the facility was also provided to the persons with disabilities and octogenarian voters. ""In total 2429 and 488 Form 12 D was accepted from senior citizens and PwD and out of that 2257 and 429 senior citizens and PwD casted their vote through postal ballot,"" said the official data shared by the election office.

Further, commission also conducted various other awareness program such as including the public and citizens via state cVIGIL app to upload pictures/videos of the leaders or any party members if they found them violating the model code of conduct (MCC) imposed for the elections. Action was taken on these posts within 100 minutes. It was a citizen-driven approach that held many to account.

But for scattered incidents, the election passed off peacefully. To maintain law and order, 38,874 Delhi Police personnel had been deployed. While in Rithala the AAP and the BJP workers clashed, Congress candidate Alka Lamba slapped an AAP supporter in the Chandni Chowk area.

While, the special voter awareness campaign through various mega events, Nukkad Nataks, Rallies, Prabhat Pheris, Magic Shows, Rangoli, balloons display and selfie cutout were organised. Outdoor Media Campaign through Metro Trains, Bus Queue Shelters, Digital Screens and Cluster Buses was also organised.

94,10-2-20,GAIL organises ‘Walkathon’ to conserve energy,"In an attempt to awaken the masses about energy conservation, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) organised ‘Walkathon’ on Sunday in the State Capital. Executive Director (Eastern Region), GAIL (India) Limited, KB Singh flagged off Saksham Fit India Walkathon from Sri Jagannath HEC Ground.

More than 1200 participants walked their way round Dhurwa Golchakkar for over 3 Km distance before finishing at Sri Jagannath HEC Ground.

The walkathon was organised by GAIL as a part of an awakening campaign, “Saksham 2020” (Sanrakshan Kshamta Mahotsav 2020), an initiative of the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) under the aegis of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas , Goverment of India

The objective of this walkathon was to create awareness amongst the people about fuel conservation, environment protection and to promote walking as a means of commute for short distances, which will not only help save fuel but will also aid the creation of a cleaner, greener & healthier environment.

Speaking on the occasion KB.Singh said “It is the small initiatives that counts. At an individual level, when every citizen begins to contribute to the larger good, change is possible. Walking should become that first step to making a difference.

While commuting shorter distances, if a citizen opts to walk they will be benefited multi fold: from attaining fitness goals to improving mental health, from conserving fuel to reducing the carbon footprint, there’s so much that just one decision to give up using motorized vehicles and take up walking can do.

“Prime Minister, Narendra Modi firmly believes that if every citizen avoids using diesel or petrol driven transport medium, even for one day in a week, it would add up a great feat to the development of new India.

Inspired by PM Modi’s vision, PCRA has organized a month long awakening campaign through which walkathons across close to 624 districts will be organized by oil and gas PSU’s to draw mass attention and sensitize various groups of society on need and benefits of petroleum products conservation,” said Singh.

GAIL India Limited is executing Ganga Urja Gas Pipeline Scheme through which CNG Gas will be supplied to households through gas pipeline. Over 2,000 households in Ranchi are getting piped gas in their kitchens, replacing LPG cylinders, under the Urja Ganga Gas Pipeline Project (UGGPP). The piped gas connections have also been provided in about 2,000 households in Jamshedpur’s Sonari locality.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gail-organises----walkathon----to-conserve-energy.html
95,10-2-20,More than half of State’s missing children untraced,"More than half of the children who went missing from Jharkhand since 2014 have been untraceable, a Minister’s reply to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha has revealed.

The figures put forth by Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani, in reply to the question, highlight the plight of missing children here and the failure of the Government machinery in addressing the menace of child labour, child trafficking, kidnapping and unchecked migration, say child rights activists.

In reply to RS MP Mahesh Poddar’s question in Rajya Sabha, Irani said that on the basis of data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau, more than half of the children that went missing from Jharkhand every year since 2014 could not be traced. “In 2014, 726 children were missing from Jharkhand out of which 394 were safely recovered. 720 children went missing in 2015, of which 191 were safely returned,” Irani said.

“In 2016, 1008 children were missing, of which 329 were found. In 2017, 1099 went missing from Jharkhand out of which 465 children returned. In 2018, 993 children were reported missing from Jharkhand, out of which 377 were safely returned,” she added.

The complied figures put the total number of children that went missing from Jharkhand to 4546.

Out of these children only 1756 were traced, and 2790 children – much more than half of the total number of missing children – have not been traced.

Expressing concern over the status quo, Poddar stressed on the need to use latest technology in searching for the missing children.

He also emphasized on the need for adequate arrangements to prevent the disappearance or kidnapping of children.

Taking up the matter through an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Poddar sought information about the initiatives taken by the concerned ministry to locate missing children in the country. Poddar said that despite all efforts, only half of the children who go missing, sometimes one-third of the children, are safe, which is worrying.

Jharkhand has been one of the worst-affected states in India in terms of human trafficking in the past decade. NCRB data says that at least 131 incidents of human trafficking were reported in Jharkhand in 2018 – fourth highest in the country. However, activists claim that several thousand children, especially tribal girls, are trafficked from the state to metro cities every year on the pretext of jobs, marriage and even education.

A majority of these children, activists say, are often subjected to physical and sexual tortures leading to fatal ailments or even suicides. The Crime Investigation Department of Jharkhand police says the number of children who went missing from the state since 2005 stands at 3,838 and 1,281 children remain untraced since the same year.

Many cases of trafficked Jharkhand girls being tortured, raped and brutally beaten up by employers in Delhi have been reported in the past.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren had recently highlighted the matter on microblogging website Twitter and directed officials of all district to identify all the children who were prone to fall prey to human trafficking agents in the State.

He asked officials to take the matter of missing children seriously and impart education and skill development lessons to the children who were at risk. “Bringing an end to the menace of human trafficking is our top priority,” he stated in his Tweet.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/more-than-half-of-state---s-missing-children-untraced.html

98,10-2-20,Low voter turnout worries political parties,"All political parties, including the BJP, are worried over the low voter turnout in the Delhi Assembly elections, which further went down from the last Assembly polls.

Worried over the low voter turnout, the BJP Delhi unit held a meeting which continued till late Saturday night. BJP national president JP Nadda, Home Minister Amit Shah, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari, Delhi election in-charge Prakash Javadekar, in-charge Nityanad Rai and several other leaders were present at the meeting where voting on every Assembly seat was reviewed.

The BJP leaders are worried not only over the low turnout but also the exit polls which claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will repeat the performance of 2015.

Several party leaders feel that the decline in the voter turnout is due to the apathy of the middle class which is directly impacting the party. In the last Assembly elections, the BJP got 33 per cent vote share. The party leaders believe that it was difficult to motivate people and bring them out to the polling booth. The booth workers were instructed to ensure high voter turnout and the MPs were asked to keep an eye on their work. Despite all the efforts, the voter turnout was recorded 5 per cent less as compared to the previous Assembly elections.

The party strategists are trying to figure out if the people have voted for regularisation of the unauthorised colonies or for free water and free power scheme of Arvind Kejriwal.

Party leaders also believe that the scheme of 'Jahan jhuggi, wahin makaan' (Homes in place of slums) did not reach the public properly. Rumours were spread about the implementation of this scheme. The BJP is looking at it as a direct loss.

A senior Delhi BJP leader said the AAP cadres spread rumours about the scheme in the public as he told the people that they will lose the ownership of their original houses.

The BJP has not spoken out openly on the low voter turnout but has certainly dismissed the exit polls results, which indicate AAP's victory. Delhi election in-charge Prakash Javadekar said, ""Exit polls are not exact polls. The results on February 11 will show BJP coming to power.""

The party is also analysing the records of 13,000 booths.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/low-voter-turnout-worries-political-parties.html
99,10-2-20,DefExpo made Lucknow richer,"Lucknow emerged richer because of the DefExpo 2020 that closed on Sunday with industry people and business chambers believing that the city generated no less than Rs 500 crore in the five days of the megaevent.

Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said the spin-off from the DefExpo could be Rs 500 crore on aconservative estimate. He told this reporter that this amount could be much more as all walks of life in Lucknow stand benefited from this five-day exhibition.

Sood's estimates are not off the mark. All the hotels in the city were booked beforehand and majority of them were overpriced. The tariff of the room normally available for Rs 10,000, touched the roof during DefExpo 2020 -- priced at anything between Rs 65,000 and Rs 70,000.

Officials from around 1,800 companies manufacturing defence equipment took part in this edition of the DefExpo. There was a big crisis of rooms during the event.

""Not to talk about big hotels, even the smaller ones were booked. We accommodated some of our guests in hotels in Kanpur,"" a senior official of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) said.

Uttar Pradesh Hotel and Restaurant Association's joint secretary Shyam Kishnani said that room rent increased because of the demand. ""More the demand, more is the price. If this formula holds good for the airlines and railways why not for hotel industry?"" he asked.

The taxis faced the brunt of the rush as Ajay, one of the taxi drivers puts it, travel agencies hired taxis from neighbouring districts of Kanpur, Hardoi, Barabanki and Sitapur and still were not able to match the demand.

""It is too early to suggest how the DefExpo gave a boost to the economy of Lucknow because hotels and taxis are just one facet of this economic activity. Think about thousands of hoardings that were put up across the city. The flex agencies and even those people who put up hoardings on the sidewalks of the city have economically gained from the defence expo. This list does not end here. It goes on as it includes the roadside tea seller who did a good business and also the electrician who illuminated the road with led lights,"" Sood said.

100,10-2-20,Priyanka offers prayers at Ravidas temple in Varanasi,"After the Muslim outreach programme after the anti-CAA violence in UP, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has embarked upon the Dalit outreach programme by visiting Sant Ravidas temple in Varanasi on Sunday. Priyanka’s visit to Ravidas temple is not only about temple and religion, as the Congress would like everyone to believe.

Priyanka had visited the families of Muslim victims killed in the violence during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bijnor and other places in UP. The visit to Sant Ravidas temple has a definite Dalit outreach and Priyanka's participation in the Guru Ravidas birth anniversary celebration at Seer Govardhanpur is a clear indication of it.

Guru Ravidas, a Dalit seer, poet-saint, social reformer and a spiritual figure who was a part of the Bhakti movement in the 15th and 16th centuries, is held in high esteem by the Dalit communities. The devotional songs of Ravidas have had a lasting impact during the Bhakti movement.

After arriving in Varanasi, Priyanka offered prayers at the Ravidas temple and met the seers. Speaking at a function in Varanasi on the occasion of Ravidas Jayanti, Priyanka urged the audience to take the teachings of the saint to the masses.

""He (Sant Ravidas) had dreamt of a society, where there is no discrimination and where every person is respected. You all should take forward his teachings to the masses, especially at a time, when there is so much violence and hatred in the society. His teachings are need of the hour,"" Priyanka Gandhi said.

Before attending the function, the Congress leader offered prayers at the Guru Ravidas Janmasthan Mandir, and also participated in ‘langar’ (community lunch).

The Congress is apparently trying to win back Dalits in UP and regain lost ground. Dalits, along with Brahmins and Muslims, formed the core vote base of the Congress till the decline of the grand old party following the rise of Mandal and Mandir issues in UP politics in 1990.

The advent of the Mandal politics and the Ayodhya temple movement in the early 1990s turned the tide against the Congress. While Brahmins went with the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Muslims found refuge in the Samajwadi Party and Dalits opted for the Bahujan Samaj Party.

All these three parties were emerging on the political horizon of Uttar Pradesh and their growth was directly proportional to the decline of the Congress in the state. The Congress did not have a single Dalit leader of stature who could wield considerable influence on the community.

In 2009, it was Rahul Gandhi who started a Dalit outreach campaign in Uttar Pradesh when he started visiting the homes of Dalits, shared meals with them and even spent the night in their houses. The campaign, however, was not followed up by party workers who reduced the outreach to a mere photo opportunity.

After the drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has taken it upon herself to bring Dalits back into the party fold.

""Dalits are now completely disillusioned with the BSP which has only provided lip service to the community. Priyanka has already started making the right moves by visiting Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ when he was hospitalised in Meerut and then demanding proper medical care for him in jail. The Bhim Army is proving to be BSP's nemesis and if the Congress can strike a deal with it, the party will benefit,"" said a senior party leader.

Last year, Priyanka was the first political leader to visit Sonbhadra where ten tribals were massacred after a land dispute. The Congress also provided financial assistance to the victims’ kin.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-offers-prayers-at-ravidas-temple-in-varanasi.html
101,10-2-20,BSP will rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar after coming to power in UP: Maya,"Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Sunday said if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh, her party would rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar.

In a statement issued here, the BSP chief said, ""As soon as the BSP comes to power (in Uttar Pradesh), it will rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar. The previous Samajwadi Party government had changed its name due to its casteist mentality.""

Mayawati accused the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party of never honouring saint-poet Ravidas during their tenures and indulging in ""theatrics"" now by visiting temples.

Listing the work done by the Bahujan Samaj Party to keep the memory of Ravidas alive, Mayawati said, ""Sant Ravidas Park and Ghat were made in Varanasi, his place of birth, his statue was installed in Varanasi and the Ravidas Samman Puraskar instituted. The Santguru Ravidas Rajkiya Mahavidyalay was established in Faizabad.

Apart from this, Sant Ravidas Polytechnic was established in Chandauli. A bridge on river Ganga was named after the saint. Assistance was given for Sant Ravidas Dharmshala in Budaun.""

The assertion of the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh to rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar came close on the heels of a proposal to change the name of Basti, a district located in the eastern parts of the state, after Maharishi Vashishth.

The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has changed the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj and that of Faizabad to Ayodhya. It has also renamed the Mughalsarai railway station after Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

Meanwhile, hitting out at the Congress and the BJP, Mayawati said these parties were indulging in ""theatrics"" now by visiting temples.

The BSP chief’s remarks came on a day when Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was in Varanasi to offer prayers to Sant Ravidas on the occasion of his birth anniversary.

""The Congress, the BJP and other parties did not give any respect or honour to Sant Ravidas during their tenures. But after being out of power, they are indulging in various theatrics to realise their vested interests by visiting temples and other places’’ Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.

In another tweet, she said, ""The BSP, on the other hand, has been the only party which, during its government, gave respect to him at various levels, which the opposition parties are trying to put an end to. This is highly condemnable."" Ravidas Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Ravidas, was celebrated across the country on Sunday. Ravidas, a 14th-century saint, was the founder of the Bhakti movement in north India. Lakhs of people converge at Shri Guru Ravidas Janmasthan Mandir in Varanasi to celebrate his birth anniversary on this day every year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bsp-will-rename-bhadohi-as-sant-ravidas-nagar-after-coming-to-power-in-up--maya.html

The land for the mosque is adjacent to 18th century Sufi shrine of Shahgada Baba, believed to be the disciple of famous Sufi Syed Makhdum Ashraf Jahangeer who has a mausoleum in Kichaucha in Ambedkarnagar district, and maximum visitors to this shrine are Hindu devotees.

Nearly half of the residents of the village are Muslims, and many of them like Mohammad Faheem Khan say the proposed mosque should not be connected with Mughal emperor Babar, as he was not a representative of Indian Muslims.

“The true representatives of Indian Muslims are the ideologies of Sufis like Hazrat Nizamuddin, Khawaja Ajmeri and those Ulemas who sacrificed their lives in freedom struggles,” said Khan.

He said a multi-speciality government hospital and a college must also be constructed near the mosque.

Some of the residents said that mosque should be named - Aman Masjid (mosque of peace)

Rakesh Yadav, the village pradhan (headman), said they are hopeful of better connecting roads and other amenities, once the work start on the alloted plot.

“If mosque is constructed here our village will be known worldwide. We are hopeful of development in the village... Broad roads in the villages and other basic facilities,” he said.

Every Thursday, there is large assembly of devotees at the Sufi shrine. The congregation swells to lakhs on 28th, 29th and 30th of April very year when the Urs is celebrated.

Laal Ji Kannaujia, a middle aged man who was offering prayers in the shrine, said, “I have deep faith in Baba. Those who will come to visit the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will definitely come to this Masjid also.

“I hope this mosque will bring good luck for us here.” Sohrab Khan, a local, said five acres of land was not enough and the government must give at least 25 acres for a grand mosque.

“The government must also ensure that in future there will be no dispute on this site by right wing groups,” he said. The village has 1,600 voters, out of which about 700 are Muslims and the rest are Hindus from mostly backward and Dalit communities.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ayodhya-villagers-hopeful-new-mosque-will-help-bring-development.html

117,10-2-20,"Omar's PSA dossier cites his considerable influence over people, Mehbooba's pro-separatist stand","Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's ""considerable influence"" over people, including the ability to attract voters to polling booths despite poll boycott calls and the potential for channelling energies of public for any cause, has been cited in support of his detention under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).

His political opponent and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti has been accused of making anti-national statements and extending support to organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islamia of the state, which has been banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

The PSA dossier prepared by the police against the 49-year-old Omar, who had served as minister of state for external affairs as well as commerce and industries, states his ability to convince electorates to vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycott calls by separatists and militants.

The grounds of detention against Omar, who was chief minister of the state from 2009-14, state that on the eve of reorganisation of the state he had made attempts to provoke general masses against the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A.

The grounds also mention his comments on social networking sites to instigate common people against the decisions on Articles 370 and 35-A which had the potential of disturbing public order.

However, the police have neither mentioned any of Omar's social media posts in the dossier nor in theorder for grounds of his detention.

""To the people of Kashmir, we don't know what is in store for us.......Stay safe and above all please stay calm,"" was the last few tweets of Omar before he was taken to Hari Nivas for preventive detention.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/omar-s-psa-dossier-cites-his-considerable-influence-over-people--mehbooba-s-pro-separatist-stand.html
118,10-2-20,Dip in youths joining militancy in Kashmir,"The number of youths joining the ranks of militancy in Kashmir has gone down ‘remarkably’ since the nullification of provisions of Article 370 in August last year, officials have said.

According to a report prepared by security agencies, on an average five local youths have joined militancy every month since August 5 last year, as compared to the earlier rate of 14 per month. The report, comparing militancy-related developments before and after August 5, stated that large gatherings at funerals of militants, which were fertile grounds for recruitment of youths into militancy, have become a thing of the past as now only a handful of close relatives are seen at burial grounds.

“There are instances when militants were buried in the presence of just a dozen of close relatives,” the report said.

Earlier, funerals of terrorists killed by security forces attracted large crowd with the attendance crossing 10,000 at times. Another trigger for local youths joining the ranks of militancy was the last call made by a trapped terrorist to his family members. Such voice recording would normally find its way to general masses and would act as a catalyst on some of the young brains to pick up the gun.

However, after August 5, 2019 no such calls were reported, partly due to restrictions in communication channels and partly due to the changed scenario, the report said. It said there has also been a marked decrease in stone-pelting incidents — both during encounters between security forces and militants as well as on other occasions. The use of tear smoke shells, pellet guns was naturally reduced and the number of deaths in law and order went down to negligible limits.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dip-in-youths-joining-militancy-in-kashmir.html

123,10-2-20,"Stones to be answered with stones, says MNS chief to protesters","In a move that would bring his party closer to the BJP, MNS chief Raj Thackeray not only came out in full support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Citizens Register (NRC), but also warned those behind recent morchas against CAA and NRC that his party would henceforth give them a “stone for stone and sword for sword” response.

After flips flops that initially saw him extend an indirect support to the Centre on CAA and NRC and later backtrack a bit on the issue, Raj went full throttle in support of the two controversial laws, by handing out a warning in a colloquial manner to those who have so far taken out morchas against the two controversial laws.

“Today, we have responded to your morchas with our morcha. If you (those opposing the CAA and NRC) indulge in more nataks in future, then we will respond to you in a Rs stone for stone and sword for sword’ manner. You do not get in any other country the kind of freedom you get in India. Better live in harmony. Why are you out to destroy the country that has given you everything,” the MNS chief said.

Thousands of people had turned out for the morcha taken out by the MNS from P J Hindu Gymkhana to Azad Maidan in south Mumbai to demand immediate deportation of illegal Muslim immigrants settled across the country. The MNS workers from different parts of the state, including Thane, Nashik, Pune, Solapur and Aurangabad participated in the morcha. Interestingly, there were some Muslims in the morcha as well.

Addressing a massive public rally at Azad Maidan, Raj urged the Centre to implement CAA and the proposed NRC speedily. “The patriotic Muslims – especially those living in Maharashtrq – should be vigilant about what is going on around them and tell us about these things... Be it CAA or NRC, the Centre should take immediate steps to implement them. If the Centre is saying that it has no plans to bring NRC now, it will have to implement the law someday. The country needs to get rid of all illegal immigrants someday”.

“The Indian Government should become more stringent in dealing with these illegal immigrants. Today’s morcha is to give warning to the government in the Government in this regard,” Raj said.

Defending the proposed NRC, the MNS chief said: “India is no dharmashala where anyone can come from any country and live her3e. Yes we have many other pressing issues in the country. But, the need for removal of illegal immigrants is also main issue. Let’s face it, India has not taken upon itself the responsibility of taking humanitarian aspects involving the illegal immigrants. In other countries, there are stringent laws in dealing with immigrants. In other countries, there are only two options for the illegal immigrants – either go back to your country or we will put you behind the bars”.

Raj’s open support to CAA and proposed NRC should be seen in the context of the fact that the MNS has been trying to occupy the space vacated by the Shiv Sena after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form a government in the state and the meeting he had with former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis last month.

Though his comments will definitely endear him to the BJP, Raj himself sought to underplay the import of his support to CAA and NRC. “There have been occasions when the Modi Government erred, I criticised it. Whenever it did a good thing, I supported. For instance, on the issues of abrogation of Article 370, the Supreme Court’s judgement on the Ram temple and Modi’s announcement about the setting up a temple trust. But, when I criticised the BJP, I was dubbed as Modi critic, when I appreciated the Government’s good work, I was called a supporter. Is there something there or not in between the two positions I have taken?,” he

asked.

Earlier, recalling that at a rally held on August 31, 2012 he had displayed the passport of a Bangladesh that had been found abandoned after the rioting that took place 20 days earlier, Raj said: “If you remember that someone had brought and given me a passport of a Bangladeshi which was found at the Azad Maidan after a riot witnessed there.

The passport showed only the entry to India of Bangladeshi concerned. After that I made enquiries, I found that from Bangladesh alone, 2 crore people had illegally migrated into our country. We have absolutely no idea as to how many people might have come from Pakistan and Nepal”

Making as strong case for the immediate deportation of illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh, Raj said: “There should be absolutely no comprise on throwing out illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Many people do not know anything CAA. They exchange messages and discuss the law on whatsApp. The Citizenship law came into existence in 1955. At that time, the situation was different. Today in 2020, the satiation is entirely different”.

Earlier in the afternoon, Raj Thackeray’s son Amit—who was launched into active politics at a party convention held last month --- walked along with thousands of party workers in the morcha from PJ Hindu Gymkhana to Azad Maidan in south Mumbai. Today’s was the first occasion when Amit Thackeray had participated in such a morcha.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/stones-to-be-answered-with-stones--says-mns-chief-to-protesters.html
124,10-2-20,"Uddhav takes dig at cousin Raj, says have not changed party’s flag colour","On Sunday when MNS chief Raj Thackeray took out a massive pro-CAA-NRC morcha in the metropolis, Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray took a pot shot at his cousin, saying, “ I don’t have to prove my Hindutva to anyone, because it is pure. I have not changed the colour of my party flag any time. It will remain saffron till my death”.

Taking a veiled dig at Raj for changing his party flag from the earlier Blue, white, orange and green from its flag to all round saffron, Uddhav said: “Some people are saying that since the Shiv Sena has joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form a government in the state, I have given up Hindutva. But, the fact remains that we will neither give up Hindutva nor forsake saffron flag till I am alive”.

Addressing party workers at a workshop organised at the state-run Sahydri Guest House at Malbar Hill to brief them about the salient features of CAA and NRC, Uddhav said: “I do not have to prove my Hindutva. Because, it is Bal Thackeray’s Hindutva and it is pure. I have never changed party flag. People know our party flag and they know all about our Hindutva”.

It may be recalled at a party convention held on January 23, Raj had unveiled his new party flag which has now foregone its earlier Blue, saffron and green from its flag to all round saffron with an administrative seal on it that was used by Legendary warrior King Shivaji.

The apparent intention behind Raj changing his party’s earlier flag, colour of which represented Dalit community, Hindutva ad Musilm community, was to occupy the position of Shiv Sena, which always used saffron as its colour, in the wake of the Sena joining hands with the NCP and Congress to forma Government in theState.

Meanwhile, talking to media persons after the workshop, senior Sena minister Eknath Shinde sought to underplay the morcha taken out by the MNS. “We have been advocating the need for throwing out illegal Bangladeshis and Pakistanis from the time of late Sena chief Bal Thackeray. Some other people are doing that now. I have nothing to say anything about it”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uddhav-takes-dig-at-cousin-raj--says--have-not-changed-party---s-flag-colour.html
125,10-2-20,Nod for NPR in Tamil Nadu will invite people's ire: DMK,"DMK president M K Stalin on Sunday urged the AIADMK Government to not allow the National Population Register drive in Tamil Nadu, saying any move to go ahead with it would invite “stern opposition” from the people.

He also renewed DMK's demand for an anti-CAA resolution in the State Assembly and said only such a move would be an ‘atonement’ for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament.

Writing to party cadres, Stalin said the AIADMK government should not allow the National Population Register exercise in Tamil Nadu under any circumstances.

“If the Government attempted to do it to fulfil the objective of the BJP Government at the Centre, I would like to caution that it will invite strong opposition from the people,” he said.

He urged the Government to take steps for passing the resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act during the budget session, commencing on February 14.

Thanking his party workers and cadres of alliance parties for 'active' participation in the “one crore signature campaign” against the CAA, NPR and National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said as 'expected', it has turned into a people's movement and so far it has seen over two crore signatures.

On February 2, Stalin launched the campaign of the DMK- led alliance which comprise among others the Congress. It is expected to be completed soon and the signatures are to be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind.

The DMK chief, who is also the leader of opposition in Tamil Nadu, said the battle against the CAA will be taken forward if the Centre failed to reconsider its stand even after seeing the response to its signature campaign.

According to the Home Ministry, the NPR is a register of usual residents of the country. A usual resident is defined for the purposes of NPR as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more.

It's objective is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars.

Blood samples of two among the six have been sent to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) in Kolkata for test, the state nodal officer of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Dr Pachuau Lalmalsawma, told PTI.

129,10-2-20,Parties disagree on States not bound to give quota to SC,"The Supreme Court decision that States are not bound to give quota to Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes has drawn sharp reaction from several political parties, who have asked the Centre to take steps to protect the interest of the SC/ST communities.

In a verdict delivered on appeals on reservations for SC/ST community members in promotions to Assistant Engineer (Civil) posts in the Public Works Department of the Uttarakhand Government, the Supreme Court said

there was no ""fundamental right"" that allowed for such claims.

""There is no doubt the State Government is not bound to make reservations. There is no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions. No mandamus can be issued by the court directing State Governments to provide reservations,"" a bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta said on February 7.

The Congress, the CPI(M) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on Sunday expressed their disagreements with the apex court.

LJP asked the Union Government to take immediate measures to ensure that the reservation benefits for these communities and other backward classes continue in the same manner as they have been for decades.

""The LJP does not agree with this decision of the Supreme Court. The party demands that the Union Government take immediate measures to ensure that the reservation provision continues in jobs and promotion him the same they have been so far,"" tweeted LJP President Chirag Paswan .

Paswan expressed his party's disagreement with a Supreme Court decision that States are not bound to give quota to these communities in Government jobs or promotion.

LJP founder and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan may raise the issue in a meeting with scheduled castes and tribes MPs on Monday.

""I have invited the SC/ST members of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha for a get together at my residence 10th February,"" he said.

It is a regular meeting which Paswan holds with the parliamentarians of these communities in which they discuss the issues related to their welfare.

The Congress too disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision on the issue of Reservation in appointments and promotions, and alleged that the rights of SC/ST communities are under threat during the BJP rule.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, Congress general secretary Mukul Wasnik said the party will raise the issue inside and outside parliament.

""We respectfully say that we do not agree with this decision. The rights of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes are not secured under the BJP Government,"" Wasnik said.

""The Congress party believes that the appointment of SC/ST people to government posts should not be at the discretion of governments, but it is the fundamental right conferred by the Constitution,"" he said.

Concurring with Wasnik , Congress spokesperson Udit Raj, who was also present at the press conference, said the matter shows the contradiction between the BJP-led Government at the Centre and in the State, as the

Centre in a similar case had pushed for reservation in promotions.

Opposing the Supreme Court's Judgment, CPI(M) Polit Bureau on Sunday urged the Centre and State Governments to file review against the judgment.

In a statement, the party also said that Parliament should also intervene on this interpretation of the apex court on the reservation in recruitment and promotion to protect the rights of SC, SCT and OBC.

""A two-member bench of the Supreme Court has interpreted that Article 16(4) and 16 (4-A) are enabling provisions and there is no fundamental right to claim reservations for SC/ST/OBCs in government jobs and promotions. The Supreme Court has reversed the Uttarakhand High Court order directing the state government to provide reservations.

""While this provision for reservation and promotions may not be a fundamental right, these are constitutional provisions that are mandatory, to be applicable universally in India.

The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) considers this interpretation of the Constitution as being anti-dalit, anti-tribal and anti-OBCs.

It calls upon the Central Government to rectify the lacuna leading to such an interpretation through legislative resolutions in both houses of parliament and set right this lacuna in the Constitution forthwith,"" said CPI(M) Polit Bureau, urging all States and Centre to file Review Petition against the judgment.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/parties-disagree-on-states-not-bound-to-give-quota-to-sc-st.html
130,10-2-20,MHA extends air travel facility of jawans posted in J&K,"nThe Union Home Ministry has indefinitely extended the air travel facility of jawans and other non-entitled personnel of the Central paramilitary forces deployed in Jammu & Kashmir.

The air travel facility was extended for one year to the non-entitled following the Pulwama incident on February 14 last year in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a terror attack on the paramilitary convoy by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad. This had led India to conduct an aerial raid at a Jaish facility at Balakot in Pakistan, killing scores of suicide bombers being trained at the terror training centre.

The air courier facility for these categories of paramilitary personnel was granted on February 21 last after the deadly Pulwama bombing on a CRPF convoy carrying over 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar through road. This had led to criticism as non-armoured vehicles were prone to risks from the terrorists during long exposure of the convoys on the road.

The air courier facility is available from Jammu to Srinagar and back on official duty/transfer/tour and leave (on termination/commencement at base point at Jammu).

The service is also available from Delhi to Srinagar and back on official duty /transfer/tour.

In an order issued recently, the Union Home Ministry said, "" in continuation of this Ministry's letter dated 21.02.2019, the undersigned is directed to convey approval of the competent authority to allow extension of period of air travel in respect of non-entitled personnel of CAPFs, AR (Assam Rifles) & NSG deployed in the Kashmir Valley to travel by air.""

The letter issued by Under Secretary Santosh Kumar has been circulated to the paramilitary forces including Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP0, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and National Security Guards (NSG).

Apart from being safe, the air courier service for the jawans and other non-gazetted officers of the paramilitary forces significantly cuts down on the travel time on both the routes-from Jammu to Srinagar and back and from Jammu to Delhi and back.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mha-extends-air-travel-facility-of-jawans-posted-in-j-k.html
131,10-2-20,Scientists develop portable sensors to trace explosives,"Indian scientists have developed a cost-effective portable sensor that can trace explosives and toxic metals such as trinitrotoluene (TNT), trinitrophenol (TNP) and RDX even if just a few molecules are present, on the scale of parts per million (ppm). The senor, a solution, can be easily carried in public spaces like airports, railway and hotels or sensitive areas to counter terrorism.

Developed by Dr CV Yelamaggad, and his team from Bengaluru-based Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute under the Department of Science & Technology, the solution works on the simple visual detection technique.

Talking about the concept, Dr Yelamaggad, who has been working on the technique for last 3 years, said, ""It employs a fluorescent material known as coordination polymer, a hybrid system originating from the interaction between organic and inorganic moieties. This system being electron rich acts as an electron source.

""The explosive materials containing nitro groups are electron deficient and act as electron sink,"" he said.

""A charge transfer complex or an association of 2 or more molecules is formed between these electron sources and sink that is non-fluorescent and hence the fluorescence intensity decreases drastically which can be observed visually. The sensing can be done in solution as well in thin film forms at very minute part per billion concentrations,"" he further explained.

Selectivity is very perfect. Currently, there are many different kits which are being used for the sensing of explosive materials but they suffer from major drawbacks such as large size, need of repeated calibration and so on. However, solution phase developed by Dr Yelamaggad and his team can be comfortably transported and used in various places such as airports, rail stations and shopping complexes owing to its compact size and ease of handling. The simple visual detection technique makes it compatible to be used without calibration. A prototype of the sensor has been fabricated and demonstrated in the Bengaluru INDIA NANO-2018 expo under a collaborative project with Tata Steel. "" We are also trying to explore possibilities to detect other explosives such as acetonitrile, benzene and toluene etc,"" said Dr Yelamagged.Researchers said that with such low cost sensors they want society to be a much safer place to live. ""This is not just a research but in keeping with the societal responsibilities. We still need to do a lot of investigation.If this development can help save a single life it would be a great win for me,"" summed up the scientist.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/scientists-develop-portable-sensors-to-trace-explosives.html
132,10-2-20,First consignment of Japanese apple arrives,"Good news for fruit lovers. After 10 years of negotiations between India and Japan, the first consignment of light reddish/green and big-sized Japanese apples have arrived in India. These apples are from Aomori, mecca of apple growers in Japan.

Officials of Ministry of Agriculture said that India and Japan has agreed on Aomori apples export to India in December last year. ""The people were made to taste apples at the Japanese Embassy in New Delhi when it hosted a Japanese Food promotion event, ""An Evening with Japanese Food 2020"" at ambassador's residence,"" said officials.

Aomori, apples are not only eaten but also put in hot spring waters. The malic acid in apples is said to have a moisturizing effect, while linoleic acid promotes blood circulation and oleic acid softens the skin, serving to replace skin oils.

According to the first advance estimate of horticulture, the Fruits production is expected to be lower at 95.74 million tonnes in 2019-20 crop year as against 97.9 million tonnes in the previous year. It is mainly due to loss in production of Grapes, Banana, Mango, Citrus, Papaya and Pomegranate.

India is the world's fifth biggest producer of apples, with almost all of its apples produced in just the three hilly states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. What's interesting though is productivity. While the area under apple cultivation in both J&K and Himachal Pradesh is roughly the same, the former produces more than five times of that of the latter. In fact, J&K accounts for almost 80% of India's apple production. Despite that, India import $200 million worth of the fruit every year

Apples, in fact, have a far longer history in India. The origin of apples has been traced to Kazakhstan (the name of its largest city, Almaty, probably derives from 'place of apples') and they spread along the Silk Route, which connected with Kashmir.

The Mughals also brought apples with them. The Nushkae-Shahjahani, recently recreated as The Mughal Feast by Salma Husain, has recipes like Shishranga Saib Namky, apples stewed with spices and then cooked with eggs. Another source of apples was the British.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/first-consignment-of-japanese-apple-arrives.html

134,10-2-20,Don’t rush Central Vista redevelopment plan: CPM,"The CPI (M) on Sunday demanded that the Government ""lifts the veil"" from the redevelopment plan for the Central Vista in Delhi, and said such a historical project should not be rushed.

According to the plan, the Government would redevelop the 3 km-stretch of the Central Vista spanning from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate with the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry saying that the entire project will be completed by 2024.

On September 2 last year, the Centre had floated a request for proposal for the ""development or redevelopment of Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista."" ""The Politburo of the CPI(M) calls upon the BJP Government to lift the veil from the proposed project of redevelopment of the Central Vista in Delhi. Apart from the citizens, it is the Parliament that will get most affected.

""It is therefore imperative that the Government discusses the details of the project in the ongoing budget session of Parliament. Such a historical and important proposal should not be rushed through,"" a statement from the party said.

It said the Centre must know that the land in consideration for the Central Vista belongs to the people, and the government is just the custodian.

""The Supreme Court has already laid it down in the 2G spectrum allocation case the precise definition of natural resources and the limits to the manner of government intervention. The Government therefore cannot unilaterally decide on the project,"" the CPI(M) said.

The Delhi Development Authority conducted a two-day public hearing on February 6 and 7 where a large number of urban planners, environmentalists and other sections of the society participated.

The CPI(M) said there is a general and genuine concern of the citizens that the Central Vista project has been designed in an ""ambiguous and hidden"" manner.

""It is the responsibility of the Government to provide certain facts to Parliament and the public before going any further with the project,"" it said.

The list of information that the CPI(M) demanded that the government provides to Parliament, included a list of ""all buildings intended to be demolished in Central Delhi and in the vicinity of the Central Vista, list of new buildings to be built in Central Delhi and in the vicinity of the Central Vista, total cost of the entire project and its year-wise outlay"".

The party also sought to know the time which would be needed to reconstruct the Central Vista, the list of changes proposed to the Master Plan for the reconstruction and the total area that will be affected by the proposal.

It also demanded to know whether environment impact assessment study has been carried out for the proposed project by an independent authority.

""The re-development proposed for the construction of the Central Vista can not violate the existing master plan of Delhi without completing due processes provided by law. There is no information in the public domain about how the construction of the Central Vista will impact the heritage area of Delhi.

""The CPI(M) demands that the government puts the project on hold and first discuss it in the Parliament as it concerns the reconstruction, redevelopment and expansion of the Parliament building which is unique to Delhi, country's capital,"" the statement said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/don---t-rush-central-vista-redevelopment-plan--cpm.html
135,10-2-20,Opposing BJP doesn't mean being against Hindus: RSS leader,"RSS general secretary Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi on Sunday said that opposing the BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus.

Joshi was speaking during a question-answer session as part of his lecture on 'Vishwaguru Bharat' at Dona Paula near here.

""We should not consider opposition to BJP as opposition to Hindus. It is a political fight that will continue. That should not be linked with Hindus,"" he said responding to a question- 'Why Hindus are becoming the enemy of their own community?'.

""Your question says that Hindus are becoming enemy of Hindu community, means BJP. Hindu community does not mean BJP,"" he said.

His remarks come amid the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""A Hindu fights against a fellow (Hindu) because they forget the religion. Even Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj faced opposition from his own family,"" he said.

""Where there is confusion and self-centered behaviour, there is opposition,"" he said.

""Some claim that Vivekananda's Hindutva is good and not that of Vinayak Savarkar. What is the basis for such claims?"" he said.

Joshi said that the Communist rulers in West Bengal claim that they are against Hindus, but when it comes to heading Durga Puja mandals, they are always in the forefront.

""Similar is the situation in Kerala, where Communists want to be president of temple committee,"" he added.

Joshi advised that Hindus should rise above politics. Responding to a question, Joshi said that the people from all communities are welcome to join the Sangh.

He said that those who believe in the ideology of the Sangh can join and they would be given ""respectable position but not a separate position"".

""Sangh has given position to everyone. Whoever wants to come to Sangh they are welcome. We never stopped non-Hindus from joining Sangh. It is true that we have focused on Hindus. But if someone from Christian community or a Muslim agrees with Sangh's ideology, they can also join it,"" Joshi added.

""After joining the Sangh, if they are reluctant to say 'Bharat mata ki jai', then we will say that you don't consider 'Bharat' as your mother, so you don't deserve to be here,"" he said.

In states like Uttar Pradesh, many Muslims have joined the RSS, he said, adding, ""If any non-Hindu joins the Sangh, they will get a position as much as any Hindu gets. They won't get a separate position.

Whoever joins will get a respectable position, but not a separate position,"" he said.

Responding to another question, Joshi said that government servants are not barred from joining the RSS, although they are barred frombecoming part of political movements.

""Unfortunately, in our country, if you speak about the country's welfare and possible threats, it is considered as a political thinking. When I live in the country, don't I have a right to speak about the country?"" he asked.

Joshi said that there is no example of any government servant losing his job for joining the RSS, but there are ample examples wherein they were harassed for being part of the organisation.

In reply to another query, Joshi said that Hindus cannot be considered as communal as the religion does not believe in single religious book or single God.

""Let them define the word communal. Communal has become a bad word these days. We believe that Hindu can never be communal in the country,"" he said.

""It is wrong to consider Hindus as communal or those who work for Hindu religion. We don't believe in singular religious book (granth), singular God...We have to ask them what is the definition of communal,"" he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opposing-bjp-doesn-t-mean-being-against-hindus--rss-leader.html
136,10-2-20,Goa tourism industry puts Chinese team visit on hold,"A Chinese delegation's visit to Goa has been put on hold by tourism industry stakeholders here in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the neighbouring country, an official said on Sunday.

The delegation, comprising photographers, models, online and offline booking experts and marketing strategists from China, was supposed to arrive here on Sunday, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias told PTI.

“But, their visit has been now put on hold in view of the present situation following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. The delegation was part of a marketing strategy planned by Goa tourism industry stakeholders to attract visitors from China,” Messias said.

Goa has been eyeing Chinese markets to salvage its sagging international tourism industry. A delegation from the coastal state participated in a travel mart last month in China's Chengdu city.

There were also plans to market Goa as a tourist destination in China's prominent cities like Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, Messias said.

“But, the plans have now been put on hold till the coronavirus scare is there. Once it is over, we will resume our promotions in China,” he said.

Former TTAG president Ralf D'Souza, who also runs a chain of hotels in Goa, claimed that highest footfalls in any tourist destination across the world are from India and China.

“Goa's tourism industry also sees a huge potential from China, but due to the coronavirus scare, we have to keep our promotional activities in the neighbouring country on hold,” he said.

Goa attracts nearly four lakh foreign visitors annually, including from destinations like the UK and USA. The death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak rose to 811 on Sunday, while over 37,000 people have been confirmed as infected with the deadly virus.

Sunday said crores of rupees have been allocated for the city and accused the Opposition, including the BJP, was spreading fake news.

Surendran was speaking to reporters here against a campaign against the the State Government, alleging “mistreatment” to the capital city in the state budget.

“Since Pinarayi Vijayan Government came to power, the city has been witnessing a lot of development projects. The BJP makes effective use of social media and have been spreading fake news on budget allocation,” Surendran said.

He ridiculed the Opposition Congress-led UDF and said, “No one takes them seriously.” Asked about lack of funds for the international airport here, Surendran said the government was waiting for the final decision on handing over the airport to Adani group.

“The State Government will allot more funds for the development of the airport if the Centre decides to hand over its operation to the State Government instead of Adani group.

“If it's given to Adani, why should we spend money on it,” Surendran asked.

The Central Government has already planned to privatise six airports in the country, including the one here, under the Airport Authority of India.

Surendran said Rs 1,696 crore has been allotted for various projects in Thiruvananthapuram.

“We have allotted Rs 350 crore for the Vizhinjam port. Travancore Titanium has been allotted Rs 21 crore, Rs 100 crore for developing Kattakada as a township. Trivandrum Spinning Mill, Kerala Automobiles, all have been allotted fund,” he said.

“Under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) over Rs 3,000 crore has been allotted for 98 projects in the district,” Surendran said.

138,10-2-20,TMC MLA murder case: BJP MP grilled by WB CID,"The BJP has alleged ‘political vendetta’ by the ruling TrinamoolCongress after its Member of Parliament from Ranaghat Jagannath Sarkar was subjected to 4-hour grilling by the State Crime Investigation Department late on Saturday evening. He was questioned in connection to the murder of a TMC MLA Satyajit Biswas.

“This is nothing but political score settling by the TMC which is known for its vindictive politics,” Sarkar said adding he would keep on coming to the police station when

called upon to do so by the police.

“I have supreme faith in the judiciary. I have been asked to cooperate with the

police in investigation and I will keep cooperating with them. I will keep coming to here as many times I am called upon to do so,” the

Ranaghat MP said adding “the end of the TMC regime was very much in the vision which is why they are trying to malign the political opponents to gain political mileage out of that.”

Sarkar’s name figured among 43 other accused persons in the MLA murder case. Biswas the local strongman and TMC MLA from Krishnaganj Assembly seat in Nadia district was bumped off in February last year.

Another prominent person whose name figured in the list of accused is senior BJP leader Mukul Roy.

While the BJP claimed that the murder was the fallout of an infighting in the TMC the ruling outfit said the murder was the part of a saffron conspiracy as Biswas an influential leader was being readied by his party to contest the April-May 2019 parliamentary elections.

The MLA was shot dead even as he was attending a cultural programme last year.

The Governor said that bomb factories did not go well with a State that had produced a number of Nobel Laureate and literary giants.

“At times it pains me when I think how Bengal — a State which has produced so many Nobel Laureates and which has been a hub of literary activities producing giant intellectuals and which has been the epicenter of democratic movements — is today sitting on a pile of gun powder. This does not go well with the State’s lofty intellectual and democratic traditions,” the Governor.

Dhankhar who has no love lost with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wondered whether in such a volatile atmosphere peaceful elections were possible.

He asked “how can you conduct peaceful and free and fair elections if the situation continues to be so grim and if explosives hidden across the State are not recovered immediately.”

Bengal is scheduled to go in for a state-wide civic elections. Apparently the Governor was making his statement in the backdrop of forthcoming municipal polls.

The Trinamool Congress was prompt to hit back at the Governor doubting his neutrality. Reacting to his sharp remarks senior State Minister and TMC general secretary Partho Chatterjee said that in his long political career he had never seen a prejudiced Governor like the present one in office.

“I have seen many Governors in my long political career. But none like this gentleman who gets up in the morning and starts tweeting on subjects that do not fall within his domain,” Chatterjee asked saying “at times I wonder as to why has he became a Governor in the first place if he had so much interest in active politics. He could well have remained a Minister. The job he is presently in does not perhaps suit him.”

The Minister added, “It is good that he is making the work of Dilip Ghosh (State BJP president) easier because the comments that should otherwise have been coming from the BJP office is coming from the Governor’s House.”

However, FPIs pulled out Rs 1,172.56 crore from equities during the period, resulting in a total net investment of Rs 5,177.44 crore.

On investment in the debt segment, Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India said that it was “largely on the back of RBI maintaining an accommodative stance in its recent monetary policy review, which leaves room for further rate easing.”

Besides, he also added that markets have been overwhelmed by the spread of novel coronavirus and the impact that it could have on the Chinese economy and global growth. This would have pushed FPIs to maintain a cautious stance on emerging markets like India until more clarity emerges.

Regarding the future course of FPI flows, Alok Agarwala, head research and advisory, Bajaj Capital, said India could continue to attract FPI inflows as “union budget has announced plenty of measures to attract the foreign capital.”

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors, adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent.

Besides, the government also proposed to remove dividend distribution tax (DDT) on companies, and henceforth the tax burden will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

Agarwala also added that once coronavirus gets contained in China, risk-on sentiments will again prevail among the investors and emerging markets including India would continue to attract foreign capital.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-net-buyers-in-february-so-far--invest-rs-5-177-crore.html
145,10-2-20,Govt may clear CVC oversight before share sale in IDBI Bank,"The Government may clarify the application of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) oversight over the IDBI bank before it initiates the process to exit the bank by selling its entire stake to private players.

The move is expected to prevent a tepid response to the share sale plan, as cumbersome vigilance oversight is seen as a big negative by investors who feel that the RBI, as a single regulator for the sector, is enough to ensure smooth and transparent functioning of the banks.

Presenting the Budget proposals FY21, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the government will exit from IDBI bank by selling its entire equity to private players.

Sources said that government may seek opinion of the Law Ministry again on whether the now privatised IDBI bank should be considered a state-run financial institution or a private entity as classified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This would also clarify whether CVC oversight on the bank for all matters would apply or not.

The CVC is mandated to maintain vigilance oversight over public sector banks and financial institutions. Private sector banks, however, are out of its purview, but are subjected to statutory audits from the RBI.

IDBI, set up in 1964 under an Act of Parliament, is regarded as a public financial institution. But the government has now ceded its management control in the firm, hence there is confusion about the status of the bank.

Following a cabinet decision in 2018, the LIC in January 2019 completed acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in the bank by infusing Rs 20,800 crore, making it the lender’s majority shareholder. Following this, the government shareholding in the bank has fallen to 47.11 per cent. The RBI, however, has classified the bank as a private sector lender for regulatory purposes.

“In my opinion, the IDBI is a government bank as the Centre still is in complete control of the lender through direct equity and indirect holding through LIC, another state-run institution. As regards to CVC oversight, the 2016 Supreme Court order makes it ample clear that officers of private banks are also public servants when it came to the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988. So, in all PCA related cases, CVC would have a role in both private and public sector banks,” said former Vigilance Commissioner T.M. Bhasin.

But so far, private banks continue to remain outside the CVC’s purview. In fact, the CVC had earlier urged the Prime Minister’s Office to bring private sector banks under its watch, citing the fact that they have been involved in many instances of malfeasance.

INDBI Bank has been perpetually in losses with the lender reporting a loss of Rs 3,458 crore in the second quarter of current fiscal, its 12th successive quarterly loss. However, news of the government’s exit from the bank has been taken positively by the markets as its shares rose 4.32 per cent to Rs 36.25 a piece at close of trading hours at BSE on Friday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-may-clear-cvc-oversight-before-share-sale-in-idbi-bank.html
146,10-2-20,12% tax revenue growth achievable in 2020-21 fiscal: Revenue Secy,"A 12 per cent growth in tax collections next fiscal may look ambitious to some but for Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey it is achievable in an economy that is projected to clock a 10 per cent nominal GDP growth.

The economy slowing down to its slowest growth in 11 years together with a cut in corporate tax rates led to the government missing its tax collection target by a wide margin in the current fiscal. The tax shortfall also led to slipping on fiscal deficit target for the third year in a row.

In an interview to PTI, Pandey exuded confidence of meeting the tax collection target of Rs 24.23 lakh crore for 2020-21.

“In 2020-21 the nominal growth that has been projected is 10 per cent. So on a 10 per cent (GDP) growth, getting a 12 per cent growth in tax revenue is achievable,” Pandey told PTI. The 2020-21 Budget has pegged gross tax revenues for 2020-21 at Rs 24.23 lakh crore, up 12 per cent from Rs 21.63 lakh crore in the current fiscal.

Around Rs 6.38 lakh crore is expected to come from personal income tax in 2020-21, a 14.13 per cent increase over Rs 5.59 lakh crore earned in 2019-20.

Besides, corporate tax revenue is budgeted to increase by 11.63 per cent to Rs 6.81 lakh crore in 2020-21, from Rs 6.10 lakh crore in current fiscal.

For current fiscal, the government has revised downwards the tax collection projections from budgeted Rs 24.61 lakh crore to Rs 21.63 lakh crore in the revised estimates. Pandey said the revenue growth budgeted for current fiscal was calculated assuming a 12 per cent nominal GDP growth. However, the nominal GDP growth came in at 7.5 per cent.

He said in the current fiscal, the gross tax revenue is 4 per cent higher than Rs 20.80 lakh crore collected in 2018-19 fiscal. However, the government had estimated an 11 per cent gross tax revenue growth in 2019-20.

Explaining further, Pandey said, “This year we have shown a tax revenue growth of 4 per cent. 7 per cent growth we had to forego on account of corporate tax (cut). So 4 per cent (growth) means actually 11 per cent achievement. On 7.5 per cent nominal growth if you are achieving 11 per cent (tax revenue) growth, we can’t say that this is unrealistic”.

In September 2019, the government announced a cut in base corporate tax for existing companies to 22 per cent from current 30 per cent; and for new manufacturing firms, incorporated after October 1, 2019 and starting operations before March 31, 2023, to 15 per cent from current 25 per cent.

The effective tax rate for existing units, after considering surcharges and cess such as Swachh Bharat cess and education cess — which are levied on top of the income and corporate tax rates, will be 25.17 per cent as compared to 34.94 per cent now.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/12--tax-revenue-growth-achievable-in-2020-21-fiscal--revenue-secy.html
147,10-2-20,Govt to release another Rs 35K cr compensation to States soon,"The Centre will soon release another Rs 35,000 crore to states to compensate for the revenue loss on account of GST rollout, an official said.

Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law, states are guaranteed compensation for revenue loss for 5 years if their revenue does not increase 14 per cent on the base year of 2015-16.

There were no differences between the Centre and States with regard to compensation payment in 2017-18, 2018-19, and in the first four months of the current fiscal.

However, with revenue mop-up from compensation cess falling inadequate, the Centre held back fund transfer to states for revenue shortage beginning August.

Following this, states raised the issue with the Centre and in December 2019, Rs 35,298 crore was released as compensation for August-September.

“We will soon transfer another Rs 35,000 crore from the consolidated fund of India (CFI) to compensation cess fund in 2 instalments. The first tranche will be compensation for October-November,” an official told PTI.

The excess collection from compensation cess in 2017-18 and 2018-19 was deposited in the CFI earlier and this will now be transferred back to the compensation fund, the official added. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech said it is decided to transfer to the GST Compensation Fund balances in two instalments.

Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods and the proceeds from the same is used to compensate states for any revenue loss.

The Centre has so far released about Rs 2.11 lakh crore as GST compensation to States since the implementation of GST on July 1, 2017.

During July 2017-March 2018 Rs 48,785 crore was released, while between April 2018-March 2019, Rs 81,141 crore was paid to states. For April-May and June-July last year, Rs 17,789 crore and Rs 27,956 crore were released. Further, Rs 35,298 crore was paid to states as compensation for August-September 2019.

In an interview to PTI, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey had said revenues from GST will have to increase in order to resolve the issue of compensation payment to states.

“Revenue will have to increase and for that only we are looking at rate rationalisation, addressing issue of inverted duty structure and increasing compliance. This will ensure that requirement of compensation is less,” Pandey said.

He further said the government is looking at monthly average GST collection of over Rs 1 lakh crore.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-to-release-another-rs-35k-cr-compensation-to-states-soon.html
148,10-2-20,"Govt seeks to engage itself with businesses, industries: Nirmala","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said that the Government wants continuous engagement with industries and businesses and will act as a facilitator for hassle-free payments of taxes.

She was interacting with the members of trade and industries here, a week after presenting the Union Budget for 2020-21 in Parliament on February 1.

“The broad message which is apparent is that the government wants continuous engagement with industry and business. And my presence here is not in response to what is happening inside (country) and outside,” Sitharaman said.

She said the Centre has introduced some features in the budget like “faceless appeals and sorting out of problems while imparting tax administration”.

Sitharaman said this will be made possible only with the help of new technology.

“Over the years, we had to remove all the dead wood gathered with a pincer. This will help the government to fulfill its commitments made in the budget,” she said.

Referring to issues relating to GST, the Finance Minister said it is not the Centre to initiate steps for reduction of rates, the State Ministers should also represent cases so that a synergy could be built.

Responding to Tea Board chairman PK Bezbaruah’s remarks on the scarcity of ATMs in the tea belts of Assam and West Bengal for which “cashless wage payments are becoming a problem”, the Finance Minister said the Government is willing to set up ATMs in pockets where there are none.

“I know that number of ATMs is minuscule in the tea growing regions. The Government is ready to set up such facilities in these areas,” she said.

Finance secretary Rajiv Kumar said that “there is a need for credit offtake to pick up for genuine businesses.

“Commercial lending has to go up.

149,10-2-20,Laid foundation for $5 tn economy: FM,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said the Union Budget has laid the foundation of increasing consumption while ensuring that the government’s investment is deployed to build infrastructure leading to a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25.

She also pitched for rationalisation of GST rates once a year and not every three months as was the trend so far.

“I think we have laid the foundation for increasing consumption, ensuring that capex (capital expenditure) and government’s investments will go towards spending on building of assets in infrastructure which should have cascading effects both in the short term and in the long term,” Sitharaman told reporters.

She said, “In order to address rural distress, 16 focused action points have been announced in the budget. So I expect all this will lead to a five trillion dollar economy.”

Asked about what West Bengal has received from the Budget, she said, “I do not know how I answer this question of kisko keya mila (which state gets what). I am looking at the point of macroeconomic stability, building assets in the country, money directly going to hands of individuals because of reduced tax rates and so on.”

150,10-2-20,Fuel prices cut for fifth consecutive day on Monday,"Fuel prices dropped further for the fifth consecutuve day on on Monday as international crude prices fell due to demand slump. The Price of petrol was cut by 13-16 paise a litre and that of diesel by 16-20 paise a litre across all major cities in India.

The petrol now costs Rs 72.10 a litre in Delhi, Rs 77.76 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 74.74 a litre in Kolkata and Rs 74.90 a litre in Chennai.

Similarly, diesel costs Rs 65.07 a litre in Delhi, Rs 68.19 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 67.39 per litre in Kolkata and Rs 68.72 a litre in Chennai, according to the Indian Oil Corporation website.

The fuel prices in India have so far become cheaper by around Rs 3 a litre since January 1.

Crude oil prices continued to decline as spectre of excess supply loomed over the market as demand in China was hit by the outbreak of coronavirus which has killed over 900 people so far.

The retail prices of fuel are dependent on the international crude prices and the rupee-US dollar exchange rate as India imports almost 80 per cent of its crude requirements.

Domestic petrol and diesel prices are reviewed by oil marketing companies on a daily basis. Price revisions are implemented at the fuel stations with effect from 6 a.m.

151,10-2-20,BJP hasn't put up no exit board: Naqvi on Muslim leaders quitting party,"In the wake of some Muslim leaders from Madhya Pradesh quitting the BJP in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said his party has not put up a board of ""no exit"" or ""no entry"".

He said those who have misunderstandings about CAA should think with an open mind and get their misconceptions cleared as the new law is not a threat to any Indian citizen.

Talking to reporters here, Naqvi assured Indian Muslims that their citizenship was ""100 per cent protected"".

Asked about Muslim leaders from the Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh quitting the BJP in protest against the CAA, Naqvi said, ""The BJP is a big political party. The BJP has neither put up a board of 'no exit' nor of 'no entry'. People come to the BJP and those who don't want to stay in the party go away.""

To another question, the Union minister denied that the BJP failed to convince its Muslim leaders that the CAA was in the country's interest.

""We appeal to those having misunderstanding about CAA to think with an open mind and clear their misconceptions. They should also think why a 'bogus bashing brigade' was spreading fake information about CAA to create an atmosphere of fear and confusion in a particular community,"" he said.

Notably, BJP's lone Muslim corporator Usman Patel in the saffron party-ruled Indore Municipal Corporation on Saturday announced his resignation from the ""changed"" BJP, which he said was indulging in ""politics of hate"" over CAA.

In a letter to the district BJP unit, Patel said he was resigning from all posts in the party with which he was associated for last 40 years.

Yadav did not specify when he would begin his ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ but said he would continue with the rally even during the five-week-long Assembly session which will begin on February 24.

""The country is grappling with the problems of recession and unemployment. I will tour every corner of the state with the Berojgari Hatao Yatra,"" he said.

""The RJD is not M-Y's (Muslim-Yadav) party alone. Its base is much larger. The party belongs to people from A to Z. Ours is a big family where we respect and honour every section of the society and give everyone appropriate representation,"" Tejashwi said. The RJD has been known for its M-Y vote base. Party chief Lalu Prasad, who is currently serving sentence in Ranchi following his conviction in several fodder scam cases, has carefully cultivated the M-Y vote bank since its formation in July 1997 when Prasad left the Janata Dal.

Addressing a meeting of newly elected district presidents and district secretary generals of the party, the RJD heir apparent said the party has always fought for bringing the backward, oppressed and the deprived sections of the society into the mainstream and giving them voice.

154,10-2-20,Industry seeks decriminalisation of offences committed under business legislations,"Offences committed under business or economic legislations should be treated as civil instead of criminal offences and punishment be limited to penalties rather than fines or imprisonment, industry body CII has demanded.

In representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the CII suggested that offences which are of a technical nature or those that do not affect public interest prejudicially should be considered to be decriminalized.

The Confederation of Indian Industry’s recommendations in this regard cover 37 laws and Acts ranging from the partnership Act of 1932 to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of 2016. Hardselling his administration’s pro-business approach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December had said the government is working to decriminalise provision of Companies Act to make it easier to do business in the country.

Sitharaman in her budget for 2020-21 also announced that the government will amend the Companies Act and other laws to remove the criminality clause on tax issues.

Lately, there have been increasing incidents where commercial and civil disputes are being treated as criminal complaints, thereby creating a fear factor among Directors, young entrepreneurs and foreign investors, CII stated.

“For such business and economic legislations which fall within the domain of arbitration or civil courts, the government should consider decriminalising the laws, unless there is an intent of fraud or misdoings,” CII President Vikram Kirloskar said.

Directors today are fearful, and this impacts corporates negatively since they are resigning due to the fear of criminal implications of the laws.

It has argued that changing the nature of the punishments to make them more rationale will also help reduce litigation and de-clog the judiciary.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/industry-seeks-decriminalisation-of-offences-committed-under-business-legislations.html

156,10-2-20,Serpentine airport queues to continue for at least next 3 more years: Report,"Given the slow progress on the ongoing Rs 38,000-crore capacity expansion at the four largest metro airports, and also the surging traffic, the snaky queues will continue at least till 2023, warns a report.

The four largest airports — New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad — handle more than half of the traffic and are operating at 130 per cent of their installed capacity. These airports are under a record Rs 38,000-crore capex but the capacity will not come up before end-2023, says a Crisil report.

“With the dip in traffic growth largely behind, we expect congestion at the top four airports of New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which handle more than half of the load, to continue till about FY23,” says the report.

Already these airports are operating at over 130 percent of installed capacity, and the ongoing healthy traffic growth this operating rate is expected to rise further in the next 12 months.

“Operationalising of capacities in the following two fiscals will bring down utilisation levels albeit still high at over 90 per cent by fiscal 2023 and that is despite an unprecedented Rs 38,000 crore capex being undertaken by the operators of these airports over five fiscals 2020-24,” says the report.

Despite this unprecedented capex that is debt-funded, ratings are likely to be stable given the strong cash flows expected due to healthy traffic growth, low project risks associated with the

capex and improving regulatory environment, notes the report.

“Capacity at these four airports will increase a cumulative 65 per cent to 228 million annually (from 138 million now) by fiscal 2023. However, traffic is expected to grow strong at up to 10 per cent per annum over the same period. Since additional capacities will become operational in phases only by fiscal 2023, high passenger growth will add to congestion till then,” warn the report.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/serpentine-airport-queues-to-continue-for-at-least-next-3-more-years--report.html

With 91 more people dying, most in Hubei province, the novel coronavirus death toll is now higher than the 774 people killed worldwide by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that started in southern China.

China’s National Health Commission in its daily report on Sunday said 2,656 new confirmed cases were reported , taking the total number of people infected with the deadly virus in 31 provincial-level regions in China to 37,287.

The commission said China’s new confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei Province, the ground zero of the epidemic, have been dropping for the five consecutive days.

A total of 509 new confirmed cases were reported on Saturday outside Hubei, about 42.8 percent lower than the number reported on Monday, Mi Feng, spokesperson of the NHC was quoted by the state-run Xinhua news agency on Sunday.

The numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 (Monday), 731 (Tuesday), 707 (Wednesday), 696 (Thursday) and 558 (Friday).

""It shows that the joint prevention and control mechanism incorporating different regions in the country, as well as strict management, are taking effect,”Mi said.

As per the data released by the commission, the confirmed cases in Hubei showed a drop perhaps for the first time since the virulent virus emerged in the province in December.

On Saturday, Hubei reported 2,147 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, the commission said. The figure is 694 less compared with the new confirmed cases reported in the previous day, it said.

Hubei’s capital Wuhan reported 1,379 new infections and 63 new deaths, and the cities of Xiaogan and Huanggang reported 123 and 100 new confirmed cases, respectively, according to the provincial health commission.

Hubei alone reported 27,100 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, with 780 deaths and 5,247 cases in severe or critical condition.

Also, 1,439 patients have been discharged from the hospital after recovery, it said.

The deaths come at a sensitive time in the 18-year-old war, with President Donald Trump eager to bring troops home and end the longest conflict in US history.

The incident occurred late Saturday in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan when US and Afghan commandos were conducting a ""key-leader engagement”at a base in Sherzad district. ""Current reports indicate an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on the combined US and Afghan force with a machine gun,”US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Sonny Leggett said in a statement on Sunday.

Provincial governor Shah Mahmood Meyakhil said in an audio message to reporters that three Afghan commandos were wounded. He said it was not immediately clear if the incident was a deliberate act by an ""infiltrator”or an accident.

""It was not a clash between the forces. We are investigating,”Meyakhil said. Leggett also stressed the cause or motive behind the attack were not immediately known.

In a tweet, the US Army’s 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) said ""several”of its soldiers had been killed or injured during combat operations in Afghanistan.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incident. Last year was the deadliest for US forces in Afghanistan since combat operations officially finished at the end of 2014, highlighting the challenging security situation that persists.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/two-us-troops-killed-by-afghan-soldier-in-nangarhar-attack.html
161,10-2-20,Where it begins: Young hungry locusts bulk up in Somalia,"At a glance, the desert locusts in this arid patch of northern Somalia look less ominous than the billion-member swarms infesting East Africa in the worst outbreak some places have seen in 70 years.

But their time will come.

Small and wingless, the hopping young locusts are the next wave in the outbreak that threatens more than 10 million people across the region with a severe hunger crisis.

And they are growing up in one of the most inaccessible places on the planet.

Large parts of Somalia south of this semi-autonomous Puntland region are under threat, or held by, the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group.

That makes it difficult or impossible to conduct the aerial spraying of the locusts that experts say is the only effective control.

Somalia has declared the outbreak a national emergency.

Across the region, it has the potential “to be the most devastating plague of locusts in any of our living memories if we don’t reduce the problem faster than we’re doing at the moment,”UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said.

As an armed Somali policeman stood by, experts on Thursday walked across the dry land crawling with the young locusts and explained the threat to come if the world doesn’t act right now.

“The world needs to know this is where it all begins,”said Alberto Trillo Barca, a spokesman for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

“In the next three or four weeks, these nymphs, as we call them, will develop wings.”

Then they are expected to set off for neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, where a handful of planes spraying pesticide can only do so much if such swarms keep arriving.

Climate experts have pointed to unusually heavy rains, aided by a powerful cyclone off Somalia in December, as a major factor in the outbreak.

The locusts were carried in by the storm’s winds from the Arabian Peninsula and parts beyond, and now they are feeding on Somalia’s fresh vegetation.

With more rains expected in the region in the coming weeks, the number of locusts if unchecked could grow by up to 500 times by June, when drier weather is expected.

But that drier weather is not necessarily the solution, said Dominique Burgeon, the FAO’s emergency and resilience director.

The density of the locusts is now so high that even normal moisture can lead to another generation, he said.

“We cannot believe in Mother Nature to solve it,”he explained.

Without enough spraying to stop the swarms, the already worrying outbreak could turn into a plague, “and when you have a plague, it takes years to control,”he said.

Against that sweeping outlook, a few masked workers with white protective suits and pesticide containers strapped to their backs stood in the camel-crossed Somali desert, spritzing the thousands of locusts clinging to thorny bushes.

The world’s changing climate brings the risk of more cyclones coming in from the warming Indian Ocean off East Africa, climate experts say. With that, the likelihood of further locust outbreaks grows.

The “sort of new normal,”Burgeon said.

And that means Kenya, Ethiopia and other East African countries that rarely see such outbreaks and found themselves largely unprepared for this one could join “frontline countries”in parts of West Africa and the Middle East, experts say. Those countries have well-trained monitoring and prevention systems in place for more frequent locust outbreaks.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/where-it-begins--young-hungry-locusts-bulk-up-in-somalia.html
162,10-2-20,Cultural heart of Europe,"Isabella Rauter, Global Head of Public Relations for Vienna Tourism Board, tells Ayushi Sharma that the city continues to attract Indian visitors with its history, art, glittering palaces and musical heritage

What kind of travellers are you catering to?

I have been coming to India for the past five years now. The whole idea is to focus on Vienna on the basis of what interests the Indian travellers. The main focus is on three things. First, this year marks the 250th birth anniversary of Ludwig Van Beethoven, the German composer. A series of events and performances have been organised around that. The city will pay special homage through concerts, operas and events by composers including Mozart. Second, the focus is on luxury travellers, millennials. We don’t really cater to mass tourism. People who are culturally inclined, interested in music and who love to engage in new experiences, are what we are looking at. Culture is really an important part of the city. Third, Vienna has come out with its Visitor Economy Strategy for 2025. It aims at keeping the ecological footprint of tourism as low as possible. We are looking at how the city will contribute to giving the best experience to the visitors as well as to the Viennese people.

Why should Indian travellers put Vienna on their bucket list?

Vienna is home to some of the world-renowned museums, palaces, art collections, music and theatre stages that host over 15,000 concerts annually and sights from the Imperial era. Sigmund Freud never really grew to like Vienna but nevertheless spent almost 80 years of his life in the Austrian metropolis. The Sigmund Freud Museum takes you back in time in search of “Freud’s Vienna.” The 18th-century Schonbrunn Palace is worth visiting not only for its magnificent architecture but also for its park-like setting. Dotted with parks and gardens, farmer’s fields and meadows, and boasting a biosphere park as well as a national park, Vienna is a green city. Protecting the environment and sustainability are always high on the agenda. Smart strategies help to make sure that this urban space remains as liveable as always.

Best known for its huge Dinosaur Hall and for the world’s largest exhibit of meteorites (which includes the Tissint meteorite from Mars that fell in Morocco in 2011), Vienna’s Natural History Museum should also be on the list. Its 39 exhibit halls trace such subjects as the origins and development of humans and the evolution of human culture from prehistoric times.

How does Vienna’s coffee culture sets the tone for the tourists?

Although many countries can boast about the quality of their coffee but Vienna has elevated it to an art form and its consumption to a lifestyle. Coffee is the highlight of the city. By literally buying just a single cup, a person can spend the entire day at a coffee house. It’s an integral part of the city’s social experience. We have very old traditional coffee houses mainly from the 18-19th century. It was a time when very famous artists and writers sat there for hours. It used to be a great place for discussions. We still have those old traditional houses but of course, new contemporary ones have also come up.

Given India’s economic slowdown, how does it impact the tourism industry in Vienna?

We only need 65,000 travellers in a year. India’s economy cannot really stop people from travelling where they wish to. There will always be enough tourists.

What are the other major attractions?

It’s perfect for a family holiday and is also the convention capital. Vienna is one of the most popular meetings destinations anywhere in the world. The city’s location in the heart of Europe and its role as a link between East and West are among its biggest strengths. As many as 74 airlines provide regular connections to and from 195 destinations worldwide. The city’s efficient public transport system comprising tram, bus and metro is as convenient for small children in strollers as it is for the elderly. Vienna offers enough activities for families with children, making it the best city for a memorable family holiday.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cultural-heart-of-europe-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/cultural-heart-of-europe.html
163,10-2-20,Find that common ground,"Here are some ways for couples to tackle the challenging task of decorating shared spaces

Sharing a home with someone you love can be wonderful. But decorating together isn’t always easy, especially when your tastes aren’t the same. If one partner loves filling every space with mementos and the other is clutter-averse, who gets their way? It can be hard to find good compromises when one loves bold colours and patterns, while the other favours calming shades of gray.

Interior designer Penny Drue Baird draws as much on her doctorate in psychology as on her design training when she works with couples decorating a home. “I’m there as the mediator, like a marital therapist,” Baird says, “working out how to approach it so both persons don’t feel like they’re the one that can’t get what they want.” Here, Baird and two other New York-based interior designers — Deborah Martin and Michelle Gerson — discuss how couples can tackle the challenging task of decorating shared spaces.

SHARING YOUR VISION

All three designers begin by doing an intake meeting with a couple to find out “everything that they are hoping to achieve, and the look they feel like they’re going for,” Baird says. Clients will bring photos they’ve ripped from magazines or show pages from design books to help explain what appeals to them.

A couple can sit down together and have this sort of meeting even if they aren’t working with a designer. By showing your partner what you envision, you may find that you have more common ground than you realised. Martin says that sometimes a client begins with a preconceived notion that they don’t like a certain pattern or style but when they see it in context they do like it.

Martin says just as a designer must “take some risks and present what you feel will work very well in the home,” a partner can take the risk of showing their vision and taking in their partner’s vision with an open mind. Both may be happily surprised.

COHESIVE COMPROMISES

Gerson recommends making a list of items you both need in the room/ home you’re decorating. These are the shared must-haves you can agree on, like plenty of seating in the living room if you both like to entertain.

Find that common ground, she says, and try to agree on one major piece of furniture. Maybe it’s a sofa that one partner loves the shape of and the other likes the fabric. Once each person feels like their biggest requests have been heard, it may be easier to compromise on other details.

Some couples opt to mix their contrasting tastes throughout their home but Baird says creating an “eclectic” room that mashes up two different decorating styles can be difficult. “People bandy around the word eclectic, but it really is a mishmosh,” she says. “It’s very rare to see a room or a home that I would call eclectic that is well done.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/find-that-common-ground-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/find-that-common-ground.html
164,10-2-20,Lies and half-truths,"Cyborgs, trolls and bots: A guide to online misinformation

Internet can be full of false claims by Cyborgs, trolls and bots. Understanding them is key to learning how misinformation spreads online.

As the 2016 election showed, social media is increasingly used to amplify false claims and divide Americans over hot-button issues including race and immigration. Researchers who study misinformation predict it will get worse leading up to this year’s presidential vote. Here’s a guide to understanding the problem:

MISINFORMATION VS DISINFORMATION

Political misinformation has been around since before the printing press but the internet has allowed falsehoods, conspiracy theories and exaggerations to spread faster and farther than ever.

Misinformation is defined as any false information, regardless of intent, including honest mistakes or misunderstandings of the facts. Disinformation, on the other hand, typically refers to misinformation created and spread intentionally as a way to confuse or mislead.

Both can appear in political ads or social media posts. They can include fake news stories or doctored videos. Research indicates that false claims spread more easily than accurate ones, possibly because they are crafted to grab attention.

Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysed more than 1,26,000 stories, some true and some false, that were tweeted millions of times from 2006 through the end of 2016. They found that misleading or incorrect stories traveled six times faster — and reached more people.

Online misinformation has been blamed for deepening America’s political polarisation and contributing to distrust in government. The risks were highlighted in 2016 when Russian trolls created fake accounts to spread and amplify social media posts about controversial issues.

WAR OF THE BOTS AND CYBORGS

The disposable foot soldiers in this digital conflict are bots. In the social media context, these autonomous programmes can run accounts to spread content without human involvement. Many are harmless, tweeting out random poems or pet photos. But others are up to no good and designed to resemble actual users.

One study by researchers at the University of Southern California analysed election-related tweets sent in September and October 2016 and found that one in five were sent by a bot. The Pew Research Center concluded in a 2018 study that accounts suspected of being bots are responsible for as many as two-thirds of all tweets that link to popular websites.

While flesh-and-blood Twitter users will often post a few times a day, about a variety of subjects, the most obvious bots will tweet hundreds of times a day, day and night, and often only on a specific topic. They are more likely to repost content rather than create something original.

SPOT THE BOTS

Bots can be hard to spot, even for the best researchers. “We have 12 ways that we spot a bot and if we hit seven or eight of them we have pretty high confidence,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, a Washington, DC-based organisation that studies connections between social media, cybersecurity and government.

Nonetheless, Brookie recalled the case of a Twitter account from Brazil that was posting almost constantly — sometimes once per minute — and displayed other bot-like characteristics. And yet, “It was a little grandma, who said, ‘This is me!’”

FAKE VIDEOS

Deepfakes are videos that have been digitally created with artificial intelligence or machine learning to make it appear something happened that did not. They are seen as an emerging threat, as improvements in video editing software make it possible for tricksters to create increasingly realistic footage of, say, former President Barack Obama delivering a speech he never made, in a setting he never visited. They are expensive and difficult to create — especially in a convincing way.

Facebook announced last month that it would ban deepfake videos — with exceptions for satire. Beginning in March, Twitter will prohibit doctored videos, photography and audio recordings “likely to cause harm.” Material that is manipulated but isn’t necessarily harmful may get a warning label. And YouTube bans “deceptive uses of manipulated media” that could pose serious risk of harm.

By contrast, shallowfakes, cheapfakes or dumbfakes are videos that have been doctored using more basic techniques, such as slowing down or speeding up footage or cutting it. Examples include a doctored video posted by Britain’s Conservative Party before December’s UK election that made it seem like a Labour Party official was struggling to respond to a question about Brexit.

Researchers who study Americans’ changing media habits recommend that people turn to a variety of sources and perspectives for their news, use critical thinking when evaluating information on social media, and think twice about reposting viral claims. Otherwise, they say, misinformation will continue to flow and users will continue to spread it. “The only solution,” Ferrara said, “is education.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lies-and-half-truths-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/lies-and-half-truths.html

Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra will turn yoga teacher for contestants of the controversial reality show Bigg Boss 13 in a forthcoming episode.

In a promo clip, Shilpa is seen entering the Bigg Boss house and teaching the housemates poses to relax their mind, body and souls. However, the contestants found it difficult to perform some of the yoga positions.

In another video clip, Shilpa, who has hosted the second season of the Colors show, said that she watches it closely.

She said that she has seen a lot of contestants but never seen such an entertaining lot. She then asked the contestants about their fondest memories in the show.

‘I have a lot of memories of my dad (Surinder Kapoor) but overall we, including our neighbours in Chembur, where we were born and brought up, remember him as a warm-hearted and jovial man. Although as a film producer, he went through a tough time at one point in his career but I never saw him dejected or bitter. He fought all crises with a smile and that is a quality all of us brothers have imbibed.’

Actor Taapsee Pannu was one of the early birds to cast her vote in Delhi during Assembly elections. But soon her voting right was being questioned on social media because she lives in Mumbai. She had a befitting reply: “You can take a girl out of Delhi but you can not take Delhi out of this girl.”

She took to Twitter to share her family photo flaunting their inked fingers and captioned it: “Pannu Parivaar' has voted. Have you #VoteDelhi #EveryVoteCounts.”

167,10-2-20,Death of whistleblower ignites calls for political reform in China,"The death of a whistleblowing doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the new coronavirus has sparked rare calls for political reform and free speech in China.

Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan — ground zero of China’s virus epidemic which has killed more than 800 — succumbed to the disease Friday over a month after he first raised alarm about the SARS-like virus.

He was among eight physicians punished by Wuhan police for ""rumour-mongering"".

But after his death struck a collective nerve, a number of academics have spoken up to demand more freedoms in China.

At least two open letters demanding free speech have circulated on social media since the 34-year-old’s death — one signed by 10 professors in Wuhan.

Li’s efforts ""vigorously maintained the interests of the country and society"", read that letter, which has since been censored on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site.

""Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,”it demanded, and ""openly apologise”to Li and the seven other doctors punished for discussing the emergence of the virus in December.

The other letter — signed on Friday by an anonymous group of alumni from the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing — called on authorities to ""guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens"".

""Resolutely oppose making political security the top priority — that is an extremely selfish goal of a small organisation!”it said.

The letters are a rare call for political reform in China, a country where dissidents are often jailed and criticism of the Government is quickly scrubbed.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/death-of-whistleblower-ignites-calls-for-political-reform-in-china.html
168,10-2-20,B’desh scraps plans to bring back stuck 171 nationals from China,"Bangladesh has scrapped plans to bring back its 171 nationals stuck in coronavirus-hit China after it failed to arrange a flight following refusal from crew members to fly to the affected country, according to media reports on Sunday.

State-run Biman Airlines’ Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft on February 1 brought back 312 Bangladeshis, including 12 children and three infants in the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, that has claimed 811 lives and infected over 37,000 others.

“We can’t send any flight. No crew member agrees to go there either. So, we’ve told them [stranded Bangladeshis] to wait,”Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen was quoted as saying by bdnews24.Com.

The Government has said that the number of Bangladeshis who wanted to return but could not be brought back is 171.

Momen also denied reports that some of the stuck Bangladeshi nationals have complained of shortage of food and drinking water due to the lockdown, saying that the Chinese authorities were providing food and water to the 23 places where the Bangladeshis stay.

He said that the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing was maintaining regular contact with the stranded Bangladeshis.

According to a report in the Dhaka Tribune, the minister said that the government has spent a lot of time for those intending to return.

""However, it is still not possible (to bring them back). The Biman crew members who brought back some 312 Bangladeshis from China are now in effect barred from flying to other countries,”he said.

169,10-2-20,Scientists race to develop vaccine,"Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China’s coronavirus outbreak.

The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries.

Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals.

But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope their’s could be ready in six months.

""It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,”said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland. But the scientist added he took ""some solace”knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission.

""The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,”he said.

But even a timeframe of six months looks agonisingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China.

Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.

With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals.

170,10-2-20,"Joe Biden, a presidential frontrunner in trouble","After suffering a drubbing in Iowa and bizarrely conceding he will likely lose New Hampshire’s Democratic primary next Tuesday, Joe Biden is under immense pressure to turn his floundering US presidential campaign around.

The popular former US vice president has been the national frontrunner for more than a year, but his enviable position is increasingly under threat, and rivals -- including a socialist-leaning senator and a small-city mayor -- smell blood in the water.

The 77-year-old moderate is being eclipsed on the campaign trail by mostly younger candidates with sharper stump speeches, more hustle, and telegenic debate performances.

An average of polling in New Hampshire, which votes Tuesday in the first-in-the-nation primary (following Iowa’s troubled caucuses this past week), shows Biden plunging from first place to third, behind Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.

""To not be concerned I think would be foolish,”acknowledged Biden-backer Will Johnson, a 23-year-old law student from northern Pittsburgh, said in one of several conversations voters had with AFP about the candidate.

""Hopefully a more concerted effort is made by the campaign to really push out the vote and get people to support Biden,”he said, adding Biden was ""the best shot we have”at defeating President Donald Trump in November.

The big crowds, however, are going to Buttigieg, 38, and Sanders, 78, the two candidates who won the most votes in Iowa and are leading in New Hampshire.

Biden took a day off the trail Thursday, five days before the primary, to huddle with top advisors about the path forward.

But instead of coming out swinging at the start of the next day’s debate, Biden committed a glaring unforced error.

""I took a hit in Iowa, and I’ll probably take one here,”Biden said onstage, startling Johnson and other supporters who are looking for him to grab the reins, not admit defeat.

Biden, who passed a 2016 presidential run after his son Beau’s death, has seen his path to this year’s nomination transform into a rocky road.

He and his other son Hunter were drawn into the Trump impeachment saga, with the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate them over Hunter’s involvement with a Ukrainian energy firm while his father was vice president.

No evidence of wrongdoing has emerged. But Trump has blasted the Bidens as corrupt, and some Republicans have repeatedly labeled the younger Biden’s board position as a conflict of interest.

Biden’s unsteady performance has put some in the Democratic establishment on edge.

Is the situation alarming? ""Yeah,”former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who held a senior position in the Obama administration, told AFP.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/joe-biden--a-presidential-frontrunner-in-trouble.html

173,10-2-20,Miles to go,"While education and infrastructure have developed in Uttarakhand, healthcare needs urgent attention, says Narendra Singh Bisht

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Report 2019 released by the NITI Aayog indicates that there is still scope for large-scale improvement in the country’s healthcare. As per the report, health facilities in North Indian states are worse than that in South India. Facilities in the country’s largest states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, are pathetic. A close analysis would make one realise that health facilities are as important as the basic necessities. It is an integral requirement of every citizen. Since Independence, it has been given priority by all state governments as well as the centre. Despite this, the healthcare system in the country is in shambles. The condition of the district hospitals in some cities is so terrible that patients prefer to go to private hospitals even if they can hardly afford the cost of treatment.

The report paints an abysmal picture of the healthcare sector in Uttarakhand. It ranked 19th out of 21 States which were analysed. According to the report, there has been a decline in the sector by 5.02 points in the state in 2017-18 as compared to 2015-16. Certainly, a reason to be worried.

An example of this is Nainital. This beautiful hill station attracts millions of tourists every year. However, the city’s healthcare system is hardly up to the mark. It has become a serious subject not only for the city but also for the state. The health of its 50,000 residents is totally dependent on two government and a few private hospitals. The condition of government hospitals can be gauged from the figures where there’s only one doctor to attend to more than 150 patients every day. Additionally, they even take care of the administrative work.

A resident of Nainital, Rashid Zuberi’s child developed complications soon after birth. Water accumulated in the baby’s throat and needed to be removed. Due to lack of proper equipment at the government hospital, the doctors suggested shifting the child immediately to the Haldwani Government Medical College, which is 43.2 km from Nainital. Zuberi said that he had enough money to afford the last-minute shifting and proper treatment but there are many people who cannot afford this. And in several cases, if a patient’s condition deteriorates, they succumb to their illness during the journey. Moreover, shifting a patient in a hilly area is a huge challenge especially during an emergency. It’s worse during winters when there is snowfall.

Even if one reaches Haldwani, the irony is that the patient has to undergo all the tests again, which results in a loss of both money and time. Strangely, the hospital authorities pressurise the family members or the person accompanying the patient to repeat the tests and examinations at specified centres. One can only imagine the condition of rural areas if it is so deplorable in the cities. There are many villages in the state which are eight to 10 hours away from a basic health centre.

The patient and his/her attendants’ problems do not end here. For medicines, they are compelled to wander from one shop to the other. Medicines are rarely available at government medical stores. Often expensive medicines to treat serious illnesses have to be purchased from private medical stores. Although people have got some relief from the Jan Aushadhi Centres, for most of the expensive medicines they still depend on private medical stores.

Being healthy is the basic right of any person. It should be the government's priority and responsibility that proper treatment should be available to all. Everyone has the right to proper health facilities; especially people living in remote areas. This also means adequate number of doctors as well as capable staff along with proper infrastructure. At the centre, the government is running the world’s largest health scheme, Ayushman Bharat Yojana. But this scheme cannot be called successful unless it reaches all sections of the society, especially in rural areas and the economically-weaker people.

174,10-2-20,Partnering Setiawan was great learning experience for Chirag,"It was not an ideal start for Indian men’s doubles player Chirag Shetty after suffering two first-round exits in as many tournaments this year. But representing Pune 7 Aces in Premier Badminton League (PBL), where he partnered Hendra Setiawan, turned out to be a great experience for him ahead of the crucial Tokyo Olympic games.

However, their partnership, where the pair won six out of the seven games, wasn’t even enough to take Pune 7 Aces to its maiden final appearance as they were knocked out on Saturday after suffering 3-4 defeat against 2019 champions Bengaluru Raptors.

Speaking about the experience of playing alongside Indonesian great, Chirag said: “It could not have come at a better time. Learning from him by playing alongside helped me. As both of us are frontcourt players, so I have learnt quite a few things, mainly to keep calm while at the net,” he said about his partner, who won Gold in 2008 Beijing Olympic games besides having five World Championship medals (4 Gold and 1 Bronze) and is currently ranked second in men’s doubles world ranking.

“I learnt a different style of play because we are used to of playing in the same way and partnering him you get to see the other side of it as well,” he added.

Discussing what’s different in Setiawan’s and his partner Mohammad Ahsan style compared to him and his Indian doubles partner Satwiksairaj Rankiredddy. 2018 Commonwealth Games Gold medallist said, “I and Satwik play a lot more hard kind of games where we rely a lot more on our power game. Whereas Setiawan and Ahsan try to create openings and they keep the shuttle as low as possible. And if the shuttle is low, they will try to keep it at the net, they won’t lift it. So that is one thing I have been working on and avoid lifting the shuttle,” he said.

At World rank 10 and currently eighth in terms of points in Olympic qualification period which ends on April 30, Chirag-Satwik pair is almost certain to secure Tokyo berth becoming the first men’s pair to represent India in Olympics.

And Chirag wants to make sure that after confirming Olympic place, the pair work more on weak areas and prepare best for the Tokyo event.

“The primary target for us is just to qualify for the Olympics and once we are there, we will try to work more on our weak points and our fitness.”

“It is a continuous process, it doesn’t come in a day or two. There is always room for improvement and we are working a lot on our defence and some other areas as well that we want to better ourselves in,” he said when asked about the Olympic preparations.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/partnering-setiawan-was-great-learning-experience-for-chirag.html

The West Indian legend stroked a series of lofted cover drives and straight drives, including two sixes, before retiring to give another batsman a chance in a star-studded Bushfire Bash at Melbourne’s Junction Oval.

His captain Ricky Ponting, coming in after Justin Langer was out, also hit 26 as his team made 104 for five from their 10 overs.

177,10-2-20,Naseem breaks hat-trick record vs Tigers,"Teenage paceman Naseem Shah became the youngest player to record a Test hat-trick as Pakistan closed in on victory against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Sunday.

Just when Bangladesh seemed to have fought their way back into the match at 124-2, minutes before the close on the third day, Naseem destroyed them with three wickets off successive deliveries.

Aged 16 years and 359 days, he becomes the youngest player to record a Test hat-trick, besting Bangladeshi Alok Kapali who achieved the feat aged 19 in 2003.

Naseem trapped Najmul Hossain Shanto leg before off the fourth ball of his seventh over for 38, then followed up with dismissals of Taijul Islam (lbw) and Mahmudullah (caught) with the next two deliveries.

Naseem had figures of 4-26 before he left the field with a shoulder injury.

Shanto and Mominul Haque, unbeaten on 37 at the close, had added 71 for the third wicket after they lost Saif Hassan on 16 and Tamim Iqbal on 34.

At the close, Bangladesh were 126-6 and needing another 86 runs to avoid an innings defeat with two days to play.

Naseem, who burst onto the scene on Pakistan's Australia tour last year, is also the youngest fast bowler and second bowler overall to take five wickets in a Test innings.

He achieved that feat at 16 years and 307 days against Sri Lanka in Karachi last year.

‘Special talent'

“I wanted to do something that people remember about me and this is a special achievement for which I thank (the) Almighty,” Naseem said after the match.

“I can’ describe my feelings and the way (the) crowd (was) backing me up can’t be described in words.”

Pakistan’s Babar Azam, who scored 143 in the first innings of the Rawalpindi Test, praised Naseem.

“There is no doubt he is a special talent,” said Azam at the close of play. “It’s an outstanding achievement at this very young age and the best thing about him is that he bowls to the plan given to him.”

Pakistan were bowled out for 445 in their first innings. Saif, playing his first Test, was on a pair after his second-ball duck in the first innings but he started confidently to reach 16 with four boundaries before he was bowled by Naseem.

Iqbal, fresh from scoring the highest first-class score on Bangladeshi soil of 334 not out last week, was trapped leg-before by Yasir.

Earlier, Pakistan lost seven wickets either side of lunch with Sohail holding the innings together.

He struck seven fours and two sixes for his third Test half-century before holing out off spinner Taijul Islam to deep mid-wicket. Last man Naseem was run out to end Pakistan's first innings.

A 10,000-strong holiday crowd had come in anticipation of Azam scoring a double hundred. But resuming at 342-3, he was out to the first ball of the day, edging to Mohammad Mithun at first slip.

Azam's 143 was his fifth Test hundred and a masterclass of attractive batting, which included a six and 18 fours.

Asad Shafiq, who put on 137 for the fourth wicket with Azam, added just five to his overnight score before he was caught behind off fast bowler Ebadot Hossain for a 65 that included nine boundaries.

Jayed was the pick of the bowlers with 3-86 while Islam finished with 2-139.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/naseem-breaks-hat-trick-record-vs-tigers.html
178,10-2-20,Eng sneak home after late collapse,"England survived a late collapse to square the series when they beat South Africa by two wickets in the third and final one-day international at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.

England were cruising to victory at 232 for four after leg-spinner Adil Rashid and his fellow slow bowlers restricted South Africa to 256 for seven after they were sent in to bat.

But fast bowler Lungi Ngidi, who had endured a horror start to the innings, struck three times in quick succession as England lost four wickets for 20 runs before Moeen Ali got the winning runs.

South African captain Quinton de Kock praised the energy his inexperienced team had shown in the two completed matches, which were shared 1-1.

Man of the match Rashid, playing in his 100th one-day international but in his only appearance in the series, took three for 51, including the key wickets of Temba Bavuma and De Kock, who made 69.

After being under covers throughout Saturday because of heavy rain, the pitch helped the bowlers in South Africa's innings.

A nice wicket

There was movement through the air and off the surface for the new-ball bowlers, while offering turn for the spinners.

Twenty-seven overs were bowled by England’s spinners including 17 in tandem by Rashid and off-spinner Ali.

David Miller lifted South Africa’s hopes at the end of the innings with some powerful hitting in making 69 not out off 53 balls, dominating an unbeaten eighth wicket stand of 52 off 32 balls with Lutho Sipamla.

Jonny Bairstow slammed 43 off 23 balls as he and Jason Roy (21) got England off to a blazing start. Ngidi sent down three wides in his first over and was taken out of the attack after conceding 29 runs in two overs. He went for another 23 runs in a second spell of three overs before coming back strongly to take three for 11 in his final three overs.

Joe Denly shared partnerships of 76 with Joe Root (49) and 70 with Tom Banton (32) for the fourth and fifth wickets but the capacity crowd were lifted when Denly was caught in the deep off Ngidi for 66 and Banton fell in the next over to Beuran Hendricks.

Ngidi dismissed Tom Curran and Rashid before Ali completed England’s win. England will finish their tour with three Twenty20 internationals against South Africa, starting in East London on Wednesday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eng-sneak-home-after-late-collapse.html

Opening the batting along side skipper Hanuma Vihari (59), Gill scored his runs off 153 balls with the help of 13 boundaries and one six to help India A pile up 234/1 in 53 overs.

Middle-order mainstay Chesterwar Pujara was giving Gill company at the crease on 52 off 99 balls at the draw of stumps.

Earlier, New Zealand declared their innings at 386 for nine in 131.5 overs after the second day’s play was washed out on Saturday.

Daryl Mitchell remained unbeaten on 103 off 222 balls during which he struck 10 boundaries and a six.

Besides, Glenn Phllips made 65, while wicketkeeper Dane Clever scored 53.

For India, Sandeep Warrier (2/50), Mohammed Siraj (2/75), Avesh Khan (2/82) and veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin (2/98) shared eight wickets among them.

180,10-2-20,Vesley takes Tata title,"Czech star Jiri Vesely produced a dominating show to clinch his first ATP Tour title in five years with a 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 6-3 win over Belarusian Egor Gerasimov in the singles final at the third edition of Tata Open Maharashtra at Mhalunge Balewadi Stadium in Pune on Sunday. Velsely had won his last ATP Tour title in 2015 in Auckland.

Meanwhile, pair of Christopher Rungkat and Andre Goransson overcame Grand Slam champion Jonathan Erlich and Andrei Vasilevski 6-2, 3-6, 10-8 to clinch doubles crown for their maiden ATP Tour title.

The opening set of singles final saw Vesely facing tough challenge from Gerasimov before winning it 7-2 in the decider. However, eighth seeded Gerasimov, who became the third Belarusian player to enter ATP Tour singles final following victory over James Duckworth in the last-4 clash, made a comeback in the second set to take the summit clash into the third set.

Making a comeback after a setback, the former World No 35 Vesely scored three back-to-back points to start the decider with some exquisite hard-hitting strokes that left Gerasimov clueless before wrapping up the match to win first title in five years.

“I am very happy to come back in India and winning the tile. I thank the suporter. It’s been amazing support from the crowd here. I will look to continue the momentum in future tournament,” Vesely said after the match.

Earlier in the doubles final pair of Rungkat-Goransson, making first appearance at the South Asia’s only ATP Tour tournament, maintained their dominance that saw them dropping only two sets during their campaign in Pune.

After winning the first set, Rungkat-Goransson had to work hard as the former Australian Open champion Erlich won the second set and also presented strong challenge in the decider along with partner Vasilevski. However, playing fifth tournament together, Rungkat-Goransson made timely comeback into the tie-breaker to complete impressive win. “We were happy winning our first title, you could see at the end of the match I couldn’t believe it but it happened. We had very tight first round match after that we played really well,” Goransson said during a post-match press conference.

When asked about team coordination, Rungkat added: “In October last year I asked Andre through social media about partnership. I asked him whether he's keen to play tournaments in Asia at the end of the year in China and Japan. He was excited to come here. We started good coordination from there.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/vesley-takes-tata-title.html
181,10-2-20,Empower yourself spiritually,"Crime cannot be dealt with rules and regulations alone. We will lessen suffering and develop a corruption-free world when we awaken our true spiritual identity, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Corruption” has consistently grabbed headlines in the Indian media in recent times. Scams, central agency probes, public protests and anti-corruption agitations have kept the topic alive in all sections of media, government and in public and private discussions. There has been enormous pressure on the government by civil rights activists to create a strong anti-corruption law and implement it aggressively across the country.

However, in this whole struggle, we tend to forget that corruption cannot be dealt with activism and political awareness alone. Laws and regulations cannot deter humans from indulging in follies of character and moral values. It is like pruning or cutting the stems and branches that will eventually sprout again and proliferate in more directions. Such laws can surely deter people in high public offices from indulging in heinous acts of bribery, fraud and corruption, shameless, but it cannot root out the evil.

So what is it that makes a man corrupt? Is it power, status, wealth or lack of certain amenities? The genesis of corruption is not to be found in any external circumstance, it actually lies in the psyche or the character of the human soul. It begins with a desire that tempts one to have, acquire and grab more money, assets, power and fame to gain happiness. Once it begins, it creates a vicious circle that keeps feeding itself with more desire and indulgence.

This blind chase is supported by the temporary feeling of being powerful which is followed by emptiness, insecurity and despair that further drives a person to commit more such acts of corruption. All this begins from the fundamental ignorance about the true identity of self. Because we believe our self-worth depends on money, role, status, fame or authority that we strive to create more identities based on that. With time, these fabricated means of self-worth fall apart. Due to that fear, we put all our efforts in strengthening and protecting such false support systems because we feel we are nobody if all these identities are taken away from us.

From a spiritual perspective, it is said that vices like greed, ego, lust, anger and attachment are all born out of body consciousness, that is the false identification of the self with one’s physical image, role and assets. It is this ignorance and vice that begin to corrupt the soul, its thoughts, feelings, actions and habits.

In that sense, one can say that today, almost all human souls have become corrupt to some extent. Hence, we must understand that corruption is a soul-deep malady and can be remedied only by spiritual awareness and empowerment. We must awaken our true self and live by values of peace, purity, love and joy. Today, we do not experience such enriching qualities because we are always seeking them outside ourselves. When we look inwards and become aware of our true identity and innate qualities, we begin to express and experience them in our lives naturally. A person who empowers himself this way, experiences contentment in life. Such a person will never fall in the trap of sensory attractions and desires. It’s only when we are disconnected from our innate self that we feel empty inside and get attracted to external objects to feel happy or important. In soul consciousness stage, we are naturally aware of our virtues and we also understand the law of cause and effect — the law of karma.

Remember! A soul that is aware of its spiritual identity will never indulge in corrupt actions as it knows that they will lead to suffering and degradation. This realisation and experience will free the world from corruption.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/empower-yourself-spiritually-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/empower-yourself-spiritually.html
182,10-2-20,Make better choices,"Extreme weather has gardeners looking for resilient plants

Fiercer and more frequent natural disasters in recent years have many homeowners re-evaluating their landscaping. Many are restocking with trees and plants more resilient in the face of storms, fires and flooding.

Scientists link the higher frequency of severe weather events to climate change. There are some steps home gardeners can take.

“Protect your property from wind and wildfires by checking tree and shrub species for winds and flammability before using them around the home,” said Mark Tancig, a horticulturist with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS). “Native tree species are more adaptive to diseases and insects. They also tend to be more aerodynamic, making them a better bet for surviving high winds,” Tancig added.

Avoid trees with delicate wood that breaks apart easily in severe weather. Small species that mature below the strongest wind gusts are better choices in urban and suburban landscapes than taller ones, said Theresa Badurek, another UF-IFAS horticulturist.

“Trees that grow very quickly usually have brittle wood. Slow and steady wins this race,” Badurek said. Trees with shallow or damaged roots are prone to blow over. “Don’t cut the roots of a tree for sidewalks, driveways or patios. Work around them,” she said.

People living in the Gulf and Mid-Atlantic states contend with hurricanes, while those in the West cope with wildfires. Thunderstorms, tornadoes and flooding cause most of the destruction in the nation’s interior and then there’s the damage caused by lightning, hail, icing, mud and landslides — events that can occur almost anywhere.

“If mature trees are damaged, rotting or dying back, hire a certified arborist to prescribe preventive pruning or removal and replacement before the next big storm,” Badurek said.

Lightning strikes are an unpredictable and explosive natural hazard. “Tall trees can be damaged or killed by lightning,” Badurek said. “Lightning can jump from trees into nearby homes and utilities.” To help minimise losses, install lightning rods toward the top of your highest-value trees and ground the coils, Tancig said.

People facing wildfire damage should create defensible space around their homes. Close-in areas should be free of brush, debris and firewood, have irrigated sections nearby and include an abundance of fire-resistant plants. No plant is fireproof, but many are fire-resistant. These are plants with supple leaves without waxy or resinous surfaces, said Amy Jo Detweiler, a horticulturist with Oregon State University Extension.

Proven fire-resistant plant species include daylilies, coneflowers, coreopsis, lavender and high-moisture succulents. Lilacs and hedging roses make good shrubs for wildfire country while hardwood varieties like maples, poplar and cherry are safer choices among trees. Avoid landscaping using conifers with wood containing flammable waxes, fats or oils.

Although fire-resistant plant varieties might still be damaged or killed in wildfires, their foliage and stems don’t significantly fuel the fires’ intensity, Detweiler said.

Some other OSU Extension precautions include:",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/make-better-choices-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/make-better-choices.html
183,10-2-20,Leverkusen win seven-goal thriller,"Leon Bailey scored one late goal and made another on Saturday as Bayer Leverkusen earned a stunning 4-3 win over Borussia Dortmund to deny the visitors the chance to move level on points with Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.

Jamaica winger Bailey came on for the final 20 minutes with his side 3-2 down and after slotting home the equaliser with nine minutes left, the Jamaican winger’s audacious backheel seconds later led to Lars Bender heading in Leverkusen’s dramatic winner.

The defeat for Dortmund, which leaves them third on 39 points, was also the first time teenager prodigy Erling Braut Haaland failed to score after hitting eight goals in his first four games for his new club.

Leverkusen are now fifth, two points off the Champions League places.

“We have problems, we’re conceding too many goals,” fumed Dortmund’s Swiss coach Lucien Favre.

“We have to control the situations better and play smarter.”

The goals flew at the BayArena with three disallowed efforts on top of the two Kevin Volland also scored for Leverkusen.

Volland put Leverkusen ahead on 20 minutes by firing home with his second touch, but Hummels equalised almost immediately by heading home a corner.

Emre Can put Dortmund 2-1 up with a rifled finish in the 33rd minute before German Volland levelled just before the break.

Dortmund took the lead again in the 65th minute when Achraf Hakimi started a move which released left-back Raphael Guerreiro, who drove his shot home.

The scene was set for Bailey, who had a goal disallowed soon after coming on, but was not to be denied.

After asweeping home a goal of his own on 81 minutes, he back-heeled to Dutch midfielder Daley Sinkgraven who crossed for Bender to nod in the winner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/leverkusen-win-seven-goal-thriller.html
184,10-2-20,Icing on the cake,"Gareth Bale came back into the team and Real Madrid came back to beat Osasuna on Sunday as a 4-1 victory in Pamplona strengthened their hold on top spot in La Liga.

Bale had been left out completely for Madrid’s previous four matches but the Welshman returned to the squad and the starting line-up at El Sadar, in a surprise show of faith from coach Zinedine Zidane.

A fortuitious deflection meant Bale assisted Isco’s equaliser too before Sergio Ramos put Madrid in front after Unai Garcia had given Osasuna an early lead.

Substitutes Lucas Vazquez and Luka Jovic then scored from late breaks as Madrid pulled six points clear of Barcelona, who play away at Real Betis later on Sunday.

Barca’s exit in the Copa del Rey overshadowed Madrid’s own shock defeat at home to Real Sociedad in the quarter-finals, a loss that brought a dramatic end to their 21-match unbeaten run.

But Zidane will be relieved to see his team swiftly back on track with a performance full of the kind of resilience that Madrid’s rivals have so lacked in recent weeks.

Bale also keeps coming back under Zidane and the 30-year-old had chances to add a goal to a spirited display before going off to a decent reception from the away support in the second half.

185,10-2-20,Ver on a roll,"Cristiano Ronaldo on Saturday became the first Juventus player to score in 10 successive Serie A games but the champions fell 2-1 at Hellas Verona to leave an opening to their title rivals.

Ronaldo — who turned 35 this week — broke through after 65 minutes, to hit his 15th goal in 10 games and take his league tally to 20.

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is closing in on the all-time Serie A record of scoring in 11 consecutive games held by Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella.

But Juventus paid for defensive errors with Fabio Borini pulling Verona level with quarter of an hour to go, before veteran striker Giampaolo Pazzini won the match for the promoted side from the penalty spot four minutes from time following a Leonardo Bonucci handball.

Juventus are three points ahead of Inter Milan, who have a chance to pull level when they take on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s AC Milan in derby clash at the San Siro.

The defeat was the third this season for Maurizio Sarri’s side but second in three games after losing 2-1 at Napoli just two weeks ago.

“We have to understand that winning is not a foregone conclusion,” blasted Sarri.

“We need to get it into our heads that we can’t have lapses in concentration as happened this evening.

“We dropped points through carelessness.”

Verona meanwhile are up to sixth after extending their unbeaten run to eight games days after earning a creditable goalless draw at Lazio, who can pull to within a point of Juve with a win at Parma.

“We’ve created a group of hungry kids,” said Verona coach Ivan Juric.

“Heart played a big role, the lads were tired but they gave it everything.”

Napoli have suffered a 3-2 home defeat by underdogs Lecce, stumbling in their chase for the European places in the Italian Serie A.

187,10-2-20,Raptors make it two in a row,"Raptors created history to become the first-ever team to successfully defend their title as the Star Sports Premier Badminton League 2020 concluded at the GMC Balayogi SATS Indoor Stadium in Hyderabad on Sunday.

World Championships Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth and World No 2 Tai Tzu Ying led the Bengaluru Raptors from the front before the mixed doubles pair of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won sealed the 4-2 win over the North Eastern Warriors, who were in the final for the very first time.

With the two teams locked at 2-2 in the overall tie after the first the three matches, it was left to their respective mixed doubles pairs to push them ahead.

Bengaluru’s Trump pair of Olympic Silver medallist Chan Peng Soon and two-time World Championships medallist Eom Hye Won showed their vast experience to pull off a 15-14, 14-15, 15-12 win over the Warriors’ Krishna Prasad Garaga and former World No 1 Kim Ha Na and bag the tie for the Raptors.

Soon and Won showed nerves of steel to eke out the tight first game. In a topsy-turvy second game, the Warriors pair led 6-4 before facing a match point which they saved to take match into a decider.

The Raptors pair regained control in the deciding game to race ahead to 8-2. They held off a late surge from the blue brigade, who came within one point of the Raptors at 11-12 and went on to grab the win.

Having lost to the 2020 Indonesia Masters semi-finalist in their solitary league face-off this season, Sai needed to find his best form against the World No18 Lee Cheuk Yiu. The World No 11, who was upset by the 73rd ranked Kazumasa Sakai of the Pune 7 Aces in the semi-finals on Saturday, began on the backfoot as the two were involved in a highly competitive opening game that tested the grit and resolve of both. Lee edged Sai 15-14 but that woke up the champion in the former Singapore Open winner.

Sai, who has fond memories of winning the PBL title last year with the Raptors, found his aggression just in time to turn around the match. By injecting more pace and power into his shots, the Bengaluru shuttler grabbed the second game 15-9 and kept the momentum going to take a mind-blowing 11-1 lead in the decider. With Lee peppering the court with unforced errors, it did not take Sai much time to finish the comeback with a 14-15, 15-9, 15-3 victory.

With a 7-2 head-to-head record over the World No 10 Michelle Li on the BWF World Tour, World No 2 Tai Tzu Ying came prepared to tackle the Warriors shuttler with her deception and finesse. Li kept struggling to read Tai’s game in the opening game as the Chinese Taipei ace surged to a 15-9 lead.

The second game turned out to be way more competitive with the aggressive Canadian using her brilliant footwork to put her formidable opponent out of position. From a 1-4 deficit, Li stormed back to level matters at 7-7 and even wrested the lead to go up to 9-8 with the Raptors ace fumbling at the net.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/raptors-make-it-two-in-a-row.html
188,10-2-20,Extra careless India lose cup,"A sprightly bunch of Bangladesh boys created history by winning their country’s first global cricket title, shocking defending champions India by three wickets in the summit clash of the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Sunday.

In a low-scoring final, Bangladesh first choked India to a meagre 177 in 47.2 overs and then did well enough to score revised target of 170 in 42.1 overs under Duckworth-Lewis method.

Once play resumed after rain, target was revised to 170 and with seven runs to get and three wickets in hand, it became a cakewalk for the ‘Tiger Cubs’ as they scripted a golden chapter in their country's cricket history.

India's cricketing battles with Bangladesh have been filled with acrimony since 2015 World Cup quarter-final at the MCG and it had only amplified with the kind of boorish behaviour that some of the Bangladeshi players displayed.

On Sunday also, a few players from both sides nearly came to blows at the end of the game and it was India coach Paras Mhambrey, who was seen urging his boys to keep calm as opposition leading pacer Shoriful Islam was seen swearing expletives on camera.

Even then, credit should go Bangladesh's 18-year-old captain Akbar Ali, who showed nerves of steel with a patient 43 not out off 77 balls, which negated more fancied opponent Yashasvi Jaiswal's 88 off 121 balls.

Akbar’s cool quotient was there for everyone to see as he marshalled his resources brilliantly and then batted responsibly, seeing out India's threats from leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi and fast bowler Kartik Tyagi’s spells before reaching the finishing line with ease.

There were two things that cost India dearly. While batting, India lost their last seven wickets for 23 runs. And then while defending, the number of extras (33) bowled did matter in the final context of the game.

Bangladesh's chase started in earnest with Parvez Hossain Emon (47 off 79 balls) and Tanzid Hasan (17) adding 50 in quick time, primarily due to former's impressive off-side play.

However, things changed once leg-spinner Bishnoi (4/30 in 10 overs) came into the attack and started bowling his googlies.

First he got Tanzid holed out in the deep and then had Mahmudul Hassan Joy (8) played on with another wrong 'un and Towhid Hridoy was also rapped on the pads and Dhruv Jurel effected a smart stumping to make it 65 for 4.

With Emon back in the hut due to hamstring injury, it was on skipper Akbar to show composure in the hour of crisis even as left-arm seamer Sushant Singh in his second and third spell got a couple of wickets.

Then, it was Emon who again came back at 102 for 6 as Akbar finally got hold of Bishnoi’s googlies as there was one slog sweep for six. With Bishnoi not having an effective leg-break, he was taken out of the attack.

Emon, despite hamstring issues, fought gamely before Jaiswal bowled his part-time leg-breaks and Garg’s gamble paid off with the opener being caught in the extra cover region to make it 143 for 7.

Earlier, India’s batting wilted under pressure as a superb Bangladesh bowling attack shot the defending champions out for a paltry 177 in 47.2 overs.

Jaiswal (88 off 121 balls) was once again a standout performer but not for once did he look like dominating the Bangladesh bowling unit whose new ball bowlers Shoriful Islam (2/31 in 10 overs) and Tanzim Hasan Shakib (2/28 in 8.2 overs) literally stifled the Indians for runs.

The third seamer Avishek Das (3/40 in 9 overs) was the most successful bowler in terms of figures but it was Shoriful's first spell with channelised aggression that put the Indians on the back-foot from the onset.

Only 23 came off the first 10 overs and India never recovered from the slow start despite a sedate 93-run stand between Jaiswal and NT Tilak Verma (38 off 65 balls) in 23.2 overs.

Shoriful and Shakib were not afraid of sledging the Indian batsmen as they bowled full and got the ball to swing away from the left-handers. The fielding was also agile and top-notched, making it difficult throughout the Indian innings.

Once Jaiswal was out, the distinct lack of match-time for other Indian batsmen was evident as seven wickets fell for only 23 runs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/extra-careless-india-lose-cup-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/extra-careless-india-lose-cup.html

190,10-2-20,Govt to make statement on SC ruling on quota in promotion,"The government will make a statement in Lok Sabha on the Supreme Court ruling on reservation in promotions for SC/STs, Deputy Leader of the House Rajnath Singh said on Monday amid Opposition protests over the ruling.

As soon as the Question Hour started, Opposition members, led by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, sought to raise the issue. He was also joined by members from other parties, including the DMK.

However, Speaker Om Birla told them that the matter can be raised during the Zero Hour, saying that the Question Hour was ""important"".

The recent Supreme Court ruling is a ""sensitive issue"" and the Social Justice and Empowerment Minister would make a statement on the subject in the House, Singh, who is also the Defence Minister, said.

Thaawarchand Gehlot is helming the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry.

The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no fundamental right to claim reservation in promotion for SCs, STs and OBCs in government jobs.

Birla requested protesting members to raise the issue during the Zero Hour and wondered why they want to lower the dignity of the House.

When one of the members remarked that the Constitution itself was under threat, the Speaker said, the Constitution was not under threat but the dignity of the House was.

The Speaker also emphasised that he does not want to stop any member or minister from raising issues but that the Question Hour was important.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi met senior ministers this morning in his Parliament House office. Though such meetings are routine during Parliament sessions, Monday's meet assumes importance in the backdrop of the court ruling.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde took strong exception to some of the lawyers opposing the court's taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the matter.

""Can a 4-month-old child be taking part in such protests,"" the bench asked women lawyers appearing in the matter.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said it was not correct that minors like the 4-month infant should be taken to the protest site.

The apex court took suo motu cognisance of the matter following a letter written to it by a national bravery award winner Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, who said that minors be barred from participating in any type of protest and agitation.

The top court issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi government seeking their responses on the issue.

The bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, expressed anguish over the two women lawyers who made a statement that children who participated in the protests have been dubbed as 'Pakistani' and 'anti-nationals' in their schools.

""We do not want people to use this platform to further create problems,"" the bench said, expressing unhappiness that the lawyers were deviating from the main issue it taken cognisance of.

""We are not considering either CAA or NRC. We are not considering the abuses like Pakistani hurled in schools, the bench said.

The bench made it clear that it was not stifling anybody's voice.

""We are not stifling any voice. This is a properly constituted suo motu proceedings by the Supreme Court of India,"" the bench said.

194,10-2-20,Anti-CAA protesters scuffle with cops as march from Jamia to Parliament stopped,"Scores of Jamia Millia students and residents of Jamia Nagar on Monday got into a scuffle with police after they were stopped from carrying an anti-CAA march towards Parliament.

The protest call was given by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), an organisation of Jamia students and alumni.

Despite repeated appeals from the police and the varsity authorities, the protesters refused to end their agitation. Police said the protesters did not have permission to march towards Parliament.

Amid heavy deployment of security personnel in and around the university, the protesters, including several women, began their march from Jamia's gate no 7.

The protesters raised slogans like ""Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge' (We will not show documents) and ""Jab Nahi Dare Hum Goron Se Toh Kyun Dare Hum Auron Se"" (When we did not fear the British, why should we fear others).

Men formed a human chain on either sides of roads as women walked ahead, waving the tricolour and raising slogans of ""Halla Bol"".

""It has been two months since we are protesting. No one from the government has come to talk to us, so we want to go to talk to them,"" said burqa-clad Zeba Anhad.

A scuffle ensued as policemen tried to stop the protesters. Many of them jumped over barricades to continue their march towards Parliament.

Jamia Millia Islamia proctor Waseem Ahmed Khan appealed to the students to disperse and not meddle with the police. ""The message has been sent. I request students in the crowd to go back to the university. Respect the law and peacefully go back,"" he urged the students.

The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before 2015 to escape religious persecution there.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in the country.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone's citizenship.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/anti-caa-protesters-scuffle-with-cops-as-march-from-jamia-to-parliament-stopped-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/anti-caa-protesters-scuffle-with-cops-as-march-from-jamia-to-parliament-stopped.html
195,10-2-20,Indian envoy describes evacuation of Indians from virus-hit Wuhan logistical nightmare,"India's efforts to evacuate its citizens from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province and its capital Wuhan was a logistical nightmare since the entire operation had to be done in a region sealed from all sides, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri said on Monday.

As the news of the outbreak began emerging in the middle of January, the Indian Embassy stepped up efforts to locate hundreds of Indians, mainly students, residing hundreds of kilometres apart in Hubei province and Wuhan - the epicentre of the virus outbreak, Misri said.

It was a logistical nightmare as data had to be collected about Indians stranded in the virus-hit areas while many left for home for the Chinese New Year holidays, he told PTI here.

India issued its first travel advisory on January 17 which was followed by more stringent measures including cancellation of visas for Chinese and foreigners travelled to China as the virus grew more virulent.

Misri said the embassy had to first locate the Indian citizens in Hubei province, establish contacts with them, receive their consent for a 14-day quarantine, followed by the most difficult part of the operation - to get approvals from China's central, provincial and local governments as the city and province were locked down from January 23.

Ahead of the first Air India flight on February 1, the mission sent two of its diplomats - Deepak Padma Kumar and M Balakrishnan - to Wuhan by road through Changsha city despite travel bans and fears of the virus.

Then a large number of buses were hired, permits procured in areas under lock down to transport them to the airport which turned out to be a massive exercise. The airport was closed from January 23 besides all local transportation.

The operations to get permission to operate buses and send them to 40 odd locations to pick up waiting Indians were coordinated by Acquino Vimal, the deputy ambassador, and Priyanka Sohoni, First Secretary (Political) in the mission.

In some areas, roads were dug up to prevent people's movement and entire operation to pick up the students on both the days had to be conducted from the control room in the embassy hundreds of miles away, Misri said.

But 10 Indians could not make it to the flight as they were not allowed by the Chinese immigration officials to board the plane because they had high body temperatures.

Air India's B747 made two flights to Wuhan city - the ground zero of the coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 900 people, infected 40,000 others and spread to 25 countries, including India, the US and the UK.

In the first flight, 324 Indians were evacuated and another 323 Indians and seven Maldivian citizens were flown back in the second flight.

Sri Lanka and Bangladesh also evacuated their citizens through special flights. Several hundred Pakistani students are held up still in the virus-hit areas as their government has declined to evacuate them ignoring their pleas.

Misri said that about 80 Indians were still in Hubei and the embassy is in touch with them through e-mail, social media and phone calls.

The embassy has received 28,000 emails and receives about 100 calls a day from Indians who were stranded in Wuhan and Hubei province and has been coordinating with the Chinese officials to ensure proper supplies to them.

About chances of their evacuation, Misri said the embassy is exploring all avenues.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-envoy-describes-evacuation-of-indians-from-virus-hit-wuhan-logistical-nightmare-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/indian-envoy-describes-evacuation-of-indians-from-virus-hit-wuhan-logistical-nightmare.html
196,10-2-20,India skipper says Bangladesh's reaction was 'dirty' following U-19 triumph,"India captain Priyam Garg has called the aggressive celebration of Bangladesh players as ""dirty"" following their maiden title triumph at the Under-19 World Cup here.

Some of the Bangladeshi players got carried away with their celebration after their historic win over India in the final here on Sunday.

While their captain Akbar Ali apologised for the ""unfortunate incident"", his Indian counterpart Garg felt it is something that should not have happened.

""We were easy. We think it's part and parcel of the game - you win some and you lose some. But their reaction was dirty. I think it shouldn't have happened. But it's okay,"" Garg was quoted as saying by Cricinfo.

Even when the match on, Bangladesh players were overtly aggressive while fielding with their lead pacer Shoriful Islam sledging the Indian batsmen after every delivery.

In fact as Bangladesh approached the winning runs, Shoriful was seen swearing multiple times on camera.

However, his skipper Ali showed maturity beyond his age to apologise on behalf of the players.

""What happened, it should not [have] happened. I don't know what exactly happened. I didn't ask what was going on. But, you know, in the final, emotion can come out, and sometimes the boys were getting pumped, and emotions were coming through.

""As a youngster, it shouldn't happen. In any position, in any manner, we have to show the respect to the opponent, we should have respect for the game. Cricket is known for being a gentleman's game. So I'll say, I'll be sorry for my team,"" said Ali, who scored an unbeaten 43 in a high-pressure situation.

Over the past two years, both teams were involved in close games with India getting the better of them on two important occasions -- the Asia Cup final and tri-series final last year.

""I'll say India-Bangladesh rivalry bring the part, and before the World Cup final, we lost the Asia Cup final to them a couple of months ago. So I think the boys are really pumped up and take a revenge. I won't say it should have happened, but I will be sorry for my side,"" said Ali.

It will also deal with the extent of judicial review with regard to religious practices and the meaning of ""sections of Hindus"" occurring in article 25 (2)(b) of the Constitution.

201,10-2-20,Gargi College molestation: Students hold protest; Delhi Police launches probe,"Four days after a group of men broke into the all-women Gargi College and allegedly groped, harassed and molested students, Delhi Police on Monday registered a complaint as hundreds of students protested demanding strict action against the intruders.

The outrage of Gargi students following the attacks during their college festival Reverie on February 6 found wide echo with students from other colleges sharing their anguish, political parties speaking out and the issue being raised in Parliament.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed the incident ""extremely unfortunate"" while Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' said those involved in the act were outsiders and the college administration has been asked to take strict action against them.

The Delhi units of the BJP and the Congress united on a common platform with both asking that the culprits be arrested at the earliest.

Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal also reached the college, in the Siri Fort area in the heart of south Delhi, to take stock of the situation. The DCW issued a notice the college and the Delhi Police for ""inaction"".

Fighting allegations that the college administration turned a deaf ear to their complaints and did nothing, Gargi College Principal Promila Kumar said a general body meeting was held with the students and the matter amicably resolved.

""The college has filed a police complaint and has also set up an internal inquiry committee to look into the matter and speak to complainants. The police have begun their probe and are collecting footage,"" she told PTI.

The students alleged that the men, in their 30s and drunk, groped and dragged girls and performed obscene acts, while security and Delhi Police personnel stood by like mute spectators.

Reliving the nightmare of the men gatecrashing into what they considered their safe space, a student said there was complete lapse of security.

""The students were groped, molested and even assaulted by the men. The college claimed to have made security arrangements. I don't think such an incident has taken place on any college campus across the country,"" she said.

Requesting anonymity, a political science student added that some men jumped over the gates while others jumped over walls.

""They were drunk and went berserk. Some girls ran towards washrooms, but the men followed them and locked them inside,"" she added.

The students alleged that they were threatened by the intruders, who also made objectionable remarks and used cuss words.

They also claimed that auto drivers, who had parked their vehicles outside the main gate of the college, also entered the campus.

""The college had hired bouncers for security. The security personnel were also standing right there and watching it all. My friend, who was molested, rushed to a security guard and pleaded him for help but he did not move,"" a student said.

Their ordeal aggravated after the college refused to take cognisance of the incident, the students alleged.

""The next day, on February 7, we took up the matter with teachers and the college management. The management said they had taken note of it. They didn't promise to take any action, after which many students shared their horrific experiences on Instagram,"" a B.Sc student added.

According to Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (south), a case has been registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrong­ful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

He said the case will be investigated by Inspector Pratibha Sharma, Crime Against Women Cell of south District.

Police are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras to collect evidence and speaking to students to ascertain facts, the officer said.

Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who raised the issue in the Lok Sabha, said sexual harassment and bullying often takes place in many higher education institutions and action should be taken in such incidents.

""What happened in Gargi festival is disgusting! Such festivals are opportunities to celebrate the cultural diversity & talent in Delhi. But the obvious anti-social elements saw this festival as another chance to inflict harassment & violence on students!"" said Kejriwal.

Left-group AIDWA alleged that the Citizenship Amendment Act supporters were involved in the ""molestation"" of students.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gargi-college-molestation--students-hold-protest--delhi-police-launches-probe-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/gargi-college-molestation--students-hold-protest--delhi-police-launches-probe.html

The apex court further said that the protest at Shaheen Bagh is going on for long but it cannot create inconvenience for others.

The bench said it would not pass any direction without hearing the other side and posted the matter for February 17.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-says-protestors-at-shaheen-bagh-can-t-block-public-roads--create-inconvenience-for-others-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-says-protestors-at-shaheen-bagh-can-t-block-public-roads--create-inconvenience-for-others.html

A Naxal was also died in the gun-battle, they said.

The gunfight started around 10.30 am in a forest in Irapalli village under Pamed police station limits, located over 400km from here, when security forces were out on a counter-insurgency operation, a senior CRPF official said.

The patrolling team of 204th battalion of CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA - an elite unit of CRPF) had launched the operation on Sunday evening from Tippapuram camp in forests along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts, he said.

When security personnel were advancing through Irapalli forest, they came under fire from Naxals, triggering a fierce gun-battle between the two sides, he said.

""Two constables - Vikas Kumar and Purnand Sahu - were killed in the gunfight, while six others, including an officer, sustained injuries"", he said.

While Kumar was a native of Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, Sahu hailed from Rajnandgaon district in Chhattisgarh.

204,10-2-20,India’s kabaddi team Pak visit stirs row,"Have not given clearance to any athlete for competing in Pakistan: Sports Ministry

The arrival of an ‘Indian team’ in Pakistan for the World Kabaddi Championship has kicked up a controversy with the Sports Ministry and the national federation claiming that they have not given clearance to any athlete for competing in the neighbouring country.

A contingent from India reached Lahore on Saturday via the Wagah Border to take part in the championship, being hosted by Pakistan for the first time. The pictures and footage of the Indians arriving in Lahore have surfaced in social media. The tournament opens on Monday at the Punjab Football Stadium in Lahore followed by some matches which will also be held in Faisalabad and Gujrat.

A Sports Ministry source said the Government has not granted permission to any athlete to travel to Pakistan for the event. “The Sports Ministry and the Ministry of External Affairs have not granted any permission to any team, which is mandatory while representing the country at any international event,” a Sports Ministry source told PTI on condition of anonymity. The administrator of Amateur Kabbadi Federation of India (AKFI) Justice (Retd) S P Garg also said the national body has not cleared any such team.

“We have no information about any Kabbadi team which has gone to Pakistan. No permission was ever granted by AKFI to any team to go to Pakistan and play any Kabbadi match there,” he said.

“We came to know about it only after information was sought. AKFI does not support any such activity. Legal action may be taken against the defaulters,” he added. The procedure for participation at overseas events is that the national federation will communicate to the sports ministry which in turn will write to the MEA for political clearance and Home Ministry for security clearance, irrespective of whether the government is funding the contingent or not.

AKFI is currently being run by administrator, Justice (retd) Garg, after the Delhi High Court had struck down it elections held in 2018.

Pakistan Punjab Minister for Sports Rai Taimoor Khan Bhatti welcomed the ‘Indian contingent’ at a Lahore hotel.

The officials of the Pakistan Kabaddi Federation welcomed and garlanded the Indian players when they crossed into Pakistan from Wagah border from where they were taken in a security convoy to their hotel in Lahore.

All the six previous editions of the World Kabbadi Champinship took place in India between 2010 and 2019. India have won all six championships, defeating Pakistan in the 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 editions.

Pakistani organisers said that teams from Australia, England, Germany, Iran, Azerbaijan, Sierra Leone, Kenya and Canada are also taking part in the event.

The winner of the tournament will get 10 million rupees, while the runner ups will get 7.5 million rupees.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india---s-kabaddi-team-pak-visit-stirs-row-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india---s-kabaddi-team-pak-visit-stirs-row.html
205,10-2-20,Momentum of India-US trade moving in favour of America: Mukesh Aghi,"The momentum of the bilateral trade between India and the US is moving in favour of Washington, mainly due to the sudden increase in energy import by New Delhi, the head of a top India-centric American trade and strategic advocacy group has said.

Noting that the India-US trade has gone up from USD 142 billion in 2018 to USD 160 in 2019, President of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) Mukesh Aghi said that the energy import by India from the US had shot up dramatically.

""If you look at three years ago, it was almost zero. Now as of last year's cross USD 6 billion, and we expect this to cost USD 10 billion this fiscal year. So, the momentum is moving in favour of US,"" Aghi told PTI.

He said the bilateral trade numbers were going up without the trade deal and when the big ticket items such as Boeing planes were not being delivered.

India's private air carrier Spice Jet has placed an order for 200 planes to Boeing. As such, the trade numbers would go up significantly, once the delivery of the planes kicks in motion.

Aghi said that even after the US withdrew India's GSP privileges, the export in that sector had not slowed down.

""In fact, that is up another five per cent,"" he said.

The momentum on the bilateral trade continues even as a trade deal between the two countries is still being negotiated. There are a few issues that need to be sorted out, he said, hoping that there will be more mature response from both sides as time goes by.

""You will have differences. But at the same time, I think we'll find a solution. I don't think there are very many open issues. It's just matters of trying to cross the T's and make sure the dots are in the right places so you can move forward,"" he said.

From the US export environment, Aghi said the energy sector - ranging from gas, LNG, and even high-quality coal - was taking the lead in the India-US bilateral trade.

""From the US side, scientific products, energy, planes, and defence, will keep on fuelling the growth,"" he said.

""From Indian side, you will definitely see low-end stuff like jewelry and leather and other garments coming into the US. But we also see services, especially the IT services. They will cut you to grow regardless of what … H-1B, the demand for that, those services is at the moment fuelling quite a bit. And that's fuelling is coming because of the growth of the economy also,"" he said.

Aghi asserted that American companies continued to be bullish on India and will continue with their investment in the country.

They are showing a substantial growth on the current base itself and are also gaining the market share, he added.

However, Aghi said the American companies continue to be challenged by ease of doing business environment in India, in particular at the State level.

While there has been market improvement in the World Bank's ranking in ease of doing business, which is basically based on parameters in major cities like Mumbai and New Delhi, companies continue to require a number of permits for opening their businesses in States, where the manufacturing is going to be set up.

""The other big issue is a transparent and predictable policy. That's important to have. Because classic example is people are saying, we invested in Andhra Pradesh, a change of government, reversed everything. So today, a lot of companies which are invested are struggling with the change in policy.

If you have a contract, those contracts have to be honoured regardless of change of the government. To me, that's very critical, if you're going to bring that strong sentiment of confidence among US companies to come invest in India,"" Aghi said.

The court system has to play a much more ""efficient and effective role"" and there has to be ""maturity on part of politicians"" that you attracted a strong investment and you can't overturn because of political reasons, he said.

""Yes, if there's some bribery or some other issues then we absolutely agree with that. But if a company has gone through a proper transparent process, then to reverse that sends a wrong message,"" Aghi said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/momentum-of-india-us-trade-moving-in-favour-of-america--mukesh-aghi-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/momentum-of-india-us-trade-moving-in-favour-of-america--mukesh-aghi.html

""We are observing 138 people across the state, including in Bengaluru,"" the department's Communicable Diseases Wing Joint Director Prakash Kumar told IANS.

Though no coronavirus-positive case has been reported from Karnataka so far, four persons have been admitted in state hospital under medical observation, Kumar confirmed.

207,10-2-20,Improved handwashing at airports may reduce spread of infectious diseases: Study,"Improving the rates of handwashing by travellers passing through just 10 of the world's leading airports could significantly reduce the spread of many infectious diseases, including the novel coronavirus, according to a study.

The greater the improvement in people's handwashing habits at airports, the more dramatic the effect on slowing the disease, said researchers, including those from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US.

The findings, which deal with infectious diseases in general including the flu, were published in late December, just before the recent coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China.

However, the study, published in the journal Risk Analysis, could apply to any such disease, and are relevant to the current outbreak, the researchers noted.

People can be surprisingly casual about washing hands even in crowded locations like airports, they said.

Travellers from different parts of the world are touching surfaces such as chair armrests, check-in kiosks, security checkpoint trays, and restroom doorknobs and faucets, the researchers said.

Based on data from previous research by groups, including the American Society for Microbiology, the team estimated that on average, only about 20 per cent of people in airports have clean hands -- meaning they have been washed with soap and water, for at least 15 seconds, within the last hour or so.

The other 80 per cent are potentially contaminating everything they touch with whatever germs they may be carrying, the researchers said.

""Seventy per cent of the people who go to the toilet wash their hands afterwards,"" said Professor Christos Nicolaides from the University of Cyprus.

""The other 30 per cent don't. And of those that do, only 50 per cent do it right,"" said Nicolaides, who is also a fellow at MIT.

Others, he said, just rinse briefly in some water, rather than using soap and water and spending the recommended 15 to 20 seconds washing.

That figure, combined with estimates of exposure to the many potentially contaminated surfaces that people come into contact with in an airport, leads to the team's estimate that about 20 per cent of travellers in an airport have clean hands.

Improving handwashing at all of the world's airports to triple that rate, so that 60 per cent of travellers to have clean hands at any given time, would have the greatest impact, potentially slowing global disease spread by almost 70 per cent, the researchers noted.

Deploying such measures at so many airports and reaching such a high level of compliance may be impractical, they said.

However, the study suggests that a significant reduction in disease spread could still be achieved by just picking the 10 most significant airports based on the initial location of a viral outbreak.

Focusing handwashing messaging in those 10 airports could potentially slow the disease spread by as much as 37 per cent, the researchers estimate.

They arrived at these estimates using detailed epidemiological simulations that involved data on worldwide flights including duration, distance, and interconnections.

They also used the estimates of wait times at airports and studies on typical rates of interactions of people with various elements of their surroundings and with other people.

Even small improvements in hygiene could make a noticeable dent, the researchers said.

The increasing prevalence of clean hands in all airports worldwide by just 10 per cent could slow the global rate of the spread of a disease by about 24 per cent, the researchers said.

This could potentially be accomplished through education, posters, public announcements, and improved access to handwashing facilities, they said.

Numerous studies have shown that such measures can increase rates of proper handwashing, Nicolaides said.

The researchers used data from previous studies on the effectiveness of handwashing in controlling transmission of disease.

These data would have to be calibrated in the field to obtain refined estimates of the slow-down in spreading of a specific outbreak, the researchers said.

The findings are consistent with recommendations made by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO), they said.

Both have indicated that hand hygiene is the most efficient and cost-effective way to control disease propagation, the researchers said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/improved-handwashing-at-airports-may-reduce-spread-of-infectious-diseases--study-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/improved-handwashing-at-airports-may-reduce-spread-of-infectious-diseases--study.html
208,10-2-20,Brad Pitt wins maiden acting Oscar,"Superstar Brad Pitt, who has been this award season's darling with his funny, self-deprecating speeches, won his maiden acting Oscar for his performance as stuntman Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino's Hollywood memory capsule ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"".

The 56-year-old actor was recognised in the best supporting actor category for his role in the 1960s-set drama, which received a total of 11 nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards on Sunday night.

The win marks the first acting Oscar for Pitt, who took home the trophy as the producer of best picture winner ""12 Years a Slave"" in 2014.

Pitt, who was presented the trophy by last year's best supporting actress winner Regina King, credited the ""one of a kind"" and ""original"" Tarantino for his win.

""This really is about Quentin Jerome Tarantino. You are original, you are one of a kind. The film industry would be a much drier place without you and I love the ethos you gave (to) Cliff Booth. Look for the best in people, expect the worst but look for the best,"" the actor said in his acceptance speech.

Pitt went on to thank his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio and sent out ""a little love"" to Hollywood's stunt coordinators and stunt crews.

The actor also utilised his precious 45 seconds on stage to bring impeachment trial jokes to the Oscars.

""They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week. I'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it, in the end the adults do the right thing,"" he said taking a sly dig at the Senate voting against allowing witnesses during President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

Pitt said he is not somebody to look back, but his first acting Oscar made him reflect on his Hollywood journey.

""I think of my folks taking me to the drive-in to see 'Butch and Sundance' and loading up my car and moving out here, and Geena (Davis) and Ridley (Scott) giving me my first shot to all the wonderful people I've met along way, to stand here now: 'Once upon a time…in Hollywood'. Ain't that the truth? This is for my kids, who colour everything I do,"" the actor said.

Pitt was up against acting giants Anthony Hopkins (“The Two Popes”), Joe Pesci (“The Irishman”), Al Pacino (“The Irishman”) and Tom Hanks (“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”).

The actor, who has had a great 2019 courtesy “Once Upon...” and James Gray's ""Ad Astra”, impressed both the audiences and critics with his portrayal of Booth, whose dangerous side hides beneath an easy-going persona.

The role, which made many believe that Pitt was Tarantino's muse in the film, helped the actor win all the precursor awards including the BAFTA, the Golden Globe, the SAG and the Critics Choice Award.

Pitt's journey to his first acting Oscar has been a roller-coaster ride. In his two decade long career, the actor has been nominated seven times by the Academy.

He received his first Academy Award nomination in 1996 in the best supporting actor category for “12 Monkeys”, but lost to Kevin Spacey (“The Usual Suspects).

The actor got his second nod in the best actor category for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”. He again got nominated for the best actor trophy in 2012 for “Moneyball”. He was also up for best picture award in the year 2012 (“Moneyball”) and 2016 (“The Big Short”).

From being the heartthrob of the industry in ‘90s to staying away from media glare during his divorce from actor Angelina Jolie and then bouncing back as the renewed crush of the Hollywood, Pitt's journey in the movies came a full circle this award season.

The actor has not announced his next acting gig yet, but will be serving as producer on Jon Stewart's political comedy “Irresistible” and Andrew Dominik-directed “Blonde” based on Joyce Carol Oates' novel of the same name.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brad-pitt-wins-maiden-acting-oscar-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/brad-pitt-wins-maiden-acting-oscar.html

According to China's National Health Commission, 91 deaths were reported in Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, two in Anhui, and one each in Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hainan and Gansu.

There were 97 deaths and 3,062 new confirmed cases of the lethal infection on Sunday, it said.

A total of 908 people have died of the disease and 40,171 confirmed cases of the outbreak have been reported in 31 provincial-level regions so far, it said.

Another 4,008 new suspected cases were reported on Sunday. A total of 296 patients became seriously ill, the commission said, adding that 6,484 patients remained in severe condition and 23,589 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.

A total of 3,281 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery, it said.

The commission said 3.99 lakh close contacts had been traced, adding that among them, 29,307 were discharged from medical observation on Sunday, with 1.87 lakh still under medical observation.

By the end of Sunday, 36 confirmed cases, including one death, had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 18 in Taiwan. Overseas, over 300 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including from three from Kerala.

A team of international experts led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) would arrive in China on Monday night to assist the Chinese health officials to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak.

""I've just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led 2019nCoV international expert mission to China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies,"" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.

The WHO experts team, led by Aylward, will arrive in Beijing on Monday night, state-run China Daily reported.

After the outbreak, Ghebreyesus visited Beijing last month and held consultations with Chinese health experts and leaders.

Earlier, he said China had agreed to allow the WHO experts team comprising different countries.

Their arrival was expected to boost efforts to contain the virus which is causing havoc in China and many parts of the world, even though the Chinese officials claim the confirmed cases have begun to drop in the last few days.

The WHO said the number of cases of the coronavirus in China was ""stabilising"", which is ""good news"".

It, however, cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked.

""There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei,"" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme said at a briefing in Geneva.

""We're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced. That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place,"" Ryan was quoted as saying.

He added that it was ""very early to make any predictions"".

Meanwhile, millions of people have started returning to Beijing and other cities in China after the extended holiday of China's New Year.

The holidays, which began on January 24 and were due to end on February 3, has been extended till February 9 as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

However, the employees of most of the offices have been asked to work from home.

As the biggest reverse migration began, Chinese officials said on Saturday that the cases of the deadly infection had started declining for the first time after weeks of sharp rise.

China's new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus outside Hubei has been dropping for six consecutive days, according to the commission.

A total of 444 new confirmed cases were reported on Sunday outside Hubei, the data showed.

The numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 on Monday, 731 on Tuesday, 707 on Wednesday, 696 on Thursday, 558 on Friday and 509 on Saturday, the commission said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-908-in-china-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-908--who-sends-team-to-china.html
211,10-2-20,"UP BJP leader seeks ban on burqa, links it to Ravana's sister Surpanakha","A BJP leader Monday demanded a ban on burqa, calling it a security threat and provocatively linking it to demon king Ravana's sister Surpanakha.

""Burqa should be banned in the country as has been done in several other countries,"" Raghuraj Singh, who holds a rank equivalent to a minister of state in the Uttar Pradesh government, told reporters.

Singh claimed burqa is not worn in countries like Sri Lanka, China, the US and Canada and said it should be banned in India as terrorists can take advantage of it.

The BJP leader said people are sporting burqas in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest against the new citizenship law, and added, “The burqa helps terrorists, thieves and anti-socials elements to hide behind it.”

""Burqa is a threat to national security and has to be banned to crush terrorism,"" Singh said.

Without citing his source, Singh linked burqa to Surpanakha, the demon who has her face disfigured in Ramayana. According to Singh's version, Surpanakha fled to hide in the Arab desert.

“As her nose and ears were chopped, she used a burqa to hide her face,"" he said, adding it is not necessary for humans.

""In Mecca, a shivalinga was set up by Guru Shukracharya, who was the guru of devils, and from there the burqa tradition started,"" he said.

""This is Hindustan and it will be run as per traditions of the Hindus. This is our wish,"" he said.

Singh, who is part of a cell attached to UP government's labour department, courted controversy earlier by threatening to bury alive Aligarh Muslim University students for raising slogans against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Bharatiya Janata Party's Aligarh unit spokesperson said Singh holds the rank equivalent to a minister of state in the UP government.

Congress leader P L Punia and Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh condemned Singh's remarks.

BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh, a minister in the UP government, disowned the remarks, saying they reflected Raghuraj's Singh's personal opinion.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/up-bjp-leader-seeks-ban-on-burqa--links-it-to-ravana-s-sister-surpanakha-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/up-bjp-leader-seeks-ban-on-burqa--links-it-to-ravana-s-sister-surpanakha.html
212,10-2-20,ST quota creates political uproar; Govt says will take 'appropriate steps',"A huge row broke out both inside and outside parliament on Monday over the Supreme Court ruling on reservation in jobs for the SC/ST with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleging that it was ""in the DNA of the BJP and the RSS"" to try and erase the quota system, while the government said ""appropriate steps"" will be taken in the matter that was being discussed at the ""highest level"".

The political storm was caused after the apex court recently ruled that the states are not bound to provide reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

Under attack over the issue, the government accused the Congress of ""politicising the sensitive issue"" while the LJP, an NDA constituent, said the Centre should immediately interfere in the matter and put the subject of quota in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution so that no one moves the apex court on these issues.

Amidst the opposition attack, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawarchand Gehlot during his statement in both the Houses of Parliament made it clear that the Centre was not asked to file an affidavit in the matter, and said the issue is being discussed in the government at the ""highest level"" and it will take ""appropriate steps"" in the matter.

Using the SC order to attack the Modi government, Gandhi alleged that it was ""in the DNA of the BJP and the RSS to try to erase reservations"" and that a ""big conspiracy"" was underway to take away the rights of deprived sections.

Gandhi also told reporters outside Parliament that the Congress will not allow reservation to be done away with,""no matter how much (Prime Minister) Modi Ji or (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat dream of it.""

As soon as the Question Hour started, opposition members led by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought to raise the issue in Lok Sabha. He was also joined by members from other parties, including the DMK.

Hitting back at the opposition, the government said the Congress is trying to politicise a sensitive issue. ""This is my charge that the Congress is politicising the sensitive issue,"" Defence Minister and deputy leader of the House Rajnath Singh said.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi urged Speaker Om Birla to expunge remarks made by opposition members against the government. Birla said he would look into the issue.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said that in 2012 there was a Congress government in Uttarakhand and they took a decision on the matter.

""In the matter, the central government has no role. Our government is committed for reservation,"" Meghwal said.

Asserting that the court order and the behaviour of the Opposition over the matter is impacting a big population in the country, Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan said,”I request the central government to strengthen the reservation system. We cannot even discuss the issue of ending reservation.""

The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution is where the government parks laws which it thinks should be beyond judicial review. It bars the courts, including the Supreme Court, from striking down laws on the ground that it violates fundamental rights.

Rajiv Ranjan (BJP) said it is a ""very sensitive"" issue and the House has one view on it.

""No politics should happen on this matter,"" he said adding the government has taken several steps for the community.

Other opposition leaders who expressed their concern over the SC order, included Supriya Sule (NCP), Kalyan Banerjee (TMC), Ritesh Pandey (BSP), Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal),E T Mohammed Basheer (IUML) and CPI (M) member A M Ariff.

Similar scenes were witnessed in Rajya Sabha where Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and other members demanded that the government file a review petition in the SC, and walked out of the House over its ""unsatisfactory"" response.

During his statement, Gehlot said the top court order pertains to a 2012 decision of the previous Congress government in Uttarakhand and asserted that the central government is ""committed"" and ""dedicated"" to reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs.

""There was Congress Party government in Uttarakhand in 2012. Our government is dedicated and committed for the welfare of SCs, STs and other backward castes... Since it is an important subject, the government is considering it at the highest level,"" the minister said.

Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said the apex court's decision was ""unjust"" and the reservation subject should be brought under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.

It is a ""serious"" issue and the entire country is concerned about it, LJP leader and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.

""There is no need to worry. The Modi government will protect and will do whatever best possible to protect the interest of SCs and STs,"" Paswan, a dalit leader, said.

Later, the Congress accused Gehlot of misleading Lok Sabha on the issue, and said it would move a privilege motion against him.

The Congress also said it would stage protests and agitations at district level on the issue in the coming weeks to ""expose"" the Modi government's ""conspiracy to end reservation"" for STs/SCs and and Other Backward Classes.

Congress general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal said it is a clear agenda of the BJP to curtail reservation for SCs/STs and backwards and alleged that the RSS has been ""sabotaging"" reservation to these oppressed sections for years.

""The minister has misled the House. The Congress party has decided to move a privilege motion against the minister,” he told reporters.

Meanwhile, DMK President M K Stalin alleged that the policy of providing reservation was facing peril ever since the BJP assumed office at the Centre.

In a Facebook post, Stalin urged the Centre to take appropriate steps to ensure that reservation for OBCs, SCs and STs was protected and social justice upheld.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also attacked the BJP over the apex court order and alleged that the ruling party was weakening the equal rights given to Dalits and tribals by the Constitution.

The Congress has also slammed the BJP government in Uttarakhand for contending in the case in the apex court that there was no fundamental right to claim reservation in appointments or promotions in public posts, and that there was no constitutional duty on the part of the state governments to provide reservations.

""Understand the BJP's bid of ending reservation -- 1. RSS people consistently make statements against reservation. 2. The BJP government of Uttarakhand makes an appeal in the Supreme Court to abolish the fundamental right to reservation. 3. Uttar Pradesh government also immediately starts tampering with the rules of reservation,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet. ""The BJP first tried to weaken the law against atrocities on Dalits and tribals. Now it is trying to weaken equal rights given to them by the Constitution and Babasaheb (Ambedkar),"" she added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-order-on-sc-st-quota-creates-political-uproar--govt-says-will-take--appropriate-steps--2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-order-on-sc-st-quota-creates-political-uproar--govt-says-will-take--appropriate-steps-.html
213,10-2-20,AAP questions EC on data delay,"Chief Electoral Officer rejects charge, says Delhi voter turnout 62.59%

Hours after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday questioned the “delay” by the Election Commission (EC) in giving the final voter turnout figure and said it is “absolutely shocking”, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh on Sunday said there was no unusual delay in announcing the final voter turnout figure as the returning officers were busy with scrutiny of data throughout the night to ensure its accuracy.

At a Press conference held at 7.15 pm on Sunday, Singh said the final voter turnout was 62.59 per cent. In the 2015 Assembly polls, Delhi had recorded a voter turnout of 67.47 per cent.

The highest voting of 71.6 per cent was reported from Ballimaran constituency, while the lowest turnout was in Delhi cantonment at 45.4 per cent, Singh said. He tried to allay all the fears as expressed by a section of political parties over delay in releasing the final voting figures for the Delhi Assembly elections held on Saturday, saying “they did not want to speculate and wanted to give exact figures”.

“So, returning officers worked throughout the night to check data to ensure it is accurate,” Singh said while asserting that the delay was not unusual rather it was done in a good time. He said there were more than 13,700 polling stations in the national Capital and they had to add data from each station and ensure that every vote is accounted for.

It is not matter of late or early as soon as the voting per cent was finalised, it was shared with the public, he said.

Earlier in the day, Kejriwal tweeted, “Absolutely shocking. What is the EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?

While Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, “The BJP leaders are giving poll percentage. While on other hand, even after 24 hours of completion of the polling, the Election Commission is unable to tell the total poll percentage. It is saying, there are still collecting data,” he tweeted in Hindi adding, “What is happening @CeodelhiOffice? Are you waiting the BJP office to release the final data?”

“After compilation of form 17c for 143 booths. Total 98012 out of 144777 votes polled in my constituency (Shakurbasti AC 15) that works out to be 67.7% votes. Where as EC website is showing 49.19% polling only. Why after 22 hrs of official polling data is not released by EC,” tweeted AAP leader and Delhi Home and Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Satyendar Jain.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh alleged at a Press conference that “something is cooking” and “a game is being played secretely”.

“This is perhaps the first time in the 70-year history of country that the Election Commission is not ready to release the final figure of voter turnout. The entire country and Delhi have been waiting for the polling percentage since yesterday,” he said.

When asked about the less voter turnout in this election as compared to the previous 2015 Assembly elections, Singh said, “The voter turnout is increased than the Lok Sabha election which was 60.05 per cent. But, yes this time it is lesser than the previous Vidhan Sabha elections and the reason behind this may be winter, cold and holiday,” he said.

Further, on the questions of Babarpur EVM rumour, Delhi CEO, said, “Two officers were posted on the location and the officer was taking the EVMs to the car, in order to keep them in the strong room but the voting was not done from that machine. Following this, some people gheraoed our officers and when they tried to explain, they did not believe it.”

He also said the poll officers faced some technical issue in EVM at Bijwasan and “also the police should have been a little more active following the Shaheen Bagh protest management.”

The official data shows, of the total poll percentage, the female voter turnout is 62.55 and the male voter percentage has been slightly increased to 62.59 percentage including transgender voter turnout.

The highest voter turn was recorded in three minority constituency Ballimaran with 71.58 percentages, Seelampur 71.22 per cent and Matia Mahal 70.38 percentage. While, the lowest in Delhi Cantonment 45.36 percent.

The Assembly election was held on February 8 and the polling began at 8:00 am and ended around 7:30 pm. The high stake election results will be declared on February 11.

Exit polls on Saturday predicted an easy win for the AAP against the BJP and the Congress. However, the BJP and the Congress have dismissed exit polls prediction.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aap-questions-ec-on-data-delay-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/aap-questions-ec-on-data-delay.html
214,10-2-20,9.4K Indians under scanner for China virus,"Modi offers all help to Xi to deal with deadly crisis

More than 9,400 people across India are presently under observation following coronavirus outbreak in China. As of now, 1,818 flights and over one lakh 97 thousand passengers have been screened at 21 airports.

In India, universal screening for all flights from Singapore and Thailand besides Hong Kong and China is already on at earmarked aero-bridges. The screening of passengers is on in all 21 airports, international seaports and border crossings, as per a statement of the Union Health Ministry.

Meanwhile, concerned at the death of over 800 people in the neighbouring country due to the lethal virus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday wrote to Chinese President Xi Jinping about India’s readiness to provide assistance to the country to deal with the situation.

In a letter to Xi, Modi expressed solidarity with the president and people of China over the outbreak of the virus, official sources said.

A total of 1,510 samples have been tested and 1,507 samples were found negative except for three samples which had tested positive already from Kerala. The containment and prevention activities are being taken up on utmost priority. All the States are continually strengthening their rapid response teams to counter any eventuality, said the statement.

The Indians tested positive for the disease are students who recently returned from China’s Wuhan city, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

A total of 811 people have died of the coronavirus infection in China so far while the number of confirmed cases has gone up to 37,198, according to latest data released by Chinese authorities.

The Prime Minister also conveyed India’s appreciation for China’s assistance in evacuation of Indians from Hubei province. While offering India’s assistance to China to face the challenge, Modi also conveyed condolences at the unfortunate loss of lives due to the outbreak.

Though the epicentre of the outbreak was Hubei province, the virus has spread to almost every province in China as well as around 25 countries in the world, forcing the World Health Organization to declare it a global emergency.

A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from China.

India too has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China as part of precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/9-4k-indians-under-scanner-for-china-virus-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/9-4k-indians-under-scanner-for-china-virus.html
215,10-2-20,Urban Ministry devises smart city plan for top 20 to help bottom 20,"With some of the 100 selected smart cities lagging behind, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has hit upon a novel way to give a leg up to the laggards. As per this, the Ministry has paired up 20 best performing cities with the 20 bottom cities.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi will guide Amritsar whereas Ahmedabad will help Chandigarh in implementing projects under the mission. Ahmedabad (1st rank), Nagpur, Tiruppur, Ranchi, Bhopal, Surat, Kanpur, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Vellore, Vadodara, Nashik, Agra, Varanasi, Davanagere, Kota, Pune, Udaipur, Dehradun and Amravati are the 20 best performing cities, according to internal rankings.

An official said under the 20-20 formula, Ranchi and Pune will team up with Shimla and Dharamsala respectively, and share ideas with them to improve their performance.

The Ministry has issued an advisory for the same and asked the 20 best performing cities and the 20 bottom cities to sign an MoU before February 20. According to the official, cities have been paired up with those from a similar region and culture.

The official said Varanasi, a holy city, has been paired up with another holy city Amritsar which needs to improve its performance under the mission.

Smart Cities Mission, launched in 2015, is aimed at ensuring all-round developments of a city which has advanced facilities for its citizens.

Visakhapatnam and Surat will help Diu and Sharanpur improve their performance respectively, while Bhopal will share its ideas with Mizoram’s capital city Aizawl.

“The pair of “sister cities will have to sign an MoU before February 20 to ensure expeditious execution of projects and report compliance to the Smart Cities Mission Directorate,” the official said.

“Sister cities” will undertake a 100-day challenge from the day of its announcement to enhance the ranks and performance of the bottom 20 cities. Under the mission, 100 selected smart cities have identified 5,151 projects worth Rs 2,05,018 crore to be executed.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/urban-ministry-devises-smart-city-plan-for-top-20-to-help-bottom-20.html
216,10-2-20,"India’s 1st darknet narcotics vendor held, 12,000 tablets seized","The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday arrested the country’s first “darknet” narcotics operative (vendor) who allegedly shipped hundreds of parcels containing psychotropic drugs to offshore locations in the garb of sex stimulation medicines.

Dipu Singh, 21, son of a retired Army officer, was arrested by the sleuths of the Delhi zonal unit of the NCB from Lucknow recently.

During the searches, 12,000 tablets of various psychotropic drugs were seized from his residence.

“Singh is a major player on the darknet. His listings were found in one of the biggest and reliable darknet markets like Empire Market and Majestic Garden. He clandestinely couriered hundreds of drug parcels to countries like the USA, UK, Romania, Spain and some other European nations using the darkweb,” NCB Deputy Director General (DDG) (operations) Rajesh Nandan Srivastava said.

“Singh initially began his operation with shipping medicines related to erectile dysfunction and fitness supplements to overseas locations using the darkinternet facility, but later shifted to transacting psychotropic drugs,” the DDG said.

“A bachelor in hotel management from Amity University in Lucknow, Singh had mastered the technique to disguise identity while making a shipment”, the NCB said in a statement.

A total of 55,000 psychotropic tablets that includes tramadol, zolpidem, alprazolam have been seized as part of this two-month-long multi-national operation that was conducted with cooperation from international agencies, NCB Delhi zonal director K P S Malhotra said. Some drugs ere seized from Mumbai and the United Kingdom.

Darknet or darkweb refers to the deep hidden Internet platform that is often used for illegal activities like sale of narcotics, exchange of pornographic content and the like using the secret and layered alleys of the onion router (ToR) to evade surveillance of law enforcement agencies.

Darknet is considered very tough to crack by the investigators due to its end-to-end encryption,

The NCB was part of a global ‘Operation Trance’, launched in December last year, entailing a joint intelligence gathering action on international postal, express mail and courier shipments containing psychotropic drugs (which can only be purchased on a doctor’s prescription and are barred to be sold over the counter) that are abused as sedatives and painkillers by the drug addicts.

The latest darknet ring was unearthed as part of this operation, which has international linkages and is spread across Singapore and the US and services of global post offices and international couriers were used as logistics for the illicit trade, Srivastava said.

“The payment gateways of cryptocurrency like Bitcoins and Litecoin were used by the operators to conceal the transactions from regulatory agencies,” the NCB DDG said.

The orders were procured from darknet and routed through various wicker identities, WhatsApp and some business-to-business platforms.

The investigation in the case is ongoing as the NCB is looking at the links of Singh and others associated with him, Malhotra added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india---s-1st-darknet-narcotics-vendor-held--12-000-tablets-seized.html
217,10-2-20,Bangladesh maiden U-19 World Cup win a major upset for India,"A sprightly bunch of Bangladesh boys created history by winning their country’s first global cricket title, shocking defending champions India by three wickets in the summit clash of the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Sunday.

In a low-scoring final, Bangladesh first choked India to a meagre 177 in 47.2 overs and then did well enough to score revised target of 170 in 42.1 overs under Duckworth-Lewis method.

Once play resumed after rain, target was revised to 170 and with seven runs to get and three wickets in hand, it became a cakewalk for the ‘Tiger Cubs’ as they scripted a golden chapter in their country’s cricket history.

India’s cricketing battles with Bangladesh have been filled with acrimony since 2015 World Cup quarter-final at the MCG and it had only amplified with the kind of boorish behaviour that some of the Bangladeshi players displayed.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bangladesh-maiden-u-19-world-cup-win-a-major-upset-for-india.html
218,10-2-20,"Iran satellite launch fails, in blow to space programme","Iran said it ""successfully"" launched a satellite Sunday but failed to put it into orbit, in a blow to its space programme that the US alleges is a cover for missile development.

The attempted launch of the Zafar -- ""Victory"" in Farsi -- comes days before the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and crucial parliamentary elections in Iran.

Arch foes Iran and the United States have appeared to be on the brink of an all-out confrontation twice in the past seven months.

Long-standing acrimony between Tehran and Washington was exacerbated in 2018 when US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a deal that froze Iran's nuclear programme, before issuing new demands that Tehran curtail its development of ballistic missiles.

Washington has also raised concerns in the past about Tehran's satellite programme, saying the launch of a carrier rocket in January 2019 amounted to a violation of limits on its ballistic missiles.

Iran maintains it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons, and says its aerospace activities are peaceful and comply with a UN Security Council resolution.

On Sunday, it launched the Zafar satellite at 7:15 pm (1545 GMT) but it fell short of reaching orbit, the defence ministry said.

A ministry spokesman said initially that the satellite was ""successfully"" launched and went ""90 per cent of the way"", reaching an altitude of 540 kilometres (335 miles).

""The Simorgh (rocket) successfully propelled the Zafar satellite into space,"" said Ahmad Hosseini of the ministry's space unit.

""Unfortunately, in the final moments the carrier did not reach the required speed"" to put it into orbit, he told state television.

""God willing with improvements made in future launches this part of the mission will be done as well,"" he added.

""We achieved most of the goals we had and data has been acquired, and in the near future, by analysing the data, we will take the next steps.""

Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi admitted in an English-language tweet soon after that the launch had ""failed"".

""But We're UNSTOPPABLE! We have more Upcoming Great Iranian Satellites!"" said Jahromi.

Tweeting in Farsi, he added: ""I would have liked to make you happy with #good_news but sometimes life does not go the way we want it.""

Iran on Sunday also unveiled a new a short-range ballistic missile and its ""new generation"" of engines designed to put satellites into space.

The Revolutionary Guards' website said the Raad-500 missile was equipped with new Zoheir engines made of composite materials that make them lighter than previous steel models.

It also unveiled Salman engines made of the same materials but with a ""movable nozzle"" for the delivery of satellites into space, allowing ""manoeuvrability beyond the atmosphere"".

In January 2019, Tehran announced that its Payam -- ""Message"" in Farsi -- satellite had failed to reach orbit, after authorities said they launched it to collect data on the environment in Iran.

The United States said the launch of the carrier rocket was a violation of a 2015 UN Security Council resolution endorsing the international accord on curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.

Resolution 2231 called on Iran to refrain from any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Tehran confirmed in September that an explosion had taken place at one of its satellite launch pads due to a technical fault, and slammed Trump for ""gleefully"" tweeting about it at the time.

Trump said the US had nothing to do with what he called a ""catastrophic accident"" at Semnan Space Centre, also tweeting a high-resolution picture pointing to apparent damage at the site.

Sunday's developments come at a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington, after a January 3 US drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

Iran retaliated days later by firing a wave of missiles at American troops stationed in Iraq.

Its defence forces had been braced for US retaliation when they accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight a few minutes after take-off from Tehran on January 8.

Iran says its internet services have faced cyber attacks for the past two days, without elaborating on the source of the attack or the likely motives.

The country's on-off space programme unsettles some Western nations as the technology used in space-bound rockets can also be used in ballistic missiles.

The Islamic republic has successfully launched several satellites since February 2009.

It has also sent monkeys, a turtle, mouse and worms into space.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-satellite-launch-fails--in-blow-to-space-programme-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-satellite-launch-fails--in-blow-to-space-programme.html

This time, the image has the hashtag ‘Asim Riaz For The Win written on it.

Cena's recent post has left netizens excited, though most have wondered if Cena actually watches ""Bigg Boss 13"".

Reacting to Cena's post, Riaz's former ""BB 13"" contestant Himanshi Khurana commented with fire emojis on the picture.

Another user wrote: ""It seems John Cena watches 'Bigg Boss' daily.""

On Cena's part, the posts are probably meant to work as an early promotional campaign for ""Fast & Furious 9"" in India.

221,10-2-20,Galaxy Watch Active 2 4G: True style and fitness package,"With a strong millennial base and rising disposable income, India now offers immense growth potential for the smartwatch players like Apple, Samsung, Huawei and more.

In order to expand its presence in the wearable market, the South Korean tech giant has launched its latest smartwatch Galaxy Watch Active 2 4G for Rs 35,990, which makes it one of the most expensive smartwatches in the country.

The leather strap makes the smartwatch more visually appealing and comfortable to wear it for long hours.

The smartwatch is available in 44mm steel dial along with silver, black, and gold finishes.

It sports a 1.4-inch Super-AMOLED 'Always On Display' with maximum resolution of 360x360 pixels.

As expected, the touchscreen worked extremely fast. In terms of brightness, the display performed well in various light conditions.

The Super-AMOLED display covers the screen edge to edge and comes with a touch bezel that ensures a smooth experience while navigating through apps.

Underneath the hood, the smartwatch is equipped the Galaxy Watch Active 2 LTE with an Exynos 9110 dual-core processor ticking along at 1.15 GHz.

The chipset has been paired with 1.5GB of RAM and 4GB of storage.

The Galaxy Watch Active 2 4G runs Tizen OS 4.0 with 'One UI' 1.5 on top. Samsung claims that this watch is IP68 rated, which means it should be water-resistant up to 5ATM or 50 metres.

Just like the Galaxy Watch 4G, the Watch Active 2 4G uses an eSIM for uninterrupted flow of data as well as receiving calls directly from the smartwatch.

Once connected to your phone, Galaxy Watch Active2 4G allows users to easily take photos, start recording a video, preview video clips, switch between front and rear lenses, set a timer and then check the final photo or video - all from the wrist.

Users can also charge their Galaxy Watch Active2 4G in an easy and intuitive way using Wireless PowerShare on their Galaxy smartphones.

The smartwatch comes with e-SIM connectivity, helping consumers stay connected and allows them to make and take calls freely from the watch itself without having to keep their phone around.

Due to carrier limitations, only Jio and Airtel users can make use of the e-SIM functionality in the country to date.

The LTE support works pretty much exactly the same way like the Galaxy Watch 4G.

Users can access social media apps, especially WhatsApp with just the tap of the finger, even while away from the smartphone.

The smartwatch comes with advanced sensors which track up to 39 distinct activities with auto tracking for popular activities such as walking, running, cycling, rowing and more.

The smartwatch comes with an updated 'Running Coach' that provides access to seven different running programs and lets users monitor their running pace in real time.

In terms of battery backup, the watch performed quite good with around two days usage in a single charge.

Conclusion: The smartwatch has distinctive qualities in terms of design and performance and will appeal the young buyers but will face some competition from Huawei Watch GT 2 as well as Honor MagicWatch 2.

222,10-2-20,Android flaw BlueFrag lets attackers send malware over Bluetooth,"Researchers and independent IT Security service provider ERNW have discovered a vulnerability named BlueFrag that lets attackers silently deliver malware to and steal data from nearby smartphones running Android 8 Oreo or Android 9 Pie operating system (OS).

The vulnerability BlueFrag does not work with Android 10 OS. It's possible that versions before Android 8 are affected, but the team hadn't ""evaluated the impact"" on older releases.

The intruder only needs to know the Bluetooth MAC address of the target, and that's sometimes easy to guess just by looking at the WiFi MAC address. You won't even know the attack is happening, ERNW said, Engadget reported on Monday.

According to the researchers, users can protect themselves by installing the February 2020 security patch and the Bluetooth nature of the flaw means that the users have to be relatively close to an attacker.

This will mainly be a concern in public spaces where there's an abundance of targets, the report added.

It also means devices still on Android 9 Pie or below, probably still don't have much to worry about -- finding the Bluetooth MAC address isn't always a simple task.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/android-flaw-bluefrag-lets-attackers-send-malware-over-bluetooth-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/android-flaw-bluefrag-lets-attackers-send-malware-over-bluetooth.html
223,10-2-20,India hope for top order blitzkrieg to avoid 3-0 whitewash,"India would expect its top order to fire to avoid a series whitewash when it clashes with a high-flying New Zealand in the third and final One-day International, here on Tuesday.

Despite missing inspirational skipper Kane Williamson in the line-up due to a shoulder injury, the hosts shrugged off the T20 series debacle to claim the ODI series.

New Zealand, though, will have the experience and leadership of Williamson for the final game as he has passed the fitness test.

The major difference between the two sides has been the top-order's impact.

With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan missing due to injuries, Virat Kohli missing out on scoring big and KL Rahul batting later in the order, India's traditional ODI strength was neutralised without New Zealand having to do any hard work.

Openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal have shown only momentary flashes of brilliance and have not replicated the kind of starts the Indian batting has grown accustomed to from its top-order.

Rohit's absence has been a major factor in India's defeat in this series. The opener averaged 57.30 in ODI cricket in the past 12 months, having a major impact on Indian fortunes in this format.

In that light, the burden of scoring runs has been placed squarely on Kohli in this series. With 66 runs in two innings, he did not come through for once and the rest didn't rise to the occasion either.

All of it resulted in reversal of fortunes on the limited-overs leg of this tour, as India had arrived here at Mt. Maunganui a week ago leading the T20I series by a 4-0 margin. They went on to drub the Black Caps 5-0, but now find themselves in the same position at the same ground.

It is also a reversal of results from the Men in Blue's last visit here in 2019 when they won the ODI series 4-1 but lost the T20I series 2-1.

India's previous ODI series loss in New Zealand was 4-1 on the 2014 tour here. Shreyas Iyer, with a hundred and a half-century, has mirrored Ross Taylor's rich form in Hamilton and Auckland. But Iyer lacked the finishing touch as compared to Taylor's experience. He couldn't see India's chase through in Auckland like the senior Kiwi batsman did in Hamilton.

India may also look to experiment a bit before the Test series.

Rahul, Shaw, Iyer, Kedar Jadhav and Yuzvendra Chahal did not take part in the optional practice session on Monday.

Kohli was first into the nets against both pace and spin. Manish Pandey was in the nets beside him, while Rishabh Pant had a long session once again.

Pant has not played limited-overs' cricket since he suffered a concussion against Australia. If India goes as per routine plan, he is in danger of missing out entirely from playing white-ball cricket on this tour.

In the bowling department, all pacers were present for training, except Mohammed Shami.

New Zealand have added leg spinner Ish Sodhi and pacer Blair Tickner to the squad for this match. Sodhi played in the first ODI at Hamilton, bowling Kohli with a googly.

They were part of the New Zealand A team playing an unofficial Test against India A but did not take part on the fourth day's proceedings. Tim Southee (stomach bug), Mitchell Santner (stomach bug) and Scott Kuggeleijn (viral fever) are hoping to recover in time for the third ODI.

Squads:

224,10-2-20,Understanding ground dimensions must in New Zealand: Thakur,"Understanding the peculiar dimensions of the grounds and negotiating the wind factor is a must for bowlers to succeed in New Zealand, reckons India pacer Shardul Thakur.

""There are no grounds alike in New Zealand, so it is very important to understand the ground dimensions. How to bowl, etc. In each game, as a bowler, you may have to change your plan because the last game in Auckland, straight boundaries were short. ""Before that in Hamilton, the side boundary was short. The dimensions of each ground are different and you have to bowl accordingly. Here in the next game, we will get a bigger ground compared to the others,"" said Thakur on the eve of the third ODI here on Tuesday.

Thakur feels the conditions make New Zealand one of the toughest places to play cricket in.

""It is very difficult because you don't get to play on grounds like this every day. That's why they say New Zealand is a difficult country to play cricket in. I feel that when you practice in the nets you have to practice in the manner in which you are going to bowl the next day.

""Mentally too, it is crucial to be prepared because if you are not prepared mentally, the opponent can take you by surprise. So both things are important. If you see, their batsmen use the wind and the short side,"" he added.

Thakur is returning to international cricket after a lengthy break. He was injured on his Test debut and then had to go through the rigours of domestic cricket all over again.

The pacer said he had forgotten about that, but has been continuously working on his fitness and skill to make sure he is always ready for international cricket.

India will be aiming to avoid a 0-3 whitewash on Tuesday and with the series already out of reach, Thakur feels he and his teammates can play even more freely.

""When you play international cricket, every game matters for every player. When you are 2-0 down, you can express yourself even more – our skills, our variations in bowling. Batsmen can play their shots, can execute shots and express themselves. That's how we will approach it.""

While India have missed Rohit Sharma, thus weakening the batting order, New Zealand's top-order has been rejuvenated after the T20I series. Ross Taylor has been in-form scoring a hundred and a half-century as New Zealand took a 2-0 lead. Skipper Kane Williamson has recovered his shoulder injury and is set to play in third ODI.

""Thanks for reminding that (Kane) is going to play tomorrow. But yeah, it's okay. Everyone's playing cricket here, I guess. It's no different. I think the opening partnership has been crucial for them. They are building a good partnership, like you said, up front. That's why they are able to set up good scores.

""He (Taylor) is batting really well. Once he is set, he is able to play on the leg-side like he is a God. I think we have to be very precise bowling to him. At times, we have had our chances. In the last two ODIs, he had skied up a few balls and we had chances. Had we grabbed it, the game could have gone anyway.""

For India, meanwhile, the lower order has been doing wonders. Thakur said it is the responsibility of the bowlers to contribute with the bat as well, and he pays due attention to this skill.

""When I bat at no. 8, a good 20-30 runs from me are always helpful for the team. I have been trying to do the same. If there is a batsmen at the other end and if No. 8 or 9 can be handy for the team, there is always a difference of 30-40 runs when it comes to play,"" Thakur added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/understanding-ground-dimensions-must-in-new-zealand--thakur-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/understanding-ground-dimensions-must-in-new-zealand--thakur.html
225,09-2-20,Post Brexit: Miles to go before complete divorce,"Though Brexit is finally done, Johnson has to stick to the transition period that he has agreed in the withdrawal pact. Precisely speaking, it is too little time for a complete withdrawal from the EU. For all these, the rest of the 27 members of the EU have to come together and the UK must cooperate with them

Brexit is finally done. At the end of January this year, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, signed the agreement for country’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU).This has taken the country to the path of a full Brexit for which people have been waiting for more than three years. Johnson hailed this as a “fantastic moment” for Britain. While releasing the exit agreement, he said, “We can now move forward as one country… with a government focused upon delivering better public services, greater opportunity and unleashing the potential of every corner of our brilliant United Kingdom, while building a strong new relationship with the EU as friends and sovereign equals.”

Queen Elizabeth duly gave her approval for the agreement. Hence, starting from the floor of Parliament to the court of the royalty, Johnson has received a clear “go ahead” for the Brexit. This signals that Britain is on the road to build a new future, with a new identity. It’s all about asserting its sovereignty in a unique manner.

With the UK finally leaving the EU on January 31, the country has now entered an 11-month transition period with the EU. During this entire period, the country effectively remains within the legal ambit of the Union. Hence, it has to follow the rules of the customs union, single market and rest of the organisations of the EU. But strikingly, the UK is no more a part of the political institutions of the EU.

However, since the Britons’ vote to exit the EU in June 2016, the nation has continued to defy the gloom and doom predicted by the Remainers. But the moot point is why Brexit is good for Britain. Simply speaking, Britain will be able to assert its control over its borders again. It does not need to bother Brussels again and again. But then deserting the Union may put pressure on Britain to identify and set a new relationship with all its members. And many of these members may not cooperate the way it did in the past during its membership to the EU.

After the withdrawal agreement, the first priority for Johnson was to ink a pragmatic trade deal with the EU. This is because, he wants as much access as possible for the UK goods and services to the EU market. Otherwise, this will have a negative impact both on the commoners and the trading community across the country. But this time, the current British Government has underlined the fact that the country must leave the customs union, single market and the European Court of Justice (ECJ). In fact, leaving the ECJ would eventually mean putting an end to overall jurisdiction of the court over Britain.

Meanwhile, Johnson has set his vision for a trade deal with the EU. While doing this he has underlined the fact that there is no need for the UK to follow the rules set by Brussels regime. What he wants is a Canada-style free-trade deal with the EU. Or else Britain will get back to the withdrawal agreement. But the EU officials highlight such a deal as very ambitious one for which a level playing field is required. Around the same time, the Labour Party is putting pressure on the government and saying that Johnson’s ideology has trumped common sense. Further, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the PM risked trade and investment if he kept undermining collective agreements. But then the Opposition is missing the very vital point that only to come out of the stranglehold of the EU, the Brexit is done. Its only purpose is to stay out of tentacles of the Brussels and save the country as much as possible from the collective burdens of the Union. The existing EU-Canada deal, the import tariffs of most of the goods have been eliminated between the two. But customs and VAT checks are applicable to these goods. When it comes to flow of services such as banking, it is restricted between Canada and the EU. But it is very crucial for the UK. Johnson is also indicating that he might revert his country to the WTO terms if the EU leaders refuse to offer a Canada-style framework. So for him, “The choice is emphatically not ‘deal or no deal’. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada’s — or more like Australia’s. In either case, I have no doubt that Britain will prosper mightily.”

His confidence is well placed. Equally he must be aware of the fallout of the exit from the Union after decades of bonding. Political gimmicks are fine. While encountering reality, Johnson’s high-handed style may irk many, including the ones who voted him to power after leaving the labour camp.

What happens next will certainly be evoking more interest and controversy in the years to come. Many critics feel that Britain leaving the EU may encourage some other nations to follow suit. And this can happen through specific referendums of their own to safeguard particular interests and demands. Else some countries within the EU may ask for tailor-made deals of their own. That is how the future of the union might be affected.

However, untangling from the EU would be a long and arduous process. When pro-Brexiteers are talking tough on the migration from other EU member countries, they must note the fact that nearly 1.2 million Brits are also working in other member nations who might face a number of hassles. Leaving behind the EU and making a new road map is difficult. Apart from issues related to migration, following the EU rules and directives in regard to competition policies, subsidies, social protection and the environment may create trouble for the UK.

Though the Brexit is finally done, Johnson has to stick to the transition period that he has underlined in the withdrawal agreement. Precisely speaking, it is too little time for a complete withdrawal from the EU. For all these, the rest of the 27 members of the Union have to come together and the UK must cooperate with them.

226,10-2-20,Bong Joon Ho creates Oscar history with best picture win for 'Parasite',"""Parasite"", director Bong Joon Ho's twisted satire on class divide, leap-frogged through 92 years of Oscars history to become the first non-English and South Korean film ever to win the best picture award.

The movie, a cleverly crafted, stylish genre-bending story broke the ""one inch long subtitle barrier"" that its director Bong famously had talked about in the run up to the Oscars to sweep the top categories that also included the international feature, best director and original screenplay.

The director, who had already come up the stage thrice and promised to drink the night away, let his producers bask in the limelight for the big finish.

""I'm speechless. We never imagined this to ever happen. We are so happy. I feel like a very opportune moment in history is happening right now,"" co-producer Kwak Sin Ae said in her acceptance speech via interpreter Sharon Choi.

As the lights dimmed, award presenter Jane Fonda and the audience, including Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Charlize Theron, urged the Academy to let the team finish their speeches.

Bong still did not come up to the mic, letting Miky Lee, the South Korean movie mogul, to speak about the film.

""I like everything about him, his smile, his crazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks, especially the way he directs. What I really like about him is his sense of humour...He never takes himself seriously. Thank you for being you,"" Lee said.

Later, talking backstage to Academy's 'Thank you cam', the director called the win ""surreal"".

""Four times... It's crazy. It's an unbelievable night. It's such a great honour. I feel like I'll wake up to find this all a dream. It all feels very surreal,"" he said.

While ""Parasite's"" chances in the international category were a lock, the best picture and director win was a huge upset for British filmmaker Sam Mendes' war drama ""1917"".

The South Korean film, about a poor family which worms its way through a rich and gullible household to comic but ultimately tragic results, was also up against seven other films: “Ford V. Ferrari,” “The Irishman,” “Jojo Rabbit,"" “Joker,” “Little Women,” “Marriage Story” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"".

""Parasite"" has been on a unstoppable march since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival where it became the first South Korean film to win the top, Palme d'Or, award.

The universal love and acclaim that the film has been receiving warmed the hearts of even the notoriously conservative Academy voters, leading up to a historic night that film critics and Oscar-watchers believe will pave the way for other international films.

""Parasite"" went into the Oscar race with an impressive haul of trophies at the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs and the Screen Actor Guild awards where it won the best picture equivalent of best ensemble cast in a motion picture.

Bong is not new to the western audiences and first broke on the international scene with ""Memories of Murder"", a cult favourite of the director's fans and credited for being one of the films of the new wave in South Korean cinema.

The director will continue the ""Parasite"" saga in a television series, which will expand on the universe that he created in the movie.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bong-joon-ho-creates-oscar-history-with-best-picture-win-for--parasite--2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/bong-joon-ho-creates-oscar-history-with-best-picture-win-for--parasite-.html
227,10-2-20,China praises PM Modi's letter to XI on coronavirus assistance,"China on Monday appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's letter to President Xi Jinping offering solidarity and assistance to deal with the deadly coronavirus outbreak, saying it ""fully demonstrated"" New Delhi's friendship with Beijing.

In a letter to Xi, Modi expressed solidarity with the president and people of China over the outbreak of the virus that has claimed over 900 lives in the neighbouring country.

""We thank and appreciate India's support for China's fight against the NCP Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, the official name for coronavirus,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

""India's acts of goodwill fully demonstrate its friendship with China,"" Geng said during an online media briefing while replying to a question on Modi's letter to Xi.

Prime Minister Modi also offered India's assistance to China to face the challenge, besides conveying condolences over the loss of lives due to the outbreak.

The prime minister also conveyed to Xi his appreciation for facilitating evacuation of around 650 Indian citizens from the worst-affected Hubei province last week.

A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from China.

India too has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China as part of precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus.

""We stand ready to work with India and other members of the international community to jointly tackle fight the epidemic and safeguard regional and global public health security,"" Geng said.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told the Indian media here on Monday that India was in touch with Chinese officials to find out the immediate requirements to deal with the epidemic.

The death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 908 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province and the confirmed cases of infection crossing 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday.

231,10-2-20,"They flashed, groped us at Gargi fest: DU students","Received no complaint, say police, Gargi principal

In a shocking incident, a number of students of Delhi University’s Gargi College alleged that a group of men barged into their campus and molested, manhandled and sexually assaulted them during the third day of their annual college fest.

A second year student of Political Science on condition of anonymity said the incident took place “around 6.30 pm on February 6. “I was groped thrice, somebody reached for inside my skirt and the problem was I couldn’t move out of it. I saw that a 30-35-year-old man began masturbating while looking at me, so I ran from there too,” she told IANS in a choked voice over the phone,

Following the incident, Rekha Sharma, chairperson of the National Commission for Woman (NCW) said she will send a team to the college on Monday to talk to the students. The team will take the matter with police also.

However, a senior police official said neither they have received any complaint nor any PCR call was made by the students or the college authorities regarding the incident. “College principal Promila Kumar also didn’t inform us about any such incident. If any complaint will come we will take action accordingly,” he said.

Contacted by IANS, the principal, however, said, “We had a huge security arrangement, including police, bouncers and even commandos, along with the teaching and non-teaching staff, on duty. No one came to us and reported any such incident. We were taking rounds in the crowd. It was very crowded. We were very vigilant but we couldn’t see anything of this sort. It is a serious incident and I will deliberate on it. Unfortunately nobody has reported it to me,” she said.

According to students of the college, the incident happened when college annual festival ‘Reverie’ was underway. “There were restriction on outsiders to get inside the college premises during the festival but the event was open for boys studying in other Delhi University colleges. Outsiders may have entered the campus using passes given to students of other Delhi University colleges,” they alleged.

“A large crowd of men entered into campus after breaking the gate and started abusing girls. They were also passing lewd comments and touching students inappropriately,” said one of the students on the condition of anonymity.

“The field was so massively crowded that there was no space to move. Two of my friends, who were accompanying me, had held my hands so that I don’t get lost in the crowd as there is no cell reception on the field. Suddenly immense pressure came from behind and my hand got jerked off so I lost my friends for the next 10-15 minutes, and in those minutes, I was molested thrice,” she said.

Another student from the college said, “Around 3-3.30 pm, a large groups of men started pushing the doors and then entered the college. There were no police personnel or bouncers present at the gate from 3 pm to 4 pm when 300-400 people entered the college.

“The college grounds are small, with little place to move around, and that is when some of these men started groping, molesting and harassing us.”

The student also alleged that when she approached the college principal, she responded by saying that I should have not come to the fest if I felt so unsafe. Asked about the student’s allegation that she was not helped when she reported the matter, Kumar said, “This is a false allegation. One of the students did come to me, so I asked her to stay with me until the situation became normal, but she disappeared suddenly.”",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/they-flashed--groped-us--at-gargi-fest--du-students-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/they-flashed--groped-us--at-gargi-fest--du-students.html
232,10-2-20,'Joker' earns Joaquin Phoenix his first Oscar,"Hollywood star Joaquin Phoenix finally ended his dry run at the Oscars as he picked up the best actor trophy for his performance in and as ""Joker"" at the 92nd Academy Awards.

The 45-year-old actor had earlier bagged a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his turn as a failed, unhinged stand-up comedian who descends into chaos.

In a lengthy and rambling speech, Phoenix touched upon issues such as racism, climate change and gender inequality. He said the greatest gift of his life was having a ""voice"" and being able to support those who are ""voiceless"".

""I think, whether we're talking about gender inequality, or racism, or queer rights, or indigenous rights, or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice.

""We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender, or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity,"" he said.

Admitting that he has been a ""scoundrel"", ""selfish"" and ""cruel"" in the past, Phoenix said he is grateful to life for giving him a second chance.

""I think we're at our best when we support each other, not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow, when we educate each other, when we guide each other toward redemption. That is the best of humanity,"" he added.

The actor also remembered his brother River Phoenix, who died of a drug overdose at the age of 23 in 1993.

""When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, he said, 'run to the rescue with love and peace will follow',"" Phoenix concluded.

At the Academy Awards and the entire Hollywood award season, Phoenix had emerged as an undisputed frontrunner even though he was up against the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio (""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood""), Adam Driver (""Marriage Story""), ""Antonio Banderas (""Pain & Glory"") and Jonathan Pryce (""The Two Popes"").

An Oscar had eluded Phoenix for the most part of his career, despite his successful collaborations with Ridley Scott (""Gladiator""), James Mangold (""Walk The Line"") and Paul Thomas Anderson (""The Master""), all of which had earned him nominations.

But as Arthur Fleck aka The Joker, Phoenix finally managed to break that jinx and became the second actor to win an Oscar for playing the DC comic book villain after the posthumous best supporting actor win to Heath Ledger in 2008.

As Joker, Phoenix took a deep dive into character, capturing its essence as well as maniacal spirit in both body and soul.

He lost 52 pounds to get into the physicality of Fleck and turned to a pathological disorder to get his distinct laughter right.

Phillips wrote the part keeping Phoenix in mind though the actor took some convincing to play the role.

Phoenix started the film's festival circuit tour on a positive note at Cannes last year that followed by stops at Venice and Toronto.

The film had also courted controversies, owing to its theme of gun violence in the movie as well as Phoenix's temperamental press tour that saw him walking out of an interview midway.

But critics and the fans loved the actor's riveting turn in the movie and his pointed speeches.

At the Golden Globes, he called out the industry for its insensitivity towards climate change and pulled up his peers for using private jets for travel, while at the SAGs, he joked how he would always lose a role to DiCaprio and asked Christian Bale to deliver a bad performance for once in his career.

In his acceptance speech at the BAFTAs, Phoenix acknowledged the lack of diversity in the nominations, calling himself a part of the problem.

Phoenix's career most praised performances include ""Signs "", ""We Own the Night"", ""Two Lovers"", ""The Immigrant"", ""Her"", ""You Were Never Really Here"" and ""Inherent Vice"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-joker--earns-joaquin-phoenix-his-first-oscar-2020-02-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-joker--earns-joaquin-phoenix-his-first-oscar.html
