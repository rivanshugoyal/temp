0,26-2-20,Door to diplomacy,"As we celebrate the first anniversary of Balakot, one of the biggest challenges facing the Indian subcontinent and West Asia is of managing cross-border air strikes

On the first anniversary of Balakot, which is today, challenges of managing cross-border air strikes are worth recalling. Prevention of high-stake military action — initiation or retaliation — from escalation is the challenge. Recent air, drone and missile strikes in the subcontinent and West Asia demonstrate diminishing appetite for war and conflict. Whenever a conflictual incident has occurred, the immediate aim has been to de-escalate. Uri, Doklam, Balakot and the targetted assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani demonstrated marked preference for containment and defusion rather than confrontation or escalation. A classic case of the absence of escalation control occurred during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war where both sides played tit-for-tat.

Pakistan launched Operation Gibraltar, attacking by infiltrating Jammu & Kashmir. India retaliated at Hajipir and Kishanganga bulge in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Pakistan responded in Chhamb-Jauriyan. Pressed against the wall in Chhamb, India called in its Indian Air Force (IAF) and crossed the International Border (IB) in Sialkot and Lahore sectors, taking the war into the Punjab plains. Rawalpindi had believed its war would be confined to Jammu & Kashmir.

Now compare India’s surgical strikes in Uri and Balakot with the US drone strike against Soleimani. Language and vocabulary employed following these incidents make it clear that both the initiator and the responder aimed at de-escalation. Both the US and India have tried to alter the behaviour of Iran and Pakistan respectively, making both end their use of terrorism as instruments of State policy. In retaliation to the acts of terrorism, neither has wanted escalation after they initiated pre-emptive strikes or acted in anticipatory self-defence — a terminology used by India and the US. Although India’s air strike in Balakot was in retaliation to the Pulwama suicide attack, it was presented as pre-emptive action to ward off imminent terrorist attacks. The US drone strike on Soleimani was portrayed as revenge for earlier Iranian attacks on American interests and its allies in the Gulf region as also to prevent future attacks. As India wanted no escalation, it stated upfront that air attacks targetted the terrorist bases and that no further action was planned. The read-out was similar to pre-emptive attacks in 2016 against terrorist launch pads as reprisal for Uri. By completely denying Indian attacks, Pakistan absolved itself of any response.

But in reaction to Balakot, where the IAF struck for the first time inside Pakistan after the 1971 war and not in PoK, a Pakistani retaliation was inevitable. It came swiftly the next day when a package of F-16s crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and dropped their payload in Nowshera in a void, not on Indian military installations to obviate escalation. But Indian fighter jets scrambled, and in the dogfight, India claimed shooting down of a F-16 while Pakistan shot down a MiG 21 Bison, taking its pilot hostage. Content with retribution but intent on de-escalation, Pakistan agreed to return the pilot, though under US pressure. Pakistan’s announcement of the release of the pilot and India’s declaration that there would be no response to the Nowshera foray hastened the process of de-escalation .

Now compare Balakot with the US drone strike that eliminated Soleimani. Washington explained the operation as anticipatory self-defence. In order to deter wider conflict and asymmetric retaliation by Iran, the US counselled proportionate response even as Tehran put a bounty of $80 million on US President Donald Trump’s head. Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said: “The US’ act of international terrorism targetting and assassinating Gen Soleimani is extremely dangerous and foolish escalation. The US bears responsibility for all the consequences of its rogue adventurism.” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised revenge, which came through 12 precision-guided missile strikes against two US bases in Iraq, which were programmed to cause no harm to its soldiers and assets (like Pakistan bombing in Nowshera) to minimise scope for escalation despite Trump’s high-octane warnings for reprisals.

Retribution delivered, Zarif said: “Action taken in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter has been concluded. We do not seek escalation or war.” Like Pakistan’s retaliatory strikes after Balakot caused no harm to India, Iranian missiles were sanitised to avoid escalation. Trump chose to step back and imposed only additional sanctions on Iran. For consumption of domestic audience, the Pakistan Air Force claimed causing huge damage in Nowshera.

Similarly, Iran fed its people the fake news that 80 US terrorists had been killed in revenge attacks. At the same time, it was able to demonstrate the impressive capability of its missiles, which were fired for the first time outside Iran in Iraq after the Iran-Iraq war. Neither the US nor Iran targetted each other’s territory. The US was deterred from escalation by the threat of stepped up asymmetric Iranian response against more than 70,000 American troops in the region scattered over US bases in 10 allied countries.

While in India-Pakistan conflicts the nuclear bomb was a factor for deterrence, in the US-Iran fight it was not. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed during an election rally after Balakot that he had a couple of missiles ready for launch in case the Indian pilot was not released.

Although both the ground and air strikes launched across the LoC/IB were in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Uri and Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir, New Delhi did not invoke Article 51 and the right to self-defence to retaliate. Instead, it utilised the principle of pre-emption to thwart imminent attacks in both cases. Arguably between pre-emptive action and anticipatory self-defence, the latter is more acceptable in international law.

While the US invoked anticipatory self-defence in eliminating Soleimani, Iran used the right to self-defence in attacking American bases. The problem arises while responding to non-State actors like India did in response to Jaish-e-Mohammed attacks in Uri and Pulwama. It specifically targetted terrorist launch pads/training bases in Pakistan, the country supporting/sponsoring terrorist groups and on whose soil they were located. The UN Charter covers only armed attacks by one State against another State under Article 51 that covers self-defence provision. In the US-Iran case, America attacked a terrorist entity in a third country, Iraq, and Iran, too, responded in Iraq.

Restraint and de-escalation have ensured that the imminent threat of war in West Asia has passed, though tensions remain. But another Pulwama or Uri will set alarm bells ringing again. On assuming charge, Army chief Gen MM Naravane warned Pakistan of pre-emptive strikes to deter cross-border terrorism. For military action, pre-emptive or in anticipatory self-defence to be salutary, it has to be executed periodically against terrorists bases like what the Israelis do: Mowing the grass in Gaza. But comparing Gaza with PoK/Pakistan will be wrong. Surgical air and ground strikes — even after the induction of Rafale — will not be the new normal as they were made out by the BJP during election rallies.

1,26-2-20,"Trump, the salesman","There were no big takeaways except strategic convergence from the US President’s visit and light-footing on thorny issues

There may not be too many big takeaways from the visit of US President Donald Trump to India as the trajectory of Indo-US relations has been only going up despite regime changes with respective heads of State striking up some sort of optical chemistry. The civil nuclear deal began a new season of engagement, one that has helped each fill up the other’s strategic requirement. For the US, there’s our sizeable market and value as a bulwark against a hegemonic China in the region. For India, that has meant de-hyphenation from Pakistan and the US’ own narrowed down zoom of our neighbour’s relevance in the strategic backyard of Afghanistan, humouring it within that context. It has also meant US endorsement of the changed status of Kashmir. So this visit would have yielded as much had Trump or Modi not pushed Yeh Dosti visuals. The continuity of the Indo-US relations is no more in doubt. The greatest takeaways are, therefore, for the two men who are bound by a similar personality, politics and ideology, of justifying even autocracy and divisive excesses as putting their nations first. To that extent, Trump has wisely chosen India to build up momentum for his campaign at home, besmirched by the impeachment move. He has simply used India’s demographics and population to prove a US President has magnified his global popularity. Hence the preoccupation with the scale of events and spectacles. Considering that he has yet to broker a worthwhile truce despite his global ambitions to be seen as a peacemaker or a big enough economic pact that justifies his protectionist policies, the big defence deals with India will give him a talking point about generating jobs back home. Apart from the billions that Indian companies will be investing in the US energy market. For Modi, the ceremonial genuflection is intended for the same reason, to prove that his leadership has the endorsement of none other than the US President and that for all the opposition by both political parties and civil society at home, he has the US-sanctioned trust and a broader silence on Kashmir, no matter the pyrrhic bursts of angst. Yes, there’s a subtext in the larger hyperboles of stronger ties and comradeship, like the mention of India’s diversity as a democracy and Pakistan’s efforts at curbing terrorism, albeit at US insistence. Also, Trump renewed his willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, leaving it up to Modi to decide. He even mentioned religious freedoms, saying a lookback would prove that India had worked hard for religious freedom and that Modi wasn’t against it. That was a not so subtle hint about the historical timeline and the changed contemporary situation. And while he announced that India was all for Afghan peace, the Government would be anxious about the Taliban’s role in the new regime, one that would be controlled by Pakistan and one it would use to extract some concessions from the US that is dependent on it. The US has definitely softened towards our neighbour of late. And in insisting that the 5G network be used in a transparent and accountable manner and not as a conduit of censorship, there was a hidden message for India, too, though the target implied was China. Clearly, Trump doesn’t forget to remind us of our weaknesses and his coercive strengths. There was a gentle heave, not a hard push though.

The economic partnership is a work in progress, and India won’t be as servile as the US expects it to be. Trump has been punishing on that front, taking us out from the Generalised System of Preferences List, saying India is no longer a “developing” country. The tit-for-tat tariff war continues and although we have cut import duties on the Harley Davidson by about 50 per cent, Trump reiterated it again. The US also wants access to our dairy and medical devices market. Both are tricky for India, the former because we need to protect our status as the world’s largest milk producer, the latter because of affordable prices of Indian variants. Still a workable middle path would come about ultimately. The big defence deals on acquisition of Apache and M-60 helicopters will not only up India’s defence shield but end our over-dependence on Russian products. The inter-military operability coupled with the US’ upgradation of India in the Asian Pacific region — already defined by renaming the geopolitical sphere as Indo-Pacific — shows that India is a strong ally in the US counter-weight efforts. Trump has also injected new energy in the Quad initiative by reiterating his commitment to it. India has a tough job then in assuaging Russian anxieties, no matter how deep our one-to-one engagement, first because of the defence sales and second because of Russian discomfort over the re-classification of the Pacific region. Of course, there is a commonality with the US of countering terrorism, with both sides going to town over it. But Trump never forgot to publicise his authorship in this project. Clearly, that’s a deal that no nation can negotiate on its terms.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump--the-salesman-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/trump--the-salesman.html
2,26-2-20,Delhi aflame,"After peaceful protests, the violence over CAA shows how polarities have now been weaponised politically

An ominous situation has been allowed to develop yet again in the national capital, rendering it unsafe, giving an impression of a rage-filled India at a time when a presidential visit is under way. Delhi’s north-east is now the new battleground over the pros and cons of a new citizenship law and in just three days, more than 10 deaths have been reported, more than 100 have been injured and a reign of terror continues with incidents of stone-pelting, torching of vehicles and houses. Democratic dissent is allowed and Delhi has shown how to keep it peaceful despite sit-ins. The citizenship protesters, who began the stir over the imposed classification of identities, were consistent in their single-mindedness to effect a change in civic discourse. Their resilience is no doubt politically uncomfortable but has inflammatory potential, too, one that is being encashed by the politics of the day and being swiftly turned into a communal war. Claims and counter-claims have been made about the protests being manufactured but will the blame-game change anything on the ground or will it compel the Government to tamp down tension? One of the loudest messages from the Delhi Assembly elections, where the BJP suffered a severe jolt, was that Indian voters reward those leaders who shun divisive politics. But the steep loss hasn’t forced a rethink in the BJP, which is now encouraging rabble-rousers to go all out in defending the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which is pivoted on exclusion against the spirit of the Constitution, and though not in isolation, but in tandem with other profiling-based census, could legitimise the politics of otherisation. So there was Kapil Mishra, whose anti-CAA statements and videos did the rounds during the Delhi Assembly elections, egging on lumpens and encouraging hate rhetoric all over again. Such leaders have been so emboldened that they issued an ultimatum to the Delhi Police to clear the roads of anti-CAA protesters in the wake of Trump’s visit to India.

One expected the Delhi Police to recalibrate its approach in ensuring law and order but as has been the norm, it failed to restore calm. After a meeting with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union Home Minister Shah assured him of every help, since police comes under his Ministry, but didn’t do anything to rein in flagrant party cadres. With a huge mandate, Kejriwal should not bother about his administrative powers but must use the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP’s) mohalla networks to address people’s concerns. That’s what is needed exactly till, of course, the Supreme Court takes the final call on the CAA. One hopes the national mindset isn’t poisoned till then.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-aflame-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/delhi-aflame.html
3,26-2-20,Temple priest hacked to death,"In a sensational incident, priest of a temple in Ballia was found hacked to death under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday morning. Senior officers rushed to the spot to supervise investigation and the body was sent for autopsy.

Reports said that Vishnu Brahmchari, who hailed from Rajasthan, was the priest at Balaji Temple in Bisalpur area of Philibhit for the last few years. On Monday morning, he was found murdered under mysterious circumstances. According to Additional SP (Philibhit) Rohit Mishra, who reached the spot along with local police and investigated the case, the priest went to the temple for morning prayers on Tuesday. He said circumstantial evidence hinted that assailants were also present in the temple at that time and they attacked him with sharp-edged weapons.

A milkman spotted the body lying in a pool of blood. He raised an alarm after which local police were informed. Mishra said another priest was also engaged for the same temple and he, along with his family members, was found missing. He said they were making efforts to trace the other priest so that it could be confirmed whether his disappearance had anything to do with the killing, or some other criminals were involved.

He said that on the complaint of the manager of the trust, which runs the temple, they registered a case against unidentified persons and were making efforts to get some clue which could help them zero in on the accused. A case was registered in this regard while further investigations were on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/temple-priest----hacked-to-death.html
4,26-2-20,‘No incident of stray animals destroying crops’,"The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday informed the Assembly that there has been no incident of stray animals destroying agricultural fields in the state.

State Jal Shakti Minister Dr Mahendra Singh, replying to a question in UP Assembly, categorically said that there was no incident of stray animals destroying standing crops.

He also refused to entertain the demand of SP member Dr Manoj Kumar Pandey regarding compensation to the farmers whose fields were destroyed, saying there were no such norms and besides, no such incident happened.

The minister further claimed that the agriculture production of the state had increased and was increasing every year, and it was an evidence that standing crops were not being destroyed by stray animals.

However, the opposition members raised the issue of stray animals behind road accidents and farmers being killed in some of them. The minister said that farmers were covered under the accident insurance scheme, which gives them compensation in case of any mishap.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---no-incident-of-stray----animals-destroying-crops---.html
5,26-2-20,Sengar loses UP Assembly membership,"Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been disqualified as the member of Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha, following his conviction in the rape case by a Delhi session’s court in December.

Sengar is the second MLA elected on the BJP ticket in 2017 UP Assembly elections to be disqualified from the membership following conviction in a criminal case. Earlier, BJP MLA from Hamirpur in Bundelkhand region Ashok Chandel was disqualified from the membership of UP Assembly in April 2019 after the Allahabad High Court upheld his conviction in a murder case of 1998, in which four brothers were killed.

In a notification issued by the UP Vidhan Sabha Secretariat on Tuesday, Sengar has been deemed disqualified with effect from December 20, 2019, and his Bangarmau seat in Unnao has been declared vacant.

The Delhi court had pronounced its verdict of life imprisonment on December 20, 2019 and Sengar has been deemed disqualified from that date. Election Commission sources said the bypolls would be held for Bangarmau seat soon.

Sengar is a four-term MLA, who was accused of rape by a girl from his village (Makhi). The girl attempted self-immolation outside the Chief Minister’s residence in April 2017 after the police did not take action on her complaint.

The rape victim’s father, who was arrested by the police, had died in police custody two days later, after he was beaten up in the lock-up allegedly by Sengar’s brother Atul Sengar. Following public outrage, the Chief Minister had handed over the case to the CBI, and Kuldeep Sengar and his brother Atul apart from others were arrested.

In July 2019, the rape victim had met with a road mishap in Rae Bareli. Her two female relatives had died in the car crash while she and her lawyer were grievously injured.

Both were airlifted to Delhi for treatment and the family alleged that Kuldeep Sengar had masterminded the accident. However, the CBI did not find any evidence of Sengar’s involvement in the accident.

The Supreme Court had ordered that all cases related to the rape case be heard in Delhi, where a session’s court convicted Kuldeep Sengar in the rape case in December and awarded him life sentence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sengar-loses----up-assembly--membership.html

7,26-2-20,India must remain alert,"Though Pakistan is unlikely to openly promote cross-border terror as long as the sword of FATF continues to hang over it, Islamabad would continue to back terrorism clandestinely

Despite intensive lobbying by Islamabad and cosmetic measures to convince the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to take it off the grey list in which it was placed in June 2018, the international watchdog has once again placed Pakistan in the said list with a stern warning to be prepared to be placed in the blacklist if it does not complete the full action plan by June.

This was not the first time that Pakistan was being named and clubbed with countries like Ethiopia, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and Yemen. It had been similarly shamed in the past in 2008 and then again from 2012 to 2015. In June 2018, Pakistan was given an action plan, to be completed by October 2019, or face the risk of being blacklisted, the ultimate death knell for its shattered economy. The FATF’s reasoning is Pakistan’s “structural deficiencies” in anti-money laundering (AML) activities and combating financing of terrorism (CFT). However, Pakistan failed to implement the action plan to be able to negotiate an exit from the grey list. At the same time it successfully averted being Blacklisted with the support of China, Malaysia and Turkey and was given additional time to comply.

To understand the charter of FATF and why Pakistan is on its target list, it is necessary to understand the terms money laundering and terror financing. In simple terms, laundering pertains to disguising cash earned from a crime as funds earned through legitimate sources. The crime could be corruption, drug trafficking, fake currency, fraud or tax evasion. Terrorist financing involves collection of funds to support acts of terror or terrorist organisations. The key difference between the two is that, in money laundering, the source of funds has to be a crime. In the financing of terrorism, money may come from perfectly legitimate sources, such as donations from citizens, but the purpose has to be a crime. Pakistan has been charged with both and is accused of supporting terror groups like the Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba. Hizbul Mujahideen and the Taliban.

However, Islamabad denies this and plays the victim card. It quotes the Global Terrorism Index, 2017 by the Institute of Economics and Peace that ranks Pakistan as the fifth country most affected by terrorism, after Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Syria. Pakistan’s leadership feels that its placement in the grey list is far more political than financial. Nothing can be farther from the truth since Islamabad’s role as a fountainhead of terror has been exposed to the world on numerous occasions. Pakistan today is known the world over for not only producing global terrorists but also harbouring, training and financing various jihadi organisations, particularly those involved in cross-border terror against India and Afghanistan. Ever since its placement in the grey list, Pakistan has been seeing it as an attempt by the USA to put pressure on it to “do more” on issues related to terrorism, as had been openly demanded by the US President Donald Trump. Pakistan is also convinced that if the US can have it placed on the grey list, it can also make it easy for it to exit the list, if Islamabad is somehow able to contribute to American interests in the region. While it has been making cosmetic attempts to institute measures as per the plan of action suggested by the FATF, it has been concentrating more on lobbying and diplomacy to convince the US and other members through it, to remove it from the list of “not so good guys.”

In the absence of any visible and concrete measures to mend “structural deficiencies” in AML and CTF, it was widely believed that Pakistan would be blacklisted during its October 2019 plenary at the end of the 15-month notice. Due to its burgeoning debt and shattered economy Pakistan could ill-afford it. Pakistan was shocked when the FATF Asia-Pacific Group put it in the Blacklist in its meeting held in August 2019, when its members found that the country was non-compliant on 32 out of 40 parameters. Islamabad put its diplomatic machinery in action to garner the crucial three votes needed to prevent it from being blacklisted. With China in the chair, Pakistan felt assured of one vote. However, after Beijing agreed to list Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, it was widely believed that it would behave more maturely. But in the end China’s huge investment in Pakistan and the strategic relationship between the two nations tilted the balance in Islamabad’s favour. Ultimately, it succeeded in garnering the necessary three votes and continue in the grey list. Though it noted that Pakistan had addressed only five out of the 27 tasks given to it for AML and CTF, it asked Islamabad to act swiftly and complete the full action plan by February.

Since terrorism is an instrument of Pakistan’s national policy and the real power centre in the country is its Army which uses cross-border terrorism as part of its military strategy, it is well-nigh impossible for that country to divorce itself from terrorism. It once again doubled its lobbying and diplomatic efforts. Prime Minister Imran Khan dashed to the friendly member countries and the USA to garner support. This time it found the US to be more amenable than before, since it needed Pakistan’s assistance in Afghanistan and Iran. With China and the US on its side, Pakistan took a few measures including the arrest of Hafiz Saeed and custody of Azhar Masood. It got a shot in the arm when, during its three-day review meeting held in Beijing in January, the FATF noted that Pakistan had taken satisfactory steps against terror groups. It evaluated Islamabad’s compliance efforts in relation to AML and CTF as satisfactory. Member countries like the US, UK, Japan, Australia and New Zealand did not raise any concern this time. Pakistan’s game plan of successful lobbying at the cost of compliance was bearing fruit. The logic was simple. It was an election year in the USA and Trump needed Pakistan’s assistance. This appeared to have shaped the US’ stance to go soft on Pakistan during the February plenary in Paris. It accordingly convinced its allies and Pakistan, which was at one time facing the prospect of being blacklisted at the end of the October plenary, now began dreaming of an exit from the grey list also.

India, which knew the ground reality well as it has been the worst sufferer of Pak-sponsored terrorism, including money laundering and financing of the separatist movement in Kashmir, got a rude shock, as it was hoping that Pakistan would definitely be blacklisted. Having understood the US’ game plan, India began to act swiftly to minimise the danger by ensuring that Pakistan did not get off the grey list till its compliance was fully confirmed. New Delhi began to exert its influence to ensure that Pakistan was unable to garner the support of 15-16 member nations needed to remove it from the grey list. It provided dossiers and sufficient evidence to the FATF of Pakistan’s continued involvement in money laundering and terror financing. India was apprehensive that any such decision by the anti-terror body would provide oxygen to terrorist groups, leading to increase in terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, where Pakistan is desperately trying to revive militancy.

India keenly participated in the FATF plenary held in Paris which culminated on February 21. In order to ease the pressure on itself from the anti-terror body, Pakistan sentenced Hafiz Saeed for two terror crimes with the sentence to run concurrently a week before the plenary. While the US expressed satisfaction, India questioned Pakistan’s intent by pointing out the timing of the sentence and the fact that it was subject to appeal in the higher court. India also raised questions about Azhar Masood, Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim, who continue to enjoy the patronage of the Pakistani Government and roam freely. India also exposed Pakistan’s lie that Azhar Masood was “missing” by providing evidence that he was under Pakistan military’s safe custody at Bhawalpur.

Another area of concern for New Delhi was the fake Indian currency racket being run by Pakistan, as its prime interest is to promote espionage, destabilise the economy and finance terror. Hence, India continued to insist on complete compliance with the FATF action plan.

While Pakistan will aim to exit the grey list at the earliest, India must continue to press for total compliance. Despite, the FATF observing that Pakistan had largely addressed 14 of 27 action items, with varying levels of progress made on the rest of the plan, it decided to keep it on the grey list till June.

India is certainly disappointed with the outcome and Pakistan will take satisfaction from the fact that it has succeeded in avoiding being on the Blacklist. But one thing is certain, its strategy of lobbying at the cost of action has suffered a major setback and it has failed yet again. It will continue on the FATF grey list with its resultant repercussions. India can heave a sigh of relief for now since Pakistan is unlikely to openly support and promote cross-border terror as long as the sword of FATF continues to hang over its head. However it would continue to fuel unrest and back terrorism clandestinely.

India not only needs to keep its eyes and ears open but simultaneously up the diplomatic offensive against Pakistan to expose it to the international community. The risk of being blacklisted in June may restrain Pakistan to some extent but the prospect of continued support from China, Turkey and Malaysia along with tacit support from the US will encourage it to yet again depend more on lobbying than action. In the ultimate analysis, India will have to sort out cross-border terror from Pakistan on its own.

8,26-2-20,"Praise, not punish Assange","We don’t always respond to the whistle-blowers’ revelations as fast as they would hope. But they are indispensable to keep the level of deceit down

The cost of being a whistle-blower is going up in today’s world. When Daniel Ellsberg stole and published the Pentagon Papers in 1971, revealing the monstrous lies that the US Government was telling the American public and the Congress about the Vietnam War, he was arrested for his disclosure. Later he was charged with conspiracy, espionage, theft of Government property and tried, but in the end the court set him free.

Then came Edward Snowden who released a vast trove of documents from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 when he was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European Governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy. When Snowden released the documents he was already abroad, knowing that civil liberties had taken a turn for the worse in the country since 1971. Snowden is still abroad seven years later, living in Moscow, because hardly anywhere else would be safe.

And Julian Assange, whose court hearing on a US extradition request began on Monday at Woolwich Crown Court in east London, is facing 175 years in prison if Britain delivers him into American hands. The US authorities are really cross about his WikiLeaks dump of confidential material in 2010 that detailed US misbehaviour in Iraq and Afghanistan. Everybody knew or at least suspected that terrible things were happening there, but without documentation there was really nothing they could do about it. What Assange did was give them the evidence. The most striking piece of evidence was a video and audio clip from an Apache helicopter gunship attacking civilians in Baghdad in 2007. The crew spray their targets with machine-gun fire, making comments like, “It’s their fault for bringing their kids into battle” and “Oh yeah, look at those dead b*@#&*ds.” They even target people in a vehicle that stops to help the wounded.

As for the claims of the US authorities that Assange has “blood on his hands” — as his 2010 data dump endangered the lives of some of those who were mentioned in the documents — there is not a shred of evidence that this is so. If anyone had come to harm over the past nine years as a result of his actions, don’t you think that the US Government would have trumpeted it to the skies?

The whistle-blowers are among our last remaining checks on the contemptuous ease with which those who control information seek to manipulate the rest of us. We don’t always respond to the whistle-blowers’ revelations as fast and as strongly as they would hope but they are indispensable to keep the level of deceit down. They should be praised, not punished.

So what are the chances that Assange will escape extradition to the US and a lifetime in prison? His lawyers will doubtless argue that nobody was harmed as a result of his revelations (except perhaps their reputations for truthfulness) and that nobody profited by them. A British court might look unfavourably on an extradition request that is brought out of sheer vindictiveness.

The story that US President Donald Trump contacted Assange through an intermediary, former Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, might also help. Trump was allegedly offering to pardon Assange if the Australian would confirm that it wasn’t the Russians who gave him the Hillary Clinton campaign emails he released during the 2016 election campaign. This has all been denied by both Rohrabacher and the Trump White House, but in carefully phrased ways that leave room for suspicion. Trump’s recent denial that he doesn’t know Rohrabacher and never spoke to him is especially suspect, since he invited the man to the White House for a one-on-one meeting in April, 2017. British courts will not extradite if the request is politically motivated. But Assange’s best chance probably lies elsewhere. During the seven years when he lived in Ecuador’s Embassy in London as a political asylum-seeker, a Spanish security company called UC Global installed cameras in every corner of Assange’s space in the Embassy and live-streamed every contact and conversation he had, including with his lawyers, directly to the CIA. I don’t know how a British court will respond to that information, but I think I know how an American court would react. That’s how Ellsberg got off in 1971: The Government tapped his phone conversations (and sent burglars to break into his psychiatrist’s office and steal his file), so the judge dismissed the case because the Government’s behaviour was outrageous and no fair trial was possible. There will be many appeals, both in the UK and maybe later in the US and Assange will not draw a free breath for a long time, if ever. But in the meantime, here’s one happy ending.

Snowden couldn’t tell his girlfriend his plans before he left the US and released his documents, because that would have made her his accomplice. She was angry at first but she forgave him, married him in 2017 and lives with him in Russia now.

9,26-2-20,Are we truly advancing women’s rights?,"There are countries where gestational limits are higher or where there is no limit prescribed and abortion is a woman’s right. In India it is still a conditional right. In its current form, the MTP Amendment Bill, 2020 cannot be termed as progressive or women-centric

The Union Cabinet’s approval of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in January set the stage for a small though belated step forward. Since this is only the second time that the MTP Act is being amended in its 49 years of existence, the news managed to create quite a buzz. Initial reports suggested that the gestational limit for abortion had been increased from 20 to 24 weeks, for all women, which was welcomed by many. However, the fine print reinforces the view that the increase in gestational limit is only for “special categories of women” (vulnerable women including survivors of rape, victims of incest, differently-abled, minors and so on). The move to remove the upper gestation limit in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities is indeed welcome, but it comes with a rider. Medical Boards — whose composition, functions and other details will be prescribed subsequently in Rules under the Act — will decide if women can have an abortion on this ground. It moves the decision-making from the woman and her doctor to a medical board comprising multiple members, thereby legitimising third-party authorisation, which was never the intention of the original MTP Act. Subjecting women to multiple medical checkups and assessment by an unfamiliar board in no way advances their rights and surely does not seem to keep their interests at the centre.

The MTP Act guarantees women confidentiality, an aspect valued greatly by women who seek abortion care. Under the Act, the name and other particulars of the women terminating a pregnancy can be shared only if ordered by the courts. The Cabinet-approved amendments include a clause, “the name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed, except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force.” This could be problematic for many women, especially vulnerable ones. Over the years, we have seen barriers to abortion care increase due to conflation of the MTP Act with Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The proposed amendment could enable officials implementing these two Acts and even the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (which governs medical abortion drugs) to seek information on women seeking termination of pregnancy from doctors and chemists, compromising client confidentiality and putting them at risk.

For any legislation or policy to be hailed as landmark or progressive, it should benefit a vast majority of the target audience it is meant to serve or it should be expanding the boundaries on the issue it seeks to address. The proposed amendments fail this test miserably. For the overwhelming majority of the estimated 15.6 million women (over 99 per cent) who seek to terminate their pregnancy every year, the amendment does not change anything. Even for the small number of women who will benefit, the amendments do not go far enough. Many countries, both developed and underdeveloped, including some in the subcontinent already have a much liberal abortion law.

There are countries where gestational limits are higher or where there is no limit prescribed and abortion is a woman’s right. In India it is still a conditional right. The proposal requiring the opinion of just one provider up to 20 weeks’ gestation is indeed useful for women who seek termination in the second trimester, as opposed to the current requirement of opinions of two providers.

To summarise, the proposed amendments addresses, to some extent, only the tip of the iceberg. For the vast majority of women who need to terminate a pregnancy, the amendments will not make any difference. It is unlikely to make any dent in maternal mortality and morbidity due to unsafe abortions. Even when compared to the draft MTP Amendment Bill, 2014, developed after wide ranging consultation with a number of experts and stakeholders, the proposed amendments seem inadequate.

In its current form, the MTP Amendment Bill, 2020, cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed as progressive, women-centric or advancing women’s rights and agency. The full draft of the Bill is yet to be circulated widely and hopefully there are no more nasty surprises in store.

The intention of the Government seems to be right but the execution seems to fall short. Hopefully some of the issues can be addressed when the Rules under the Act are framed.

Given the advances in medical technology, the current discourse on women’s rights and available evidence, it is an opportune time to make the MTP Act truly women-centric. Women’s health and rights in general and abortion in particular, are increasingly under threat globally. A great opportunity exists for India to take a leadership role in setting the global agenda.

This would require the Government to review what is proposed and overhaul the amendments, so that a contemporary MTP Act, which serves the needs of women and advances their rights, is tabled in the Parliament. If this opportunity is not grabbed, we will be failing 50 per cent of our population. Will Indian women have to wait for another two decades to exercise full control over their bodies?

10,26-2-20,SP members stage walkout over ‘fake encounters’,"Samajwadi Party members staged a walkout from Uttar Pradesh Assembly during the Question Hour after the Parliamentary Affairs Minister claimed that there was not a single fake encounter in the state between July 2017 and September 2018.

Listing several instances of killing of “innocents by police in cold blood” in the name of encounters, Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary alleged that the BJP government has given the police free hand to kill people. He demanded compensation to the families of those killed in fake encounters.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, replying to a question of BSP member Shyam Sunder Sharma, clarified that there was not a single case of fake encounter. “There was just one case of a policeman killing a person in Lucknow and two policemen were sent to jail in that connection and also removed from the service,” he said.

Khanna further said that all the encounters were done to eliminate the criminals who were posing a grave threat to the society. He added that five policemen, including a sub-inspector, were also killed in encounters with the criminals during that period.

Not satisfied with the reply, the SP members walked out of the House.

In another question by SP member Ujjawal Raman Singh over the rising crime against women in the state, Khanna claimed that it has come down by 5-7 per cent.

The Opposition members, quoting NCRB report, claimed that the crime rate against women has gone up but Chaudhary termed the government’s report fabricated.

Singh also said that crime against women during the previous Samajwadi Party regime was less than what is reported in the BJP rule. He claimed that there are 32 cases of dowry reported every day in UP, besides 52 cases of rape and 161 cases of molestation on a daily basis. He said the number of these crime was much lower during the previous regime.

However, the treasury bench rejected the figures presented by the Opposition and Khanna said that photocopy of the report cannot be authentic.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said 21 people have been killed in riots and over 400 policemen injured in stone-pelting incidents over the past six months.

While replying to a question by Rakesh Pratap Singh (SP), Yogi said that in the last six months, 21 persons were killed in riots, protests and sit-in in the state. In incidents of stone-pelting by protesters, 400 policemen were injured and 61 policemen sustained firearm injuries, he said in a reply in writing.

The deaths apparently took place during the anti-CAA violence in December last year, but the question and the CM’s reply had no mention of this.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-members-stage-walkout----over----fake-encounters---.html

In his two-hour address that marked the opening of the assembly’s Budget session, Dattatreya also welcomed the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict that has paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple.

Dattatreya said a single Constitution is now in force after the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370, bringing the entire nation from Kashmir to Kanyakumari under one tricolour. “This became possible only because of the guidance of a strong leadership in the country,” he said,” reflecting the views of the two-year-old BJP government in the state.

“My government endorses these decisions and congratulates the Centre for taking these unprecedented decisions,” he said.

The Governor listed out the policies and programmes of the Jai Ram Thakur Government, saying it has lived up to the promises made during the assembly polls. He said the Centre has sanctioned to the state 327 schemes amounting to Rs 2,896 crore under ''Jal Jeevan Mission'' on drinking water.

VIPIN PARMAR TO BE NEW SPEAKER

Himachal Pradesh Health Minister Vipin Parmar is set to be appointed as the new Speaker of the State Assembly after becoming the only candidate on Tuesday to file the nomination paper for the post.

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur proposed his nomination as the BJP candidate for the post. The notice was seconded by Nahan MLA and former speaker Rajeev Bindal.

Bindal, who quit the Speaker's post on January 16, was later elected as the State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president.

The opposition Congress did not file any nomination for the post as it has only 21 members in the 68-member House. The ruling BJP has a total of 44 MLAs whereas the CPI(M) has a lone MLA. Two independent MLAs are supporting the BJP.

Parmar is a law graduate and MLA from Sullah assembly constituency. He was elected to the State Legislative Assembly for the first time in 1998. He was re-elected as MLA in 2007 and 2017. He was inducted into the Council of Ministers as Health Minister along with the portfolios of Medical Education, Ayurveda and Science and Technology on December 27, 2017.

The division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice RC Khulbe also asked the State Government to also respond on whether the PIL is sustainable or not.

It is pertinent to mention here that in his PIL, Swamy has contended that the Devsthanam Act is unconstitutional.

Swamy said that in the past, similar decisions had been taken in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.

He had filed petitions against these decisions in the Supreme Court and won the cases. He further said that there are various decisions on the Supreme Court in such matters. Swamy has also opined that the decision of the State Government is against the policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Swamy has also requested in his petition that the Government not take any further action until the matter is in the court.

16,26-2-20,EA threatens boycott during Budget Session,"The Uttarakhand General, OBC employees association, the powerful federation of employees has threatened work boycott during the upcoming budget session of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha.

The association is demanding that Uttarakhand government should implement the order of Supreme Court (SC) on reservation in promotions and remove the ban imposed on the promotions.

The association which claims to have over 2.5 lakh employees has given a call for indefinite strike from March 2. Incidentally the budget session of Uttarakhand assembly is commencing from March 3 at Gairsain.

The president of the association, Deepak Joshi told The Pioneer that the thousands of employees have retired without promotion in last few months due to the ban imposed on the promotions. “After the landmark judgement of the SC, the employees are now in no mood to wait and suffer,’’ he said.

Reacting sharply to the recent statement of Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Pradip Tamta, Joshi said that the politicians should refrain from commenting on such a sensitive issue.

He said that the members of the association would burn effigy of the Congress leader at all district headquarters on Wednesday. The association has decided to hold a massive protest outside the residence of Tamta at Almora on the day. Joshi said that Mashal marches would be held in different parts of the state on Wednesday evening.

He claimed that the association is receiving support of similar associations in different parts of the country and on February 29, representatives of many states would arrive in Dehradun to hold discussion with the office bearers of the association of Uttarakhand. “We have sought time for meeting the CM Rawat on February 29. We don’t want to create problems for the government, we are part of it,’’ he said.

While hearing a Special Leave Petition (SLP), the SC on February 7 had opined that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and said that the reservation is not a fundamental right. The SLP was filed by the Uttarakhand government against the Uttarakhand High Court (HC) order in Gyanchand Vs state case. This order has brought a sharp schism among the employees on caste lines. The general and OBC employees want that there should be no reservation in promotion while the SC and ST want that the benefit of reservation should be extended to them in promotions also.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ea-threatens-boycott-during-budget-session.html
17,26-2-20,"Forensic Science, Ayush univs to come up in UP","Uttar Pradesh is all set to get two new universities (Forensic Science and Ayush) to produce experts and help the state make a mark. Besides, the government also changed the name of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Urdu-Arabi-Farsi University (Lucknow) to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Bhasha University.

The state cabinet, which met on Tuesday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, gave its approval to the proposal. Bills of both the universities will be presented in the ongoing budget session of the state legislature. Sources said that Uttar Pradesh Police and Forensic Science University will be set up in Lucknow with an aim to produce scientists and experts in this field. It will not only impart education but also open avenues of vocational training.

At present, UP has five forensic laboratories in Lucknow, Agra, Varanasi, Ghaziabad and Moradabad while six more are coming up in Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Kannauj, Aligarh, Gonda and Jhansi. “With the number of crime cases needing forensic intervention going up, there are not enough hands to carry out the tests, as a result of which the probe gets delayed. This university will produce national and international-level scientists,” an official said.

He said students of neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka can also get admission to this university.

The cabinet also gave its approval to setting up of State Ayush University that will control Ayurvedic, Unani and Homoeopathy colleges. At present, there are eight state-run and 59 private Ayurvedic college controlled by Ayurved Directorate besides two state and 13 private Unani collages and nine government & three private homoeopathy colleges. These colleges come under respective state-run universities.

“The universities do not have expertise to control medical colleges so that the government decided to set up Ayush University. It will also bring uniformity in the syllabus and academic calendar of Unani, Ayurvedic, and Homoeopathic colleges,” the official said.

Justifying the decision to drop Urdu-Arabi-Farsi from Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti University, the official said that besides these three languages, others like Hindi, Sanskrit and Pali are also taught there.

“Besides, foreign languages like French, German and Japanese will also be introduced in near future. Thus, the name of the university was changed to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Bhasha University,” he added.

In another decision, the government authorised the Resident Commissioner, New Delhi, for maintenance and furnishing of offices taken on rent in the national capital. UPRNN was made the nodal agency. The government has allocated Rs 636.60 lakh for this project.

The cabinet approved a land for construction of a bus stand at Baberu in Banda district and also gave its assent for providing piped drinking water in fluoride, arsenic and encephalitis-hit regions of Bundelkhand and Vindh regions. It will include seven districts of Bundelkhand and two of Vindh regions. The total cost is expected to be Rs 15,722.89 crore.

25,26-2-20,Govt defends liquor policy despite Opposition’s attack,"Even as the Opposition created a ruckus on the new liquor policy of Haryana Government on the third day of the Budget Session of the Haryana Assembly on Tuesday, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that some of the provisions of the policy was made by Congress Government headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

Khattar said BJP-JJP Government has taken strong steps in the new excise policy to prevent sale of illicit liquor.

Speaking on the issue, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala , who also holds the Excise Department, said Haryana Government is considering changes in the law to ensure those accused of liquor smuggling do not get bail for six months. ""If anyone is caught in liquor smuggling, as per present provisions in the law, the offence is bailable and one gets bail within 15 days. However, we will soon make changes in the existing law making the offence non-bailable for six months,"" Chautala said.

The opposition Congress has slammed the BJP-JJP Government over the new excise policy alleging that various provisions of the new policy, which comes into effect from April 1, will encourage liquor addiction among youths.

Among other things, the policy provides that bars in Gurgaon, Faridabad and Panchkula will soon remain open till 1 am as against existing rules that doesn't allow them to run after midnight. The bars in these cities will be able to extend their closing time by another two hours after 1 am by paying an additional annual licence fee of Rs 10 lakh per hour.

The excise duty on beer across categories has been slashed by Rs 10 per bulk litre (BL) under the policy.

During the Zero hour, Congress MLA from Rohtak, B B Batra pointed out one of the provisions of the new policy, saying, ""You have allowed an individual to get a temporary licence and store six bottles of country liquor, 12 bottles of beer...rum, Indian Made Foreign Liquor…in this way one can open a mini liquor vend inside one's house and misuse it"".

Chautala told the House that the provision was made by the previous Congress regime in 2005-06. ""This provision was even during previous Congress Government... We are giving licence for 24-hour period on the condition that an individual will store liquor in his house for social functions like marriages. However, if anyone is found misusing the licence permit or storing liquor without permit, then we have made provision of imposing heavy fines,"" he said.

Chautala dismissed criticism that certain provisions in the new policy would encourage liquor addiction. He said under the policy, if any distillery is found selling liquor illegally, a fine of Rs 1 lakh will be imposed for first offence, Rs 2 lakh for second, Rs 5 lakh for third after which licence will be cancelled for subsequent offence.

Congress leader Kiran Choudhary said ""there is no doubt that liquor smuggling in the state is going on in a big way and this needs to be checked"".

""Under the policy, we have taken steps by which we can trace every bottle which comes out of distillery until it reaches end consumer. Also, flow meters will be installed in every distillery to monitor every drop which is produced,"" Chautala told the Congress member.

Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who is also the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, demanded withdrawal of the new policy, terming it as a ""recipe for disaster"".

""If this policy was so good, then why would Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala also criticise it. He too has demanded rollback of certain provisions of this policy,"" Hooda said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-defends-liquor-policy-despite-opposition---s-attack.html

37,26-2-20,Kartarpur corridor not to close down: Capt Amarinder,"Two major issues — Punjab police chief’s remarks on Kartarpur Corridor and allegations against the Cabinet Minister — that rocked Punjab Vidhan Sabha a day before, headed towards resolution on Tuesday with the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh clarifying the Government’s stand.

Underlining that the DGP Dinkar Gupta has already regretted his remarks and apologised, Capt Amarinder maintained that the Corridor would not be closed down despite Pak ISI’s “known” nefarious deigns and terror threats.

At the same time, Capt Amarinder vehemently defended to his Cabinet colleague, while brushing aside the Opposition’s demand to reopen 28-year-old cases against Bharat Bhushan Ashu pointing that the courts have acquitted him.

Capt Amarinder also declared that he would dismiss Punjab police “suspended” DSP Balwinder Singh Sekhon, who leveled allegations against Ashu, under Article 311 if the departmental probe declares him guilty.

However, “dissatisfied” opposition, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and SAD-BJP, staged a walk out demanding reopening of cases where trial was not held and Ashu’s dismissal from the State Cabinet.

Describing Ashu as the “competent Minister” and DSP Sekhon as “suspended and chargesheeted”, Capt Amarinder said that Congress leader was given a clean chit at every level.

After AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema pointed that allegations were leveled on the basis of Ashu’s confessional statement, Capt Amarinder said that all cases referred to by Sekhon had been scrutinized through judicial processes and no fresh evidence had been filed by the DSP, and Ashu had mentioned this in all his election affidavits.

Pointing out that Ashu was just 19 when his parents were killed, the Chief Minister said that TADA cases against him were examined by the Commission set up by the then Akali Government and Ashu was duly exonerated.

Cheema underlined that the trial was not held in the case, neither the challan was presented in other cases. “If 32-year-old case was reopened against SAD leader, why not this…what is the fault of those who have been killed…their families should be given justice…Ashu had confessed that he helped the terrorists,” he added.

Reacting, the Chief Minister asked that then why not acting against former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal who tore the Constitution.

“A lot happened in between…you were all kids. I know what Punjab had gone through….many thousands were killed…do you want to reopen all those cases. Do you want to talk about terrorism again,” asked Capt Amarinder.

Insisting the Government can reopen the cases of which the trial never held, including the Gur Mandi blast, Cheema asked the Government to table the report of all cases trials against Ashu in the House.

SAD MLa Bikram Singh Majithia pointed that DSP Sekhon was given inquiry in a matter by the former Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu in which Ashu’s name cropped up.

“Ashu made the confession before a gazetted officer that he harboured terrorists and helped them in Gur Mandi blast…Ashu was acquitted as carbon copies were provided and not the real confessional statement was provided before the court…he was not acquitted in a blast case where challan was not presented besides another case.

Intervening, the Speaker Rana KP Singh pointed that a FIR cannot stay if it does not have magistrate’s approval. Unhappy, SAD-BJP MLAs entered the well of the House sloganeering.

Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa asked why Parkash Singh Badal did not reopen these cases when he was the Chief Minister for 15 years.

As the Speaker did not allow any further discussion on the matter, AAP MLAs staged a walk out, followed by a walk out by the SAD-BJP MLAs.

Earlier addressing the House, Capt Amarinder asserted that had someone like Balwinder Singh Sekhon made such charges against a senior commander in the Army, he would have been court martialled and dismisses by now.

“He is only trying to conduct a media trial with his baseless charges…Unfortunately, this is not the army and Sekhon could not be court martialled,” said Capt Amarinder, asserting that if the departmental inquiry currently in progress against the ex-DSP finds him guilty, he (the Chief Minister) would personally ensure the officer’s dismissal under Article 311.

“This man (Sekhon) was thrown out of police force and even dismisses from duty on many serious charges. But he was reinstated later, and he is now making charges against my Minister,” said the Chief Minister, questioning the former DSP’s locus standii in making any statements or allegations against Ashu.

Later, talking to the mediapersons outside the House, the Chief Minister said that the issue was being raised by the Akalis after all these years purely for political reasons. “Why did they (Akalis) not reopen the cases during their regime if they felt there was something in it?” he asked.

DGP ALREADY APOLOGIZED, KARTARPUR CORRIDOR NEVER BE CLOSED DESPITE THREATS: CAPT ASSURES HOUSE

Underlining the need for vigilance against Pakistan’s nefarious designs, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday made it clear that regardless of security concerns, the Kartarpur Corridor shall remain open for ‘Khulle Darshan Deedar’ of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.

“Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has been opened because we wanted it to be opened; every Punjabi wanted it, and had prayed for it in daily ardas every day, along with praying for opening of Nankana Sahib, Panja Sahib and other Gurdwaras,” said Capt Amarinder, urging the Governments of India and Pakistan to work for the opening of these Gurdwaras too.

Capt Amarinder, who had requested the Speaker for permission to make his statement before the Question Hour, was responding to the criticism by the opposition of certain recent remarks of the state DGP regarding the threat potential of the Kartarpur Corridor.

Noting “with great concern the statements made by different persons and organizations on DGP’s remarks about security concerns relating to Sri Kartarpur Sahib,” the Chief Minister termed the reactions “totally avoidable”.

“The DGP had apologized; everybody makes mistakes; even I make mistakes, we are human beings,” said Capt Amarinder, asking if there was anyone from the Opposition who could claim not to have made mistakes.

“We all make mistakes, this issue is over now, let us concentrate on peace and on ensuring that the difficult times through which Punjab had been do not recur,” he added.

Pointing out that 35,000 Punjabis and 1,700 policemen had lost their lives, in addition to the Army soldiers, during the years of militancy in the stare, the Chief Minister said: “It is our responsibility is to ensure this does not happen again.” Assuring the people of Punjab, “through this August house, that we are extremely happy that the Corridor has been opened, thanks to our collective efforts,” the Chief Minister declared that it (the Corridor) shall remain open, whatever may be the concerns.”

“My Government was party to the decision to open up the Corridor. The whole of my government, including Ministers and officers of various departments, worked tirelessly day & night, along with the Central Government, to acquire the land and build the necessary Infrastructure in record time, including security infrastructure, for the launch of the Sri Kartarpur Sahib corridor to coincide with the 550 years birthday celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev ji in November 2019,” said Capt Amarinder.

The apprehensions of threat to the security of the people and the country were, however, “serious”, the Chief Minister said, adding that these apprehensions “are not because the Corridor has been opened but because of the ‘maadi neeyat’ (bad intent) of Pakistan.

The Chief Minister said that his Government had classified documents which he could not circulate in the House. After meddling in Kashmir for long, the ISI had only one task now – to disturb the peace of Punjab, he said, adding that Pakistan was blatantly trying to foment trouble in the State.

He informed the House that his Government had succeeded in checking ISI’s nefarious designs in the last three years with the Punjab Police had busting 32 modules, arresting 154 terrorists and seizing 41 AK47/ MP9/ MP5 rifles, 156 other rifles and pistols, 35 hand grenades including those used in the Nirankari Bhawan attack in Amritsar, 3.5 kg of RDX, two smart phones and Rs 30 lakhs in fake currency, the Chief Minister revealed.

Showing pictures of Chinese drones, Captain Amarinder said these had been seized from a man swimming through Raavi but there might be others that had not been caught. “Who knows what their motive is,” he added.

Later, responding to concerns raised by Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, Captain Amarinder said Pakistan could not be trusted, as was evident from the developments in 1947, 1965, 1971 and the Kargil war. The Pak army was highly committed against India, with Prime Minister Imran Khan being a mere puppet in their hands, he said, adding that ISI was also a part of Pakistan Army.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kartarpur-corridor-not-to-close-down--capt-amarinder.html
38,26-2-20,Speaker likely to act against MLAs not attending House,"Legislators present in the House yet conspicuous by their absence during the proceedings may soon face action. For, the Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana KP Singh on Tuesday maintained that he would consider amending rules regarding initiating action against such “absentee” MLAs.

The assertion came after the state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra pointed out that all the departments work day and night to prepare responses to the calling attention notices given by the MLAs, but when they are taken up for discussion, these legislators were not present in the House.

“We should amend the rules so that action could be taken against such MLAs who are present in the House but are still absent when their calling attention notices came up for discussion,” said Mohindra while pointing that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) members listed three important issues for discussing on Monday.

“Those were such important issues of public interest. But that could not be discussed as the MLAs were staging a protest in the House,” said Mohindra.

Notably, a day before, three calling attention notices were moved by three AAP MLAs — Saravjit Kaur Manuke on non-issuance of cards under Bhai Kanahiya Health Scheme and improper implementation of the Chief Minister’s Cancer Relief Fund Scheme; Rupinder Kaur Rubi on plying of unfit and unauthorized school vans and buses; and Aman Arora on noise pollution due to loudspeakers.

Later, Aman Arora raised the issue of noise pollution due to loudspeakers during the zero hour saying that it could not be discussed on Monday as the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh was absent. Correcting him, Mohindra said that it was not discussed as AAP MLAs were staging the protest, and not because of the Chief Minister’s absence.

Arora quipped that the protest was also held because of Chief Minister’s absence as the situation would not have been so if the Government’s stand was given on the DGP remarks on Kartarpur Corridor and allegations against Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.

In another significant issue raised by Ferozepur City MLA Parminder Singh Pinky regarding involvement of SAD local leader Iqbal Singh Mallah in anti-national activities, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh assured that a thorough probe would be conducted and action would be taken as per law.

Demanding a time-bound inquiry, Pinky had alleged that AK 47, live cartridges, Pak currency, has been seized from Mallah against whom 25 FIRs have been registered. He also alleged that Mallah had links with a Khalistan Liberation Force member Harmeet Singh ‘Happy PhD’, who was killed recently in Pakistan.

Pinky also showed pictures of Mallah along with the SAD president Sukhbir Badal, while demanding that National Security Advisor (NSA) should be asked to look into it.

Sports Minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi also informed the House that the shooting and archery contests, as a part of Birmingham Commonwealth Games-2022, will be held in Chandigarh — the state capital.

“It is a matter of great pride for us that the shooting and archery events, which were earlier excluded from the Commonwealth Games, will now be held in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games-2022 and competitions, under these two events, will be held in Chandigarh,” said Sodhi while thanking Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder, and National Rifle Association of India president Raninder Singh who attended series of meeting of Executive Board of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) in London for the inclusion of these two events in the Commonwealth Games after which CGF took this decision.

Besides, all the MLAs present in the House also gave a round of applause to Bathinda lad Sunny Hindustani, who won the Indian Idol singing contest, after the Finance Minister and Bathinda urban MLA Manpreet Badal shared the information. Sodhi proposed that Sunny should be honoured by the Chief Minister, and he should be provided financial assistance, if possible.

AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan, raising the issue of Centre’s proposed move to do away with the MSP regime, demanded that the House should move a unanimous resolution against this decision. He also reminded that the Government had assured to hold a two-day session to hold discussion on this sensitive issue.

SAD MLA NK Sharma highlighted the issue of illegal mining going around the Chhatbir Zoo and levying of goonda tax because of which the water had entered the zoo premises in the previous monsoon.

“No shamlat (village common land) is left in my constituency where illegal mining is not taking place…it has no environment clearance also…and each trolley is being charged Rs 5000 goonda tax,” alleged Sharma adding that this was a “big threat to the zoo”.

Another AAP MLA Saravjit Kaur Manuke brought into the Government’s notice the issue of travel agents duping Punjabi girls, and demanded stringent action against them besides checking the same trend.

SAD MLA Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal urged the government to frame a policy so that the State’s sugarcane farmers get their dues on time besides encouraging the diversification. “Sugarcane farmers are agitating demanding their pending dues which amounts to Rs 180 crore. When they will be paid,” he asked.

SAD MLA Dr Sukhwinder Kumar raised the issue of de-addiction drug — buprenorphine and noloxone — of nine companies failing quality test alleging a multi-crore scam.

Alleging that five crore buprenorphine tablets, out of the total eight crore, were sold out of the system by the companies, Dr Sukhwinder demanded that the Government should take strict action against the defaulter companies, whose samples have been found ‘not of standard quality’.

NO MOVIES PROMOTING VIOLENCE, SEX, ALCOHOL IN PUNJAB: CAPT ASSURES HOUSE

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday categorically made it clear that he would not allow any movie seeking to promote gangsterism, alcoholism, sex and violence, in the State.

At the same time, the Chief Minister maintained that he would also write to the Censor Board in this regard, while underlining that checking the content of the movies is the Board’s responsibility.

Chief Minister’s response came on the issue raised by Congress MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli highlighting the two more movies, similar to “Shooter” recently banned by Punjab Government, is in the pipeline and the Government should ban those too.

Reiterating his firm commitment to ensuring a safe and secure social environment across the State, the Chief Minister said that nothing would be allowed to disturb Punjab’s hard-earned peace and communal harmony.

The State Government would write to the Censor Board also on such movies since the matter come under their purview, he added.

Drinking water Minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur inspected Rukka Dam on Tuesday and issued various directives regarding the same.

Thakur has directed all the department officials and engineers to chalk out special action plans to ensure that people from any part of the State do not face drinking water problems in the coming months.

“Rukka Dam has enough water to cater to the drinking water needs of the entire Capital City in summers. The water released daily from Rukka to Sikidri hydel power project can be utilized to provide drinking water to Ranchi for a month. In this regard, discussions with the Energy Minister cum Chief Minister will also be held as the water being provided to the hydel power project is not generating electricity in the same proportion which needs to be considered,” said the Minister.

Thakur further added that the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation prepares schemes for pipeline water supply. The distribution for it lies with the municipal bodies. Due to non- timely payment by them, it is difficult to repair and maintain old schemes and also start new ones.

“Just like an ultimatum has been issued by DVC, the same will be taken by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation as well. If the payment is still not received, more action will be taken,” added Thakur.

The Minister further expressed his displeasure over the functioning of the agency engaged in maintenance and safety work. The officials have been directed to float a tender for selecting a new agency.

The Minister had earlier visited Dhurwa Dam on Monday where he said that the officials will be held responsible if any situation of water shortage arises in the summer season. Thakur is also likely to visit Kanke Dam in the coming days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/min-inspects-water-bodies-ahead-of-summer-season.html

“ As per our study the cool conditions inside the sanctuary has somewhat come down much to the relief of elephants. Other jumbos would also follow suit,” a forester informed, adding it is also a relief for villagers who live in constant fear over the presence of elephants near human habitat.

Trackers, who are mostly village youths recruited a daily wagers to keep tab on movement of animals also spotted elephants moving uphill a couple of days back. “A herd was spotted moving uphill via Bota, the largest jungle inside the sanctuary.

50,26-2-20,Nadda appoints Deepak Prakash State BJP chief,"State BJP General Secretary and senior leader Deepak Prakash has been appointed as State president of the party. BJP national president, Jagat Prakash Nadda on Tuesday named Prakash as State president. Prakash will succeed Laxman Gilua who decided to step down from his post followed by party’s humiliating defeat in last Assembly election.

Prakash, apart from Nadda is also close to BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi, who became BJP legislative party leader on Monday. The closeness Prakash enjoys with Marandi can be gauged from the fact that in 2006 when Marandi decided to leave BJP along with Marandi and other BJP leaders too left BJP. However, his honeymoon with Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) did not continue for long as after three years he once again returned to BJP. Sources said that his closeness with Marandi can be gauged from the fact that when the talks of Marandi planning to merge his party JVM with BJP started he was one of the few leaders in BJP who had information, but he kept the entire development secret.

The appointment of Prakash also assumes importance as he eclipsed many leaders, who were in fray of becoming state president. Leaders such as BJP Rajmahal Anant Ojha, Chatra MP Sunil Singh, former state president Ravindra Rai and Rajya Sabha MP Samir Oroan were in fray for State president’s post.

Prakash is in BJP for more than three decades. He started his political activities as ABVP member in 1973 and later became a BJP member. As a BJP member he had held the post of state secretary and state vice president in BJYM the youth wing of BJP. In State BJP he had held the post of state secretary and vice presidents apart from being member of core committee. Prakash, who is post graduate in political science is good orator and is known for his organizational skills. By appointing Prakash as State president, the BJP has tried to give a message of social balance as Marandi a tribal leader has been made BJP legislative party chief, while the State president post went to general category.

State BJP leaders have congratulated Prakash for his appointment as state president. Former Chief Minister Raghubar Das said, “The BJP will strengthen with appointment of Prakash as state president as he had long experience of working in BJP organization. He will take the BJP to new heights.”

Union Tribal Affairs minister Arjun Munda too has welcomed the appointment of Prakash as State president, Munda said, “Prakash is senior leader with strong organizational skills. The party will gain from his experience.”

Other State leaders too have welcomed the appointment of Prakash as state president. Many BJP leaders visited party office and wished him for becoming state president",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nadda-appoints-deepak-prakash-state-bjp-chief.html
51,26-2-20,Election for 2 RS seats on March 26,"The Election Commission of India today announced Biennial Elections to the Council of States on March 26 to fill the seats of members retiring in April 2020. The term of office of 55 members of the Rajya Sabha elected from 17 States is due to expire on their retirement in April, 2020. Out of the 55 members two Rajya Sabha members Parimal Nathwani and Prem Chand Gupta elected from Jharkhand will complete their term on April 09.

According to the ECI, Issue of Notifications for the polls will be on March 06, the last date of making nominations will be March 13, scrutiny of nominations will be done on March 16 and the last date for withdrawal of candidatures will be March 18. Polling will be conducted on March 26 between 09:00 am to 04:00 pm and counting of votes will be conducted on the same day. Election will be completed by March 30.

In the present political set up the BJP and Grand Alliance (JMM, Congress and RJD) both have claim on one seat each. While the Grand Alliance will easily grab one seat with JMM’s 29, Congress’ 18 and RJD’s one legislator in its side, the BJP will have to toil hard to get two votes for its candidate.

In the House of 81 legislators the BJP has 26 members, but it needs 28 votes to secure one seat. BJP’s old time partner AJSU Party has two legislators in the House, but it will be a tough bargain for the saffron party to bring AJSU Party legislators in the fold, especially after the 2019 Assembly election debacle, where the differences between BJP and AJSU Party led to the defeat to the former.

Notably, Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand have been notorious for alleged horse trading cases and fielding of ‘outsiders’ in the polls by different political parties.

Recently an ADG rank IPS officer was suspended by the Hemant Soren Government for his alleged involvement and role in influencing voters and affecting the electoral process in the 2016 Rajya Sabha polls in the State.

52,26-2-20,Sonia asks Cong Ministers to fulfill election promises,"Congress president Sonia Gandhi has asked Congress Ministers in Hemant Soren Government to fulfill the poll promises made by party during Assembly election. Sonia Gandhi gave the directive to Congress Ministers during their visit to 10 Janpath the official residence of Congress chief. Four Ministers including finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam, Agriculture minister Badal and health minister Banna Gupta met the Congress chief along with State Congress in-charge RPN Singh.

Minister Alam said, “The Congress chief asked us to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto. Simultaneously, the directions were issued to work in organization as well.” Apart from this

The Minister said that the party chief asked the leaders to go to all the districts for having public interaction.

Sources said that the Congress chief asked the ministers to full fill the election manifesto such as waving of farmers’ loan as announced by Chhattisgarh Government and increase the minimum support price of paddy.

Gandhi’s directive to Congress quota Ministers assumes importance as senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while addressing a rally at Simdega last year during Assembly election promised to waive farmers’ loan if the grand old party is voted to power in the State.

Rahul had also said that if the Grand Alliance government, of which Congress is part is voted to power, they will waive farmers’ loan. The Congress party manifesto too talked about waiving of farmers loan.

The Congress manifesto mention that all crop loans up to Rs 2, 00,000 will be waived immediately if the party returns to power in the state.

Rahul had said that the Congress party is real well-wisher of farmers and not handful of industrialists like the BJP governments. The Congress ruled governments at Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Rajasthan as per the poll promises had waived farmers’ loan.

Sources said that apart from waving farmers loan, the Congress chief also asked about increasing the minimum support price of paddy.

Also Rahul Gandhi during election campaign had said that farmers would receive a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 2,500 for every quintal of paddy, if the Cong-JMM-RJD coalition wins majority.

The Congress chief directive on increasing the MSP and waving farmers’ loan gain importance as both the finance and agriculture ministry is with Congress.

Meanwhile, health minister Banna Gupta said that Congress chief asked about the performance of various departments. Highlighting, the work of his department, Gupta said, “We informed Congress chief that the government had introduced health scheme under which people having annual income upto Rs 8 lakh will be entitle for getting medical insurance upto RS 5 lakh.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sonia-asks-cong-ministers-to-fulfill-election-promises.html

63,26-2-20,Experts stress on energy-efficient technology for steel industries,"Steel industry is the largest energy-consuming manufacturing industry in the world. With the constant increase in the national and global Steel production, it becomes mandatory to check on the energy consumption in the production and handling processes and actively participate in reducing the carbon print to the environment, said experts on energy conservation and management here on Monday.

Aiming to conserve energy, a workshop on energy conservation and management in the process was recently organized by The Institute of Engineers (Bokaro Center) in a joint association with Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC), Bokaro Power Supply Company (P) Limited (BPSCL) and Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL).

“As a developing country, India has a lot of construction and development plans underway that will further encourage the production of Steel materials. With the increased production, comes the responsibility to promote energy efficiency with minimum greenhouse gas emissions,” said A. Bhaumik Executive Director BSL.

“There is an immediate need to introduce energy-efficient technologies in all steel industries not only in India but across the world,” he added.

About 50 per cent of an integrated facility’s energy input comes from coal while 35 per cent from electricity, 5 per cent from natural gas and 5 per cent from other gasses, said an expert.

By adopting a few norms we can reduce the consumptions of the energy in steel industries, he said adding, “Energy efficiency also increases productivity, reduces the space and equipment needed for storage and supply, and ensures competitiveness with the other companies with respect to the pricing and also energy management. Business strategies, goals, expansion and investment plans are dependent on energy consumption and efficiency projects that are undertaken by the brands.”

Raw materials used in the Steelmaking processes play a pivotal role in defining the energy consumption in the industry, said the expert.

Steel industry should adopt suitable economic and investment policies in a bid to ensure the availability and utilisation of advanced technologies and machinery to conserve energy. These technologies also ensure minimum wastage and monitor the consumption of energy source, said YN Singh another expert.

“Investing in Sustainable and renewable sources of energy are increasing in Steel and related industries to reduce the burden on the non-renewable sources,” he added.

The Steel industry is actively managing its use and conservation of energy. It is crucial to ensure the functioning of the industry and to reduce environmental impacts. Recovery of waste and outgoing heat energy is also been looked into to reuse it in the main processes. AgniSteels has always engaged in preserving energy and also invested in alternative sources of energy, for instance, sustainable energy from the windmills, following reusable energy practices including others, said an expert.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/experts-stress-on-energy-efficient-technology-for-steel-industries.html

66,26-2-20,State needs 100 model fertiliser retail outlets,"At least 100 model fertiliser retail outlets are required to be opened in the State as the fertiliser companies are reluctant to open more outlets.

Major fertilizer companies are opening several retail outlets in other States, where as they are shy to open the facilities in Odisha, admit officials. Minister Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment Arun Kumar Sahoo during a review recently felt that more numbers of model fertiliser retail outlets are needed to be opened in the State as demand for such is growing.

Accordingly, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ empowerment has written to Government of India in this regard, said sources. The Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers has been requested in this regard, said sources in Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Empowerment.

State agricultural productivity suffers due to lack of availability of fertilisers in Odisha and this has been raised time and again by the State Government.

Provision of sufficient number of railway rakes has always been raised by the State administration and facilities at rake points are very poor.

Take for example, there are several rake points, where infrastructure improvement is needed and the Ministry of Railways is reluctant in making provision.

Infrastructure needs to be developed at Junagarh Road of Kalahandi, Dunguripalli of Subarnapur. Both are the major points for fertilizer movement and poor infrastructure is coming its way.

Similarly, rake points at Nayagarh, Kerjung in Angul and Naranpur in Keonjhar are needed to be made functional by providing the minimum requirement on priority basis.

Facilities like proper platform, electricity and approach road for trucks are needed and the railway authorities are reluctant in making provisions, officials admit.

Full rake movement is not allowed at Rairangpur in Mayurbhanj and repeated request with the Ministry of Railways has not yielded results. Due to non availability of required infrastructure at existing rake points and non provisioning of new rake points, supply of fertilisers and its distribution is affected in a big way in the State.

Restrictions are imposed on booking of fertiliser rakes for which transportation of fertilizers is affected. The State Government has moved to both the Ministries of Fertiliser and Railways to sort out the issues in the interest of the farmers of the State, said sources.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-needs-100-model-fertiliser-retail-outlets.html

73,26-2-20,ILS transfers tech for commercialisation,"The Institute of life Sciences, Bhubaneswar on Tuesday transferred a technology for production of curcumin sponge for wound healing.

During last few years, the ILS has been working on developing a product and demonstrated the efficacy of curcumin encapsulated in chitosan and alginate polymers for cure of various inflammatory and oxidative stress-related diseases, including wound healing.

Wound healing is a complex physiological response to injury. In severe pathologic conditions, this cascade healing process is lost and the wounds are locked into a state of chronic inflammation. Wound treatment and its therapeutic impediments represent an economically-challenging burden on healthcare worldwide.

Some studies in India suggest that around 4.5 per thousand people are affected by chronic wounds and this almost doubles to 10.5 for acute wounds. Plant-based products have multi-targeting potential and in addition are inexpensive and safe compared to synthetic agents. Turmeric is an important cash crop grown by tribal farmers of India, particularly Odisha.

The ILS had already entered into an MoA (memorandum of association) with the NRDC (an enterprise of DSIR, Ministry of Science and Technology) in 2015 for commercialisation of this product. Based on extensive discussions, the NRDC has identified Golap Pharmaceuticals, Jaipur, for mass-scale production and commercialisation of curcumin sponge. The technology has been developed by ILS scientist Dr Sanjeeb Sahoo and his group.

The product was launched on Tuesday in the presence Dr Manju Sharma, former Secretary, Dept of Biotechnolgy, and Dr Ajay Parida, Director, ILS.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ils-transfers-tech-for-commercialisation.html

80,26-2-20,Relax marine fishing ban period: Paradip assns,"Nearly 80,000 people depend directly or indirectly on fishing industry in Paradip and their business has suffered due to manifold difficulties. Especially, the fishing ban due to the turtle safety lobby has hit them hard.

Recently, the All Odisha Fish Producers’ Federation (AOFPF) and the Odisha Marine Fish Producers Association (OMFPA) (trawler association), Paradip have appealed both to the Union and State Governments to end their plight. They also threatened to launch a stir, unless their concerns were addressed.

Briefing mediapersons, they alleged that the fishing ban in coasts from November to April each year for turtle conservation has an adverse impact on the fishing community, especially on the trawler operators.

The ban on fishing also hits net makers, dry fish merchants, fish traders, basket makers and ice plants operating in Paradip, they told, lamenting that though they have urged the authorities for relaxation in the fishing ban, but in vain.

“Memoranda have been given several times to the Central Empowerment Committee on Turtle Conservation and the Union Ministry of Forests, Environment and Climate Change, but ironically we have got no response,” told AOFPF president Kameshwar Narayan Praharaj and OMFPA president Sumanta Kumar Biswal.

According to sources, to ensure turtle conservation, the Forests and Environment Department has notified the coast from north of Paradip up to 80 km into the coast as marine sanctuary area and no fishing zone under the Wildlife Act.

On the other hand, the State Fisheries Department too prohibits fishing in and around 20 km radius from the Devi river mouth to Paradip coast from November to April each year. In view of the ban, the fishing industry remains inactive and trawlers stand idle for five months in a year.

The trawler association claimed that it was needless to declare 20 km from the shore as a sanctuary zone. The area should be confined to 10 km and trawlers should be allowed for fishing, suggested association president

Biswal .

Besides, the two associations raised issues like dredging of harbour, harassment and detention of fishers by surveillance officials, improper maritime water zone identification, lack of sops like easy loan facility, subsidies in inputs and compensation during inclement weather when fishing is affected.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/relax-marine-fishing-ban-period--paradip-assns.html
81,26-2-20,Museum Popular Lecture held at IGRMS,"Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya organised a Museum Popular Lecture here on Tuesday. Prof Sadasiba Pradhan, Former Professor of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar (Odisha) delivered a lecture on ‘Interpreting Rock Art: An Ethno-archaeological Perspective’.

Prof Sadasiba Pradhan said that one of the characteristic features of rock art world over is the large assemblage of non-thematic and non-figurative abstract symbols and motifs juxtaposed with animal and human forms. These symbols are both geometric and non-geometric and are so bewildering that no definite name or meaning could be given to these forms.

They include a host of parallel vertical or horizontal lines or wavy lines within or without a geometric format; criss-cross, zigzags, grids, curvy linears, bisected triangles or triangles with a shallow depression (cupule) at the center resembling vulvas; honeycombs, rhomboids, harpoons, denticulate, diamond chains, spirals, concentric circles, series of dots, cupules, palm, foot, paws and so forth. It appears as if there is an overwhelming richness in the invention of symbols and men’s desire for creating such symbols in prehistoric time was inexhaustible.

Ninety percent of rock pictures documented in one hundred six rock shelters in eleven districts of Odisha are non-thematic symbols and motifs. Vulva (yoni) remains the hallmark of all representations in Odishan rock art. Identical symbols do appear all over in a given time whether in Australia or America or Africa or India.

Animal and human forms may appear identical in their execution and depiction because of their standardized physiognomy, which is divine, or the law of the creation, but why and how such uniformity also exists in the composition of certain symbols, which is exclusive to human creativity. Is it because the thought process of the mankind in a given time was alike everywhere wherever they roamed? Or since they shared a common level of subsistence economy of hunting-gathering, environment and insecurity of life, their cognitive development was identical irrespective of their area of operation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/museum-popular-lecture-held-at-igrms.html

97,26-2-20,A partnership that will deliver regional peace,"The Motera blockbuster (Trump actually referenced Bollywood) has heralded a new era in the Indo-US relationship. The bonhomie and pragmatic realism that is a result of intimate personal friendship between the leaders of the two most powerful democracies is palpable in the calibrated speech of President Trump. While showering praise on Prime Minister Modi, he also spelt out the future roadmap of India-US strategic partnership.

In the true sense of Atithi Devo Bhava, POTUS Trump was presented with a spectacle rivaling Howdy Modi at Houston five months earlier and was clearly swept off his feet, FLOTUS Melania in tow. Optics apart, the true purpose of the visit is out for everyone to see. It is evident that the standalone visit is a clear effort by President Trump to put his might behind India for a wider Indo-Pacific strategic partnership. His gestures speak about the plans of the two nations for times to come.

For one, it heralded an era in which India would be regarded as an equal partner in the world stage both in economic and strategic terms. The fact that Russia, our close strategic ally from the Seventies, did not object to the high-voltage visit goes on to prove the growing diplomatic muscle of India in the world arena. Second, there was a very direct message to China when President Trump said India has achieved greatness by setting its people free by trusting in their abilities and by honouring the dignity of individuals. He explicitly mentioned a country, not countries, which had tried to achieve power through aggression, by coercive action and without individual freedom. China’s reaction would be worth watching for. Reeling under the Coronavirus and refusing world aid, China might take a while to react, but react it will.

The next take-away from Trump’s powerful speech was regarding Pakistan. While asserting that the US has good relations with Pakistan, he mentioned in the same breath that the US is working to control terrorism emanating from the borders of Pakistan. He went on to say that both India and the US have suffered the anguish and pain of terrorism (no points on guessing by whom) and are determined to fight it united. This is by far the most direct statement of any POTUS from Indian soil regarding terrorism vis-a-vis Pakistan. This is especially important coming as it has on the background of the US-Taliban pact on February 29 in Doha for which Pakistan has to be on board. In a single sentence, Trump has put Pakistan on notice about terrorism as well as on Afghanistan. If you do not come forward with cooperation in Afghanistan, well, we have India as a friend. We might see some sort of broad security declaration implying this in near future.

The next important statement having a global ramification is the statement that India and the US are committed to fighting radical Islamic terrorism ideologically. At a cursory approach, it might sound like a statement borne out of Samuel Huntington’s ‘Clash of Civilisations’. But in reality, it could be a very well-thought-out, coordinated global strategy combating Islamic fanaticism. The USA is a Judeo-Christian nation. India has recently opened up with Israel, a Jewish state, and we now are not ashamed of calling ourselves a pluralistic Hindu Rastra (Hoardings welcoming President Trump to the land of Lord Rama were seen in Agra). From Malaysia to the Middle East and from Europe to the US, Islamic fundamentalism is a fact; and increasingly, nations don’t hesitate in calling it so. The recent ban on Burqa in Sri Lanka is a case in point.

Overall, the power-packed visit by President Trump in an American election year and, that too, to a country which has a sizeable expat community in the US which can influence the elections, is a much-calculated one. While the detractors may claim opportunism, the fact of the matter is that the geopolitical equation is undergoing a definitive shift. While China with its aggressive hegemonic tendencies is becoming increasingly isolated, the once-hegemony US stands to gain in terms of reduction in military spending and expanding made-in-US trade if it can strike a working relationship with emerging economic powers like India. Moreover, together with Japan and Australia, India and the US will be in a position to checkmate China in the Indo-Pacific region.

We in India should welcome this with open arms as we need to straddle both the worlds (in effect meaning Russia and the US) in order to be prepared to fight a two-and-a-half front war. While the US is willing to deal with us in defence purchases, one has to be clear about the transfer of technology aspect. Our old ally Russia has transferred some technology to us which had been indigenised (BRAHMOS for example). But with the US, the loyalty has to be tested on ground. The geostrategic factors may have pushed the US to the lap of India, but a clear and farsighted leadership rooted in national interest only will be able to utilise the gain to consolidate its position in the region. The unfinished agenda of the POK should be woven into the Indo-US strategic security narrative. It would go a long way in killing many a bird with a single stone.

98,26-2-20,State has failed in creating own income source: Opp,"Opposition BJP and Congress members on Tuesday targeted the State Government over its robust Annual Budget alleging that it has completely failed in creating income source during the last 20 years.

However, the ruling BJD boasted of saying that the State has witnessed development in all sectors and is still marching ahead both economically and socially.

“The State Government has presented a Rs 1,50,000-crore Annual Budget. It is a Centre-based Budget. The State has estimated its own income at Rs 56,000 crore while the Union Government will provide Rs 68,300 crore and the rest would be made up with loans,” said BJP Legislature Party Deputy Leader Bishnu Charan Sethy while participating in General Discussion of Budget.

He alleged that the State Government is creating new modulations to divert Central funds to the schemes run by it.

He alleged that unemployment scenario has been acute in the State with about 1 crore boys and girls waiting to get jobs.

He said while hospitals and schools are lacking doctors and teachers respectively, the Government has failed in providing irrigation, cold storage facilities to the farmers.

Congress member Suresh Kumar Routray said the Government is making only false claims of development. While poor people are yet to get basic facilities, a few people have been extremely rich by stealing the State’s mines. Corruption is marked everywhere in the State,

he alleged.

However, BJD member Amar Prasad Satpathy termed the Budget as 5 Ps (Paperless, Participatory, Permissive, for People and Prosperity)

“The Annual Budget has been increased from Rs 11,800 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs 1,35,000 crore in 2019-20 and the State’s own tax from Rs 1,704 crore to Rs 33,550 crore during the period,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-has-failed-in-creating-own-income-source--opp.html

110,26-2-20,Army to MoD: Ask paramilitary not to don military uniform,"Taking a serious note of the police and the Central armed police forces (CAPF)donning Army pattern uniform while deployed on law and order duties, the Army has written to the Defence Ministry to take suitable action to ask the concerned forces to refrain from putting on such uniforms. This move came after some CAPF and Police personnel deployed with Delhi police to address anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protest in the national Capital on February 23 were seen wearing Army pattern combat fatigues.

“Wearing of combat dress by CAPFs and State Police forces may be misinterpreted as the Army being deployed for internal security duties and election. Indian Army has again written to the Department of Military Affairs on February 24 requesting Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to issue following guidelines for immediate implementation,"" sources said here on Tuesday.

The guidelines requested include that combat dress should not be worn by CAPFs across India while being employed to handle law and order situations as also while being deployed in urban areas affected by terrorism, as the surroundings do not demand such a requirement.

""Use of distinctly different disruptive dress, both in colour and pattern, by CAPFs and State Police forces should be restricted only to employment in jungle terrain in Left Wing Extremist (LWE) affected areas,"" they said adding the Bullet Proof Jackets (BPJ) cover most parts of the torso hence, the BPJs should be of plain Khaki colour and not of combat colour.

Sources also said the sale of Army pattern clothes in the open market needs to be regulated and private vendors in open market should establish identity and maintain a record of personnel to whom the Army pattern clothes, including accessories and

accoutrements, are being sold, as proposed by the

home ministry on March 31, 2016.

The Army has from time to time raised the issue with the defence ministry on the increasing trend of CAPFs and State Police forces wearing combat uniforms similar to the Army pattern.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/army-to-mod--ask-paramilitary-not-to-don-military-uniform.html
111,26-2-20,Cong: Section of people making Delhi as national Capital of riots,"Condemning the violence in Delhi, the Congress on Tuesday demanded that the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Chief Minister of Delhi come forward to ensure peace and maintain brotherhood while rising above partisan politics. The grand old party alleged that there is a larger conspiracy by a section of people in certain political parties to make Delhi as the national Capital of riots

The Left parties too wrote to PM and the HM blaming BJP's Kapil Mishra for the violence in northeast Delhi and his open call to forcibly remove protesters from various sites.

""This is Gandhi, Nehru, Patel's India, can any Indian accept this mindless violence? Congress appeals to the people of Delhi to maintain communal harmony and thwart all attempts of the forces dividing the country on the basis of religion,"" Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at AICC Press conference.

Referring to the riots in northeast Delhi over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that continued for the third day, and demanded stern action against the culprits, the party stated unabated violence and incidents of stone-pelting and murder in the national capital have shattered the nation.

""Our appeal to the prime minister, the home minister and the Delhi chief minister is, can you rise to the occasion, leave aside your political partisanship and views, and become really not leaders of your parties but leaders of the society so that harmony, peace and non-violence prevail,"" he said.

The Congress party will stand with the Centre and the Delhi government in every way to maintain brotherhood and harmony in the society, he said.

""Do not fail this country because you belong to different political parties,"" Surjewala said, adding this was a sincere appeal ""on behalf of people of Delhi and the country"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

""There is no place for violence in Gandhi ji's India... Today there is a need to establish peace on the ground and maintain brotherhood,"" he said.

CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat in a letter to Modi and Shah demanded immediate arrest of those who incited violence on the streets of national Capital. She said the need of the hour was an impartial and just intervention to ensure peace in the national capital.

""Your intervention for peace will allay apprehensions among the public that the incidents of the last two days are 'Badla' (revenge) against the people of Delhi for the election results.

In this context, action against Kapil Mishra will bring confidence to the people that you are indeed taking impartial steps for peace and against troublemakers.

121,26-2-20,Adani Group mulls bidding for Air India,"Billionaire Gautam Adani’s energy and infrastructure conglomerate is considering bidding to buy Air India and is pouring into bid documents before finalising a plan, sources said. The government is offering to sell its entire holding in the loss-making carrier along with its entire interest in its low-cost arm and 50 per cent in the ground handling unit.

Sources with knowledge of the development said the mergers and acquisition (M&A) team of Adani Group is scrutinising Air India bid documents and the interest was at a preliminary stage. Bidding, they insisted, would depend on the due diligence.

If Adani bids, it will join likes of Tata Group, Hindujas, IndiGo and New York-based fund Interups who are said to be considering putting in an expression of interest (EoI) at the close of the bid deadline next month. Adani Group’s spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comments. Sources said Adani sees synergy in Air India and its airport operations. It last year won bids to operate six airports at Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram, and Mangalore. The deciding factor for Adani to bid for Air India would be the debt and losses. The buyer will have to take on a fixed debt of Rs 23,286.5 crore along with certain identified current and non-current liabilities. The airline has been in losses during the last few years.

While the privatization bid document does not place any restriction on Adani from bidding for Air India, Airports Authority of India (AAI) restricts an airline or a group owning an airline to hold no more than 27 per cent in the airports. A similar clause restricting airlines or group owning airlines from owning more than 10 per cent in Delhi airport recently resulted in the collapse of the Tata-GIC group’s investment in GMR.

Air India and its subsidiary, Air India Express own about 120 aircraft at FY18-end and 126 aircraft till September last year. After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government this time has decided to offload its entire stake. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76 per cent stake in the airline.

Of the total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/adani-group-mulls-bidding-for-air-india.html

124,26-2-20,India on path to become $5 trillion economy: Bindu Dalmia,"Chairperson of the National Committee on Financial Inclusion and Literacy at Niti Aayog Bindu Dalmia on Tuesday said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is well on path to become a $5 trillion economy.

Highlighting inherent strengths of Indian economy and dispelling any concern of slowdown, she said that tough times don't last but tough nations do. She was speaking at an event organised by Merchant's Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kolkata.

Dispelling concern of slowdown, she said, ""There is no reason for irrational pessimism. Going forward, there is every reason for future optimism, as economic green shoots are beginning to appear, as gauged through various economic indicators like higher employee provident fund registrations, uptick in retail lending, rise in MUDRA loans, rise in bookings in residential real estate, higher FDI inflows of $24 billion, higher FPI flows, rising forex reserves, and buoyant stock markets.""

As the centre of economic gravity is shifting to cities, by 2030, 600 million Indians are estimated to migrate to cities, requiring provisioning for 100 Smart Cities and 500 new townships to absorb the influx of rural migrants. Planned urbanisation holds the largest potential to make quantum economic leaps. Rapid urbanisation was a key feature of economies like Korea that sustained 10% growth. In comparison, India has only urbanised at just 3.4% per decade.

The biggest engine of growth will be the sunrise sector of digitisation, which works on integrating the entire agro, services and retail supply chain through convergence on the e-commerce platforms.

Elaborating path to a $5 trillion economy, she talked about additional force multipliers which will come from broadly 11 sectors having high multiplier coefficients in generating employment which include housing, healthcare and tourism.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-on-path-to-become--5-trillion-economy--bindu-dalmia.html

A decision was taken in this regard recently here at a meeting between the representatives from UT Ladakh and Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Union Ministry of Science and Technology which has helped designed the system.

""The developed system has the potential to meet the needs of space heating in residential schools, tourist shelters and for a large number of houses in Ladakh.

The Ladakh government is also keen to utilise innovations in clean energy needs for the people of Ladakh,"" said Umang Narula, advisor to Lt. Governor of Ladakh in Delhi, at a meeting where the decision for installation was taken.

Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST said that meeting water requirement along with space heating solutions is an important niche area which requires to be pursued further. These innovation revolve around the needs of the people, he added.

The system, which works 24×7 to maintain the room temperature in the range of 15-20°C throughout the day and night, developed by Pluss Advanced Technologies, Gurugram, and the prototypes tested at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh can be a sustainable clean energy source for hill areas providing for both heating and lighting needs.

This system directly utilises solar heat and has the potential to be more efficient than converting solar light to electricity and then to heat following the photovoltaic generation route.

128,26-2-20,Mayor rues not being able to present ‘key of Agra’ to US Prez,"A ceremonial silver “key of Agra” was planned to be presented to US President Donald Trump during his visit to the historic city on Monday but it could not be gifted to him due to security constraints, Mayor Naveen Jain said.

The 12-inch key, made of silver, weighs 600 g and has copper engravings of Taj Mahal and the name of the city, he said.

“As a mayor of the city, on behalf of the people of Agra, I wanted to present President Trump the ‘key of Agra’ on his arrival here. But due to security constraints I could not enter the Kheria airbase where he was received by the state’s CM and governor. We really wanted to gift him this ceremonial key but could not,” Jain told PTI.

Nonetheless, it is a matter of great pride that the world’s most powerful leader visited Agra and saw the iconic Taj Mahal, the pride of India, he said.

And indeed, Trump may not have been able to receive the ‘key of Agra’ but he and his family unlocked the beauty of Agra by visiting the celebrated monument of love, the famed 17th century mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.

The US President and First Lady Melania Trump were given a special tour of the heritage complex, as the couple entered beautifully carved doors and gateways during their visit, with the guide virtually transporting them to the Mughal-era with the fascinating stories behind the Taj.

The mayor said it is a traditional gesture to welcome a high-profile guest or a head of state with a ceremonial key.

“We hand over a ‘key of Agra’ to the guest symbolically to open the ‘door of Agra’ and enter the city. Many guests have been shown that gesture in the past,” Jain said.

In 2000, the then president Bill Clinton also was to be presented with a ceremonial key of Agra.

Baby Rani Maurya, current Governor of Uttarakhand was the mayor of Agra at that time, he said.

“The key is 12-inch long and weighs 600 grams. It has the impression of Taj Mahal on it and ‘Welcome to Agra’ engraved on it. We got it designed in Delhi,” Jain said.

The city administration had made massive arrangement for Trump’s short visit in Agra on Monday evening, giving Agra a makeover in a very short span of time.

The city administration sought to present the “best face of Agra” to Trump.

Streets were spruced up, walls beautified with thematic paintings and the lawns of the iconic Taj Mahal bedecked with shimmering flowers for welcoming the US President. Trump was accompanied by his wife, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, along with his delegation.

At many places, artworks greeting Trump were made by artists and water was being sprayed regularly to ensure there was no dust.

Victorian-style lampposts were installed in many areas to improve the aesthetic look of the city, especially along the nearly 13-km route that was taken by the US President’s convoy.

Trump arrived in Agra on Monday evening around 4:30 pm after jointly attending with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the mega ‘Namaste Trump’ event at the newly-built Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mayor-rues-not-being-able-to-present----key-of-agra----to-us-prez.html

131,26-2-20,Trump woos India Inc to invest more in US,"US President promises easing of regulations in America further

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday wooed Indian industry leaders to invest more in America, promising to reduce more regulations in his country as he looked for overseas investment to boost the economy there.

Speaking at a high-profile CEO round-table which included captains of the Indian industry such as Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran and Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, Trump reassured that regulations “will only get better” for investment in the US.

The Indian industry leaders apprised the US President of their ongoing respective businesses and investments in the country.

“I want to thank you all. Congratulations on your success. Hope you come to the United States and invest more billions because I view it not as billions, I view it as jobs. We have great people...,” he told the gathering. When pointed out that businesses still have to go through regulatory challenges — especially administrative and in the legislative environment — in the US, Trump said, “Some of the regulations you have to go through are statutory process ... We are going to cut lot more regulations ... A lot of them will be cut and you will see a big difference and it will only get better.”

Stressing on the need for companies of the US and India to invest in each other’s country, Trump said Governments can only aid in creating jobs and it is the private industry that actually creates jobs.

Stating that he has been working closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump said, “We create jobs here, and he creates jobs over there through yourselves.”

On Modi, he said, “Somebody said he is such a nice man and I said well he is actually he is a very tough man but he is a nice man. He is doing a fantastic job.”

During the interaction, he said a trade deal with India is in the works but did not share any details.

“It has been an honour to be here,” he said on visiting India. “We just did a lot of business with India where they will buy helicopters worth USD 3 billion.” Claiming that he is going to win the coming US presidential elections that will cause the markets to boom, he said his government has done a lot for the economy, healthcare and military.

Trump reiterated that under his leadership the US economy has grown and has “never been as good as it has been” but has been held back by the upcoming elections.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-woos-india-inc-to-invest-more-in-us-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trump-woos-india-inc-to-invest-more-in-us.html
132,26-2-20,Bharti Airtel has financial capacity to withstand USD 5 bn payout in statutory dues: Moody's,"Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday said Bharti Airtel has the financial capacity to withstand a payout of USD 5 billion in statutory dues.

The Supreme Court earlier this month directed telecom firms to comply with its October 24, 2019 judgment upholding the Department of Telecommunication's (DoT) definition of adjusted gross revenues (AGR).

Bharti recorded a Rs 35,300 crore (USD 5 billion) liability for past-due AGR fees associated with this litigation, but is still completing its self-assessment to determine the final amount, Moody's said.

It said a Rs 35,300 crore cash payment will not cause a significant deterioration in the credit quality of Bharti Airtel while in the alternate scenario of a smaller cash payment of Rs 25,200 crore reflecting the principal and interest amount only, would position the company more comfortably within its current rating.

Full payment is to be made by March 17.

""Recent capital-raising activities provide additional liquidity to fund the AGR payment,"" it said.

The AGR payment is a cash obligation of the Indian operations.

As on December 31, 2019, the firm had consolidated cash and short term investments of USD 4.2 billion, with around USD 2.3 billion held at the Indian operations.

""Following recent capital-raising, we estimated (Bharti's) cash is over USD 5.0 billion, which can be used to fund the final AGR payment,"" it said.

Moody's further said that fundamentals in the Indian telco industry are improving, but uncertainty around the sustainability of the improvement and future cash requirements (including 4G/5G spectrum auction) remains.

Moody's said India accounts for around 75 per cent of Bharti Airtel's debt and 60 per cent of EBITDA.

""Debt levels and cash costs are high for this segment and need to be serviced from India's own organic cash flow,"" it said.

""Cash and EBITDA generated at less than wholly-owned subsidiaries is not directly available to service debt at India. As a result, a significant expansion of India's cash flow is required to achieve meaningful debt reduction on a consolidated basis,"" it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bharti-airtel-has-financial-capacity-to-withstand-usd-5-bn-payout-in-statutory-dues--moody-s-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bharti-airtel-has-financial-capacity-to-withstand-usd-5-bn-payout-in-statutory-dues--moody-s.html

135,26-2-20,Erdogan says no ‘full’ pact on Syria summit,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday there was no agreement yet for the leaders of Turkey, Russia, France and Germany to hold a summit over the escalating violence in northern Syria.

The Kremlin indicated a two-way meeting between Turkey’s Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin was also not on the cards.

Erdogan on Saturday had announced he would hold a four-party summit with Putin, France’s Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on March 5.

But he told reporters Tuesday in a televised press conference before travelling to Azerbaijan “there is no full agreement” on holding the meeting. The Turkish leader on Tuesday said he might instead hold face-to-face talks with Putin on March 5, either in Istanbul or in Ankara.

Russia and Turkey have over the last years been working in close coordination to end the conflict in Syria but strains have soared in recent weeks over the escalating violence in the Syrian province of Idlib. The tensions are seen as the biggest threat to Ankara-Moscow ties since Turkey shot down a Russian warplane over Syria in November 2015. In Moscow, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that a bilateral meeting between Erdogan and the Russian leader was planned. “We are not talking about bilateral contacts. But the possibility of a meeting in a multilateral format is being worked out,” he told reporters.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/erdogan-says-no----full----pact-on-syria-summit.html

What’s more, the UK wants to get a deal by the end of the year on the kind of trade agreement that usually takes many years to negotiate.

As per the survey, this growth is attributable to a healthy growth in passenger traffic as well as transport infrastructure in the country.

It noted that the total retail opportunity across various transport hubs in India, such as airports, highways and bus stations, metro , railways, will grow manifold in new decade.

“India is going through an infrastructure revolution.

As per the survey, the current size of transit retail in India is estimated at $2.2 billion and is expected to grow to$21.6 billion by 2030.

“While the retailing potential is best tapped at airports, it is still at a nascent stage for other modes like metros, railways, highways and bus stations. A large part of the retail opportunity at transit hubs is currently untapped due to lack of retail infrastructure at these nodes,” the survey noted.

Speaking at a business meeting alongside US President Donald Trump, US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said India imported 25,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the United States in 2017.

“In the last two years, we have seen a remarkable offtake in the US oil and gas by India, from 25,000 bpd in 2017 to 250,000 bpd now, a 10-fold increase and we expect it to be better from here,” he said.

Mubarak was a stalwart U.S. Ally, a bulwark against Islamic militancy and guardian of Egypt’s peace with Israel. But to the hundreds of thousands of young Egyptians who rallied for 18 days of unprecedented street protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and elsewhere in 2011, Mubarak was a latter-day pharaoh and a symbol of autocratic misrule.

His overthrow, however, plunged the country into years of chaos and uncertainty, and set up a power struggle between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood group that he had long outlawed. Some two and a half years after his ouster, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi led the military overthrow of Egypt’s first freely elected president and rolled back freedoms gained in the 2011 uprising.

State TV said Mubarak died at a Cairo hospital where he had undergone an unspecified surgery. The report said he had health complications but offered no other details.

145,26-2-20,Make a wise decision,"A wide array of options have opened up. This could land students in confusion. To tackle this, students need career counseling by professionals who could guide them in the right direction, says Ayush Bansal

The problem of choosing a suitable career is more acute in India as the concept of career counselling is still not very commonly accepted. Students today have a wide array of career options to choose from. However, with the rise in the number of options, we are also noticing increased confusion.

A world economic forum report says that 44 per cent of students in India need career counseling and define it as the most important factor in demand-supply mismatch. Contrary 93 per cent of Indian schools do not have counselors. The recent skilling report by Michael & Susan Dell Foundation states that only one out of 10 students in India receive career guidance. The result is that India sees 77 per cent drop-out among students at secondary education. The 250 million young population of India need career guidance, but the current schooling system does not provide it. There is an absolute gap in providing career guidance to students at early stage of education in schools.

As defined by UNICEF, Career guidance is a comprehensive, right-based development approach, designed to assist individuals in making and implementing informed educational and occupational choices that in turn lead to their social, financial and emotional well-being.

It is a process by which an adolescent makes a successful transition from school to higher education and workforce. The process involves exploring different careers, knowing the different pathways to careers, opportunity, earning levels, time period required. Further it involves knowing one’s strengths and interest, matchmaking one’s own potential to the world of careers and then selecting the right courses and colleges, the process to apply and finally the ways to finance his/her education.

With globalisation, liberalisation and use of technology across different industries, a wave of new careers has opened up in the world. It is no more limited to four-five options like doctor, engineer, and lawyer. Every day over 10-15 new careers track emerge, from artificial intelligence to growth hacker to bionics engineer and neuroscientist, there is a wave of emerging careers opening for students. Additionally, the pathways to enter such careers are very diverse. For example — one can become neuroscientist by pursuing MBBS or psychology or a core biology course as well. Universities have become flexible and the courses are now multidisciplinary. To survive in the corporate, one need to have multiple skills from different disciplines. Hence courses like Liberal Arts are on uptake which gives one the flexibility to combine two very different disciplines. One can do majors in Computer Science and minor in language which can lead to a career in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is now the fundamental technology in various voice-based products like Alexa, google assistant, Siri and it requires a combination of skill that involves two different discipline.

The career opportunity in the world is dynamic now and moving at a very fast pace. To tackle this effectively, students need career counseling by professionals who could guide them in the right direction. Talking to a career counselor, going through psychometric assessments and accessing online platforms for gathering information is important to identify the right career.

146,26-2-20,Harmony with numbers is key,"Psychic numbers from one to nine are pure single digit numbers and psychic numbers from 10 to 31 are compound numbers. Single digit psychic number is like a person standing on one leg, whereas compound numbers are like a person who is standing on two legs. Therefore, people who are having compound psychic numbers are said to be better than the person born having single digit date psychic number.

For finding the psychic numbers, we add the two digits of compound number to bring down to single number. Although numbers 11 & 22 are special master numbers in numerology therefore when finding psychic number, we do not add them up. Therefore, psychic number of 11 will be 1 and for 22 will be 2.

The person will be having main characteristic of the reduced single digit psychic number, around 70-80 per cent. There will also be effects of both numbers present in compound number. The person will show effect of both numbers in addition to single digit psychic number. The first number of compound number will always be a leading number and will show predominance dominating effects.

If two numbers in compound number are friendly with each other as well as with psychic number, the effect of psychic number as well as the leading number of compound number will be highly pronounced. Whereas If the two numbers in compound number are anti to each other, then the effect of leading number will be diluted and will be shown in a mild way and if two numbers of compound number are anti to each other and leading number is anti to psychic number, effect of both Psychic number as well as leading number will be reduced.

The first number of a compound/composite number is more important than the second because it determines to which series the composite belongs. The birth date of 12 (1 +2) belongs to the series of 1 (numbers from 1 to 19), while the birthdate of 21(2 + 1) belongs to the series of 2 (numbers from 21 to 29). Both of these combinations add up to three, but the person born on the 3rd will be different from those born on the 12th or 21st of the month. The number 1 dominates the life of the native born on the twelfth, and the number 2 dominates the life of the native born on the twenty-first of any month. In this way we see how people who share a common number (such as 1) are influenced by the double digits of their birthdate (such as 10, 19, or 28).

150,26-2-20,Enhance soft skills,"In a competitive work environment, in order to move up the ladder, it is important to not only have a degree but develop soft skills as well, says Ketul Acharya

Developing soft skills is imperative to growth and success for the future’s aggressive work culture and aspiring youth. Here is a list of eight soft skills to check-out that they must develop to meet the needs of the 21st century.

Interpersonal communication skills: Interpersonal skills refer to your ability to communicate and build relationships with others in everyday life. Often referred as good people skills, it has a propensity to integrate both your innate personality traits (of listening and speaking) and agility to handle difficult social situations. Without interpersonal skills, you can’t advance in your career.

Make the deliberate effort and follow these simple ways to improve your interpersonal communication skills over time:

Begin with identifying your areas of improvement

Focus on basic communication skills both verbal and body language

Listen carefully and practise empathy

Learn to manage differences

Reflect on your communication experience and improve

Complex problem-solving: Albert Einstein, known to the world for his mass-energy equivalence formula, believed that if he was given 20 hours to solve a problem, he would spend 18 hours on understanding the problem and 2 hours on the solution. He didn’t think he was that smart, it’s just that he had the skill of persistence to stay with problems longer than most people. He maintained a strong belief in the necessity of eliminating biases. Einstein also stated that problems require a new level of consciousness beyond the one that created the problem.

Complex problem-solving skill requires objective, being able to see the holistic picture and systematic analysis of the problem. Complex problem solving can be developed over time. However, to hone this skill, you can follow the steps:

Focus on identifying the possible solution

Adapt the approach of asking whys to define the problem

Simplify the problem and come up with simple solutions, to begin with

List out as many solutions as you think

Think laterally, this could give a different perspective to the problem and possibly different solutions

Evaluate the ideas and implement the most effective solution with a defined timeline in hand

Assess the solution and learn for the future

Every problem means that something is not working well and needs a new way to resolve it.

Critical thinking skill: It allows you to understand and address the situation basis on the facts and information available. Critical thinking involves being able to use your logic and reasoning to dissect a problem or an issue, think of viable solutions and weigh the pros and cons of each approach. How to improve critical thinking skill?

Ask basic questions

Questions your basic assumptions

Try reverse thinking to find a solution

Evaluate the existing information

Creativity: Today, industries can’t thrive without creativity. Their brand names are uplifted basis the creative work only. Some brand slogans leave a high remembrance imprint on your mind as they relate directly to the masses.

Creativity is not just limited to being artistic, it could also mean being able to connect the dots with seemingly unrelated information. The creative process, however, isn’t limited to any predefined process.

Exercise curiosity, express yourself regularly, allow thoughts to wander, observe and imagine for inspiration are some of the steps that you could take to build your creativity.

New product development, new technologies, new ways of working in a team and many other roles require creativity.

Cognitive flexibility: It means having good mental agility. In simple words, this is the ability to switch between tasks or different thought processes. Mental agility allows you to effectively and efficiently handle different scenarios. Increase your cognitive flexibility by:

Playing brainy games such as chess, word search, puzzles etc that challenges your mind

Read more and more to get exposed to different thought processes and more knowledge

Alter your everyday routine and seek new experiences

Meet new people with different cultures and walks of life; they are likely to give you different perspectives and viewpoints

Emotional intelligence: Emotional intelligence is identified as an individual’s ability to recognize, understand, manage and reason with emotions. This skill is helpful to perform well in a team as well as grow as a good leader. To improve emotional intelligence, you must:

Use an assertive way of communicating; share opinion while still respecting others

Respond instead of reacting while handling conflict, stay calm, don’t jump to conclusions and make a conscious effort to resolve the situation with appropriate actions and words

Listening can help bring clarity to the issue, also prevents misunderstandings and allows the listener to respond properly

Take criticism positively and think empathetically

Be approachable and sociable, smile and communicate clearly

People management: For improved productivity, it’s vital to motivate your team, know how to delegate, respect and respond to their needs. Here skills like emotional intelligence and leadership should be played alongside.

Decision making: A single decision can have a powerful and far-reaching impact. There can’t be a better example of this than the example of Apple. The board’s decision to bring back Steve Jobs, after firing him a decade earlier, led to amazing product innovation and the creation of one of the most valuable companies in the world. Here are the steps to develop good decision making skill:

Start with setting the end result in mind

Review the information/ facts/ data at hand

Analyse the information along with possible solutions/ pros and cons of each scenario

Visualise the scenario with the outcome

Select the course of action

157,26-2-20,Follow the rules,"Making a career in law is a dream of many. However not all students are able to become sucessfull lawyers. DR Sarfaraz Ahmed Khan shares tips that will help students in the long run

Lawyers have a huge responsibility on their shoulders, irrespective of the scope of their work or the area of law they practice. The way they handle their client's case can make a difference to the court's verdict, financial pacts or any other legal matter they deal with. Nowadays, lawyers are expected to remain updated about every area of law which is a given requirement to practice law. However, not all of them are successful because it takes a lot more than just knowing the existing laws or staying updated with the amendments.

Successful lawyers possess the following skills which make them stand out of the crowd:

Communication skills

Communications skills are a key requirement of every job, and the legal profession is not excluded from it either. You must have strong oral and written communication skills because legal profession requires both. Whether it is drafting correspondence, presenting arguments, filing pleadings/other documents in the Court or striking negotiations with clients/other lawyers/third parties, you must be able to present information in lucid, concise and logical manner. Moreover, listening skills are equally important to understand clients' needs and ensure that no points are missed out during interactions with other people.

Research and analytical skills

The scope of law is so extensive that it becomes challenging for lawyers to have a deep understanding of the facts and figures of each and every law or case. Some cases are so complex in nature that lawyers have to spend considerable time in referring archives, precedents and lengthy documents to dig out any information that could come handy in the current matters that they are dealing with. The real research skills also lies in extracting relevant information smartly in a short span of time. A successful lawyer’s job does not end with research. You have to analyse the gathered information logically to gain useful insights and draw conclusions.

Attention to detail

An eye for detail is another crucial skill to become a successful lawyer. Even the smallest detail or error can make or mar the case. It can even have huge cost implications for the client or lawyer himself. Hence, it is imperative to be detail-oriented and try not to overlook any information, no matter how trivial it may appear.

Technology skills

Successful lawyers need to be technology-savvy from two perspectives:

Greater efficiency in their work: Today, there are various software applications that can help automate and digitise administrative tasks such as billing, research, data entry, information filing, correspondence and help lawyers to reduce their time and effort, increase their productivity and focus on core tasks.

There are also advanced technology tools which can streamline contacts, manage deadlines and schedule tasks in an organised manner. Modern-day lawyers are also exploring artificial intelligence and analytics to conduct due diligence, review documents, and predict legal outcomes.

Handle cases related to technology: Lawyers who can tackle cases pertaining to cybersecurity, blockchain, digital intellectual property and other technologies are in great demand today. You can carve a successful niche career for yourself by familiarising yourself with technology laws.

Ethics and integrity

Clients trust their lawyers with every little piece of information of their personal life or business in return of utmost confidentiality. Successful lawyers understand this and represent their client with the utmost ethics and integrity. They ensure that there is no conflict of interests with themselves or anyone. Successful lawyers maintain their personal/moral values and respect towards the judiciary system.

Collaboration

No lawyer can work in silos. They need to collaborate with their staff, partners, experts, witnesses and many other stakeholders to build a winning case, find new clients or ask for favours. Successful lawyers believe in teamwork and networking. They need to have strong skills and cultivate long-term relationships with everyone.

The above-mentioned skills are fundamental to excel in your legal career in addition to expertise and experience.

159,26-2-20,MindIT,"The ability to focus can make or break your success in life. In fact, scientists consider the ability to establish mental focus as an important predictor of a person’s future success. It is perhaps one of the most important indicators, along with intelligence and GPA. We may be unable to increase intelligence, but we still can greatly increase our ability to focus

There is a huge difference between a sharp mind and a focused mind. A focused mind is very strong and energy transfers in this stage are purely undiluted to give 100%. However, if you have a Sharp Mind that gets diluted, you will not be able to give 100% to the action. Hence the focused mind is the key to success.

In second stage, It is very important for the mind to be healthy in order to achieve 100% focus. How do you bring all the states of mind together?

All resolutions take place in a conscious mind, so a resolution to bring together all states of mind is also conceived in a conscious mind. Once that happens, the resolution has to be backed up with core energy to bring the right focus.

he other three states of mind — unconscious, super conscious and sub conscious — get aligned automatically depending upon the willpower or core energy pushed into the resolution. The alignment may be different for different events, but with practice, you will get the required consistency for bringing them together.

To achieve this alignment it is very important to control your focus, which comes with the control of your breathing. Regulated breathing helps you to achieve a higher percentage and levels of focus.

The happy mind leads to a healthy mind and body. A happy external environment gives you happy memories. Suppose you visit a children’s park – it will remind you of your happy days as a child. A happy mind produces happy thoughts and happy experiences.

When the mind focuses on any cognitive sense at one time, it gets more information than would normally be passed on to it. For example, if you are picking up apples from the market, you select a few out of the many by picking them up and trying to feel their freshness.

This is done over a period of five to seven seconds spent on each apple. If you hold one apple for a longer period of time, you will start to focus your energy on it through your sense of sight and touch. Your site will give you information about the look of the apple and touch will give information about the feel of it.

Try closing your eyes and picking up an apple, spend some 15-20 seconds trying to feel it and see what information it passes on to you. You may also get some additional information. Try it.

Thus, a calm and peaceful mind is required to focus energies into your cognitive senses. To have a healthy mind, your thoughts have to be positive; to have positive thoughts, your influencing layers have to be lean; and to have lean influencing layers, your cognitive senses have to be sensitive enough to keep the garbage out — if garbage is poured in, only garbage will come out

Last, I would suggest, the key to living a focused life is direction. When you have a clear goal, you can steer all your actions in one direction. But if you are unsure where to go, you will mindlessly wander around.

At the same time, it is often not so important how long we work, but how effectively we use our working hours. If we pay the closest attention to maintaining a high level of focus, we can use the available hours of the day more effectively. However, if we allow distractions to draw away our attention, we are less likely to accomplish much in the time available.

164,26-2-20,Kiwis coach surprised by India’s batting in 1st Test,"New Zealand coach Gary Stead on Tuesday said he was a bit surprised by India’s abject surrender in the first Test but is expecting a strong comeback in Christchurch.

India were all out for 165 and 191 in the two innings of the opening Test, leading to a 10-wicket drubbing in just over three days.

“It was a bit of a surprise but it was also due to the pressure we put on those guys for long periods of time. You get Trent and Tim to operate in our conditions and both were outstanding,” Stead told reporters on Tuesday.

“Trent’s freshness after being out for eight weeks added spark.”

The head coach also had a subtle warning for the Indian team, saying touring New Zealand could be as tough as playing in some of the other countries.

“We want teams to believe that it is as tough in New Zealand as it is playing anywhere else in the world. That’s a pride thing.”

Getting Ajinkya Rahane cheaply on the fourth morning was the clincher for Stead. After that, he knew that New Zealand would wrap it up quickly.

“Guess picked up wickets at critical times in the match. We got Rahane out and it was the catalyst of the belief,” he said.

India captain Virat Kohli had expressed a desire for his batsmen to come out with a positive approach, and Stead feels that a world class side like India would like to dominate the proceedings.

“I expect Indian batsmen trying to dominate more and that will be a challenge for our bowlers because a world class side like India will come back hard.”

Neil Wagner is back for the second Test after the birth of his first child and there is a possibility that the home team will go in with four specialist seamers in bowling friendly conditions at the Hagley Oval.

“That’s always good selection dilemma to have as Neil Wagner is coming back. Kyle Jamieson made most of his debut in the outstanding manner that he played. Neil will be back (in the eleven) with us without a doubt,” Stead said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kiwis-coach-surprised-by-india---s-batting-in-1st-test.html
165,26-2-20,"Kohli, Pant, Shami in Asia XI squad","India skipper Virat Kohli was on Tuesday named in the Asia XI squad, also featuring Rishabh Pant and Mohammed Shami, to take on a World XI side in a two-match T20 International series to celebrate the birth centenary of Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman here.

Kohli has been named by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for one match subject to availability, which is yet to be confirmed by the BCCI. The two matches are scheduled to be held on March 21 and 22.

“We have already received four names from India,” Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

“We haven’t signed contracts but Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav, Shikhar Dhawan and Mohammed Shami are supposed to come. They have said KL Rahul and Virat Kohli will play one game each, but that hasn’t been finalised,” he added.

BCB wants Kohli to be a part of both the T20Is but considering the hectic schedule of the Indian team, it remains to be seen if the maestro makes himself available.

“Kohli’s name has been sent but the call on his participation lies with him and he will take it after due consultation with BCCI President Sourav Ganguly,” a BCCI source said.

The Indian team is currently touring New Zealand and is engaged in a two-match Test series.

A week after the New Zealand tour ends, India will play a three-match ODI series against South Africa beginning March 12 in Dharamsala.

The second game will be played in Lucknow on March 15 and third in Kolkata on March 18. The IPL also starts on March 29.

Asked about the Indian players’ availability for the matches, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly last Friday said they “can send four to five players”.

The World XI includes, among others, former South African captain Faf du Plessis, and veteran big-hitters Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard.

The Asia XI features four Bangladeshi players in Mustafizur Rehman, Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Liton Das.

The squad does not have any Pakistani player.

“We are uncertain about Pakistan since the PSL (Pakistan Super League) will be ongoing,” Hassan said.

Pursuing a course abroad is every student’s dream but it comes with a lot challenges. Which course to take, which university to opt for and which country to live in are some of the most common questions that arises in a student’s mind.

The answer to all these questions can be the Bond University, Australia.

“The Bond Faculty of Society and Design offer a wide variety of courses ranging from Architecture, Project Management, Pyschology to Criminology,” Professor Alan Patching, Associate Dean — External Engagement, Faculty of Society & Design tells you.

Among all the courses that the university has to offer, the most popular ones among the Indian students are the ones that can land them a job in Australia.

“Students often go for courses that can help them get a job in the country. In order to do that, they have to meet two requirements — the courses have to be in the Government’s list of professions and the students have to have a lingual degree. Project Management and Construction Management are a few of them,” Prof Patching tells you.

The other benefit that comes with studying at Bond university is that students can complete certain courses much quicker.

There are additional professional courses for postgraduate students that helps students to do internships and experience the work culture of the country.

171,26-2-20,ISMA revises India’s sugar output upward by 2 pc to 26.5 mn tonnes for 2019-20,"Industry body ISMA on Tuesday revised the country’s sugar production upward by two per cent to 26.5 million tonnes for the ongoing 2019-20 marketing year, much lower than last year but enough to meet the local demand. It may be noted that a senior Food Ministry official on February 24 had said the total sugar output would be around 27 million tonnes this year.

Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had in November last year pegged sugar production at 26 million tonnes for the 2019-20 marketing year (October to September) considering fall in sugarcane crop in key growing states, compared with 33.16 million tonnes during the 2018-19 marketing year.

Already, about 17 million tonnes of sugar has been manufactured by mills till February 15. Annual sugar consumption in India, the world’s second largest producer after Brazil, is about 26 million tonnes. Releasing the latest data, ISMA said: “Sugar production during 2019-20 would be slightly more than what was estimated in November 2019. ISMA has accordingly revised its sugar production estimates upwards from 26 million tonnes to 26.5 million tonnes for 2019-20. The production estimate has been revised after considering reduction of sugar following higher production of ethanol by way of diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice, it said in a statement.

According to the second estimate, production in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s largest sugar-producing state, is estimated to be 11.8 million tonnes this year, almost similar to what the state had produced in 2018-19. However, in Maharashtra, sugar production is estimated to drop by almost 40 per cent to around 6.2 million tonnes in 2019-20 as against 10.72 million tonnes in 2018-19.

“Based on our analysis, we expect higher yield from the balance sugarcane available for harvesting which is mainly in areas which are high yielding districts like Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Pune,” ISMA said. Similarly, in Karnataka, sugar production is estimated to be around 3.3 million tonnes in 2019-20 from 4.43 million tonnes in 2018-19 due to fall in cane acreage by 21 per cent. According to ISMA, there has not been any major changes in the other sugarcane growing states of the country.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/isma-revises-india---s-sugar-output-upward-by-2-pc-to--26-5-mn-tonnes-for-2019-20.html
172,26-2-20,Anfield magic,"Liverpool earned a record-equalling 18th consecutive Premier League win as the runaway leaders came from behind to beat West Ham 3-2 thanks to Sadio Mane’s late strike on Monday.

Jurgen Klopp’s side were in danger of dropping Premier League points for the first time since their draw at Manchester United on October 20 after falling behind in the second half at Anfield.

Georginio Wijnaldum put Liverpool ahead early on but Issa Diop equalised soon after.

Pablo Fornals gave struggling West Ham a stunning lead, but Lukasz Fabianski’s woeful blunder allowed Mohamed Salah to equalise with his 19th goal of the season.

Mane completed the fightback with nine minutes left as Liverpool moved 22 points clear of second placed Manchester City.

The Reds’ dramatic escape ensured they equalled Manchester City’s English top-flight record of 18 consecutive league wins set between August and December 2017.

“I never thought it would be broken or equalled. We did it and I cannot believe it happened to be honest,” Klopp said of the record.

“Whatever will happen this season is an effort of all of us. So far, so good.”

Their 21st successive league victory at Anfield also equalled their own English top-flight record for consecutive home wins, set by Bill Shankly’s team between January and December 1972.

Liverpool need four victories from their final 11 games to guarantee a first English title since 1990.

189,26-2-20,Trump: Modi is for religious freedom,"US Prez says tour fantastic, CAA is India’s internal matter

US President Donald Trump said here on Tuesday he discussed the issue of religious freedom at a great length with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but there was no talk on the Delhi violence or the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, (CAA).

On the Kashmir issue, the US President said “it is a thorn in many sides” and added “every story has two sides.” Trump said he is a good friend of both Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and repeated his offer to help resolve the Kashmir issue if he is asked. He also talked about Afghanistan pullout, H1B visa, and a whole range of issues with Modi.

Making these points at a Press conference, Trump said he discussed the issue of religious freedom with the Prime Minister during his comprehensive talks and that the Indian leader wants people to have this freedom.

Describing Modi as a “terrific” leader and India as a “tremendous country,” Trump said, “We did talk about religious freedom. Prime Minister Modi wants people to have religious freedom in India...If you look back, India has worked hard for religious freedom.”

However, when asked if he discussed the violent incidents here during his visit, he said that he did not discuss individual attacks with Modi and “that is up to India”.

Asked about his position on the CAA, the President said, “I don’t want to discuss that, I want to leave that to India. I hope they will do the right thing for the people of India.”

Trump, who held talks with Modi on the second and the last day of his visit, said these were great and fantastic two days. “I’m gonna be not at all controversial because...I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer, one little answer, like John will ask me one simple question and you will blow it out and that will be the end of the trip. You won’t even talk about the trip. So I will be very conservative in my answers if you don’t mind,” Trump said.

Describing the Kashmir issue as a “big problem” between India and Pakistan, he said it is “a thorn in a lot of people’s sides” and reiterated his offer to mediate between the two countries to ease the tension.

“If anything I can do to mediate, I will do,” he said, adding that Pakistan figured in his talks with Modi. “I have good equation with Pakistan PM Imran Khan. They are working to control cross-border terrorism,” he said.

The US President also talked with Modi about his country’s peace deal with the Taliban, and said that India will like to see it happen.

On defence ties, he said India is buying a lot of military hardware from the US. On the issue of trade, he said India is probably the nation with highest tariffs and noted that the Harley Davidson has to pay “huge amount of tariff.” The US has to be treated fairly, he added. To a question about reports of Russia trying to influence the US presidential poll, he said intelligence agencies never shared such information with him.

Earlier, while giving details about the extensive talks between the two leaders, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the CAA did not come up for discussion noting that the two leaders talked about religious harmony in a “positive way.”

In response to a question on whether the contentious CAA and the National Register of Citizens were discussed, Shringla said the new citizenship law did not come up in the talks.

“The issue of CAA did not come up, but with regard to what you mentioned, the term religious freedom, there was appreciation from both sides that pluralism and diversity are a common binding factor of both the countries,” he said.

“You would have heard President Trump in his speech yesterday in Ahmedabad referred to religious diversity and harmony that is evident in India and discussions really to the extent possible were on these lines on this issue,” Shringla told reporters.

In response to a question he said, “religious harmony was discussed in a positive way” between the two leaders and added that discussion on Jammu & Kashmir centred on positive developments in the region. “Things were moving in the right direction,” he said on discussion on Jammu & Kashmir during Indo-US talks.

On trade, Shringla said there has been “very useful” and comprehensive discussions. “There was appreciation that trade has increased year-on-year steadily over the last few years. The US exports to India has increased fairly dramatically and there was noticeable adverse trade imbalance decline from USD 30 billion a few years ago to USD 25 billion,” he said.

He said adverse trade imbalance is also gradually eroding with greater amount of acquisitions we are making in areas of oil and gas and purchase of commercial aircraft.

“The US is India’s largest trading partner and it accounts for 12 per cent of our total export and India is emerging as a very large market for the US too,” Shringla said.

“There are complementarities in this because there are a lot of areas in which we require goods and technologies which we don’t have from the US and vice versa and there is mutuality of benefits in these complementarities. These are the areas we want to focus on when we start discussions on a large trade agreement,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump--modi-is-for-religious-freedom-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump--modi-is-for-religious-freedom.html

Hubei and Wuhan together with over 50 million population continue to be under lockdown since January 23 with all public and private transportation remained suspended.

Other key areas including Beijing, Zhejiang and Guangdong should enhance coordination with Hubei in prevention work, such as information sharing, to contain further spread of the epidemic, He said.

For lower-risk regions across the country, preventive measures should be adopted at the county level to avoid relapse of the epidemic situation while advancing resumption of work and production as soon as possible, He said, stressing efforts to step up disinfection and ventilation as well as passengers' temperature and health monitoring to reduce the risk of virus transmission amidst people's return trips.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-coronavirus--death-toll-climbs-to-over-2-700-amidst-signs-of-slowdown-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-coronavirus--death-toll-climbs-to-over-2-700-amidst-signs-of-slowdown.html

194,26-2-20,Shoot at sight in NE Delhi!,"Riots over CAA kill 13; arsonists have field day

Shoot at site” orders have been issued by the Delhi Police to rein in the rioters after north-east Delhi continued to burn on Tuesday, with the mobs armed with sticks and rods roamed the streets, pelting stones, vandalising shops and threatening whosoever came in their way.

For the third consecutive day, Gokulpuri, the densely populated area witnessed large-scale rioting as mobs damaged two fire tenders and raised incendiary slogans in strife-torn Maujpur and set a bike on fire. Streets in many parts of the area were littered with stones, bricks and burnt tyres, a mute testimony to the spiraling violence and bloodshed that took on a communal colour on Monday. Such scenes were not seen in the national Capital for decades as frenzied mobs thrashed people on the road in Maujpur and also vented their ire on e-rickshaws and other vehicles. Many journalists were heckled and told to go back. A journalist working with a local channel was shot at while some other scribes were injured.

Even as the Delhi Police undertook steps to quell the continuing violence in several areas of north-east Delhi on Tuesday, incidents of arson continued on Tuesday evening in the Chandbagh area. Rioters set afire shops and pelted stones in a fresh wave of violence even as the police used tear gas to disperse the crowds. Paramilitary forces have been deployed to bring the situation under control.

Since Monday, 13 people, including Delhi Police Head Constable Ratan Lal, have died while around 200 people have been injured, including 56 police personnel, in the clashes between pro and anti-CAA groups at Jafrabad, Maujpur, Chandbagh, Khureji Khas and Bhajanpura. Three firemen also received injuries while dousing flames in the area. Police has registered 11 FIRs.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah convened a meeting with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Police chief Amulya Patnaik to address the issue.

Following the clashes, schools were shut and fearful residents stayed indoors as restless crowds roamed the streets, seemingly unmindful of prohibitory orders restricting the assembly of more than four people. Meanwhile, the pleas relating to the north-east Delhi violence, which has claimed 10 lives, reached the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court on Tuesday and they are likely to be heard on Wednesday.

Mandeep Randhawa, Delhi Police spokesperson said the situation in north-east Delhi is under control, even as several parts of the national Capital continued to reel under violence.

“11 FIRs have been registered in connection with the violence. We are responding to incidents involving anti-social elements. Sufficient force has been deployed in north-east Delhi. The Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have also been deployed,” Randhawa said, adding that senior police officers are monitoring the situation.

Among those killed was Vinod Kumar, a resident of Ghonda who was brought dead to hospital and whose body is at the morgue of the Jag Parvesh Hospital. Also killed was Mohammad Furkan from Kardampuri, near Jafrabad, who got married in 2014 and has two children. His brother, Mohammed Imran, overcome with grief, said they were both in the handicrafts business.

“He had gone to get some food for his children. Someone told me he had been shot. I couldn’t believe it as I had met him barely an hour earlier. I kept calling him... I then rushed to GTB Hospital where I was told that he is dead. My world has crashed around me,” he told reporters, sobbing inconsolably outside the hospital.

Mohammed Imran blamed BJP leader Kapil Mishra’s tweet, giving Delhi Police an ultimatum to clear the streets of protesters and saying people would be quiet only until US President Donald Trump is in India.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police on Tuesday appealed to residents of city to maintain peace and harmony in the national Capital.

“In the last two days some incidents of stone pelting, arson and damage to property have occurred in some pockets of north-east Delhi. Delhi Police is making all earnest efforts, including deployment of reinforcement and involving respectable citizens of the area, to restore the normalcy,” said a senior police official.

“Therefore, it is appealed to all citizens of Delhi to co-operate with Delhi Police in maintaining peace and harmony in the city. They are also advised not to lend an ear to rumour mongers and unverified messages being circulated on Social Media. It is also urged that social media platforms should be used with responsibility. Public cooperation is solicited in maintaining peace,” said the senior police official.

A resident in Maujpur said that this is the first time in 35 years -- possibly since the 1984 anti-Sikh riots -- that he has seen a situation such as this. “The area had always remained peaceful,” he said.

Five stations on the Delhi Metro’s Pink Line were closed for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in the wake of the trouble. Amit Sharma, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Shahdara, underwent an operation on Monday night for the head injury sustained during the clashes. A delegation comprising members of the Jamia Coordination Committee, Jawaharlal Nehru Union Students’ Union, Pinjra Tod, met senior police officials and deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia late on Monday night to raise concerns about the situation.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shoot-at-sight-in-ne-delhi--2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/shoot-at-sight-in-ne-delhi-.html
195,26-2-20,Riteish Deshmukh: Hope to make a biopic on my father's life,"Actor Riteish Deshmukh hopes to someday make a film on the life of his father, the late former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh. He said he is waiting for the right script that will entertain the audience as well as do justice to his father's journey.

""It is one of those miraculous journeys of a human being. He started off as a sarpanch (head of Gram Sabha) and went on to become Chief Minister of a state. Many a time, people have written scripts about his life and asked me to make a film but it is not easy,"" said Riteish.

He added: ""When a subject is so close to your heart then you forget objectivity. Just suppose, I make a film on his life and people say I have shown only the good things about him and not shown the other side of his life. If somebody else makes it, then I will say, 'he wasn't like this, he never used to talk like this and certain things never happened in his life'. So, there will always be difference in opinions when you make films on such subjects.""

All the same he hoped to make a film on his father's life someday. ""When you write a book on someone's life, you can write 500 or 600 pages. But it is very difficult to show all aspects of a person's life in a two-hour film. If you don't succeed, the biopic gets boring. So, one need to take care. Hopefully, if something comes up, then why not? But it's not in the agenda in the near future,"" the actor explained.

Riteish was interacting with the media at a promotional event of ""Baaghi 3"". The film stars Tiger Shroff with Shraddha Kapoor, and is directed by Ahmed Khan. The third film of the ""Baaghi"" franchise is an official remake of the 2012 Tamil blockbuster ""Vettai"".

198,26-2-20,"India, US ink $3 bn copters deal, plan robust trade pact","India and the US on Tuesday decided to take their strong ties to comprehensive global partnership level with focus on increasing bilateral defence and security cooperation besides energy security after talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting US President Donald Trump here. While Modi described the relationships as “one of the most important partnerships,” Trump said the two countries have made “wonderful deal”.

India signed a three billion dollar deal for procuring from the USA naval multi-role helicopters and Apache attack helicopters for the Army. The two sides also inked three MoUs in the fields of mental health, safety of medical products and energy.

Describing India-US relations as “one of the most important partnerships” of the 21st century, Modi said increasing the bilateral defence and security cooperation is a very key aspect of this relationship. He also announced that the two countries decided to have comprehensive global partnership, giving a strong fillip to strategic ties.

Addressing the media at a joint Press meet after his one on one talk with Trump covering entire range of issues, including defence, security, trade and energy, the Prime Minister said the unprecedented and historic welcome given to Trump in India will be remembered. He also said the relations between the two countries are not merely confined to Governments but are people-driven.

Trump announced that the two countries have finalised defence deals worth $3 billion and asserted that their focus was on having a comprehensive trade deal.

The relations between the two countries have never been as good as they are now, Trump said, adding that the countries have made “wonderful deal”.

Modi said as far as bilateral trade is concerned, there have been positive talks between the two commerce Ministers.

“President Trump and I have agreed that our teams will give a legal shape to the understanding that our Commerce Ministers have reached. We have also agreed to start negotiations for a big trade deal. We hope that it will yield good results in mutual interest,” the Prime Minister said.

Asserting that the cooperation between India and the US was based on their common democratic values, he said this cooperation for rule based international order, especially in Indo-Pacific and global commons.

“Both of us agree on the importance of sustainable and transparent financing in the development of connectivity infrastructure in the world. Our mutual understanding is not only in each other’s but the world’s interest,” Modi said, adding that the two countries have decided to take Indo-US ties to the comprehensive global partnership level.

The Prime Minister said, “increasing defence and security cooperation between two countries is a very key aspect of the strategic partnership between India and the US. We also agreed on new mechanism to contain drug trafficking.” He also noted that he had met Trump five times in last eight months.

Modi said both leaders held a constructive discussion on every important aspect of the partnership between the two countries, be it defence and security, energy strategic partnership, cooperation in technology, global connectivity, trade relations or people to people ties. Both sides also agreed on having a new mechanism to tackle serious concerns like drug trafficking, narco terrorism and other organised crimes, he added.

India and the US are committed to openness, and fair and balanced trade, and the bilateral trade between them has seen growth in double digit in the last three years, the Prime Minister said.

Talking about defence and strategic ties between the two countries, Trump said the US is looking forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet.

“We make the greatest weapons ever made: airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships. We make the best. And we’re dealing now with India. But this includes advanced air defence systems and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles,” Trump said after announcing the three billion dollar deal for 24 naval multi-role helicopters and six Apache attack helicopters.

He said India and the US have expanded their defence cooperation and said both the sides affirmed their commitment to protect their citizens from radical Islamic terrorism. “In this effort, the US is also working productively with Pakistan to confront terrorists who operate on its soil,” Trump said.

The US president said, “earlier, today we expanded our defence cooperation with agreements for India to purchase more than USD 3 billion of advanced American military equipment, including Apache and MH-60 Romeo helicopters -- the finest in the world. These deals will enhance our joint defence capabilities as our militaries continue to train and operate side by side.”

“Another major focus of my discussions with Prime Minister Modi was forging bilateral economic relationships that are fair and reciprocal, he said. “Our teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement. I am optimistic that we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries. Since, I took office US exports to India are up nearly 60 per cent and exports of high quality American energy have grown by 500 per cent,” Trump said.

He said to further strengthen the economic ties, the US is pleased to announce that the US international development finance cooperation will be establishing a permanent presence right here. “As we deepen our partnership with India, we remember that our two countries are united by shared traditions of democracy and constitutions that protect freedom, individual rights and rule of law,” the US president said.

Later, giving details of the talks between the two leaders, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the new citizenship law did not come up for discussion.

He said India and the US held talks in five major categories - security, defence, energy, technology and people-to-people contact, with Trump assuring India highest consideration for collaboration in defence sector. Shringla said Modi and Trump also decided to move towards what was referred to as “big deal” in trade sector.

He said the two countries have also decided to set up working groups on curbing narcotics trafficking and reinvigorating homeland security dialogue. “President Trump has assured highest consideration to India for procurement, technology and joint collaboration in defence sector,” he said. Trump and Modi held talks for five hours to arrive at a slew of agreements, Shringla said.

He said that energy has emerged as one of most important areas of bilateral cooperation and India is expected to source USD 9 billion from US in 2020. “Indian side raised issue of H1 B visa and highlighted contribution of Indian professionals in high-tech sector,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india--us-ink--3-bn-copters-deal--plan-robust-trade-pact-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india--us-ink--3-bn-copters-deal--plan-robust-trade-pact.html
199,26-2-20,"This madness must end, Shah assured all help, says Kejriwal","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah was positive and all parties have stressed on restoring peace in the national Capital.

Kejriwal visited some of those injured in the violence at the GTB Hospital on Tuesday and appealed to people to “stop this madness”.

Talking to the media after the meeting, Kejriwal said, “Meeting with HM Amit Shah was positive and it was decided that all parties will take steps to restore peace. The police are doing their bit and HM has assured that whatever force is needed, will be provided”.

The Home Minister on Tuesday held a meeting to discuss the prevailing situation in the national Capital after violence in north-east Delhi over the CAA left 13 people, including a head constable, dead.

Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Kejriwal, Commissioner of Police Amulya Patnaik, Congress Delhi unit chief Subhash Chopra, BJP’s Manoj Tiwari and Ramvir Bidhuri attended the meeting.

“The Army will also be deployed in the violence-affected areas if needed. But everybody has decided to rise above their party politics and work towards reinstating peace in the city,” he said.

Kejriwal said that a number of measures are being taken to stop the violence spreading in Delhi. The Chief Minister held a meeting with the MLAs and senior officials at his residence and instructions were given to take all necessary steps to establish peace.

“The violence that has erupted in the North-East Delhi since a few days is a matter of grave concern for all of us. I want to appeal to the people of Delhi, to maintain peace and harmony. All of the problems can be resolved with peaceful discourse on the matter,” he said.

“I met with the MLAs of the affected areas. Hospital authorities in the area have been alerted and instructions have been provided to them so that the injured people can get proper treatment. Fire department has been instructed to coordinate with the police, so that they can reach the affected areas in time. All the MLAs are worried about the insufficient strength of the police personnel. Also, police officials are unable to act on the situation unless they get orders from the senior officials”, he said.

“The MLAs of the border areas have also noted that miscreants are entering the borders in huge numbers. The borders need to be sealed and preventive arrests of the miscreants need to be made,” he said.

Kejriwal also said, “I have also directed the SDMs of the areas to take out a peace march along with the local police officials. Peace committees at the local level must conduct meetings, inviting MLAs and members from all the religions and communities,”

“The temples and mosques situated in the affected areas must also appeal to the people to maintain peace and calm. I have also requested the chief secretary to speak to the DCP to strengthen the police task force to control the situation of violence in Delhi”, he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/this-madness-must-end--shah--assured-all-help--says-kejriwal-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/this-madness-must-end--shah--assured-all-help--says-kejriwal.html

201,26-2-20,‘Happiness Class’ gets new student in Melania,"US First Lady says curriculum inspiring as inquisitive kids ask her ‘How big is America?’ ‘Is US very far’

The US First Lady, Melania Trump, who visited a Delhi Government school on Tuesday to have first-hand experience of the unique “Happiness Curriculum”, virtually turned herself into a student by joining the schoolchildren in the class activities.

Along with the students, Melania participated in meditation, storytelling and other relaxing activities at Sarvodaya Co-Educational Senior Secondary School at Moti Bagh in South Delhi.

Melania was surprised to see the inquisitiveness of the curious kindergarten students who asked her many questions, like “How big is America?” “Is it very far?” “Which is your favourite cartoon?”

Later the US First Lady said the “Happiness Curriculum” is inspiring and has set a “healthy and positive” example for educators.

Excited students dressed in traditional attire welcomed Melania at the school that was decked up with floral garlands. She was all smiles as she joined the students in three classrooms, where she was briefed by the teachers. Melania interacted with the children, before enjoying boisterous dance performances by the youngsters.

After lighting the ceremonial lamp, the First Lady took a tour of the school, heading to a reading room for class 4 students where she attended a storytelling session.

‘Happiness Class’ gets new student in Melania

The First Lady, who donned a white embroidered shirt-dress paired with a red belt, visited an activity classroom for kindergarten students where she sat among the children who were engaged in drawing, clay modelling and playing with building blocks.

'How big is America', 'Is it very far', 'What do you do as the First Lady', 'What is your favourite cartoon"" were among the few questions asked by the curious kindergarten students.

Melania then headed to the playground to observe a yoga session where students were performing 'surya namaskar' (Sun salutation). The First Lady also meditated with class 4 students in their ""happiness class"".""I am feeling very relaxed,"" she said after the brief meditation as part of ""mindfulness"" activity of the 'Happiness Class'.

The 'Happiness Class' was started by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi Government schools in 2018. As part of the programme, students are taught various activities, including meditation, street plays, basic obedience and aims to reduce anxiety and stress levels among children.

While Melania enjoyed the foot tapping number, a student in the audience became the show-stealer with his impromptu jig as everyone including the First Lady cheered for him. When the child suddenly scooted up to perform 'bhangra' moves, the security men were taken by surprise and one of them stepped forward but did not interfere.

Addressing the students, Melania praised the concept of happiness class and spoke of her similar 'Be Best' initiative to promote well-being.

""It is my first visit to India and I am grateful to have received such a warm welcome today.

202,26-2-20,Delhi tops global list of polluted Capitals,"India’s national capital, Delhi, heads the list of the most polluted Capital cities of the world with an average of 98.6 Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) concentration, as per the World Air Quality Report released on Tuesday by the Swiss-based agency AirVisual. Delhi’s satellite town Ghaziabad tops the list of the most polluted regional cities (110 PM).

The report noted that 21 of the world’s 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India.

Overall, India ranked fifth on the list of 98 countries in PM 2.5 concentration. In contrast, the neighbouring Bangladesh topped the list among the most polluted country per person, followed by Pakistan, Mongolia and Afghanistan.

PM 2.5 microscopic particles which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system.

PM 2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon. Exposure to such particles has been linked to lung and heart disorders and can impair cognitive and immune functions.

The report indicated that climate change and air pollution are linked and that “urgent action” was needed to fight greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the fact that national air pollution in India decreased by 20 per cent from 2018 to 2019, with 98 per cent of cities experiencing of varying levels of improvement came as a silver line.

Of the world’s top 30 most polluted cities during 2019, 21 are located in India, 27 in South Asia, and all the top 30 cities are within greater Asia. The global air quality information and tech company had gleaned data for the report from on the ground monitoring stations that measure levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, per cubic meter.

Citing reports that 90 per cent of the global population breathes air exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) exposure targets, the report indicated that air pollution is estimated to contribute to seven million premature deaths annually.

“Regionally, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Asia carry the highest burden of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution overall,” the report indicated, adding that only six of the 355 cities in the region meet WHO targets.

“2019 air quality data shows clear indications that climate change can directly increase the risk of exposure to air pollution, through increased frequency and intensity of forest fires and sandstorms,” it said.

The report also talked about India’s launch of the country’s first National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which aims to reduce PM 2.5 and the bigger particulate PM 10 air pollution in 102 cities by 20-30% by 2024 compared to 2017 levels.

203,26-2-20,"India, US express support for Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process","India and the US on Tuesday said they support an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process that results in a sustainable peace, cessation of violence and elimination of terror safe havens.

The assertion in a joint statement came after talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump.

Speaking at a press conference in the national capital, Trump said the US and Taliban are ""pretty close"" to signing an agreement to formally end the war in Afghanistan.

""I spoke to PM Modi on it. I think India would like to see it happen. We are pretty close,"" Trump said.

""India and the United States share interest in a united, sovereign, democratic, inclusive, stable and prosperous Afghanistan,"" the joint statement said.

The two countries support an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process that results in a sustainable peace, cessation of violence, elimination of terrorist safe havens and preservation of the gains of the last 18 years, it said.

President Trump welcomed India's role in continuing to provide development and security assistance to help stabilise and provide connectivity in Afghanistan, the statement said.

Asked about the discussion on Afghanistan during Modi-Trump talks, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the Indian side certainly took note of the fact that there should be an agreement if all goes well over the next five days between the US and the Taliban.

""We are taking note of some of the aspects of the agreement. We would be watching the developments there very carefully. India and the US have a shared interest in a united, democratic, sovereign, stable prosperous Afghanistan,"" he said.

""We support a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-driven and Afghan-owned and that the peace process results in sustainable peace,"" he said.

During their talks, Modi and Trump also committed to working together to strengthen and reform the United Nations and other international organisations and ensure their integrity.

President Trump reaffirmed the support of the United States for India's permanent membership on a reformed UN Security Council.

He also reaffirmed US support for India's entry to the Nuclear Suppliers Group without any delay, the joint statement said.

Prime Minister Modi and President Trump also expressed interest in the concept of the Blue Dot Network, a multi-stakeholder initiative that will bring governments, the private sector, and civil society together to promote high-quality trusted standards for global infrastructure development, the statement said.

""The US appreciates India's role as a net provider of security, as well as developmental and humanitarian assistance in the Indian Ocean Region. India and the United States remain committed to sustainable, transparent, quality infrastructure development in the region,"" it said.

Modi and Trump welcomed the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) announcement of a USD 600 million financing facility for renewable energy projects in India, and the DFC's decision to establish a permanent presence in India this year, the statement said.

The two leaders noted the potential for the US to meet India's goal to diversify its import base for coking or metallurgical coal and natural gas, welcoming recent commercial arrangements intended to accelerate access to LNG in the Indian market.

PM Modi and President Trump encouraged the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited and Westinghouse Electric Company to finalize the techno-commercial offer for the construction of six nuclear reactors in India at the earliest date, the statement said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india--us-express-support-for-afghan-led--afghan-owned-peace-process-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/india--us-express-support-for-afghan-led--afghan-owned-peace-process.html

Not much is known about the film except that just like the ""Bahubali"" franchise and ""Saaho"", this film too will be an ambitious, mega-budget project. Shooting will begin later this year and a large part will be shot all over Europe.

The film is produced by Vyjayanthi Entertainments, a banner that completes 50 years in business. With the official announcement of the film on Wednesday, the production house also posted a video clip to mark its golden jubilee run the film industry.

205,26-2-20,"iQOO 3 5G: Value flagship device, exceptional fast charging","Chinese tech giant BBK Group's smartphone brand iQOO is the second smartphone in the country - after Realme - that has launched a 5G-capable handset. The price of its newly-launched flagship smartphone iQOO 3 with 5G capabilities begins at Rs 36,990.

The iQOO 3 device is available in three variants -- 8GB/128GB with 4G connectivity for Rs 36,990, the 8GB/256GB 4G variant for Rs 39,990 and the 5G-enabled variant of the phone with 12GB/256GB storage at Rs 44,990.

We used the 12GB/256GB storage variant for a couple of days and here's what we think of it.

The build quality of the device is solid -- sturdy body that felt premium in hand.

Interestingly, the design language of the smartphone faintly reminded us about Vivo V17, albeit for a smoother finish. The design resemblance is not much of a surprise as iQOO existed under Chinese handset maker Vivo's umbrella (only in China) for some time.

In terms of display, the device has a big 6.44-inch AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch on the top right corner. Considering the full-HD+ resolution, the viewing angles very pretty good. For added protection, the company has used a screen protector.

At 214.5 gram, the device is on the heavier side. This could partly be due to a hefty 4,440mAh battery.

The rear of the phone is manufactured out of Corning Gorilla Glass 6 which curves at the sides, thus, making it comfortable in the palm.

Even as there is some similarity between the Vivo V17 and iQOO 3, the cameras are different: The iQOO 3 packs in a quad-camera set up with 48MP primary camera, a 13MP telephoto camera, 13MP wide-angle camera and a 2MP depth sensor.

The images shot in daylight were impressive with balanced colours. There's a 16MP camera in the front for selfies which produced decent images too. Low-light images lacked details though.

The bottom houses a USB Type-C port, the SIM tray and the speaker. Those who still prefer wired listening can rejoice as the smartphone comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack.

There's a brightly-coloured power button to essentially break the monotony of the dark coloured body.

The device comes with a 7nm class 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset which can clock CPU speed up to 2.84Ghz. It is said to be a better power-efficient processor than the 855 series and consume 30 per cent less power compared to its predecessor.

Thanks to the flagship 865 chip, performance was blazing fast. However, we would have loved to see a higher refresh rate in this device, considering the fact that even the mid-range price segment is seeing devices with 90Hz displays.

A high point of the device is the big 4,400 battery which can be quickly charged with a 55W charging technology that's very handy.

The company's proprietary software iQOO UI (user interface) appears to have taken a cue from Vivo's Funtouch OS. However, there's a bit of clutter in the UI.

Conclusion: While the India premium market will witness several 5G-capable phones (although the 5G technology is still far) this year, iQOO 3 comes with a flagship chipset and extremely fast charging to charm users. It scores as a decent value flagship device.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iqoo-3-5g--value-flagship-device--exceptional-fast-charging-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/iqoo-3-5g--value-flagship-device--exceptional-fast-charging.html
206,26-2-20,India to launch Geo Imaging Satellite on March 5,"India will launch its Geo Imaging Satellite (GISAT-1) with its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV- F10) on March 5.

207,26-2-20,Project Prithvi: Technical glitches visible but skipper wants to wait,"Trent Boult and Tim Southee have exposed the chinks in Prithvi Shaw's armour but India skipper Virat Kohli is ready to wait and watch before any corrective analysis as he does not see a pattern in the young opener's dismissals so far.

There are a few shortcomings that experts have noticed in Shaw's batting after the 20-year-old right-handed batsman scored just 16 and 14 in the two innings of the first Test against New Zealand in Wellington, which India lost by 10 wickets.

""I think we can sit down and analyse, maybe after 8 or 10 similar dismissals. I don't think (it's fair to the guy), who is playing away from home for the first time and is probably experiencing different kind of bowling attack at international level compared to playing at home,"" Kohli had said, when asked about Shaw's dismissals at the end of the first Test.

""I don't think at this stage, we need to sit down and discuss what's going wrong because I don't see anything wrong. It's the execution of things which was not there.""

Shaw has, probably, the biggest back-lift in this current crop of top-order batsmen and often when the New Zealand bowlers are employing the short ball tactic, his bat face tends to close by the time the delivery reaches him.

Scott Kuggeleijn got him out in the first innings in the warm-up game in Hamilton and Trent Boult also used the tactic successfully in the second innings of the Wellington Test.

""I think as a batsman until you are committing the same mistake about seven or eight times, you can't really sit down and worry about things too much,"" Kohli said about his junior colleague.

International cricket is about finding one's own straps and Shaw also will work out what is best for him, feels the captain who has 70 hundreds to his credit in all formats.

""He (Shaw) will figure out. He will find ways to score runs because he is a natural stroke-player and he scores runs. It is not that he gets small runs (when he gets them). He gets big runs and knows how to get runs.""

The reason why Shaw faltered could be due to the lack of understanding of the pace of the Basin Reserve track but the former U-19 World Cup-winning skipper was not alone as some of the team's other big names also failed to gauge the nature of the pitch.

""It is just a matter of understanding the pace of the wicket and conditions as soon as possible. Again, when he is in a clear frame of mind, he is very, very destructive,"" Kohli said, hopeful that Shaw will learn quickly.

Clarity of mind is paramount at the highest level and once Shaw has that, there would be no stopping him.

""I think whenever we have done well overseas, the opening partnership has been with a lot of clarity and positivity even clearing the in-field, taking bowlers on so that you put them under pressure. He is that kind of a player,"" Kohli said.

""Once he feels that he can do it, I think it will be a different ball game. The mindset can shift very quickly.""

While Kohli's Test squad has had horses for courses policy, it seems that the skipper wants to stick with Shaw in the second Test even though Shubman Gill can't be completely ruled out of reckoning.

""Prithvi obviously wants to perform and no doubt about it, every batsman wants to. We need to give him that time to get used to the conditions a little bit and once he starts scoring, he will feel more confident about it.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/project-prithvi--technical-glitches-visible-but-skipper-wants-to-wait-2020-02-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/project-prithvi--technical-glitches-visible-but-skipper-wants-to-wait.html
