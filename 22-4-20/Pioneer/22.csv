0,22-4-20,The revivalist surge,"The Tablighi Jamaat is often considered extremely orthodox in its interpretations of Islam, with the ability to convert Muslims into radical believers

The Tablighi Jamaat (society of preachers) was founded by a Deobandi Islamic scholar, Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi, in Mewat, India, in 1926 with the objective of establishing a group of dedicated preachers as a Muslim revivalist society, who could reclaim “true” Islam, which he felt was not being practised by many Muslims across the world.

The slogan Kandhlawi coined for his new organisation captured the essence of its activities — “O Muslims, become true Muslims.” By the mid-1930s, the Tablighi Jamaat had a programme of belief, which included, beyond the five pillars of Islam and Islamic doctrinal tenets the following: Islamic education; modest Islamic dress and appearance; rejection of other religions; high regard for Muslims (yet allowed to operate in India since 1947); propagating Islam; self-financing of Tablighi trips; lawful means of earning a living and strict avoidance of divisive and sectarian issues.

The Tablighi Jamaat is often considered extremely orthodox in its interpretations of Islam, with the ability to convert Muslims into radical believers. They believe that the Prophet Mohammed has commanded all Muslims to convey the message of Allah to the world and the Tablighis take this as their solemn duty.

They divide themselves into small jamaats (societies) and travel frequently across the world to spread the message of Islam to Muslim houses. During this travel, they stay in local mosques. This free spread and the access to the remotest part of the country with ease has enabled them to meet vulnerable and deprived sections of the non-Muslim population in India.

Some fringe groups within the organisation are backed by the power of petro-dollars, the Inter Services Intelligence’s (ISI) dirty money machine, the vast network of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and other anti-national entities. These elements have converted a large section of the population in the last 70 years with ease and without coercion.

Radicalism and its role in acts of terror: Some Tablighi Jamaat followers have worked as allies of jihadi and sectarian organisations. However, once they joined militant organisations, they cut off their links with the Tablighis. However, over the years, the terror groups have used some of the Tablighi Jamaat congregations as recruitment camps. Some fringe elements in the Tablighi Jamaat have been sympathisers and supporters of jihadi organisations such as the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (Hum), the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

As per WikiLeaks, “Some of the 9/11 al-Qaeda suspects detained by the US in Guantanamo Bay had stayed in the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin West, New Delhi years ago.”

According to Pakistani security analysts and Indian investigators, HuM members, involved in the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999, were members of the Tablighi Jamaat.

The 2011 US investigation reports suggest that the Tablighi Jamaat had supported members of the Al-Qaeda to get visas and funds to travel from Pakistan.

Saad, the new Khalifa: Born on May 10, 1965, Maulana Muhammad Saad is the Amir (chief) of the Tablighi Jamaat. He is the grandson of Maulana Muhammad Ilyas, who founded the Jamaat. Maulana Saad became the chief of the Tablighi Jamaat on November 16, 2015 and claims to have 100 crore followers in 214 countries.

This huge number includes almost three-four crore converts in western Uttar Pradesh (UP) that the Jamaat has successfully targetted in the last 70 years in connivance with the so-called secular political parties.

The Tablighi Jamaat has changed the religious landscape of UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala and Maharashtra extensively by targetting vulnerable and marginalised sections of the non-Muslim population allegedly aided by the secular ruling elite of India by creating a votebank for secular parties and in return, converting millions of citizens by exploiting weakness of Article 25(1).

This Article guarantees to every person and not merely to the citizens of India, the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.

The Tablighi Jamaat used its weapon extensively for the last 70 years by inviting many radical preachers and import of petro dollars to facilitate the growth of the Muslim population from less than seven per cent in 1947 to 14.5 per cent in 2011 to likely 16.8 per cent in 2021.

Furthermore, there are indeed some links between the fringe elements in the Tablighis and the world of jihad.

First, there is evidence of indirect connections between the group and the wider radical/extremist Deobandi nexus composed of anti-Shiite sectarian groups, Kashmiri militants and the Taliban. As per Intelligence reports, Rohingyas residing in camps in different parts of the country have a direct link with the Tablighi Jamaat.

The Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020: Amid the Coronavirus lockdown, patients from Nizamuddin were tested and found to be positive for the virus, which resulted in the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi Government registering an FIR against Kandhlawi for arranging a Tablighi Jamaat programme despite restrictions on such gatherings after March 16 at the Nizamuddin Markaz. The Tablighi Jamaat congregation took place between March 13 and15 but over 2,000 people stayed back in the Markaz. They had sought help from authorities for vacating the premises on March 25. On March 31, an FIR was filed against Kandhlawi and others by the Delhi Police Crime Branch under Section 3 (the penalty for offence) of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Sections 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

Later the police slapped the 304 charge (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) while the Enforcement Directorate has filed a money laundering case and the IT department is scanning the bank accounts and suspicious transactions of the Tablighi Jaamat.

Why Tablighi Jamaat antagonised their defence: Spitting and pelting stones have almost become weapons of war for the Tablighis. It makes one question as to what can be the reason for this kind of deplorable behavior? According to some news reports, there have been protests against medical staff and resistance against going to hospitals is not related to Covid-19. Some of the issues cited by them are the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens, Triple Talaq, Babri Masjid and so on.

Unfortunately, some parts of the community are still focussing on politics and discrediting the Government at any cost while the entire nation is combatting the national health emergency. The country must take the threat of the Tablighis as an eye-opener for future planning that must include a ban and seizure of assets. We must identify ancillary units of the Tablighi Jamaat so that they can be stopped from operating under different names. We must punish the traitors of COVID-19, immediately amend Article 25(1) so that the money and preachers from outside the country can be restricted in their operations (it is a national security threat), set up an expert committee to re-examine provisions under Article 25-30 in the Indian Constitution and give additional power to the police to identity and book anti-nationals. It is important that Deoband, Barelvi, Salafi ideologies managing the network of mosques in India must be brought under Government supervision and control just as the temples of India are supervised under the Religious Endowment Act, 1873. An absolute freedom in the name of religion and at the cost of the nation must be immediately curbed.

1,22-4-20,Learn to be Earth stewards,"The ‘conquest of nature’ has got us to the precipice of doom as environmental degradation is the gravest threat to human life, second only to nuclear war

April 22 will be a historic day for the national Capital and perhaps, the world, for it shall be the cleanest Earth Day, since 1970. John McConnell, creator of Earth Day, may be smiling in heaven finally, due to the lack of noxious clouds and vapour trails. The increased oxygen might have made the angels slightly euphoric too. But cosmic events aside, can we conserve our planet? As we introspect, it is clear that the “conquest of nature” has got us to a precipice of planetary doom as environmental degradation is the gravest threat to human life, second only to nuclear war. It has very serious geopolitical consequences. Noam Chomsky recently on Democracy Now said that India and Pakistan, may go to nuclear war over shrinking water resources. Overall the roast is cooked and the Earth cannot take more violence. Pandemics and diseases are corrective reminders from nature, that it is time to steer away from our ecologically-destructive design and recreate a new economy and a new world.

How can we create a new world? Do we renounce the material world and choose a life devoid of technology? No. The Coronavirus provides us with an opportunity to reduce mindless consumption and reimagine a new paradigm, where the air is healthy and waterbodies are clean. To survive climate change and extinction, we need to adopt five principles: Reduce, Reuse, Regenerate, Swadeshi and Agro-ecology. We need a strong “green economy” (non-polluting, circular, renewable-based) to rebuild India and the world. For most part of the last century, technology has been used to destroy the Earth, we have to bridge the two now. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 needs to be built on a “green economy.” But where does this path begin? We begin this journey by bringing “Earth awareness” into our lives. The Earth is alive, she is not merely dirt, or water or mountains to be mined. We have to reconnect with our land, mountains and rivers. We have to respect it.

Once this consciousness fills us, the next step is to reduce our imprint on this planet. Each action or product we buy/use has an impact on this Earth. Yet all our parameters of success — big houses, many cars and so on are ecologically lopsided. Reducing water, fossil fuel and electricity consumption, is not only “smart” but economical too. We need to get off the consumption bandwagon and fossil fuel economy to discover alternatives. A very simple way to reduce consumption is to reuse things. One can start by reusing gallons of RO outlet water for plants or washing dishes, or converting old clothes into blankets. India is filled with innovative ideas of reusing and recycling things.

Discarding two negative patterns of consumption definitely adds up to one big environmental positive. Humans are not masters of the world, but in the words of the renowned American conservationist Aldo Leopold, mere “stewards of the land.” This land we have received from our ancestors, but only borrowed it from our descendants. And carbon reductionism, viewing actions/climate action in terms of their carbon footprint only, is not the only solution. We have to take the positive and holistic approach of regeneration versus an isolated negative outlook of carbon reductionism. Our efforts should not be to replace the fossil-fuel-economy with bio-fuels, or low carbon tech but reinvent the economy and our lives, with regenerative principles of creation.

Mahatma Gandhi outlined the solution for us. He called it Swadeshi economy. This is a system is pillared on self-sufficiency, dignity and local co-operation, while having minimal or a positive impact on the environment. This economy was a decentralised system of production, which shared surpluses and took from other what it could not produce. It is about time we accept a Swadeshi 2.0 in India, aided by ecological technologies. Before you buy something ask yourself can I replace this, with something as good made locally or sustainably?

Now for the final pillar of this pledge: Agro-ecology. Industrial food systems including cattle and poultry farms have destroyed human health and lives. Farmers suicides, cancer, foreclosures of small farmers, abuse and crime in rural communities all around the world are mere symptoms of a rabid production system. Our rivers are polluted with fertiliser and pesticides run-off and the consumer family is experiencing a plethora of diseases. But is agro-ecology viable? Scientist ML Jat has proved so. Agro-ecology does not only provide healthier food, but the practice reduces chemicals and fossil fuels in our food system. It has provided eco-system services by cleaning waters, sequestrating carbon, normalising the nitrogen cycles and flavourful food. So where can we begin? Start at your own home, grow a garden with veggies or plant herbs like coriander in a pot, but remember without chemicals. Reach out to a farmer who can grow food agro-ecologically for you. The culmination of these principles is the foundation of a green economy. As the world has descended into economic darkness, India needs to emerge from the ashes of a broken economic and industrial system to embrace it. On this Earth Day we need to embark on the path of science, resilience and the Earth.

2,22-4-20,The jury is out on the performance of netas,"While the Chief Ministers function as generals, the Prime Minister remains the supreme commander. The bottom line is that unless they show their leadership qualities, they will not be able to win the next elections

The time has come for State chieftains to show their leadership qualities in handling the Coronavirus pandemic after the lockdown ends and the country starts going about its business as usual.

The days ahead are crucial for the economy of the country as well as for our fight against the virus but there is a healthy competition among the Chief Ministers to excel in dealing with these issues.

It is heartening to note that most States have risen to the challenge and each Chief Minister is trying to tackle the pandemic in his/her unique way. Their response has been quick and positive and they are leading from the front.

For instance, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has set up a committee of experts, including some Nobel laureates, to advise her on the relief measures to be taken in her State.

Similarly, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has shown that his “Bhilwara model” could be emulated by other States to contain the pandemic. The “Kerala model”, too, has won praise from all around the country.

There are others like the Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, Telangana’s Chandrashekhar Rao, Punjab’s Captain Amarinder Singh and Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik who have done a good job of handling the Corona crisis. Interestingly most of the non–NDA Chief Ministers have done quite well.

The Centre, too, has realised the importance of some lockdown relaxations in sectors like agriculture and construction.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also left it to the States to decide about further relaxation of the shutdown guidelines as most of the Chief Ministers had told him during a video-conference with them that there was a need for a staggered lockdown exit as the economy was suffering.

The Chief Ministers will face huge challenges in their respective States after the lockdown ends in May. For them it is a double whammy. On one front they have to contain the pandemic and on the other they have to find resources to deal with the situation.

At the April 11 videoconference with the Prime Minister, most Chief Ministers of Opposition-ruled States expressed grave concern over lack of resources and depleting revenues, as well as the huge slide in the economy.

A calibrated exit from the lockdown is needed because the revenues of the Centre and States have collapsed due to the shutdown and its extension. In fact, most States claim that they will not be able to meet their salary bills beyond April. They have sought special assistance from the Centre to sustain the battle against the Coronavirus.

For instance, Mamata Banerjee has demanded a national package of around six per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to counter the pandemic’s impact and as relief for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector.

The Punjab Chief Minister has demanded a three-month crop loan waiver. Gehlot has sought a Central relief package for his State’s tourism and hospitality industry, MSMEs and all the weaker sections of society. Tamil Nadu has sought Rs 4,000 crore for augmenting health services. Others have demanded their Goods and Services Tax (GST) share immediately.

Pending Central assistance, some Chief Ministers have gone ahead and started to lift their States out of the mire with their own resources.

Kerala took the lead by announcing a Rs 20,000 crore package to kick-start the economy. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was one of the first to assure a guaranteed income to daily-wage labourers.

In Odisha, Naveen Patnaik has set up three fully-equipped Covid-19 hospitals and in Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel has ensured extra rations for all. The list of initiatives goes on.

On its part, the Centre has the big problem of finding resources to deal with the unprecedented crisis. The slide in the economy is a big worry as almost all the sectors, including civil aviation, manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure, travel and tourism have been impacted and it will need a huge stimulus to uplift the economy.

The Centre has to pump in at least four to five billion dollars urgently into the economy. It has so far provided only 0.8 per cent of the GDP as a stimulus and part of this is appropriated from existing State funds linked to construction labour and mineral development.

The Coronavirus has shown how unprepared India was to tackle a pandemic like this. Many States do not have adequate hospitals, enough healthcare personnel, medical equipment and testing kits.

By and large most States are depending on the Centre for the supply of testing kits and they can perform their duties well only when they get the equipment. Hence, improving the health sector is very important and must be done on a war footing if we are to win this Corona war.

Then there is the agriculture sector. The Centre has relaxed the lockdown for farm labourers. But the States that are depending on the migrant labour from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other States will have to ensure that they can retain the workers for the harvest season. Meanwhile, Punjab does not have gunny bags to pack the harvest in and Singh has written to Mamata to send them over speedily. This will benefit West Bengal’s jute farmers and weavers.

On the whole, while the Chief Ministers function as generals, the Prime Minister remains the supreme commander. The bottom line is that unless they show their leadership qualities, they will not be able to win the next elections. The jury is out on their performance rating.

3,22-4-20,WB returnees’ testing begins in Baleswar,"Central Range Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC) Anil Samal, who visited Baleswar after five new cases were reported in the district on Tuesday morning, said many people have infiltrated into the district from West Bengal by crossing borders or through ambulances in the last 14 days.

They are being identified and kept under compulsory quarantine at panchayat level and their samples would be sent for testing on priority basis from the day.

Samal said that around 2,700-2,800 people have come to Odisha from West Bengal in the last two months. A list with details of all these people has been kept ready with the help of Sarpanches and Panchayat Extension Officers (PEOs).

“Swab samples of 50 persons from Nilgiri area in the district have been sent for the test. Besides, security at inter-State borders has been beefed up,” he added.

Worth mentioning, the new cases are close relatives of 61 case of the State. The five cases are two 34- year-old women, a 38-year-old male, a 12-year-old boy and a youth aged 26 years. With this, the total number of cases in the district rose to eight.

Meanwhile, the district administration has declared the Nilgiri and the Niliabag areas as containment zones following the detections.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wb-returnees----testing-begins-in-baleswar.html

The deceased, a resident of Medinapur of West Bengal, had been tested as the 44th COVID-19 positive patient of Odisha.

“The patient had previously been operated upon at a Bhubaneswar-based private hospital for pituitary tumor. When he had come for a follow-up treatment to the same hospital recently, he was detected COVID-19 positive,” the I&PR Department said.

After undergoing treatment, the man tested negative for the virus twice. Even though he recovered from coronavirus, he could not be discharged due to his pre-existing medical complications.

5,22-4-20,Fresh case registered against ex-Badachana IIC,"A fresh case was registered against former Badachana police IIC Deepak Kumar Jena on Tuesday for knowingly disobeying law despite being a public servant.

The Badachana police registered a case against the suspended IIC under Sections-166, 166(A) and 171 of IPC for disobeying the direction of law despite being a public servant. Further investigations are underway in this connection, said Jajpur SP Charan Singh Meena.

Meanwhile, Priyabrata Rout was appointed as the new Badchana IIC.

On Monday, DGP Abhay placed Jena under suspension for violating the COVID-19 lockdown norms by barging into the Puri Jagannath Temple through the south gate even after being restricted by a Havildar.

On the basis of a complaint lodged by the Havildar, a case was registered at the Singhadwar PS and Jena along with his family were detained for interrogation.

Later, it came to light that Jena had used a stolen Scorpio SUV seized by the Badachana police earlier for his visit to Puri.

“The IIC took the vehicle to Puri after installing a red beacon on it,” alleged the owner of the vehicle Sushant Dalei. He had lodged a complaint with the Jajpur SP and Collector the day before alleging that he is yet to get back his vehicle even after one month of the theft.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fresh-case-registered-against-ex-badachana-iic.html
6,22-4-20,Sarangi urges CM to implement Ayushman Bharat,"Union Minister of MSME, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Pratap Sarangi on Monday urged the State Government to implement the Ayushman Bharat health scheme at the earliest, saying it would benefit a large number of migrant Odia labourers stuck in other States due to the nationwide lockdown.

In a letter to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, the BJP leader said he has been interacting with migrant labourers from Odisha stranded in different parts of the country to provide them with all possible assistance in terms of food, ration, medicines and even hospitalisation.

“I have noticed that many migrant labourers, having critical ailments, are facing a great deal of financial difficulties in receiving requisite treatment outside the state as the Government of Odisha has not implemented the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana,” Sarangi said.

He said the Ayushman Bharat scheme has been the most significant state intervention under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. As such, healthcare professionals have predicted that due to the prevailing situation and continued trauma, the post-COVID-19 period may witness a discernible fall in the health profile of people, aggravating the already underlining conditions of morbidity in a sizeable section of the population.

“Considering the current COVID-19 situation and its deleterious aftermath, I request you to kindly consider implementing the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana in the State at the earliest,” he said in the letter to Patnaik.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sarangi-urges-cm-to-implement-ayushman-bharat.html
7,22-4-20,"Sun will shine, again","With more than 20,000 deaths, Spain, which used to be a tourism hotspot, has turned into a contagion hotbed. But hopes are high that it will soon be able to return to normalcy

In Europe, Spain, with a population of 46 million, is closely following the footsteps of Italy in terms of COVID-19 fatalities. It has suffered more deaths per million inhabitants than any other nation with the death toll crossing 20,000 on April 17. There were more than 9,000 new cases on March 31 and 950 deaths on April 2, the biggest daily death figure. These horrific statistics were provided by the Spanish Government’s top scientific advisor on the pandemic, Fernando Simon. Immunologist Alexander Edgar of the University of Reading said, “A lot of the spread had happened before people realised. Most of them assumed that the problem was elsewhere — Wuhan, which was shut off since January.”

This is analogous with Myanmar’s Health Minister saying in Yangon when it claimed zero COVID-19 that “Hubei was 1,200 miles away from the country though it shares a 1,900-mile border with China.” The three main reasons for the high fatality rate in Spain are the country’s slow response; demography and social behaviour; and low testing capacity. This, despite the country having an excellent healthcare system and not to forget the high-life expectancy in Europe due to its Mediterranean diet. But Spain’s ageing population has been shrinking since 2010 due to recession and migration. More people died in 2018 than were being born here and the pandemic started with the elderly contracting it first, like in Italy where social and cultural behaviour matches that of Spain’s.

On a holiday in Spain months before the outbreak of the Wuhan virus, one had heard of the Spanish flu and influenza pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919 during and after World War I, where one in three human beings were infected and around 17 million to 100 million perished across the world. Calling the flu Spanish is a misnomer: It started in Kansas at Fort Riley when the US was preparing to join the war. Others say it started in the congested trenches of Europe, which at that time were filled with young men and later American soldiers. The Spanish flu was really bad as it came in three waves and reached across the world, including Africa and Australia. Medicine, too, was not extensively developed.

The holiday was memorable. Ethiopian Airlines describes Madrid as the city of great monuments. I would add museums and Plaza Mayor to that list. It has just one cathedral and that, too, constructed in the mid-20th century as the Archbishop of Toledo, the old capital of Spain, would not allow it. Madrid sits astride Rio Manzanares with gentle slopes on both sides of the river connecting the two parts of the capital with a blend of ancient and ultra-modern bridges, marvels of architecture reflecting the extraordinary vision of the Spanish rulers building six-lane bridges in 16th century.

On both sides of the river are walkways, partly covering the Madrid marathon cycling tracks. Spaniards ride bicycles whenever and wherever they can. September is a great time to arrive in Madrid’s new and a design wonder airport where immigration officials took just four seconds to stamp my congested passport. But immigration rules will change now.

Madrid has one palace, one cathedral, more than 50 museums, 46 art galleries and 23 concert venues. All of these were renovated for the 400th anniversary of the Plaza Mayor, which records Madrid’s heartbeat with its ancient square and adjoining food and wine markets.

I am not a connoisseur of wine but Spanish rioja is excellent at 3 to 4 euro per bottle. In Madrid, in the grocery shops, I could find only Spanish wine. A bottle a day is bound to keep spirits high, ideally with fresh strawberries, ham and cherries. Bar Nakama, a hole in the wall, is run by the solitary English-speaking barman Robert. Nakama, he explained, meant “friend” in Japanese, though we never saw a Japanese in here. In his bar one could buy a glass of reasonable wine for 2 euro, which is accompanied by plentiful snacks and gratis. Excellent espresso coffee and Spanish beer were available, too.

All roadside cafes charge 1 to 2 euro extra for service except the chain 100Mantidelos, where self service rules, which is pronto. Madrid is not expensive like London and Paris or even Brussels and Amsterdam. Though museums charge an average of 7 to 10 euros, many are free between 7 and 9 on some days and gratis all times for EU and Latin American nationals.

September is also the month for art, music and theatre festivals organised by DCode, supplemented by exhibitions and concerts by Arte Madrid and Appertura. World class bands, including Team Gallagher and Oasis, Broadway musicals, English theatre artistes, flamenco dancers, singers and guitarists, all perform here. Bull fighting happens only between April and June but Spain stands divided on whether the sport should stay or be banned altogether. Madrid boasts of a three Michelin-star restaurant Cairella Bistro that has a Valencian chef. The most famous landmark is that of a male Spaniard, leaning on a balustrade near Calle Allemedine and Calle Mayor June. Most tourists mistake the bronze life-size statue for real and brush past it whispering inanities and rubbing its bottom for good luck. They call him the good bum. Toledo is a world model tourist attraction. On a Sunday, it was bursting with human kind with tour guide-led columns crawling like ants. It takes an hour to reach the old capital of Spain, which is surrounded on three sides by River Tagus. From the moment one alights the bus, one is elevated to Plaza de Zocodover on a series of escalators rising 500 feet to reach the panoramic heights of the old city famed for a blend of three cultures.

Over a period of time, Christians, Moors and Jews lived together peacefully (not quite like today in West Bank in Jerusalem). A 10th century mosque, preserved for two centuries before it was turned into a chapel, is in good shape. Toledo’s cathedral, built in the 13th century contains El Grecho masterpieces of de-robing Christ. The bell in the tower weighing 30,000 kilos apparently rang only once as it caused a minor earthquake in which a 90-metre high clock had one of its needles disappear. A 14th century synagogue is well preserved in the Jewish quarter, next to El Grecho’s recreated house. Toledo is an experience of a lifetime. Equip yourself with a tourist map, the Es Madrid magazine and mucho gracias for your travel whenever you can plan one in the future.

Fast forward, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday that current measures of lockdown will extend beyond April 25 and schools will be closed till September. Like elsewhere in Europe, he has announced a sector by sector opening of the economy. Sunday saw the smallest one-day death toll, 410, since March 22, which means the curve is bending.

8,22-4-20,"No lynchings, please","As we battle the darkest hour of our times, the virus should be the only priority, not politicisation of the kind at Palghar

They say paranoia is more dangerous than anything else. And the Coronavirus, with uncertainty about its cure and its predatory march on life, has sent us into spasms of madness. As we do not have any explanation or understanding of the virus, as insecurity and helplessness weaken us, we shift our fury to anything that remotely fits into a box called reason. Or the way we would like to define it. What else can explain the mob lynching three men in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, two of them mendicants apparently, thinking they were thieves who were out to steal goods and possibly even kidnap children? The crowd, comprising mostly tribals, had formed community vigilante groups as a self-protective measure in the times of the virus. They mobilised themselves after they received information that organ-harvesting gangs and child lifters were operating in the area. The police, who are stretched to the seams in enforcing the lockdown, were clearly overwhelmed by this human malady of distrust and hatred. And considering that sadhus were involved, soon political parties seized a new talking point, giving it a communal colour. Union Home Minister Amit Shah even called up Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to ensure that the culprits be brought to justice, considering that the incident could have a negative impact on the BJP’s core constituency. The communal card has also been played on social media by extreme Islamophobists after the indiscretions of Tablighi Jamaat — indeed a most irresponsible lot — to amp up demonisation of an otherness they can rationalise vis-à-vis the spread of the virus. We could do without xenophobia of any kind, be it on social media or in reality, during a pandemic that doesn’t spare anybody. There has been a lot of hue and cry over famous personalities being blocked out by Twitter for incendiary remarks from both sides of the divide, leading to the accusation that the social media clampdown was part of a US conspiracy, which didn’t like to see things from an Indian perspective. We certainly cannot allow this kind of extremism of thoughts, political opportunism or a dilution of priorities during the nation’s darkest hour. Or endorse a behavioural code separating COVID-19 patients into wards based on their religion. There is enough stigma going around the virus-affected and even frontline health warriors themselves. Surely we could do without adding more variants to it. India’s civilisational moorings are compassionate and accommodative and are being tested at this moment of crisis. We would be winners if we make it through, losers if we demonise and kill our own.

Of course, at the administrative level, the Palghar incident represents a terrible failure of the law and order machinery. Lockdown or not, the State cannot be allowed to descend into chaos. The job of the police is to prevent such a mess. The State Government must, therefore, take the strictest action against the police, which cannot be seen as caving into the mob instead of reining it in. We must also remember that too many examples and media reports of police negligence and inaction will erode faith in the law and order machinery. And at a time when food riots or migrants’ discontent are pushing the barricades of civic life, a system has to appear robust. Else, even the lockdown would not hold. As fear, panic and anxiety loom large, the forces must be calm, alert and composed and should nip every rumour in the bud. It is not like the police did not sense a gathering of people was up to something or the basis of their fears, real or imagined. It shouldn’t have led the situation to slide to this extent. In fact, the police in all States should maintain a reassuring community outreach to streamline COVID-19 management instead of frittering away resources for trivial issues. Any administrative authority now needs to appear sterner and ensure the enforcement of the rule of law. None of us can afford lynchings and riots at a time of a national health emergency. The nation’s job is to save lives, not watch them waste away silently.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-lynchings--please-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-lynchings--please.html
9,22-4-20,Sailing into the sunset,"The last cruise ships sailing the open seas have docked and disgorged their passengers. What next for this industry?

Anews story published by the BBC spoke about the cruise ship MSC Magnifica as the last one on planet earth. Well, the story itself said that this was not technically true as there are two other ships, the Pacific Princess and the Costa Deliziosa that are about to disembark their passengers and crew. By the time this goes to print, it is likely that all three ships would have docked and emptied out. But the question is whether this will be the last ship sailing with passengers. As is known, for many tourists, cruises are the ideal vacation. Be that as it may, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has also proved that as much convenience and luxury it offers, cruises also provide a golden opportunity to get sick. The cruise ship industry, like every other part of the travel and tourism sector, is under immense stress at this point of time. But given that cruise ships such as the notorious Diamond Princess that docked at Yokohama, Japan, became a focal point of the viral outbreak, is there going to be a return of the floating cities? Some of the largest ships across the world have a combined passenger and crew complement of close to 10,000 souls. Yet, by their very size and the fact that they are self-contained spaces, the ships became a harbour for disease. This followed a few years when huge outbreaks of diarrhoea overtook ships, particularly in the US. This has led to speculation that this particular part of the travel and tourism sector might take a lot longer time to revive than others. The bad public relations that the industry has suffered might mean that the golden age of the cruise ships, which constantly got larger and larger and brushed off disasters like the Costa Concordia with ease, is over. Hopefully when the COVID-19 pandemic is over, the cruise industry will do its best to lure the passengers with cheaper prices.

Back home, there will be a huge impact on employment. Here, it must be kept in mind that the cruise industry’s economic model is one that hires people from poor countries, who are willing to endure exploitation and mistreatment. Thousands of Indians had been working onboard such ships, which included the cleaning staff, those in the kitchens and even entertainers. Of course, there were the merchant navy officers running the ships, too. Many of them, like millions of other Indians, will not have a job to return to anytime soon. With the entire travel industry expected to be in the doldrums for a couple of years, there maybe be very few options as well. India would do well to encourage smaller cruise lines to operate in and around its shores once this crisis is over. If for nothing else but to get its people working again. It must use the post-COVID-19 situation as an opportunity to grab a larger slice of the tourist trade whenever it does recover.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sailing-into-the-sunset-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/sailing-into-the-sunset.html

12,22-4-20,Stranded migrant workers in Nuapada get food,"People in the society irrespective of class, caste and creed are coming forward to put their efforts in the fight against coronavirus. It is even evident in a backward district like Nuapada.

When some are contributing in terms of money to the PM Care Fund and Chief Minister Relief Fund, others are providing food to migrant workers stranded in different places of the district due to lockdown.

Most encouraging is that the Self Help Groups (SHGs) of women, which are engaged in small businesses to earn their livelihoods, have come forward in large numbers to contribute towards the fight against corona.

SHGs from different parts of the district have contributed Rs 1.92 lakh to the CM’s Relief Fund as a support to fight COVID-19. One to two SHGs in each panchayat have taken responsibility to provide hot cooked meals to indigent and destitute people, who at present are above 11,000. The amount spent by the SHGs to meet the food expenses is being reimbursed on regular basis by the district authority from State Disaster Management Fund. One of the SHGs has made masks and distributed that to the people of their locality.

A good number of people and institutions like the block level Sarpanch Associations, Raja AT High School 1981 batch, Agrawal Samaj, Khariar Road, Chandrakar Samaj, Nuapada; private technical institutions, Khariar Vanik Sangha, artists forums have also contributed to the CMRF and PM Care funds, which amounted to Rs 43 lakh in total till April 19.

Artists of Nuapada Zilla Chitra Silpi Sangha are making wall writings all over the district to enhance awareness amongst people to fight corona. Several other forums like Khadial Mukta Bichar Manch, a forum of intellectuals and Raja AT High School 92 batch warriors are engaged in distributing milk, bread, chuda and suji upma as breakfast to above 550 migrants of UP, MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, etc., who are stranded in Khariar town after lockdown.

One youth club is providing food to street dogs. Two persons of Nuapada town have contributed about Rs 11,000 to the CMRF and PM Care fund by sewing and selling masks to town people.

13,22-4-20,Health is not merely absence of disease,"Health is an important treasure of life. The joy, prosperity and activities of a human being depend on his or her health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely absence of disease and infirmity. It is a stage of balance in physical activities. Adopting the natural laws, health can be regained.

Yogic practice is being increasingly accepted as an effective tool to attain a holistic health, which includes the body, mind and spirit. The air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat must be pure and sufficient. Regular practice of yogic techniques with proper diet and lifestyle can bring back the physio-psychological resilience and vigour. There is a significant improvement in body flexibility, physical performance and also in mental and emotional aspects of our being. The psychological profile related with reduced anxiety level, improvement in concentration, memory, learning efficiency and psychomotor performance emphasises the role of yoga in our day-to-day life.

Yoga is not only curative but a preventative science of health and wellbeing. Removing the mental depressions, phobias, neuroses and all other negative aspects of mind, it brings about great happiness in life and removes many diseases. The practice of Yogasana activates the functions of different organs, muscles and nerves into perfect coordination so that they work for the overall good of the body. Researchers have found that by doing regular pranayama, the rhythm of breath slows down. Then, an improvement of the total health takes place with mental peace and calmness. Yoga Nidra is a method of psychic sleep, which dramatically reduces the physical and psychological stresses in a few minutes. It is a Pratyahara technique, in which there is withdrawal of sense perception from their respective sense objects and the mind is allowed to relax. Then, the mind is trained to become silent and sensitised of the inner psychic field of an everlasting peace. Hence, the science of yoga plays an important role to attain a complete health.

Today, during the corona pandemic, which has brought the whole world to a standstill, this age-old Indian science of yoga will help us improve our immunity power and mental wellbeing to fight against the upcoming situation.

17,22-4-20,"Off roads, 5K S'garh auto drivers in dire straits","The families of about 5,000 auto-rickshaw drivers in Sundargarh district are struggling for survival as they lost their income after the lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus scare.

According to sources, there are about 5,000 auto drivers in Sundargarh district, including 2,000 in Rourkela and rest 3,000 in other parts of the district. After the lockdown, the drivers had to stop driving their autos as all the people were asked to stay home. The poor auto drivers are sitting idle at their homes. Their income has become nil in the wake of the lockdown.

A majority of them had purchased auto after taking loan from bank and some drive auto by taking on rental basis. Before lockdown, most of the auto drivers were taking school children by their autos during school hour and in rest time, they were taking passengers from one place to another place and were earning money for their livelihood. Since the school will remain closed till June 17, the auto drivers have been going through financial hardship.

At this time, they have to clear EMIs for their auto, school fees for their children and also house rent. Since the schools were closed after lockdown and children did not go to school, the parents of children reportedly have refused to pay monthly auto fare to the auto drivers.

“I used to earn about Rs 13,000 per month earlier but after lockdown my income is nil,” said Chinu, an auto driver of Chhend area. “It is now very difficult for me to feed my family. Whatever little money I had in my hand, that has been exhausted during this lockdown period. I do not know, how I and my family will survive. I do not have money to give food to my family,” Chinu added.

28,22-4-20,"COVID-19 pandemic: World now greener, quieter","In 1969 at a Unesco conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honour the earth. It was first celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere.

This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a United States Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970.

He hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the National Coordinator. Nelson and Hayes renamed the event “Earth Day. It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the non profit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organiser Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now ""the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year.”

Earth Day 2020 is the 50th anniversary of the day. The theme for the Earth Day 2020 is climate action. The world is observed a greener and quieter in these days due to COVID-19 pandemic. With vehicles off the streets, seismologists investigating earthquakes in London, Brussels and Los Angeles report that the ambient noise levels are so low that they are now better able to detect even smaller seismic events in these cities.

On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.

The COVID -19 has made it possible which these agreements even couldn’t. This is potentially good news for the climate because oil is the biggest source of the carbon emissions that are heating the planet and disrupting weather systems. Some analysts believe it could mark the start of a prolonged downward trend in emissions and the beginning of the end for oil. Others strike a more cautious note about the fuel that has dominated our lives and polluted our atmosphere for the past century. Ultimately, the most important environmental impact is likely to be on public perceptions. The pandemic has demonstrated the deadly consequences of ignoring expert warnings, of political delay, and of sacrificing human health and natural landscapes for the economy.

But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases. Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions, which is one reason the World Bank estimates that by 2030, 3.6 billion people will be reckoning with it — 100 million as a direct result of climate change.

The most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have one less child (""an average for developed countries of 58.6?tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year""), followed by living car-free (2.4 tonnes CO2-equivalent per year), forgoing air travel (1.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent per trans-Atlantic trip) and adopting a plant-based diet (0.8 tonnes CO2-equivalent per year). The choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long-distance or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long-distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. Options to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Refuse.' The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting, like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions, to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their ""handprint”.

Apart from this, the animals get irritated when the temperature is high. It is necessary to keep them cool and provide them with a near-natural habitat.

So arrangements were undertaken to ensure there is adequate drinking water and the the animals do not dehydrate and do not skip the forest to the human habitations. But the forest personnel stopped the work midway due to lockdown and unavailability of labourers.

“We are waiting to get funds to complete the renovation work of existing water bodies and also to set up new ponds as the existing infrastructure is not sufficient to mitigate the water woes for the wild animals at Bhitarkanika,"" said DFO Dash.

The forest department also intensified patrolling to restrict the spotted deer and wild boar straying from their natural habitat. To contain the spread of Covid-19 among the wild animals, the forest personnel have been asked to maintain physical distance.

To feed the captive salt water crocodiles, including a couple of albinos, in the pen, a forest staff has been assigned.

47,22-4-20,"With vehicles off the road, mishap deaths come down","



|

With vehicles being off the roads due to the lockdown, the number of deaths in Lucknow has plummeted by almost 30 per cent and experts attribute it to a drastic reduction in road accidents and criminal activities.

What is more, even the number of emergency patients in government hospitals has reduced to half.

Top officials at King George’s Medical University Trauma Centre, which caters to emergency health services to majority of districts of eastern UP, confirmed a reduction in critical patients during the ongoing lockdown that completed 26 days on Tuesday.

Trauma Centre’s Chief Medical Superintendent Dr Santosh Kumar admitted that lesser number of critical accident patients were coming to the hospital.

“We used to get 180 to 200 cases of critical patients of road accidents daily and such cases have now reduced to a trickle. In fact, in the last couple of weeks, we did not have any road accident case which has lead to substantial reduction in number of deaths,” he said.

When asked to quantify, Dr Kumar said that deaths due to accidents had come down by 40-50 per cent in the last one month.

According to the data available with the Trauma Centre, earlier, around 8-10 persons used to die daily mostly due to accident and critical diseases, and this number has come down to 3-4 cases, that too due to critical illness.

at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital of Lucknow, the number of critical patients earlier admitted on a daily basis was 20-30, which has come down to 4-6 only.

Dr SK Pandey from RML Institute of Medical Sciences said that the reduction in trauma fatalities was primarily because vehicles were off the roads due to the nation-wide lockdown.

“Deaths are now witnessed only due to critical ailments and fatality due to road accident has been negligible,” he said.

At Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, the number of cases of critical patients has come down from 60-80 per day to 10-15 daily.

The claims of doctors was corroborated by Lucknow Nagar Nigam data which also claimed drastic drop in number of bodies cremated between March and April this year as compared to the corresponding period last year .

Between March 7 and April 7, 2019, the total number of bodies cremated in Lucknow was 1,132. Of this, 204 were cremated in crematorium, 550 at Bhainsa Kund and 188 at Alambagh cremation ground.

In contrast, the number of bodies cremated between March 7 and April 7, 2020 was just 836. Of this 205 were cremated in crematorium, 340 at Bhainsa Kund and 181 at Alambagh cremation ground.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/with-vehicles-off-the-road--mishap-deaths-come-down.html

Even as cases of heinous crime have plummeted due to the ongoing lockdown, domestic crimes have suddenly witnessed a spike. In this course, three sensational murders were reported from Sitapur, Ghazipur and Kanpur Dehat on Tuesday.

In Sitapur, a woman and her two children were found murdered in Bhagwanpurgrant hamlet and the assailant tried to conceal the crime by trying to burn their bodies.

As per reports, Rajni and her two children, Parvesh and Vikas, were found dead with their bodies badly charred outside their room in an open courtyard. Rajni’s husband Sunderlal was away in the field and was later informed about the incident by neighbours who also intimated the police about the deaths.

During investigation, the cops noticed that Rajni’s tongue was protruding and she had injury marks pointing towards possible strangulation. Similarly the right hand of her younger son was severed and found lying away from his body.

It also surfaced that it was Sunderlal’s second marriage. While Sunderlal’s first wife died, Rajni left her husband and married him.

Later, the police picked up Sunderlal and quizzed him during which he said that Rajni was forcing him to withdraw money from her Jan Dhan account on Tuesday. He refused and instead asked her to come with him to work in the field.

Meanwhile, Rajni’s father said that Sunderlal was having a dispute with his sister-in-law and it might have led to the killing of his daughter and her two sons.

A case was registered and a probe was on.

In Ghazipur, Gudiya Devi (23) of Rajela hamlet of Mohamedabad was strangled to death on Tuesday morning. The killer dumped the body under cattle fodder to conceal the crime and escaped.

Gudiya was married to Surjeet of Newada hamlet of Bareilly. A few days after the marriage, Gudiya left her husband and went to live with Surjeet’s younger brother Ajay. About two months back, Gudiya and Ajay came to live at her father’s house in Ghazipur.

On Tuesday morning, Jiyut, his wife and two daughters left home to work in the fields in Siwan. Besides Gudiya, Ajay and Jiyut’s two minor daughters remained home.

Soon Ajay gave them money to go out and buy sweets. When Jiyut returned from the field in the afternoon, he found Gudiya and Ajay missing. On searching his house, he recovered Gudiya’s body from under a fodder dump.

A case was registered and a hunt for Ajay was launched.

55,22-4-20,"CM writes to Shah, seeks interim compensation","Pointing to the alarming resource gap between the state’s anticipated receipt and committed expenditure, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanding interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3000 crore for the month of April on account of the Covid-19 national disaster, along with immediate release of Rs 4,400 crore of pending GST arrears.

Capt Amarinder, in a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, asked for expediting the release of the state’s GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore for the last four months, to help the State overcome its resource constraint.

Citing the lockdown that had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Capt Amarinder said that the Central Government should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to Covid-19.

“While Rs 3000 crore for April was an estimate, detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course.

However, the Centre should provide interim assistance so that fight against Covid-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that Punjab was facing a huge stress on State exchequer on account of required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, “with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the State during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry”.

The state government had made a provision of revenue receipts of Rs 3,360 crore for April 2020 in the State Budget 2020-21, including GST – Rs 1,322 crore; VAT on Petroleum products – Rs 465 crore; State Excise Revenue – Rs 521 crore, Motor Vehicle Tax – Rs 198 crore; Electricity Duty – Rs 243 crore, Stamp duty – Rs 219 crore, and Non-tax revenue – Rs 392 crore.

“However, these receipts are expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the State remain closed on account of lockdown.

The receipts on account of SGST, IGST, VAT, Excise, Stamp Duty and Motor Vehicle Taxes are almost negligible and reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60 percent of expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020,” he noted.

He added, “In addition, the GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months – from December 2019 to March 2020 – was also pending for disbursement by the Union Government.”

On the other hand, he pointed out that state’s committed expenditure, that is debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for Covid-19, healthcare and infrastructure etc, is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020, resulting in huge resource gap between the anticipated receipts and committed expenditure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-writes-to-shah--seeks-interim-compensation.html

DBSS head Rakesh Hembrom said the festival was being celebrated for over a century now and they have decided to organise the rituals on May 4.

“Amidst ongoing lockdown and the risk associated with the virus we want to make Bishu Shikar a symbolic event. Barring the customary puja on the foothills on May 2, the celebration will be without hunting animals,”he added.

According to him, they would assemble near Fadlugora along NH 33 for puja and then shoot arrows as a symbol for Sendra. “We have asked the participants from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha to not come for the festival,”he said.

Hembrom said there is no need for hunting. Instead, the need of the hour is to wipe out the deadly coronavirus.

Assistant conservator of forest R.P. Singh said though DBSS chief priest Hembrom has assured him they would keep the tradition symbolic but they will continue to keep an eye on the movement of tribals.

The samiti would also appeal to all the tribal organisations in the next couple of days to not kill animals during Sendra but observe token rituals.

88,22-4-20,Palamu: Police avert political tiff at paddy procurement centre,"Palamu police did ‘political containment’, other than the coronavirus containment, as Palamu district continues to be negative for this dreaded virus here so far.

Sources said police contained a minor issue snowballing into a major political issue at FCI’s paddy procurement centre (PPC) where one Sachidanand Chourasia alias Munna had a tiff with FCI’s programme officer A K Diwaker forcing FCI’s godown manager Solan Dangal of this PPC to rush to Chainpur police station for lodging an FIR against this Munna.

Sources said farmers have started bringing in paddy to this centre along with 12 others also in Palamu and this incident could have cast a shadow on procurement of paddy but for timely and swift action by Chainpur police station officer in charge Sunit Kumar the issue collapsed on its own.

A prompt police intervention made FCI officials Diwaker and Dangal to again write to Chainpur police station that Munna has admitted his folly and has promised not to act rudely again and thus FCI officials have reached a reconciliation with Munna thus thereby meaning their first petition for FIR against Munna goes automatically redundant.

Chainpur police OC Sunit Kumar said, “Strict police intervention saved the situation at this PPC. The day this incident occurred this PPC had done more than Rs 8 lakh procurement of paddy here which meant Munna and FCI tiff was too small.”

Sources said former minister and senior Congress leader K N Tripathy when learnt that one Chourasia had tiff with FCI officials soon sprang up to highlight this issue and rang up additional chief secretary in food and civil supplies Arun Kumar Singh as to how Chourasias are throwing spanner in paddy procurement here at Chainpur PCC.

There was no respite then as additional chief secretary rang up DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahari to look into this PPC matter, who then rang up SP Ajay Linda to do the same.

Tripathy said, “Chourasias are doing excesses. They are buying paddy from farmers at cheaper rates. They are trying to pass it off at PCC where a quintal of paddy is worth around 2,000 rupees. They are minting money by duping farmers.”

Tripathy further said, “I will not allow these Chourasias to have their way. Police must take action against them.”

Sources said there is a wedge between Tripathy and Chourasias here since November 30 polling when Tripathy was attacked by a section of these people and his multi lakh car damaged who then had to brandish his licensed revolver in his self defense. He lost to Alok Chourasia then in 2019 VS election.

The former minister Tripathy had no word that FCI officials and this lone Munna Chourasia had already patched up their ‘matter’ between them leaving police no simple thread to initiate legal action.

SP Ajay Linda said, “Police’s top priority is that paddy procurement goes on smoothly at all the13 centres in this district and FCI officials and farmers face no problem.”

SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta said “ Under order of SP Linda we are keeping close watch over PCCs and have even deployed cops to ensure smooth paddy procurement here.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu--police-avert-political-tiff-at-paddy-procurement-centre.html

92,22-4-20,Corona ‘victim’ buried at Doranda cemetery,"Unlike last week when performing last rites of a COVID -19 victim had become a real issue and challenge for district administration, the corpse of a patient, who was tested positive earlier and died on Tuesday was buried at Doranda cemetery without any hiccups. As precautionary measures police personnel along with senior administrative officials were present at Doranda cemetery.

The 54-year old woman who was infected with Coronavirus died on Tuesday morning at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). The woman was admitted at RIMS on April 6 and was suffering from kidney ailments. The woman had undergone dialysis twice, but on Tuesday her health deteriorated. The widow’s husband died last week, but his burial witnessed protests at Ratu Road Kabristhan and Joda Talab graveyard.

Ranchi SDM Lokesh Mishra said, “The woman’s final rites and burial took place at the Doranda cemetery.” The SDM said that all the protocols were followed in performing the final rites of the woman.

Sources said that only handful of persons were allowed to participate at the final rites of the woman. Also, while performing the last rites special precautions were taken so that there was no direct contact of corpse with any living persons.

The corpse of a corona positive patient was denied burial in the local Ratu Road cemetery and Joda Talab area.

Throwing the social distance advisory in wind, at least 200 people had gathered and protested outside Kabristhan against the Ranchi district administration's decision to bury the body in the graveyard. They also demanded that the corpse be buried somewhere else. The protesters had claimed that corona infection can spread if the body was buried at the cemetery. Later the body was buried at a cemetery at Hindpiri area.

Learning from last experience the district administration decided to perform the last rites of woman at Doranda cemetery based on consent provided by religious leaders.

The Ranchi district administration had talks with Anjuman Islamia regarding burial of dead bodies of corona patient. The district administration had given three to four places (graveyards) options were the corona patient burial had to take place.

Meanwhile, the ministry of health and family welfare in India has issued guidelines for its citizens about how to dispose of the body of a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19.

As the main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets there is increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members. As per guidelines the crematorium or burial ground staff should be sensitised that Covid-19 does not pose additional risk.

The guidelines also allow religious rituals such as reading from holy books or scriptures, sprinkling holy water and other last rites that do not require touching of the body.

However, bathing, kissing and hugging of the dead body is prohibited.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona----victim----buried-at-doranda-cemetery.html

Talking to The Pioneer, Sharma said that it is clear that the world would have to learn to live with the dreaded virus so it is prudent that everyone makes necessary changes so that the disease is kept at bay. “The educational institutes which are closed at the moment would open once the government makes a decision. We should make necessary changes in our class rooms, lecture theatres, libraries, laboratories, assembly halls and other places so that the necessary social distancing is followed. We would have to change the sitting plan of the classrooms to make them accommodate less number of students. Every institution would have to make changes. We have already started work in this direction,’’ he said.

The VC added that the Motherhood University has started online classes in all disciplines from April 9 so that the studies of the students are not drastically hampered. “Though the online classes cannot replace normal classrooms but under the prevailing circumstances where everything is closed, they are best option. We have prepared an elaborate schedule for these classes which start at 10 am and continue till 6 pm,’’ he said.

Sharma opined that one should not get swayed and make opinions based on what is streaming on the social media platforms. He said that many a times the information on such platforms are false and mischievous. Sharma said that the advisory issued by the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, administrations, doctors should be followed. He said that the people should follow simple methods mentioned in Ayurveda and Yoga to strengthen their immune system and body. On being asked about the problems faced by the university administration due to the long lockdown enforced to flatten the infection cycle of the virus, Sharma admitted that arranging finance is a problem as fees from the students is not being collected. He however praised the management of the institution for making necessary arrangements for paying salary of the staff and other expenditure during these hard times. “We have decided that no one would be shown the exit door and no salary would be deducted during this period of crisis,’’ he said.

On the impact of the crisis on placements this year, the VC accepted that he foresees a fall of 20 per cent in placement as the industry would cut recruitment.

He said that the University would donate a sum of Rs 2 lakh to the PM CARES fund as token of its responsibility towards the nation. “One of our board of governors, Rajesh Diwan was among the first to open the strings of his purse. He had donated Rs 30 lakh to PM CARES fund and Rs 20 lakh to CM (Delhi) relief fund.

100,22-4-20,Jharkhand girl’s venture provides experts’ opinion for cancer patients,"Amidst the global pandemic, cancer patients who have low immunity levels are very vulnerable to infection and subsequent complications. With the country in lockdown and hospitals only treating emergency cases, Navya -- a clinical informatics company -- aims to bridge the gap between cancer patients, care givers and world class oncologists by providing them treatment plans online.

Founded by Jamshedpur girl Gitika Srivastava (40) in 2014, Navya is a clinical informatics company based in Bangalore. Founded in collaboration with Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) and National Cancer Grid (NCG) it provides online expert opinion to cancer patients.

“During the Coronavirus outbreak, our daily volumes have doubled or tripled as in cancer timing of treatment is very important. Navya offers a 24- hour turnaround to patients as their anxiety levels decreases by about 97 percent when they know the treatment plan within one day,” said Srivastava.

Aimed with a goal to reach each and every cancer patient and empowering them with information and clarity when they are faced with the challenge of making complex medical decisions, it also ensures that patients get an expert opinion irrespective of their location and are able to continue with the line of treatment at a hospital of their choice.

“When a close family member was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, opinions from several oncologists over emails, phone calls, in person meetings were rounded up. We spend several hours on research and asked numerous questions to understand the language the ‘medical speak’. It was an ordeal to get the best of everything- information, treatment option and recommendation by the best doctor. This is where Navya was born,” added the Founder.

In a short time span over 50,000 patients from 74 countries have reached out to Navya and received a range of benefits from knowing the next step in cancer management to free information on diagnostics, side effects and care protocol to receiving a multidisciplinary treatment plan from the world’s best experts. Patients range from rural to urban areas as well as socioeconomically underprivileged to business executives.

“In the coming years, we aim to partner with every major hospital, insurance companies and the government of India so that patients can be ensured of receiving the latest recommendations. We also wish to partner with local treating centres and hospitals across the country as part of NCG so that oncologists can collaborate with their specialist colleagues and ensure that the treatment delivered is standarised,” added Srivastava.

Born in Jamshedpur, Srivastava completed her schooling from Loyala High School and is currently based in Boston, USA and shuffles between the USA, Geneva and India. She is a graduate in computer science and engineering from Harvard and an MBA from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan.

Her parents have now retired and settled in Gurgaon. While her father Pradeep Srivastava was a national level basketball player, her mother Dr Nalini Srivastava was a professor at Graduate School College for Women in Jamshedpur.

117,22-4-20,Faithfuls deny Covid victim peace even after death,"The saying is that the Son of the God took birth in this world to liberate us from all our sins. But we the thankless people were so cruel to Him. He died on the Cross for us. Chennai and Tamil Nadu stood silent witness to the death of yet another Son of the Lord whose dead body was humiliated because of ego clashes and the turf war between various sects.

Dr Simone Hercules, a 55-year-old neurosurgeon and director of Chennai’s New Hope Hospital breathed his last late Sunday in a corporate hospital in the city battling coronavirus for almost two weeks. He was infected by the virus while attending to patients in his own hospital.

When it was time for the last journey, Dr Hercules’ friends and relations were informed by Chennai City Corporation officials deputed to facilitate the burial that the body could not be taken to Kilpauk cemetery due to stiff resistance by the faithful. They told his associates that more than 300 persons have gathered in front of the cemetery and were against burying Dr Hercules’ body there. “Daughter of Dr Hercules is also undergoing treatment for coronavirus and it was me who came forward to carry the body to another burial ground,” said Dr K Pradeep Kumar, the late doctor’s friend for a decade.

Dr Pradeep Kumar took the body in an ambulance to a crematorium at Velangadu, some ten km away from the Kilpauk cemetery where they were met by another crowd of 200 perosns.

Though the police chased the mob away, some 50 to 60 persons objected our entry into the crematorium and started pelting stones. The windshield of the ambulance was shattered and glass splinters and stones hit even the mortal remains of Dr Hercules. The ambulance driver was injured and we had to put some four stitches on his head to stop bleeding. I myself took the wheels of the ambulance and drove back to the hospital. Later a heavy posse of policemen escorted us to the same crematorium where we dug a 12 ft pit with an earthmover and interred the doctor. Dr Hercules deserved a better farewell,” a sobbing Dr Pradeep Kumar told The Pioneer.

While the cemetery officials or representatives of the Church remained incommunicado, a section of the people associated with the deceased doctor blamed the caste hierarchy in the Church as the reason for the deprivation of a decent funeral for a person who had dedicated his life to serve the mankind.

“It is a matter of shame for entire Tamil Nadu. This is a violation of human rights also,” said Narayanan Thirupati, spokesman of Tamil Nadu BJP. The Madras High Court which took up a suo motu public interest litigation petition, warned the local residents who had objected to the burial of Dr Hercules in Kilpauk cemetery.

The bench which heard the petition reminded the people that the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the constitution included the right to decent burial or cremation.

“It prima facie appears that as a consequence of the above said alleged acts a person who practiced a noble profession as a doctor and breathed his last has been deprived of his rights to have a burial in a cemetery earmarked for that purpose,” said judges M sathyanarayanan and M Nirmal Kumar in their order.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/faithfuls-deny-covid-victim-peace-even-after-death.html

Khandelwal said that on the other hand, due to the widespread of the Coronavirus, India’s commercial markets will remain vulnerable to heavy population exposure. Therefore, the markets will have to be complete sanitised and disinfected for Coronavirus and all other types of possible virus infections.

“The sanitisation process must begin before the lockdown is lifted and will have to be periodically carried out until the Coronavirus is completely eradicated out of India,” he said.

The trade leaders said that it would be in the best interest of the nation if a comprehensive “Sanitise and disinfect” plan may be devised by the Government to sanitise all wholesale and retail markets and shops across the country defining the role and responsibility of local administrative bodies, state and central government and trade associations in all states of India.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sanitise-all-commercial-markets-to-eliminate-virus--cait-to-govt.html

128,22-4-20,"NCP, CPM resort to counter-attack, lay blame on BJP","A day after BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra released a video and indirectly accused leaders of the two major Opposition parties of being behind the much-discussed Palghar lynching incident, the CPI(M) on Tuesday slammed him, his party’s national general secretary Sunil Deodhar and others with a defamation suit, while the NCP asked the ruling party at the Centre to stop “misleading” the people and “politicising” the issue.

Upset by efforts by Patra and other leaders of his party to link the two parties to the April 16 Palghar incident in which two Sadhus and a driver were lynched by a large mob of people at Gadhchinchale village near Kasa town in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, both the CPI (M) and NCP resorted to a counter-attack, saying that the BJP ruled the village where incident happened and indirectly holding it squarely responsible for the incident.

It may be recalled that on the night of April 16, three persons were lynched by a 200-strong mob of villagers near Kasa town in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on suspicion that they were thieves.

The villagers first hurled stones at the van, prompting the driver to stop the vehicle. Later, they pulled three persons out of the vehicle and beat them to death in Gadhchinchale village on Dabhadi-Khanwel road, with sticks and rods.

The deceased —identified as two Sadhus Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (70), Sushilgiri Maharaj (35) and driver Nilesh Telgade (30) were travelling from Mumbai to Surat.

Acting sternly against the culprits behind the ghastly lynching incident, the Maharashtra police on Monday arrested 101 persons, while chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered the suspension of two policemen, transferred the case to the Crime Investigation Department (CID) and deplored the efforts to communalise the crime.

On Monday, Patra had put out two tweets – in one of which he had demanded answers from the NCP and CPI(M) on what were the leaders doing in the unruly crowd that indulged in inhumanly act at Palghar, alleged that the ruling alliance partners in Maharashtra were trying to put the sins of each other under the carpet and wanted to know if it was a murder or a conspiracy.

He had also released the video of the incident and the people in Maharashtra could recoginise as to who were in the video.

In his response tweet, BJP’s national Secretary in-charge of Tripura and Andhra Pradesh Sunil Deodhar had said that the people in the video belonged to the NCP and CPM and identified them.

In retaliation, NCP’s Maharashtra unit president Jayant Patil tweeted: @sambitswaraj Stop misleading. Gadchinchale Gram Panchayat in Palghar is ruled by BJP and the Sarpanch Chitra Chaudhari,was present at the time of incidence.NCP has no involvement in the incident. Party worker had gone to venue on the police request. Stop politicizing the issue”.

The NCP’s response to the BJP came a day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray deplored the efforts to communalise the crime. Without naming the BJP, Uddhav had taken a dig at the BJP leaders. “Currently, we are waging a war against Coronavirus. Some people are using the incident to vitiate the atmosphere over social media. Though two Sadhus were among the three lynched in the incident, please do not give a communal colour to the incident”

During the course of his address to people across the state, Uddhav had also said: “I have spoken to both Union Home Minister Amit Shah and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. There is absolutely no religious context to the incident. It is wrong for the people to give communal colour to the incident. The mob attacked even the policemen who had rushed to the scene. They also damaged their vehicle”.

Meanwhile, the CPI (M) said that it had decided to launch legal proceedings against all the above, for defamation and rumour-mongering.

In a statement issued here, CPI (M)’s Maharashtra state secretary and party’s Central Committee member Narasayya Adam said: “Once again we condemn the Palghar incident. The Gadachinchle village where the killings took place has a BJP gram panchayat for the last 10 years. It is the base of the BJP. The present Sarpanch is of the BJP.”

“In this background, to whom /are the ringleaders of the killings connected? Who was spreading rumours in this area for the last several days? These and other matters will become clear in the police investigations,” Adam said.

“Realising that the situation is turning against them, some people have begun a condemnable attempt on the social media to defame the CPI(M) for no valid reason. Sambit Patra and Sunil Deodhar of the BJP have made statements defaming the CPI(M) without any basis whatsoever,” Adam said.

“On some WhatsApp groups and on Facebook, posts giving some names as the main accused and falsely alleging that they are CPI(M) activists are being put up. Prakash Gade has written such posts. On the Facebook page of I Devendra also, such false posts have been put up,” the CPI (M) state secretary said.

“In the FIR of this case, five names have been given as the accused. None of them is a member of the CPI(M),” he said.

“We have begun the process of preparing a list that includes Sambit Patra, Sunil Deodhar, Prakash Gade, the admin of the I Devendra Facebook page and other BJP supporters who are forwarding such posts on various WhatsApp groups and on Facebook,” Adam said.

The CPI(M) has decided to begin legal proceedings against all the above, for defamation and rumour-mongering,” the CPI (M) state secretary said

“The CPI(M) reiterates its demand for a thorough enquiry and stringent action against the guilty in the Palghar case. Our Party also demands that strict action be taken against all those who use this incident for increasing communal tension, despite the appeal made by the Chief Minister,” Adam said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ncp--cpm-resort-to-counter-attack--lay-blame-on-bjp.html
129,22-4-20,‘Maha to conduct 75k rapid Covid tests’,"With the Centre having given it go-ahead with certain conditions for carrying out rapid Covid-19 test, the Maharashtra Government will undertake 75,000 such tests in the State and as a precautionary measure, distribute Hydroxychloroquine tablets at some places in Mumbai to people showing symptoms of Coronavirus.

Announcing this, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said: “Doctors in Maharashtra are conducting Covid-19 tests as per the protocol prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). After laying down certain conditions, the Centre has permitted us to carry out rapid Covid-19 tests. After complying with the conditions, we intend to undertake 75,000 rapid tests in the state”.

Tope said that since Hydroxychloroquine increased immunity in the body, “As a precautionary measure, we intend to distribute Hydroxychloroquine tablets at some places in Mumbai to people showing symptoms of Coronavirus. But, the tablets will not be given to people with heart ailments or those were aged above 60 years or below 15 years of age”.

While addressing the people across the state through “Facebook”, the minister said that if the Coronavirus were increasing in Maharashtra, it was because maximum Coronavirus tests were being carried out in the state. “While carrying out the tests, we are following the ICMR guidelines. In addition, we are carrying out door-to-door health surveillance in the state. There are currently 6359 surveillance teams. There is absolutely no compromise when it comes to health surveillance,” the Minister said.

The Minister said that the earlier periodicity of doubling of the Coronavirus cases was receding now in the state. “Earlier, the cases used to double in two days. Now, the doubling of cases happens one in seven days. After 20 to 25 days of the outbreak of Covid-19, the trend should give us some satisfaction”.

“We are also laying emphasis on setting up Oxygen stations at various hospitals where Coronavirus patients are being treated currently. Our plan is to set up a mechanism where the patient is made available oxygen masks near his or her cot. We have also requested companies providing medical oxygen to increase production,” he said.

Among other things, the minister said: “The districts where there are more than 15 infected patients, we are declaring them as red zones. If in those districts where is no increase in the number of infected cases in 14 days, we are declaring them orange zones. If there is no increase in the number of infected cases in 28 days, we are declaring them as green zones”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---maha-to-conduct-75k-rapid-covid-tests---.html
130,22-4-20,Engineer & ex-MP develops ventilator for Covid patients,"Engineer and former Member of Parliament, Konda Vishweshwar Reddy on Tuesday claimed to have developed a ventilator for Covid-19 patients.

The rapidly manufacturable Indian COVID Ventilator or ICo-Vent is a COVID-19 specific ventilator that is expected to address the shortage of ventilators in the world.

Reddy, also an entrepreneur and inventor who had headed digital healthcare arms of General Electric and Wipro, said the lifesaving ventilators can be speedily made available for treating the thousands of critically-ill Covid-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation.

Reddy, who was elected to Lok Sabha from Chevella constituency in Telangana in 2014, claimed that ICo-Vent meets global specifications for COVID-19 specific ventilators. He has already applied for a patent for the technology and function.

“Today, the world needs a million ventilators and with current manufacturers unable to keep up with the supply, we are sure that the ICo-Vent, the first rapidly manufacturable COVID-19 specific ventilator will help to bridge the shortfall. It is the need of the hour and my focus is to ensure this invention benefits humanity,” he said.

The unprecedented COVID-19 episode exposed the inadequacies of healthcare systems worldwide. Being a virus that affects the respiratory system resulting in ARDS (Acute Respiratory

Distress Syndrome), governments and healthcare systems the world over suddenly found that they needed a lot more ventilators than they had to tackle the COVID situation, but not every ventilator works on COVID-19 positive patients. This led to a global race to design and build ventilators, he observed.

UK, Canada and other governments have come out with a set of specifications defining the minimum clinically accepted criteria for a rapidly manufacturable ventilator to address the COVID-19 situation. India is also in the process of coming out with a similar set of specifications.

“The ICo-Vent addresses the shortcoming of the conventional ventilators used in ICUs for critically ill patients. Most of the other ventilators especially those based on mechanized ambu bags provide no clinical benefits for use on COVID-19 patients, on the other hand, they can potentially cause ventilator induced lung injury and also put healthcare professionals under great risk as their operation can lead to the release of a huge viral load into the ICU atmosphere. Many healthcare workers in other countries have succumbed to this viral load,” said Reddy, who is husband of Apollo Hospital’s Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy.

The ICo-Vent allows the intensive care specialist or the pulmonologist to order a precise volume of air and oxygen at a precise inspiration pressure and a precise expiration pressure considering the compliance or the elasticity of the lung.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/engineer---ex-mp-develops-ventilator-for-covid-patients.html

Birla told the State Assemblies to explore the feasibility of extensive use of digital technology in legislative and financial work and for other routine tasks such as meetings and file movements so as to make sure that stringent social distancing norms are followed in their respective states.

He also called upon all the state assemblies to setup a control room for real time information exchange between the various State Assemblies and Parliament, which would allow MLAs and MPs to discharge their duties in a more effective manner in order to fight the challenge posed by COVID 19.

“In his interaction with Speakers of the State Assemblies, Birla was informed that many states have taken proactive measures with regard to providing relief to affected people. He was informed that many state MLAs have actively contributed to COVID 19 relief funds, both at the central as well as State level.

In the backdrop of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) statement, Naqvi said “secularism and harmony” is not “political fashion” but “perfect passion” for India and Indians. “This inclusive culture and commitment has united the country with fabric of unity in diversity”, said the minister.

He said rights of minorities in India were guaranteed by the Constitution of India.

“Traditional and professional bogus bashing brigade” are still active in conspiracy to spread misinformation” he said and sought caution against “such evil forces” spreading “misinformation and propaganda” which he said should be defeated “ unitedly”.

The OIC had on Sunday condemned what it called the “unrelenting vicious Islamophobic campaign” in India “maligning Muslims” for spread of Covid-19 and urged Indian government to contain the “tide of Islamophobia”.

The Minister said ‘Ramzan’ commences on April 24 and all religious leaders, religious and social organisations have together decided and made an appeal to the Muslim community to hold prayers, Iftar and perform other rituals at home itself while maintaining social distancing.

“The Muslim community has itself taken this decision, just like they did during Shab e-Barat,” Naqvi said.

He said over 30 Waqf Boards have agreed to create awareness about “social distancing” and need to defeat Coronavirus by adhering to lockdown guidelines.

He said most of the Muslim countries have also banned mass gathering at mosques and other religious places during Ramzan and have asked Muslims to pray at home.

He said Wakf Boards would demolish fake news and rumours about quarantine and isolation camps and oversee the strict implementation of lockdown procedures during Ramzan.

On April 16, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had directed state waqf boards to ensure strict implementation of lockdown and social distancing guidelines during the holy month of Ramzan.

138,22-4-20,"Ban TB drugs’ export, suggests Health Min","Concerned over the prospect of a shortage of tuberculosis (TB) medicines in India as its production has been impacted due to the ongoing nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, the Union Health Ministry has called for a ban on its exports. At the same time, it has also asked the State Governments to ensure transportation of supplies of the finished product within the country and enable officials, labourers or workers to reach the manufacturing plants so that the much-affected production of the drug can be ramped up.

Sources said, a decision on whether or not to ban the export of anti-TB drugs could be taken soon even as the Government would go for taking measures to bring its production back on track.

""In view of the emergency measures undertaken, the availability of limited number of manpower and material to the pharmaceutical industry, the production capacity of the leading anti-TB drugs manufacturers of India has been affected,"" Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan wrote to Parameswaran Iyer, the Head of the Empowered Group for Facilitating Supply Chain Management and the Drinking Water and Sanitation Secretary.

""The TB drugs are essential for the treatment of TB patients under National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) and delay in production and receipt of supply may cause acute shortages of these drugs in the field. Such a situation will worsen the treatment of the TB patients within the country,"" she said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic and resultant countrywide lockdown to curb its spread, leading manufacturers Macleods Pharmaceuticals and Lupin Limited have told the government that there is a shortage of materials, labour and transport, the Secretary cited in her letter adding the manufacturers have communicated that there could be a delay in the supplies.

State governments in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Daman and Diu, where the factories are located, have been asked to ensure that transportation services are available for the pharma companies and workers and materials are able to reach factories.

The Health Secretary asked the Empowered Group to direct the Departments of Commerce and Pharmaceuticals and Commerce Ministry to intervene in the issue and prohibit the export of the anti-TB drugs so that the patients in India do not face any difficulties and the NTEP is also not adversely impacted.

India, where 4.5 lakh persons die annually due to the scourge of TB, plans to wipe out the menace in the country by 2025. Hence, the unhindered continuance of the NTEP holds the key to India getting rid of the tag of one of the most TB-burdened countries globally.

India had initially banned the export of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine drug but rescinded it on humanitarian grounds after several countries like the US urged it to. The US and Brazil are among the countries which are using HCF in their anti-Covid fight.

139,22-4-20,Drop in footfall in small hospitals in small cities during Covid outbreak,"In just four months since the first case of Covid-19 was reported, the pandemic is already adversely impacting country’s private healthcare sector including small hospitals and clinics, especially in Tier-II and III cities, which have been forced to close down their operations since their cash flows have dried-up, according to a joint report by FICCI and the EY, a global entity engaged in tax, transaction and advisory services.

Yet, private hospitals and nursing homes, that constitute more than 60 per cent of beds at 8.5-9 lac, 60% of inpatients and 80 per cent of doctors in India, have been investing heavily over the past month in additional manpower, equipment, consumables and other resources to ensure 100% preparedness for safety in the healthcare facilities and eventual treatment of patients, if needed, said the report.

Dr Sangita Reddy, President, FICCI and Joint Managing Director, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, said, “the private healthcare sector in India has stood besides the government firmly to contain the virus and is deeply committed to the war against COVID-19.

“However, there is an urgent need to consider the healthcare industry’s triple burden viz. low financial performance in pre-COVID state; sharp drop in out-patient footfalls, diagnostic testing, elective surgeries and international patients across the sector is impacting cash flow; and the increased investments due to COVID-19; which has impacted the hospitals and laboratories like never before.”

Dr Alok Roy, Chair- FICCI Health services Committee and Chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals added, “the financial distress accentuated by Covid-19 lockdown has forced several standalone and small nursing homes in tier II and III cities to down the shutters. Many others are at high risk of closing down soon since their cash flows have dried up, due to steep decline in patient footfalls, and they are facing liquidity crisis for even sustaining their staff salaries.”

The stakeholders have recommended Government support through Liquidity infusion for financing of the operating losses through short term interest free/ concessional interest rate loans to address the liquidity gap to the tune of Rs 14,000 -24,000 Crore, besides tax waivers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/drop-in-footfall-in-small-hospitals-in-small-cities-during-covid-outbreak.html

During the 27 days of lockdown, 1,750 tonnes of foodgrains have been moved to Lakshadweep from Mangalore port which is almost thrice the normal monthly average of 600 tonnes, it said in a statement.

The remaining 6,500 tonnes of foodgrains have been moved from Kakinada Port to Port Blair, and different public distribution centres situated at different islands of A&N, which is more than double the normal monthly average of 3,000 tonnes, it added.

FCI transported foodgrains in two ship vessels to A&N, and in seven small vessels to Lakshadweep Islands since the imposition of lockdown on March 24 to combat the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

A&N as well as Lakshadweep have very unique logistical challenges as these areas cannot be accessed by road/rail from mainland, and sea route is the only option for movement of foodgrains, it said.

According to the statement, about 1,100 tonnes of foodgrains have already been distributed via PDS shops in Lakshadweep, while 5,500 tonnes have been distributed in A&N during the lockdown.

142,22-4-20,Poor were dying of hunger and Govt wanted to make sanitisers for rich: Rahul,"Continuing his tirade against the Centre, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that the poor were dying of hunger and the Government wanted to make sanitisers for the rich.

He also sought explanation from the Government why it was not reducing the prices of petrol and diesel in the country when crude oil rates have plunged to record lows.

The Congress has also convened a Congress Working Committee on Thursday to discuss further the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown situation. This is the second CWC in this month besides the few rounds of meetings via video conferencing with state Congress units and Chief Ministers of party-ruled states.

Reacting to reports that the Centre has decided to use additional rice in stock to make ethanol, which could be used for making sanitisers, Rahul said in a tweet, ""When will the poor of Hindustan wake up, you are dying of hunger and from your share of rice they are going to make sanitisers for the rich.""

The Congress has been demanding free ration till September 20 and party chief Sonia Gandhi has also written to the Prime Minister on this.

Rahul has also appealed to the government to issue emergency ration cards to the migrants and the poor, who are not getting rations through the PDS.

His reactions came after reports suggested that the Centre has allowed the FCI to convert the surplus rice into ethanol to ensure adequate availability of sanitisers to fight COVID-19.

The decision was taken by the National Biofuel Cordination Committee chaired by Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan as per the National Biofuel policy of 2018.

The ethanol produced will also be used in production of ethanol-blended petrol.

The policy of 2018 allows such conversions of surplus foodgrains to into ethanol.

Rahul also asked when would this government listen and reduce the prices of petrol and diesel, which continued to sell at Rs 69 and Rs 62 per litre respectively in India.

""Prices of crude oil have fallen to unexpected levels in the world, yet why is petrol in our country sold at Rs 69, diesel at Rs 62. It is good that prices have fallen in this disaster. When will this Government listen,"" Rahul mentioned in a tweet.

Congress in statement said Monday was a ""historical moment"" that saw

unprecedented fall in the international crude oil prices, as manufacturers have no storage capacity left.

Congress General Secretary K.C. Venugopal said, ""A meeting of the CWC will be held on Thursday through video conferencing to discuss the current Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown situation. All CWC Members, Permanent and Special Invitees, CMs of Congress-ruled states will take part in the meeting, he said.

They pointed out that India, at present, has three times the quantity of rice than was needed.

And as per the policy, there was nothing illegal in the conversion.

148,22-4-20,46 per cent businesses in India fear negative Covid-19 impact for 1 year,"Amid the growing concern over Covid-19, 57 per cent of organisations in India expect a moderate to large negative impact on their business in the next six months, while 46 per cent expect this to last over a 12-month period, a survey revealed on Tuesday.

About 19 per cent of the respondents said they expect such an adverse impact to last over a two-year period, according to the survey by Willis Towers Watson, a leading advisory, broking and solutions company.

Only 5 per cent of organisations expect a positive business impact within the next 12 to 24 months, said the “COVID-19 India Readiness Survey”.

“The tough economic conditions and anticipated business impact could drive organisations to consider workforce optimisation,” Rohit Jain, Head of India, Willis Towers Watson, said in a statement.

“Employers should take an emphatic and considerate approach and evaluate options such as staff redeployment, reduced working hours/days, long service leave, sabbatical, furlough, hiring freeze and voluntary pay cuts, before any serious consideration of a workforce reduction,” Jain added.

The survey conducted from March 20-31 involved 103 organisations in India.

150,22-4-20,"Sensex falls 1,000 points on oil price crash, Nifty below 9,000","Indian stock market witnessed a freefall on Tuesday with both the BSE Sensex and the Nifty50 closing below the psychological levels of 31,000 and 9,000, respectively.

The Sensex lost over 1,000 points by the end of the day’s trade. Weakness in the domestic indices was in line with the bear run across the global markets, after crude oil prices in the US in an unprecedented development fell below zero and turned negative.

Rahul Sharma, Research Head at Equity99 said: “It was a very nervous day for most traders today as benchmark indices broke key support levels today on concerns of a historic fall in international crude last night where US crude prices nosedived below the $0 a barrel mark for the first time ever on fears of a supply glut.”

He said that dealers and analyst now fear that the much talked about the global recession is very close which will have serious impact on the global equity markets too in the coming days.

According to Sharma, market will continue to trade in the negative zone in the next few days and the upcoming earnings reports and economic data will also keep investors cautious.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities noted that on the BSE, the top sectoral gainers were the BSE Telecom and Healthcare indices, while the major losers were the BSE Banking index, Metal, Auto and Oil and Gas indices.

Major Asian markets have closed on a negative note. European indices like the FTSE, DAX and CAC have ended lower, he said.

On technical front, traders will need to watch if Nifty can bounce back from the immediate supports of 8,821, Jasani said, adding that, otherwise the intermediate downtrend may continue that could take the Nifty towards the next downside targets of 8,360-8,055.

On Tuesday, the Nifty50 on the National Stock Exchange closed at 8,981.45, lower by 280.40 points or 3.03 per cent from its previous close.

The Sensex closed at 30,636.71, lower by 1,011.29 points or 3.20 per cent from the previous close of 31,648. It had opened at 30,836.19 and recorded an intra-day high of 30,900.12 and a low of 30,378.26 points.

The historic plunge in the WTI crude oil prices in the US was the major factor for the rout in global equity markets.

Due to high supplies and lower offtake amid the coronavirus crisis and the worldwide standstill, the US has run out of storage for the commodity posing a major challenge for the market.

Currently, the May contract of WTI crude on the NYMEX is at -$4.47 per barrel.

Nitin Shahi, Executive Director, Findoc Financial Services Group said that the timeline of the impact on crude prices is directly related to the length of the lockdown.

“Storage capacities worldwide for crude are nearly full. If the lockdown continues for longer period of time, there is a higher possibility that output cutbacks will take place and the smaller oil producers would have to shut off their oil tap first,” Shahi said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sensex-falls-1-000-points-on-oil-price-crash--nifty-below-9-000-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sensex-falls-1-000-points-on-oil-price-crash--nifty-below-9-000.html

The top court was told that due to non-availability of 4G services, several aspects are affected including medical facilities and education services.

The Centre opposed the plea by telling the apex court that it is a question of national security as militancy still poses a serious threat in Jammu and Kashmir and cited a recent incident where hundreds of people gathered in the valley for a funeral of a militant killed by security forces.

155,22-4-20,"Oil prices crumbling, stocks around the world tumble","Oil’s chaotic collapse deepened, and stocks around the world dropped on Tuesday as markets remain upside down amid the economic carnage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

A day after oil futures plunged below zero for the first time, traders in one corner of the U.S. crude market were still close to paying others to take it off their hands. That’s a market quirk created by a glut of oil, which has traders running out of places to store it in the near term.

Prices remain well above zero for oil elsewhere in the world and for deliveries further into the future, which analysts consider to be closer to the “true” price of crude. But they also slid sharply Tuesday on the same ultimate concern: A global economy incapacitated by the virus outbreak doesn’t need to burn as much fuel. Airplanes are parked, cars are garaged and factories are idled with millions of workers losing their jobs every week.

The crumbling oil market dragged on stocks, and energy producers around the world sank sharply from ConocoPhillips in Texas to Total in France. The S&P 500 was down 2.7%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, following similar losses across Europe and Asia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 538 points, or 2.3%, to 23,104, and the Nasdaq was down 3.4%.

In another sign of the worry washing over markets, Treasury yields fell further. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 0.55% from 0.62% late Monday, meaning investors are willing to get paid even less to get the safety of owning a U.S. government bond. At the start of the year, before economies worldwide went on lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, investors were getting paid about 1.90% to own a 10-year Treasury.

Even with all the chaos in the oil markets, some signs of economic activity on the horizon were poking through elsewhere. The Senate’s Democratic leader said negotiators reached agreement on a nearly $500 billion proposal to provide more loans and aid to small businesses and hospitals. Georgia’s governor, meanwhile, announced plans late Monday to allow gyms, hair salons and other businesses to reopen as early as Friday.

Rising optimism among some investors that parts of the economy could reopen as infections level off have helped stocks rally recently, and the S&P 500 is up more than 23% since hitting a low in late March. The rally got its start after the Federal Reserve and Congress promised massive amounts of aid for the economy.

But the data coming in on the economy in the here and now continues to be dismal, and pessimists say the market’s rally has been overdone. A report Tuesday showed that sales of previously occuppied homes in the United States fell last month to its steepest drop since 2015.

Companies are also describing the hit to earnings they’re taking due to the outbreak, with many pulling their financial forecasts for the year given all the uncertainty about how long the impending recession will last. Coca-Cola said Tuesday that its sales were on track to hit financial targets through February, but that all changed when stay-at-home orders became widespread in March. It said it’s hopeful that improvement could arrive in the second half of the year. IBM on late Monday withdrew its guidance for 2020 results and said it will reassess at the end of June.

The economic pain is perhaps most clear in the oil market. A barrel of U.S. oil to be delivered in May costs about the same as a gallon of milk: $3.81. It was at negative $1.48 just before stocks began trading in New York Tuesday and had settled at negative $37.63 on Monday.

Because of the collapse in demand, storage tanks for oil are close to the brim at a key energy hub in Oklahoma. That has traders willing to pay others to take delivery of that oil in May, so long as they also take the burden of figuring out where to put it.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-prices-crumbling--stocks-around-the-world-tumble.html
156,22-4-20,"Rs ends near record low amid crash in oil, equities","The rupee depreciated on Tuesday to close at a near-record low level of 76.83 per dollar.

The weakness in Indian currency came on the back of the crash in the US oil prices and slump in the domestic stock market, analysts said.

It depreciated 29 paise to close at 76.83 per US dollar. The record low level of rupee is 76.87 which it touched last Thursday.

Financial and commodity markets off late have been on a free fall globally amid the coronavirus crisis.

The historic plunge in crude oil prices is a major factor for the weakness in rupee on Tuesday. On Monday, for the first time ever, WTI crude fell below zero and reached an all time low of -$40.32 per barrel due to a supply glut and declining storage capacity in the US.

The May contract of WTI crude is still in the negative zone and currently is trading at -$8.10 per barrel.

161,22-4-20,Pak PM warns mosques will be forced to shut down during Ramzan if directives not followed,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday warned that mosques will be forced to shut down during the upcoming month of Ramzan if people did not follow the official directives issued to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic that has infected over 9,000 people in the country. Khan’s warning came days after the government allowed congregational prayers in mosques during the month of Ramzan after the clerics agreed to follow the government guidelines on social distancing while praying in mosques.

According to the agreement, people above the age of 50, minors and those suffering from flu will not be allowed to enter the mosques.

The worshippers must maintain a distance of six feet when praying and people should wear face masks and avoid shaking hands or embracing others. The prime minister said that Pakistan decided to keep mosques open in Ramzan because “we are an independent nation and take decisions according to our own situation”.

Khan made the comments while addressing the media along with his key team of advisors about the country’s fight against the pandemic.

He, however, urged people to pray at home and those attending mosques should follow official guidelines. He warned that the government would be forced to shut down mosques if it was found that official directives on the matter were not followed.

“I don’t want that police arrest people who want to pray in mosques,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pak-pm-warns-mosques-will-be-forced-to-shut-down-during-ramzan-if-directives-not-followed.html
162,22-4-20,Muslims try to keep Ramzan spirit amid virus restrictions,"Every year during Ramadan, the Light of Muhammad Mosque sets up long tables on the street and dishes up free meals at sunset for the poor to break their daily fast. It’s a charity that many rely on in this impoverished district on the edge of the Egyptian capital.

But it’s too dangerous in this era of the coronavirus — in Egypt and in many Muslim countries, such “Tables of the Compassionate” have been barred.

So the mosque, which like others in Egypt had to shut its doors as a precaution against the virus, will use the funds that would have gone into the free communal tables to distribute packed meals and cash to those in need.

“We hope this could ease their suffering,” said Sheikh Abdel-Rahman, the muezzin of the mosque in the district of Bahtim.

As Ramadan begins with the new moon later this week, Muslims around the world are trying to maintain the cherished rituals of Islam’s holiest month without further spreading the outbreak.

At the heart of Ramadan is the sunrise-to-sunset fast, meant to instill contemplation of God. But alongside the hardship of abstaining from food and drink for hours every day, the month sweeps everyone up into a communal spirit. Families and friends gather for large meals at sunset, known as iftars. In some countries, cafes and cultural events are packed late into the night. Worshippers go to mosques for hours of evening prayers, or “taraweeh.” Many devote themselves to charity.

Muslims now find themselves cut off from much of what makes the month special as authorities fight the pandemic. Many countries have closed mosques and banned taraweeh to prevent crowds. Prominent clerics, including in Saudi Arabia, have urged people to pray at home. Governments are trying to balance restrictions with traditions.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/muslims-try-to-keep-ramzan-spirit-amid-virus-restrictions.html

South Korea’s presidential office said Kim appeared to be handling state affairs as usual and that it had no information about rumors regarding his health. But many will be watching closely for any signs of trouble in North Korea, and whether it will address the reports — something it has not yet done.

The United States and North Korea appeared to be barreling toward war in 2017, with the countries trading insults and threats of destruction.

164,22-4-20,Let’s be online,"Digital learning has become the new normal. Samit Roy shares tips that one can follow to make the most of it

The world is going through an extra-ordinary crisis of unparalleled dimensions and naturally the education sector is no different. Some 540 million students from Class I to the highest Masters and research levels in India are studying or trying to study from home. Given the factor that there is uncertainty about the duration of this period, we must get used to this new normal and get ourselves on to the task of teaching learning online through various digital platforms. The following are top suggestions for effectively doing so today when we are home-locked in the collective interest of all.

First, just as we wear a shirt, a trouser and a footwear to be at home or go outside, we invariably need a smart phone with data, a stable wifi-connection and a laptop with camera inbuilt. Many cannot afford these, many will not have a great connectivity in their locality, and there may be troubles in getting these just now. However, whether you have, or loan, or buy online, these are simply must for a digital learning experience of a good quality.

Second, for digital learning, you must have an active habit of browsing portals, being an active member of social media. This will help you to attend FB and YouTube live sessions on knowledge issues as well.

Third, you must be on Gmail, on Google platform, with access to Google Drive and if possible, paid access to G-Suite of Google. These will give you an opportunity to interact with others, store good content of all variety, and be part of Google Class by mentors or use Google Spreadsheet and attend or address Google Hangouts on specific themes, apart from co-creating a document on Google with peers.

Fourth, you should be conversant in attending Zoom sessions for live class or webinar experience, and even better, if you can generate Zoom sessions which are free upto 40 minutes. Though a maximum of 100 people can attend a Zoom session, it is best organised with 30 to 40 participants at a time.

Fifth, you must develop an email etiquette to address the recipient properly, end the mail properly, give a body-copy to your communication, and write briefly in bullet points almost identifying the core issues of your problems or learning needs. Similarly, there is a web-discussion etiquette of not speaking out of turns, not speaking over someone, muting one’s speaker phone when someone talks, and raising hand to make a point and waiting for the chance to speak calmly.

Sixth, you must be able to download videos, watch minutely while listening to academic discussions on videos, noting down key points, and ideally repeat watching a second time to capture points missed out the first time.

Seventh, you must know basics of Adobe Premier and may be iVideo or WeVideo to create short explanatory video or statement of understanding of a subject discussed digitally, apart from knowing how to make a good visually rich power-point presentation and an excel sheet as needed.

Eighth, you must be good in recording video and audio, use whatsapp to share files even after compression, and conduct co-created collaborative study resources digitally. Even videos, podcasts (audio content), ppts, pdfs etc can be shared on whatsapp individually or to a group. While using Whatsapp, special care must be taken to avoid false content, doubtful content and defamatory videos etc.

Ninth, you must prepare separate folders for each course, and save ppts, pdfs, videos, podcasts etc of that course chronologically in order of the chapters or units in the syllabus in the folder so that there is no time lost to get the same when needed and during course revision.

You must space your time suitably for not less than eight to ten hours a day, dividing time between listening, reading online, attending Google class, a zoom session (or Microsoft Meets, Webex meets or GoToMeetings as the case may be), watching videos, filing and preserving, and preparing your notes based on all inputs you have got.

Digital learning also needs that you take a 10 minutes break after every hour, stretch yourself, have a little walk, or a cup of tea or juice or a fruit, and may even jog around in your home or corridor or go up and down the stairs. This will help you avoid any body pain, neck ache or getting fat accumulated. While you must minimum three good meals a day with small breaks of tea, juice or fruits, no meal should be heavy while staying at home and studying.

Take the lockdown as a time gifted to you by nature to reboot yourself, set your ethical and professional compass right, re-prioritise, introspect, plan, and take a leap in life and work thereafter.

167,22-4-20,Organised revision strategy is key,"The lockdown being extended till May 3 means more time for students to prepare for JEE Main. RL TRIKHA shares tips how aspirants can make the most of this extra time

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation is under lockdown, which has been extended till May 3. The second session of JEE Main (April Session) which was scheduled to be conducted from April 5 to April 11 2020 has been postponed until further notice. While the expectations are that it may be conducted by the end of May, aspirants have an extended preparation time available which shall be put to effective utilisation. Students must stay positive and need to focus on revision and analysing their weaknesses.

As per the previous schedule, most of the aspirants must have gone through the complete syllabus and must be in revision mode now. The need of the hour is to utilise the extra time productively and effectively with plan in place to make the best of it.

Make a viable schedule: This phase should be effectively utilised for quick run through short notes and formulae and concepts at a glance of all chapters of the three subjects in a phased planned manner with equal time to each subject. The idea is to strengthen the concepts and their application by solving mock tests and past years papers. Learning as against mugging is the rule of the game.

Consult online classes: Online platforms are available that provide a virtual classroom ambience with complete notes, expert opinions, online classes and mock tests for best student preparation.

Follow three tier revision: The stage has arrived where revision is the most important aspect of the preparation process and the best way to tackle the challenge is to have a well-structured and organised revision strategy. Three tier revision method suggests that students should first revise the topic on the same day, then after three days and then revise the same topic at the end of the week. This way, you will be able to get strong hold on topics and subjects which stay in your memory for longer period. If you revise a topic the same day when you study it, you find it easy to revise and grab; while on the other hand if you revise that topics after few days of studying it, it becomes difficult to understand and revise and consume more time.

Study and application of important formulae: It is important to peruse and conceptually apply formulae in JEEM type questions even at the time of revision. This will help you in solving the questions within a short time in the exam.

Take regular mock tests: Mock tests play an important role in making familiar with strong and weak areas. To test and analyse your preparation, students are advised to take mock tests.

This extra time must be wisely utilised to perfect the ability to solve problems with a deep perception of concept involved, improving the time needed to solve the given problem, identifying the weak spots and correcting them. By taking regular mock tests and solving of past papers.

Speed and accuracy must be increased.

Right strategy and time management play a vital role in deciding the rank for an aspirant. The remaining weeks should be wisely used for revision, increasing speed and accuracy to solve problems,

Finally, it is the relative performance that will matter on the exam day.

168,22-4-20,AirAsia India likely to restart operations with 24 aircraft post lockdown,"Budget carrier AirAsia India is likely to resume operations with a fleet of 24 planes post lockdown, according to a source.

Amid financial woes, the airline is also unlikely to induct any new aircraft this fiscal.

A joint venture between Tata Sons and Malaysia's AirAsia Berhad, the Bengaluru-based airline has 29 Airbus A320 planes in the fleet, catering to 21 domestic destinations.

All domestic and international commercial passenger flight operations have been suspended during the lockdown, which was initially imposed from March 25 to April 14 and thereafter extended till May 3.

Soon after the extended date was announced on April 14, some of the Indian carriers announced that they would recommence flight operations in a phased manner from May 4 and had started taking bookings also.The government later directed them not to do so and wait till further orders on the issue.

""The travel demand is not going to come back any time soon. We are expecting initially it would be the stranded people in different state capitals and cities of the country, who have been waiting to return to their original places, will be rushing to the airport whenever lockdown ends and air services are allowed to operate,"" said a source from AirAsia India.

Since it would take a lot of time for even the domestic traffic to return to normal, carrying out operations with the entire fleet will not be financially prudent, he said.

""Considering these factors, we are looking to put only 24 aircraft in service with reduced frequencies when we restart operations after the lockdown. And once the traffic starts picking up, we will also ramp up both the fleet and the services,"" the source said.

AirAsia India spokesperson refused to comment on PTI queries. According to a recent survey by global aviation and aerospace consultancy ICF, the aviation industry may take six months to two years to recover from the severe blow dealt by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last week, AirAsia India had said, "" we look forward to resuming our operations soon, once we receive the appropriate approvals. Preparations are underway to implement and strictly adhere to the social distancing guidelines laid out by the government across all facets of our operations as the safety and security of our guests and crew is our top priority.""

The source also said the airline is unlikely to induct any new aircraft this fiscal owing to an expected low demand, ""if market dynamics changes and there is any sudden spurt in domestic traffic then it would prefer subleasing from the parent AirAsia Berhad than going for fresh deliveries.""

The airline, which narrowed its losses to Rs 123.35 crore in the December quarter of the previous fiscal, had added nine planes in the fleet to take total number of aircraft to 28 as on December 31, 2019. Since then it has taken delivery of only one aircraft in January this year.

In late January, European aviation major Airbus had announced it was deferring aircraft deliveries to the Indian customers through March 9. However, later in March itself coronavirus pandemic hit the world, bringing the aviation industry to a near halt.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/airasia-india-likely-to-restart-operations-with-24-aircraft-post-lockdown-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/airasia-india-likely-to-restart-operations-with-24-aircraft-post-lockdown.html
169,22-4-20,"Coronavirus very likely of animal origin, not constructed in lab: WHO","The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.

US President Donald Trump said last week that his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic emerged in December.

“All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing. “It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.”

It was not clear, Chaib added, how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had “certainly” been an intermediate animal host. “It most likely has its ecological reservoir in bats but how the virus came from bats to humans is still to be seen and discovered.”

She did not respond to a request to elaborate on whether it was possible the virus may have inadvertently escaped from a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed rumours both that it synthesized the virus or allowed it to escape.

Chaib, asked about the impact of Trump’s decision last week to suspend funding to the UN agency over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, said: “We are still assessing the situation about the announcement by President Trump ...and we will assess the situation and we will work with our partners to fill any gaps.”

“It is very important to continue what we are doing not only for Covid but for many, many, many, many other health programmes,” she added, referring to action against polio, HIV and malaria among other diseases.

She said that the WHO was 81 percent funded for the next two years as of the end of March, referring to its $4.8 billion biennial budget. The United States is the Geneva-based agency’s biggest donor.

US: The coronavirus death toll in the United States — the country with the most fatalities in the pandemic — has climbed by 1,433 in the past 24 hours to reach 43,558, the latest tally from Johns Hopkins University showed.

The US has recorded more than 8,03,018confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the start of the global health crisis, according to the Baltimore-based university. New York is the epicentre of the US outbreak, though it seems the state may have endured the worst of the crisis.

Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday that 478 deaths had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, the lowest total in more than two weeks.

UK: A total of 17,337 people in hospital with coronavirus have died in Britain, new health ministry figures showed on Tuesday, an increase of 828 on the previous day. The daily increase in deaths, which excludes those in care homes, is a significant increase on Monday’s tally but numbers are always lower at the start of the week due to reporting delays over the weekend. Coronavirus-related deaths were about 41 per cent higher in England and Wales than the Government’s hospital-only figures in the week up to April 10, according to official data released here on Tuesday. The latest figures, which was released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), shows that there were 1,662 deaths involving the coronavirus in England and Wales registered up to April 10 that happened outside of hospitals.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed on the need for a coordinated international response to the coronavirus pandemic, Downing Street and the White House said in separate statements on Tuesday.

Spain: New deaths attributed to the new coronavirus in Spain are slightly up again on Tuesday, with 430 fatalities that bring the total death toll to 21,282 from a 4-week low of 399 daily deaths on Monday. Spain is reporting nearly 4,000 new infections to a total of 2,04,178, a 2% day-to-day increase in line with the average for the past four days, health ministry data shows.

The Government is assessing already how to roll back one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, starting from next Monday by allowing children to go out onto the streets for brief periods. Spain’s center-left Cabinet is discussing details on how the measure will be implemented during Tuesday’s weekly meeting.

Italy: Italy is likely to start easing its coronavirus lockdown from May 4, though the long-awaited rollback will be cautious and calculated, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday. The country has been one of the hardest hit in the world by the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than 24,100 people killed since the contagion first emerged in February.

Looking to contain the spread, the government introduced sweeping curbs in March, telling Italians to stay at home and shutting schools, businesses and industries nationwide. The restrictions have put a major strain on the euro zone’s third-largest economy but with the number of new cases gradually slowing, Conte said he would unveil by the weekend Government plans to loosen the shutdown.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/global-cases-above-2-5-mn.html

174,22-4-20,Global Hunger Could Double Due To Covid-19 Blow: UN’,"The number of people facing acute food insecurity could nearly double this year to 265 million due to the economic fallout of COVID-19, the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday.

The impact of lost tourism revenues, falling remittances and travel and other restrictions linked to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to leave some 130 million people acutely hungry this year, adding to around 135 million already in that category.

“Covid-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread,” said Arif Husain, chief economist and director of research, assessment and monitoring at the World Food Programme (WFP).

“We all need to come together to deal with this because if we don’t the cost will be too high - the global cost will be too high: many lost lives and many, many more lost livelihoods,” he told reporters at a virtual briefing in Geneva.

Husain said it was critical to act quickly in order to prevent people already living hand-to-mouth, such as food vendors in Kenya, from selling their assets as it could take them years to become self-reliant again.

In some cases, such as when farmers sell their ploughs or oxen, it could have knock-on effects for food production for years to come, he added.

“These were the people we were concerned about - those who were OK before COVID and now they are not,” he said, adding he was “really worried” about people living in countries with little or no government safety nets.

“Acute food and livelihood crisis” is category three of five UN phases meaning a “critical lack of food access and above usual malnutrition”.

Category 5 means mass starvation. UN officials did not give a geographical breakdown of the growing needs, but said that Africa was likely to be hardest hit. WFP expects to need $10-$12 billion to fund its assistance programmes this year compared to a record $8.3 billion raised last year, Husain added. It plans to pre-position food stocks over the coming months in anticipation of growing needs.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/global-hunger-could-double-due-to-covid-19-blow--un---.html
175,22-4-20,Keep distractions at bay,"Work from home is appealing for some while it can be intimidating for others. With the right mindset and equipment, one can make sure everything goes smoothly, says KEWAL KAPOOR

To contain the spread of the coronavirus and avoid community transmission, companies across the country have implemented telecommuting. For a lot of people, working from home is an exciting prospect. No long commutes, no one staring over your shoulder, and the comfort of working at your own pace definitely make it appealing. For others, it can be quite intimidating — particularly if you have kids to take care of, distractions, or are unfamiliar with working remotely. With the right mindset and equipment, working from home works like a charm. Let us take a look at a few things to pull this off.

Find a workspace: Even if you do not have an office, setting aside a place to do work can help keep distraction at bay. It is important that you find a space where you can carry on your work without worrying about interruptions. It might take some time and tinkering to find a setup that resembles your office setup as much as possible. It does not necessarily have to be a private room. A designated area far from the couch and bed will do.

Plan your day: Make a to-do list and prioritise your tasks. Not only will it help you stay focused and keep you from procrastinating. Review the list as you start your day, and keep referring to it periodically. Evaluate the progress at the end of the day, and prepare a list for the next day. Make sure you stick to your schedule.

Dress up: Even if you do not want to wear formal clothes, it is recommended you do not work in your pyjamas. It might sound a little odd to you, but even wearing shoes in addition to jeans and a comfortable shirt will help you separate work from leisure.

Keep your kids occupied: It can be quite distracting to work peacefully when you also have to shoulder the additional responsibility of taking care of your kids. Make sure you organise their day around your work time so that you are not interrupted. Divide your kid-duty with your spouse based on your work calendars. Be upfront with your coworkers so that they are more understanding of your situation.

177,22-4-20,‘Read fineprint before taking study loan’,"Many students take loan for studying in a foreign university. While it is easy to get the amount, don’t fall in the pitfalls that come with it, says HENNA JAIN TATIA

Education loan is the second largest contributor to consumer debt around the world, led only by home loan. Thanks to the trend catching up in India, millions of students have been able to fulfil their dream of pursuing higher education — both within the country and abroad. Taking an education loan, however, is a life-altering decision. If it is not given due attention and care, it can become a chronic headache. Given below are a few things you do:

Borrowing more than needed: The maximum amount of loan you can draw from a bank ranges from Rs 20 lakh-Rs 40 lakh. You should not borrow such a large sum. The more money you take, the more you’ll have to return in terms of interest. Sit down and calculate your net education expense before you decide how much you’re going to borrow.

The temptation for luxury: Once you have the money in your hand, it’s not easy to resist spending it. But your education loan is for educational purposes only. Try finding a part-time job to fund your non-academic expenditure.

Lack of research: Diving headlong towards the first offer that presents itself is one of the worst mistakes you can make. Research the market and then research some more. Compare interest rates and go with the one that leads to the smallest repayment amount. Quite often, some Fintech companies offer lower interest rates compared to banks.

Preferring long-term repayment over short-term repayment: Long-term repayment involves paying a small instalment every month over a long duration. Short-term repayment involves paying the maximum monthly instalment. Students often tend to go for the former. However, they fail to notice that it also involves repaying a substantially larger sum of money because of the accumulation of interest. Whenever you can, prefer short-term repayment.

Not reading the fine print: The Too Long: Didn’t Read trend isn’t limited to blogs. Many students end up buying an expensive education loan without reading the fine print. Many students who apply for the loan aren’t well versed in financial matters. So take advise.

Apart from applying to the release of rankings and administrative actions, the suspension also applies to all fights in this period. WBO President Francisco Valcarcel said that the decision has been primarily taken due to restrictions on social gatherings that are in place in most countries around the world.

“I think the fans are an essential part of boxing,” Valcarcel told ESPN. “Even if boxing is a TV event, the fights that are of most interest to the public, I don’t think we’ll be able to see them this year, at least not until we can have fans.”

Valacarcel admitted that he has his doubts on whether any fights will take place in August or September. “For us to have fans, we need a vaccine — it’s a complicated thing. They say they might be able to fight in August or September, but I have my doubts. We must sacrifice money or time waiting on a vaccine.

186,22-4-20,Choose right course,"In these changing times, companies will now be looking for people who can take on more responsibilities. Hence, it is important to upskill and be relevant, says Dr Sandeep Pachpande

In these fast changing times, there is a dire need for students or working executives to choose the right PGDM/executive MBA (ex-MBA) course that will help them in enhancing their career prospects. These courses provide enormous career opportunities in the corporate world. In an era of constantly emerging trends and rapidly changing business dynamics, there's a need for upgrading and sharpening of skills to stay relevant. Companies in every industry are exploring fresh ways to develop business leaders to expand and grow their organizations.

The PGDM/ex-MBA courses help groom students in multi facets of business. It introduces young minds on the intricacies of management; inter personal skills, presentation skills and also social etiquette which are so important in today's business environment where we consider, the world to be a global village. Students doing such courses have a brighter chance of being picked up from MNC's and large corporate houses, as they generally scout for students passing out from such educational institutes.

A PGDM and ex-MBA course widens the horizon of a professional providing him with an array of career options to choose in whichever field he desires to enter. The advantages for students are multi-fold and multi-dimensional.

One of the most important benefits of taking up these courses is that it makes you corporate-ready. It becomes difficult to enter the corporate world without having management education. In every PGDM course, be it Marketing Management or International Business, you learn about other business spheres as well, like human resource management, finance, marketing, entrepreneurship, statistics, economics, etc. This helps in grooming and preparing the professional to become corporate ready and pursuing a rich and rewarding career.

On the other hand, we have seen a trend wherein working executives find themselves in need of upgrading their skill sets to stay relevant in the business. With advances in technology, it's easy to find yourself falling behind. Hence, it is necessary to analyse your skills and areas that need development and then look for programs that match your skill needs.

Today, various business schools offer executive education alongside standard MBA, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and many of them are accredited by professional organisations. Most of the business schools across India offer a wide range of courses for executive students. They are designed to enable you to choose from options that best suit your requirements.

Professional development becomes necessary to familiarise with strategic thinking and making an effort to stand out. This is where executive education comes into play. In simple words, if your employer wants you to take on bigger responsibilities, they may sponsor you to take a course in management or leadership or even from other institutes offering the same. And these courses prepare you for a new role in a variety of competencies for a new role. But with the abundance of custom-designed executive education programme, the trick is in choosing the right option.

Achieving a higher level of executive education need not be an all-or-nothing scenario. Several top tier schools offer a range of options from online courses to open-enrollment classes. Understanding which format suits you the best is the key. Open enrollment programs bring leaders and professionals from different companies together to take classes and custom programs.

This helps the professionals to gain new perspectives on strategic problems such as changing dynamics, more demanding customers or new competitors. After short-listing of programs suitable for your role, it is a necessity to do thorough homework on program structure, background, school's pedagogical approach and classroom experience most resonate with you.

Finally, before choosing the right course, the student should check if the educational institute has a trusted legacy. Also, tie-ups with reputed organisations that provide cutting edge certification for enhanced skills, will lead to better employability. Executive education is a credential that is carried with you for the rest of your career and the program's reputation holds the key.

187,22-4-20,‘AI is changing edu gameplan’,"Artificial Intelligence is transforming every sector and education can’t be left untouched. By 2025, it will be the next big thing that will change how we learn, says SACHIN DEV DUGGAL

In recent years, technology has transformed the way we perceive the reality of our world. Be it connecting with people across the world on social media, shopping clothes from an online store or having groceries delivered without us having to step out of our homes, today, human survival sans technology is simply unimaginable.

Through the years, science fiction authors, futurists, and movie makers alike have also been predicting the amazing (and sometimes catastrophic) changes that will arise with the advent of widespread artificial intelligence (AI) perceived as the next step in human evolution. Those not entirely familiar with artificial intelligence may envision a future riddled with robots that behave like humans. However, in truth, AI is nothing but advanced algorithms assisting machines in imitating human behaviour, especially in redundant tasks across industries. With so broad an impact, education is sure to be touched by AI. The question is, how?

Capabilities matter

An incredible aspect and the most prominent part of what technology can provide us with, has made inroads into our lives and is transforming the way we have been executing the simplest of our tasks. Based on user history, experiences or current usage patterns displays, AI can fulfill a myriad of demands for multiple users. It rests heavily upon profound learning principles and natural language processing techniques, wherein, machines can read vast amounts of data and process it to produce appropriate output.

AI involves the sophisticated application of smart algorithms to provide results and even, the ability to read the user intention for future implementation. Some critical aspects of AI are expert systems, speech recognition, and machine vision, apart from deep learning and NLP. Resultantly, it has emerged as the most capable choice to automate several administrative tasks

Impact

AI is offering robust support for even deeper application in the education industry. It has the power to evolve the way education is being imparted. From classroom teaching and textbook-based syllabus along with the simple grading system, AI can overhaul the individual learning journeys and turn them more personalised, predictive, efficient and effective.

The penetration of AI will help in setting necessary expectations on teacher’s accountability in improving learners’ knowledge. It will suggest appropriate ways to gain knowledge depending upon students’ abilities and breaking away from the traditional teaching approach of one size fits all.

It will become larger than life by the year 2025, as its application in the learning and education sector will increase by around 47%. From efficient tutoring methodologies to turning teaching techniques highly impactful, efficient and goal-oriented, AI surely has a more prominent role to play.

Considering the global shift towards technological dependencies, newer challenges in learning and human limitations will further amplify the scope of AI throughout the world. Aritifical Intelligence will help bring the global education industry under a single umbrella for all learning needs.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---ai-is-changing-edu-gameplan---.html

190,22-4-20,Man Utd to beat Liverpool for Sancho’s signature: Redknapp,"Former Liverpool mid-fielder Jamie Redknapp fears arch-rivals Manchester United are set to beat his former club for the signing of Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho.

The 20-year-old Englishman is currently one of the most sought-after players in European football and Redknapp believes Sancho will end up in Premier League sooner than later with the Red Devils in pole position to snap the hot shot winger.

“I think it is a matter of time with Jadon Sancho coming to the Premier League. We are talking about a genuine superstar. A player that can do incredible things with the ball. Played 70 odd games in the Bundesliga, scored 27 goals from a wide area which is very good,” Redknapp told Sky Sports.

“We have missed out on the likes of the Neymars in the Premier League but he can come and really light it up. Personally I would call it. He will be a great signing for whoever he goes to.

Shah appreciated their good work and assured them full security, he said.

The home minister appealed to them to not do even a symbolic protest as the government is with the doctors, the official said.

There have been reports of doctors being abused, beaten and denied entry into residences.

Families of at least two doctors, who succumbed to the novel coronavirus in Shillong and Chennai, had faced opposition while performing their last rites as the locals claimed that burying them in their localities may lead to the spread of the infection.

197,22-4-20,AgustaWestland chopper case: SC dismisses interim bail plea of Christian Michel,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of Christian Michel James, an alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam cases, seeking interim bail on the grounds of risk of contracting coronavirus in Tihar jail.

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai, which took up the interim bail plea through video conferencing, said that as per the criteria fixed by high powered committee constituted by government in pursuance of directions of apex court, the petitioner (Michel) cannot be granted bail.

Advocate Aljo K Joseph, appearing for Michel, said that because of his vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail, he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health.

He submitted that Delhi High Court was wrong in dismissing his interim bail plea on the ground that his apprehensions are unfounded.

When contacted about the proceedings, Joseph said, The bench told me that as per the criteria fixed for release of prisoners in wake of coronavirus pandemic by the High Powered committee, the foreigners lodged in jails cannot be released.

The High Court on April 7 had dismissed his bail plea saying that the apprehension of Michel that because of his vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail, he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded.

It had said, As regards the apprehension of the petitioner (Michel) being infected by COVID-19 pandemic, it may be noted that the petitioner is lodged in a separate cell with only two other prisoners and thus, is not in a barrack or dormitory where there are a number of prisons. It is not the case of the petitioner that any of the two inmates residing with him are suffering from COVID-19.

""Hence, the apprehension of the petitioner also because of the vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail that he is likely to contact COVID-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded.

In his plea, the 59-year-old Michel has claimed that his health condition was critical and incompatible with the current prison status, especially to cope up with the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection which could have a lethal effect on him as he is already suffering from serious pathologies.

Michel, extradited from Dubai, was arrested by the ED on December 22, 2018.

On January 5 last year, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED case. He is also lodged in judicial custody in another case registered by the CBI in connection with the scam.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the case by the ED and the CBI. The other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.

On April 1, the apex court had asked Michel to first approach the high court with his plea.

198,22-4-20,Federer happy with surgery recovery,"Rafael Nadal on Monday expressed his frustration that tennis players remain unable to practise due to the coronavirus pandemic, while Roger Federer revealed he was happy with his recovery from knee surgery.

The Spanish government has extended the country’s state of alarm until May 9, with the entire population confined to their homes except a small number working in specific sectors, leaving Nadal perplexed as to why he can’t train.

“It’s true I don’t understand very well because we cannot play tennis when many people are going to work and even more so in our sport, where we keep at a large and safe distance and we play on opposite sides of the court,” world number two Nadal said during an Instagram Live.

Nadal treated tennis fans to an Instagram Live in which he spoke to both Roger Federer and Andy Murray about their experiences during lockdown.

“I am not playing tennis, I do not have a court at home and I miss it a little,” Nadal said.

“I am sticking to my physical routines. From the gym of my academy they were able to bring me some machines when lockdown began so I try to work a little in the morning, a little in the afternoon.

“It is very important to have both the head and the body focused and it is what I am trying to do at all times.”

Federer meanwhile gave an update on his right knee after the 20-time major winner decided to undergo surgery in February.

“I’ve been hitting a bit against a wall, (doing) rehab with the knee,” Federer said.

“It’s OK, I had a really good first six weeks, then it was a bit slower, now it’s getting better again but I have plenty of time.

“There is no stress, no rush. If there is anything positive (about being in lockdown) that’s the only thing really. I just want the knee to be good, it doesn’t matter when I return.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/federer-happy-with-surgery-recovery.html
199,22-4-20,Enjoyed how SA competed as a young bowling attack: Langeveldt,"South Africa bowling coach Charl Langeveldt believes there have been some decent players who have progressed through the ranks over the past season, highlighting the fact that talent was evident within the domestic structures.

The likes of Anrich Nortje and Janneman Malan enjoyed breakthrough performances during a challenging summer in which the national team went through a serious transition in the form of a new coaching set-up, as per a report on Cricket South Africa official website.

Graeme Smith, the recently appointed full-time Director of Cricket, brought in a new Team Director in Mark Boucher and a whole new coaching team back in December on the eve of their marquee tour against England.

“It’s been an interesting time coming back from Bangladesh,” he was quoted as saying by www.cricket.co.za.

“It’s always nice to coach your country. I think when it came to making the deal back then, Jacques Faul (Chief Executive Officer) and Graeme Smith were brilliant behind the scenes making it possible for the transfer to come through to South Africa. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) were also excellent and they were brilliant in releasing me.

“It was never going to easy. We (the new coaching staff) started with the Test series against England in December and we didn’t have enough time as a team to gel.

“England being England and having a settled team with guys who have played a lot more Test cricket together than us, we had a lot of youngsters coming into the team and into the set-up, that was really hard.

“The guys played well in patches but as a unit we just couldn’t get it together. We got better in the limited-overs tours. Lungi Ngidi was excellent, Temba (Bavuma) and Quinny (Quinton de Kock) were also good. Against Australia, Lungi again with the ball was fantastic and then Janneman was outstanding. Overall we were a lot better.”

Langeveldt was brought into the set-up from his position as Bangladesh bowling coach.

Despite opting to rest senior players in the white-ball contests, South Africa still managed to pull their weight and compete, something that former Proteas quick Langeveldt relished.

“I really enjoyed how we competed as a young bowling attack at an international level,” he beamed. Anrich, Lungi, (Lutho) Sipamla, (Tabraiz) Shamsi, they all stepped up very well.

“All-round everyone chipped in. Where we came from starting in December and where we ended up,I think CSA can be really proud of what they did on a domestic level to get these players through. That’s where these players come from and they showed a lot of maturity which is a big plus for us going forward.”

Langeveldt added that there is plenty more potential in the domestic cupboard, something the national coaching team were meant to explore during the final weeks of April.

However, with COVID-19 striking, that has been placed on hold. “We are looking around for the up and coming fast bowlers,” the coach added. “We were supposed to have a camp starting on April 19 for six days, but that had to be cancelled because of the virus, but we are definitely looking because you always have to have replacements. There have been a few names that have popped up, Lifa Ntanzi, Gerald Coetzee, there’s Glenton Stuurman, Stefan Tait and then obviously Lutho Sipamla, whose been brilliant in the national set-up.

“So there’s a few out there and these are the guys that will be the back-up for the national team and they are the ones we want to see.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/enjoyed-how-sa-competed-as-a-young-bowling-attack--langeveldt.html
200,22-4-20,I try to play like Sachin sir: Shaw,"Young India opener Prithvi Shaw on Tuesday said ‘idol’ Sachin Tendulkar has advised him to always play his natural game and stay calm off the field.

In an Instgram Live chat with his Indian Premier League franchise Delhi Capitals, the 20-year old who is the youngest Indian to score a Test century on debut, said: “He has had a big influence on me. I first met him when I was eight. He always tells me to play my natural game and according to the situation. Off the field also, he asked me to stay calm.”

Shaw, who was part of the two Tests in New Zealand recently where he opened the batting with Mayank Agarwal in the absence of Rohit Sharma, said Tendulkar had once asked him not to change his grip.

“I am bottom-hand player and Sachin sir had asked me not to change my grip. I was young and I used to change my grip as per coaches’ advice. But after Sachin sir told me, I did not change my grip.”

In September 2017, at 17, Shaw became the youngest player to score a century on Duleep Trophy debut, a record previously held by Tendulkar.

Commenting on the contsant comparison with the legend, Shaw said: “There is pressure when people compare me to him. But I take it as a challenge. I try to play like him. He is the God of cricket.”

Commenting on his experience of working with BCCI President Sourav Ganguly who was earlier mentor with DC, Shaw said: “There have been experiences to be honest and he helped a lot as he knew how to motivate youngsters in the team.

201,22-4-20,CA chief hints five match Test series against India,"Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts has expressed the board’s desire to host a five match Test series against India later this year. India’s tour of Australia currently consists of four Tests and three ODIs, however, Roberts has hinted that there could be an additional Test in the series when Virat Kohli and company reach their shores in November.

Terming their relationship with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as ‘strong’, Roberts said a five match Test series is a possibility but not a certainty at this stage.

“There’s no certainty about that (five match Test series) for the coming season, but what I can say is that the relationship between the BCCI and Cricket Australia is really strong,” Roberts told reporters on a video call.

“We’ve discussed a shared desire to evolve to five match Test series between Australia and India in the future.

“It’s something we’ve both committed to in principle in the future, the big question is whether or not we can bring that in before the next future tours cycle in 2023.

“We don’t know what prospect there is of that next season, but certainly with a changing landscape...we won’t rule out a possibility of that until we get closer to the time,” he added.

Roberts also revealed the board is looking at the prospect of hosting all the matches at a single venue in their bid to keep the players and staff safe amid coronavirus pandemic.

“We won’t rule anything out in terms of the Indian series. Along with the BCCI and Indian players, we want to stage a series that inspires the cricket world, whether or not there are people in the stands,” Roberts said.

“We need to face into all possibilities. Fortunately, we have a little bit of time to work out the scenarios,” he added.

Defends pay cut

Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts also defended the salary cuts of staff as he highlighted the precarious financial position the board is currently in due to the coronavirus pandemic.

With no cricket being played, Roberts stated pay cuts are necessary to keep CA financially stable.

“In pre-coronavirus world, we were already projecting that our cash and investments would reduce to about $40 million at the start of September this year,” Roberts told journalists.

“The unfortunate reality of that is that we’re estimating that we’ve taken a $20 million impact thus far. We have to anticipate that there will be more risks than that $20 million.

“If you contemplate the prospect of the international season, in particular, being affected, we have an issue of hundreds of millions of dollars on our hands,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ca-chief-hints-five-match-test-series-against-india-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ca-chief-hints-five-match-test-series-against-india.html
202,22-4-20,Shakib to auction 2019 WC bat to raise COVID-19 fund,"Star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has decided to auction the bat he used during the 2019 ODI World Cup to help raise money for the fight against deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Shakib, who is currently serving a two-year ban from all forms of cricket -- one of which is suspended -- for not reporting corrupt approaches, is the second Bangladeshi cricketer after wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim to auction a personal cricketing gear to raise money for the cause.

""I had said before that I want to put up a bat for auction. I have decided to auction the bat I used in the 2019 World Cup. It's a favourite bat of mine,"" Shakib said during a Facebook live session.

The 33-year-old all-rounder had a hugely successful World Cup in England last year, scoring 606 runs in eight matches at an average of 86.57, which included two centuries and five fifties.

Besides, he also picked up 11 wickets in the tournament and became the only cricketer to score 600 plus runs and scalp 10 wickets in a single edition of the World Cup.

""I had a good World cup with the bat and ball. There were some good performances especially with the bat. I had used a single bat throughout the World Cup and even used tapes on it to get through games,"" Shakib said.

""It's not that this bat has only been used at the World Cup. I have scored over 1500 runs with this bat and had used it prior to the tournament and after it as well.

""Although I like the bat a lot but I have decided to put it up for auction with the thought that maybe it can leave some contribution to forming a fund during the ongoing coronavirus crisis.""

The money raised from the auction will go to the Shakib Al Hasan foundation.

""This is a very special bat to me, but my people are even more special to me,"" Shakib said.

Simranjeet said the eight-time champions have got more time to analyse their game.

""It's disappointing that the Olympics have been postponed to next year. We have been in fantastic rhythm since last year and the team was building up well for the Olympics. But, the well-being of the people is more important than anything else and the best decision has been taken,"" he said.

""We should certainly utilise the next year to become an even better side. We will ensure that we work harder and produce great results on the field.""

Members of the Indian men's hockey team are stuck at the SAI centre in Bengaluru due to the nationwide lockdown, imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

""I miss home and it would have been great to stay with family during this time, but then I wouldn't have been able to use the facilities here,"" said Simranjeet.

""It surely is a tough time for all of us. We have to stay positive and hope that the situation resolves soon. I have been mostly watching a lot of videos from our previous matches.

""It has given me a chance to patiently go through the footage and note down key aspects that I need to work on, once we can get back on the pitch,"" said the 23-year-old forward from Punjab.

With outdoor training not possible during the lockdown, Simranjeet said his focus is on maintaining his fitness.

""It's wonderful to be staying at the SAI campus at the moment. We are given fitness schedules by our scientific advisor Robin Arkell and all of us carry out exercises in our rooms.

""Maintaining fitness is the key for any sportsperson and therefore we put a lot of emphasis on it,"" he said.

204,22-4-20,Dhoni is greatest in terms of record but Kumble is the best captain I have played under: Gambhir,"The numbers are heavily in favour of Mahendra Singh Dhoni but former India batsman Gautam Gambhir says spin legend Anil Kumble was the best India captain he has ever played under.

Gambhir has high regards for Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly as India skippers, but believes Kumble would have been phenomenal as captain had he led the national team for a longer period.

""From the records point of view it obviously has to be MS Dhoni. He has won every ICC trophy possible. He has done fabulously well, he has handled the pressure for a very long time. Sourav (Ganguly) has also done well.

""But one person I would definitely, would have liked to captain India for a long time should have been Anil Kumble. I played 6 Test matches under him and had he captained India for a long time would have broken many records,"" Gambhir said on Star Sports 'Cricket Connected' show on the occasion of IPL's 12th anniversary.

""From the records point of view Dhoni is right up there but for me the best captain I played under is Anil Kumble,"" Gambhit, who is now a BJP MP, added.

Kumble was appointed as India captain after Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the side in 14 Tests -- winning three, losing six and drawing five.

But his stint as captain lasted little less than a year as he retired in November 2008, following which Dhoni was appointed as the skipper in all three formats.

Gambhir also picked Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma as the all-time great IPL captain.

""I think it's Rohit Sharma . He has won the IPL four times and his captaincy is all about winning trophies,"" he said.

""He will end up being the most successful IPL captains of all-time as well, probably he will finish with 6 or 7 titles under his belt.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-is-greatest-in-terms-of-record-but-kumble-is-the-best-captain-i-have-played-under--gambhir-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-is-greatest-in-terms-of-record-but-kumble-is-the-best-captain-i-have-played-under--gambhir.html

In Phase 1, the health ministry with the support of all the other ministries has already undertaken several activities. Additional funds to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore is released under the package to states and UTs, for strengthening of existing health facilities as COVID Dedicated Hospitals, Dedicated COVID Health Centres and Dedicated COVID Care Centers. Detailed guidelines, protocols and advisory for quarantine, isolation, testing, treatment, disease containment, decontamination, social distancing and surveillance has already been made. Meanwhile, identification hotspots and appropriate containment strategies are also in full swing.

Talking about India's testing facilities, the government said, ""Diagnostics laboratories network has been expanded and our testing capacity is increasing everyday. In fact, leveraging on the existing multi-disease testing platforms under NationalAA TB Elimination Programme, orders for procurement of 13 lakhs diagnostic kits have been placed to augment COVID-19 testing.""

All health workers including Community Health Volunteers (ASHAs) have been covered with insurance. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), N95 masks and ventilators, testing kits and drugs for treatment are being procured centrally, said the government.

However, the major share of the expenditure will be used for mounting robust emergency response, strengthening National and State health systems followed by strengthening pandemic research and multi-sector national institutions and platforms. It will be done for community engagement and risk communications and implementation, management, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation components.

The cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also amended the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987 to ensure safety of India's medical fraternity with steep fines and making any attack on them a cognisable and non-bailable crime.

Residents of 115 houses in Pocket 1, schedule “A” area at the President’s Estate have been quarantined as a preventive measure after a sanitation worker’s relative tested positive for coronavirus.

A housekeeping worker in the Lok Sabha secretariat has also tested positive and was admitted to the Safdarjung hospital.

The Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday issued a statement saying no employee of the President’s House has been detected with Covid-19.

“It may be clarified that till date no employee of the President’s Secretariat has tested positive for Covid-19 and the secretariat along with the local administration is taking all the preventive measures under the guidelines,” it said.

A corona positive patient from central Delhi, who was neither an employee of the President’s secretariat nor a resident of the President’s Estate, died on April 13, 2020 with co-morbidities at the B L Kapoor Hospital in New Delhi, the statement said.

After contact tracing of the deceased, it was found that a family member of an employee of the President’s secretariat had been in contact with the deceased, the communique said. The employee along with the family are residents of Pocket 1, schedule A area of the President’s Estate.

As required under the guidelines, all the seven members of this family were moved to the quarantine facility at Mandir Marg on April 16, the statement said.

“Subsequently, one of the family members, who was in contact with the deceased tested positive and all other family members including the employee of the President’s secretariat have tested negative,” it said.

Following the instructions and guidelines of the authority designated under the Disaster Management Act 2005, read with Epidemic Diseases Act 1897, 115 houses in Pocket 1, schedule A area of the President’s Estate were identified for movement restriction and residents have been advised to remain indoors, the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.

“The residents of these houses are being provided doorstep delivery of essential commodities,” it added.

Delhi Heath Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday confirmed that one positive case of coronavirus has been reported from the premises of the President’s Estate. “

According to officials, the deceased is the mother of a sanitation worker employed in the Estate and of the person who has tested positive. “The mother used to live outside the President’s Estate. After she was tested positive, all her relatives were quarantined and their test was done. The test report came negative,” an official said.

However, after the death of the sanitation worker’s mother, initially around 25 families were under self-isolation. Now 115 families are observing self-isolation as a preventive measure, the official said.

Meanwhile, a housekeeper working with the Lok Sabha, who tested positive for coronavirus, has not attended office for the last few days. He had symptoms of fever, cough and breathing problems and was found to be corona positive, officials said.

Eleven members of his family have also been tested for the virus and the results are awaited. Local civic authorities have quarantined his house in central Delhi, officials added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-enters-prez-estate--lok-sabha-secretariat-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/virus-enters-prez-estate--lok-sabha-secretariat.html
207,22-4-20,Noida seals border with national Capital,"3 cops +ve, Delhi’s total reaches 2,081

Even as three more Delhi Police personnel were found Covid-19 positive on Tuesday, thus raising the total number of coronavirus cases in the national Capital to 2,081 on Tuesday, Gautam Budh Nagar District Magistrate ordered the sealing of Delhi-Noida border as a preventive measure to fight coronavirus.

The national Capital saw 78 fresh cases and two deaths on Tuesday, according to Delhi Government authorities.

The number of containment zones in Delhi increased to 84, with eight new ones being added, the authorities said. The West Delhi district has the highest number of containment zones in the city, they said.

Police said the cops were deployed at the Central district’s Nabi Karim police station. Earlier, eight policemen in the Chandni Mahal police station of the same district had tested positive for coronavirus. A total of 20 policemen have been tested positive for coronavirus till date across Delhi.

According to police, the three have been isolated and police personnel who came into their contact have been asked to stay in home quarantine.

Earlier, three Tablighi Jamaat congregation attendees had also tested positive in Nabi Karim.

The death toll from Covid-19 in Delhi stands at 47. Of the total fatalities reported till date, 25 victims were aged 60 and above, said Government authorities.

Twelve of them were in the age group of 50-59 and 10 were aged less than 50 years, officials said. By Sunday night, the number of cases of the deadly virus in the city stood at 2,003, including 45 deaths.

Sixty-two Covid-19 tests were conducted here on Monday using the newly acquired rapid anti-bodies diagnostic kits, and all samples came out negative, the officials said.

The city Government has acquired 42,000 such kits and after trial runs on Sunday, the first phase of test was conducted on Monday in a containment zone in Nabi Karim area in central Delhi.

“Sixty-two Covid-19 tests using rapid (anti-bodies) test kits were conducted on Tuesday in Nabi Karim area’s containment zone and all samples came out negative,” a senior official said.

The tests were being administered only in persons showing some sort of symptoms of the coronavirus infection, he said.

Two kinds of diagnostic tests are being prescribed in India -- the RT-PCR test and rapid anti-bodies test, as per global health norms.

A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is a laboratory technique, combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA that detects the virus, while the anti-bodies tests, which use blood, detect the body’s response to the virus.

House-to-house surveillance and sanitisation of areas under containment are being done regularly. Sample collection and testing is also under process. A total of 5,560 samples have been collected from the different containment zones, the Delhi Health Department said in a statement.

The department issued an age profile of 2,069 of the total confirmed cases reported in the city. Of these, 1,335 are aged below 50 years, 334 are in the age group of 50-59 and the remaining 400 are aged 60 years and above.

According to the Health Department, at least 625 coronavirus patients are admitted to various hospitals like LNJP Hospital, GTB Hospital, RML Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality

Hospital (RGSSH) and AIIMS Jhajjhar. It said 26 of them are in ICU and six on ventilator support.

The total number of samples sent for testing till date stands at 25,900, the Health Department said. As many as 32,192 people, who came in contact with affected persons, are under home-quarantine and 20,041 have completed their 14-day quarantine, the officials said.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told reporters that asymptomatic patients who have tested positive for coronavirus infection in Delhi will be kept in Covid care centres. As many as 840 people are lodged at various Covid care centres in the national Capital as of now. These centres are meant for cases that have been clinically assigned as mild or very mild or as suspect cases.

“An order has been issued to medical directors, medical superintendents of all Delhi Government hospitals to create a media cell, to monitor social media, news media in order to present a correct position before the people,” the Health Department said in a statement.

An advisory has been issued to incorporate the services of AYUSH doctors as well as the modalities of AYUSH system for the prevention and health promotion during the Covid pandemic, it added.

Lt Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal also reviewed the situation in Delhi during the day.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/noida-seals-border-with-national-capital-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/noida-seals-border-with-national-capital.html
208,22-4-20,WHO: Hasty end of curbs could cause resurgence,"The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that rushing to ease coronavirus restrictions will likely lead to a resurgence of the illness, a warning that comes as Governments across the world started rolling out plans to get their economies up and running again.

“This is not the time to be lax. Instead, we need to ready ourselves for a new way of living for the foreseeable future,” said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific.

He said Governments must remain vigilant to stop the spread of the virus and the lifting of lockdown curbs and other social distancing measures must be done gradually and strike the right balance between keeping people healthy and allowing economies to function.

Despite concerns from health officials, some US States on Monday announced aggressive reopening plans, while Boeing and at least one other US heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production.

Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain and Germany.

Australia said Tuesday that it will allow the resumption of non-urgent surgeries from next week as health authorities grow more confident that hospitals there won’t be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.

The reopenings come as politicians grow weary of soaring unemployment numbers and the prospect of economic depression. Asian shares followed Wall Street lower on Tuesday after US oil futures plunged below zero because of a worldwide glut as factories, automobiles and airplanes sit idled.

The cost to have a barrel of US crude delivered in May plummeted to negative USD 37.63 as traders run out of places to store it. It was at roughly USD 60 at the start of the year.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/who--hasty-end-of-curbs-could-cause-resurgence.html

City Superintendent of Police Brijesh Kumar Shrivastava said Prof Mohammed Shahid was arrested on charges of arranging the shelter for Indonesians among the foreigner Tablighi Jamaat members in a mosque and not informing police about them.

One of the Indonesians had earlier tested positive for coronavirus and had undergone treatment for it at Kotwa Bani in Allahabad, he said.

Shrivastava said other arrested included nine Thailand nationals, one each from Kerala and Bengal besides eleven linked with Abdullah and Hera mosques in the city.

While the professor has been remanded to judicial custody after the arrest, others have been kept in isolation, the SP said, adding those arrested have been booked on charges of violating the Foreigners Act and colluding with each other for providing shelter to foreigners and shielding information about them from the police.

211,22-4-20,Trump halts immigration,"US President Donald Trump said that he will sign an executive order “to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States” because of the coronavirus.

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump tweeted late Monday.

He did not offer specifics, such as the time frame or the scope of who would be affected. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement on Tuesday echoing Trump’s past comments about immigration. She provided no details on what the executive order would entail. “At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work, action is necessary,” she said.

National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien earlier on Tuesday cast the President’s announcement as a move to protect the American people’s health. O’Brien said the temporary immigration halt would not be “dissimilar” to limits on travel to the US from China that Trump put in place in January.

“We’re trying to do everything, the President’s trying to do everything he can to put the health of the American people first during this crisis,” O’Brien said on Fox News Channel. “So this is one step. It’s not dissimilar to the restrictions on travel from China that he implemented back on Jan. 29 at the very outset of this public health crisis.”

O’Brien said the administration believes those travel restrictions saved lives.

Asked about Trump’s reference to jobs, O’Brien referenced the virus’ economic toll and said “the president’s looking out for Americans on both fronts at every turn.”

Trump has taken credit for his restrictions on travel to the U.S. from China and hard-hit European countries, arguing the restrictions contributed to slowing the spread of the virus in the U.S. But he has not extended those restrictions to other nations now experiencing virus outbreaks.

Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.

Almost 800,000 Americans have come down with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and more than 42,000 have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump-halts-immigration.html

As of now, 32 districts of the total 75 are free from coronavirus, the CM was told.

Adityanath, however, directed officials to remain extra vigilant and reiterated the need to test all those involved in the supply of essentials.

Aligarh, Saharanpur and Moradabad districts are sensitive and so testing labs should be set up there, he said.

The CM also directed to seal the private hospitals that do not follow safety norms and guidelines.

217,22-4-20,Chinese rapid test kits ‘fail’! ICMR to vet,"States asked to stop using testing kits for 2 days amid inaccurate results in 4 States

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday asked the States to stop using the newly-distributed Chinese rapid testing kits (RT-PCR) meant to detect coronavirus for the next two days amid reports of inaccurate results from Rajasthan and three other States.

India procured five lakh rapid antibody testing kits from two Chinese firms last week and these were distributed to States for the districts with a high burden of the infection. As per the ICMR, variation in accuracy of results ranges from 6-71 per cent. It will be sending expert teams on fields to test the new RT-PCR kits.

“We received a complaint of less detection from one State. So we spoke to three States and found a lot of variation is there in the accuracy of test results of positive samples, in some places it is 6 per cent while others it is 71 per cent,

“We have decided to launch field studies for validation into the quality of rapid test kits. We will convey our guidance to States in two days. Until then States are advised not to use rapid kits,” head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR Raman R Gangakhedkar said at a Press briefing here.

Replying to a query he said if the kits are found faulty, replacement process would be initiated.

“This is not a good thing because when such a huge variation is seen we need to investigate further even if it is the first generation of the test. This disease is only 3.5-month-old so all technologies will be refined over time but we can’t ignore these findings,” he added.

He added that over the next two days the ICMR will be sending eight expert teams on the field to validate the results.

The ICMR also said it will raise an issue with the manufacturer of the kits if results continue to be faulty.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Rajasthan Government stopped using the China-made rapid testing kits for coronavirus after they delivered inaccurate results.

The Union Health Ministry said 705 people had been cured between Monday and Tuesday — the highest single-day rise in cured cases.

Additionally, there are now four previously affected districts that have not reported any case for 28 days, said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry.

These are Mahe in Puducherry, Kodagu in Karnataka, Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand and Pratapgarh in Rajasthan.

Also, 61 districts nationally have not reported a new case for 14 days.

The official also said that, “We have issued detailed guidelines to all States that while we focus on Covid19, all other services need to be provided, be it for dialysis, HIV/cancer treatments etc. At the same time required infection management prevention should be in place.”

The kits are to be used to test people with fever, cough, and shortness of breath in 325 districts that are currently unaffected, starting with those that are in States with a high number of Covid-19 cases, explained the official, who asked not to be named. This will be the first mass testing exercise in these districts.

Rajasthan State Health Minister Raghu Sharma said, “After the test sample results, there is a question mark over the rapid test kits. We used it in the State as per ICMR guidelines but this experiment failed completely. We were hoping that the accuracy of the test will be more than 90 per cent but it was just 5 per cent. We have sent the report of the results to the ICMR. If the ICMR doesn’t provide any satisfactory response, we may send all these kits back,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chinese-rapid-test-kits----fail-----icmr-to-vet-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/chinese-rapid-test-kits----fail-----icmr-to-vet.html
218,22-4-20,population ratio lowest among top 20,"As early as mid-March, World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said, “We have a simple message to all countries — test, test, test,” but India is yet to follow the advice.

An analysis of the global data shows that India has one of the lowest Covid-19 testing ratios compared to other first 20 worst-affected countries, suggesting that infection containment measures may not be adequate because of this.

India has conducted only 291 tests per million population as of April 21, compared to 12,186 in the US, 23,122 in Italy, 14,682 in Russia and 20,629 tests per million population in Germany.

In just a week, alarmingly, India has also climbed three spots up to 17th position among the 20 Covid-19 worst-hit countries, according to the data available from the Worldometer.

Experts said testing more people will only help early detection and hence early treatment. More so when the asymptomatic persons are also found to be the carrier of virus that has claimed over 600 people and infected over 18,000 people.

Worldwide, 2,505,433 have come in the grip of the Covid-19 while 171,851 people have succumbed to the contagion.

Radha Rangarajan, Chief Scientific Officer, HealthCubed, called for more Covid-19 testing.

“So far, testing has been greatly restricted but as we emerge from the lockdown, there will be an increased need to test more and more people. It is amply clear that the current test — RT-PCR — will not scale for India’s needs, given the complexity of this test, need for sophisticated equipment and poor availability of kits. Hence, we need to rethink the testing strategy,” it said.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday has already put on hold the much-touted Chinese made rapid test kits after they were found to give inaccurate results as complained by States like Rajasthan, one of the worst-hit by the Covid-19.

States too feel that more tests will help them to manage the virus better. Steps like lockdown are just being seen as short-term measures.

Besides “public health testing”, India must ramp up “healthcare testing” to prevent hospitals from becoming Covid-19 hotspots, suggest experts.

Dr T Jacob John, former head, ICMR in Virology, said, “India needs more Covid-19 testing. Our population-based testing average is one of the lowest among affected countries. It has been argued that we have the slowest increase in the number of positive Covid-19 cases. But the problem is that if you test less, you will detect less.

“The strike rate in India is one positive among 24 tested, whereas in other countries the rate is higher - such as one Covid positive per 12 or even 10 tests. This means that our strategy must be fine-tuned to look at areas where the detection rate is better.”

As we detect more and more positive Covid-19 cases, we will know that transmission is slipping through the public health testing net; hence we must ramp up “healthcare testing” and prevent transmission among healthcare personnel and their contacts, he said.

Testing still needs to be an essential part of India’s Covid-19 control strategy and expanded rapidly, or infections will be missed, said Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute in Faridabad.

220,22-4-20,Trump indicates 60-day immigration ban may not apply to H1-B,"US President Donald Trump has said that his immigration ban will be for only 60 days and indicated that workers on temporary visas like H1-B for professionals could continue to come in.

""This order will apply only to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving green cards; big factor, will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis,"" Trump said on Tuesday while clarifying that it is for only 60 days.

He said that there would also be some exemptions to the temporary ban on immigrants.

""Some people will have to come in; obviously we have to do that, obviously even from a humane standpoint,"" he said.

Trump had tweeted the immigration ban on Monday night. He said that the executive order was being drafted and will probably be issued on Wednesday.

Trump said that after 60 days he and a group will evaluate the need for any extension or modification ""based on economic conditions at that time.""

An immigration lawyer, Mark Davies, said that based upon the president's comments H1-B visas for professionals, and temporary visas known as E-2 for a category of investors and L-1 visas for employees of foreign companies transferred to work in the US are not affected. But he added, ""This may change as more information emerges.""

These categories of visas are temporary and do not of themselves confer permanent residence or path to citizenship.

But Davies said that the immigration ban would affect another category of visas for investors known as EB-5 because it ""is a fast route to a Green Card for families and individuals able to invest $900,000.""

Trump said that he was solely motivated by the plight of American workers rendered jobless by the COVID-19 epidemic.

He said, ""By pausing immigration we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America re-opens -- so important. Would wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced by new immigrant about flown in from abroad.""

Another reason he said was to help ""conserve vital medical resources for American citizens"" and ""protect the solvency of our health care system.""

Although he denied a reporter's suggestion that he was using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to push his agenda of limiting immigration, that appeared to be what the ban was set to accomplish to a degree.

Trump has said that he wanted to end the immigration of extended family members and has imposed a requirement for immigrants to get health insurance and prove that they won't utilise public benefits.

Many of those in the pipeline to receive green cards, especially Indians, are already legally in the US on other visas waiting their turn.

So the ban will have a greater impact on potential immigrants in categories like relatives of citizens, especially if exemptions are carved out for those coming in on the basis of some employment categories. His mention of conserving health resources is in line with the earlier mandate he had issued for immigrants to have health insurance.

He has said that he wanted to change the existing immigration system to give preference based on merit to immigrants coming for jobs at the expense of other categories like relatives, which he wants to end.

While he said that he was suspending immigration in order to protect American workers, the ban does not extend to non-immigrant workers who would be taking up jobs.

He specifically said that the tens of thousands of agricultural workers who are the backbone of US farming will continue to be allowed to come in.

There is a category of visas known as H2-A to enable workers to come in every year for agricultural and similar work which Americans won't take up in sufficient numbers.

""If anything we are going to make it easier and we are doing a process that will make it better for those worker to come into the farm,"" Trump said.

Especially at this time there is a demand for healthcare workers and Ian Brownlee, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, has said that where routine visa services were suspended visas would be processed for medical personnel already accepted in US programmes.

The immigration ban appears to be more of a sop to a section of Trump's base rather than making a big material difference in terms of limiting workers coming in as Democrat Representative Don Beyer pointed out in a tweet: ""Immigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more (coronavirus) cases than any other country.""

While workers on non-immigrant visas can in theory come in, in reality there is a ban on travellers from 28 European countries, China and Iran, and air services have been severely curtailed from most parts of the world under a clampdown.

At the same time, farm workers would be allowed in through Mexico.

The US diplomatic missions in several countries have stopped holding immigrant visa interviews, although according to the New Delhi embassy website it appeared that interviews were continuing while for some categories it was done only at the Mumbai consulate.

The immigration service has also temporarily stopped immigration interviews within the US because of the social distancing rules.

Trump had already barred asylum-seekers from coming through the Mexican border and the immigration authorities have been returning to Mexico anyone caught crossing over illegally.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-indicates-60-day-immigration-ban-may-not-apply-to-h1-b-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/trump-indicates-60-day-immigration-ban-may-not-apply-to-h1-b.html
221,22-4-20,Iran's Guard says it launched satellite amid US tensions,"Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard on Wednesday said it launched a military satellite into orbit amid wider tensions with the US, a successful launch after months of failures.

There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch of the satellite, which the Guard called ""Noor"", or light.

The Guard on its official said the satellite successfully reached an orbit of 425 kilometers (264 miles) above the Earth's surface.

The two-stage satellite launch took off from Iran's Central Desert, the Guard said, without elaborating.

The launch comes amid tensions between Tehran and Washington over its collapsing nuclear deal and after a US drone strike killed Guard General Qassem Soleimani in January.

225,22-4-20,"WHO, Wuhan Institute data hacked","The digital data of World Health Organization, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Gates Foundation and other institutes working on the novel coronavirus pandemic have been hacked, with thousands of their emails, passwords and documents getting leaked online.

According to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terror groups online, hackers shared around 25,000 email addresses and their passwords of the groups which are at the forefront of the war against the global pandemic.

Many screenshots of the documents, emails and their passwords were posted on Twitter too. The data was leaked on Sunday and Monday.

The Maryland-based SITE said the National Institute of Health (NIH) was the biggest victim of hacking with 9,938 emails and passwords posted online. As many as 6,857 emails and passwords of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5,120 of the World Bank and 2,732 of WHO were also leaked.

The Gates Foundation, the private philanthropic group of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan city in China from where the novel coronavirus pandemic originated, were also targeted by the hackers.

However, the SITE was unable to verify whether the email addresses and passwords were authentic. An Australian cybersecurity expert, Robert Potter, claimed that he was able to verify if the WHO email addresses and passwords were real.

Rita Katz, SITE's Executive Director, said, ""Neo-Nazis and white supremacists capitalised on the lists and published them aggressively across their venues.""

226,22-4-20,War of words intensifies over Central team in West Bengal,"Monday’s war of words between Delhi and Kolkata — after the former ‘unilaterally’ dispatched an inter-ministerial Central team to inspect the alleged dilution of lockdown protocols in Bengal — intensified on Tuesday followed by a drama on the streets that ended in an uneasy truce by the late noon.

The Centre on Tuesday issued directions to West Bengal Chief Secretary to co-operate and provide logistical assistance to the two teams dispatched to Kolkata and Jalpaiguri for the spot assessment of Covid-19 pandemic situation and monitor implementation of lockdown norms in the State.

On Monday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee protested to the PM that Home Minister Amit Shah only informed her about the Centre’s inter-ministerial teams appointment only after their arrival in Kolkata.

Earlier, the Central teams reported to the MHA that State administration was not co-operating and even not allowing to interact with the State health administration and not providing logistical supports.

After receiving the complaints from the two teams, Union Home Secretary AK Bhalla wrote to the Chief Secretary expressing displeasure pointing out the State is violating the provisions of Disaster Management Act and recent observations of Supreme Court.

“The Union Government has directed the Government of West Bengal not to obstruct working of Central teams regarding review and on-spot assessment of implementation of lockdown measures to fight Covid-19 in the State. It had been brought to the notice of the MHA that both the inter-ministerial Central teams (IMCTs), at Kolkata and Jalpaiguri respectively, have not been provided with the requisite co-operation by the State and local authorities. It was informed that they have been specifically restrained from making any visits, interacting with health professionals, and assessing the ground level situation. This amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the Central Government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Supreme Court of India,” said the Centre in a statement.

Even as words reached Delhi, Chief Secretary Sinha came down to the BSF guest house where an hour-long meeting was held between the two sides. Subsequently the IMCT agreed to tour the affected areas with police escorts, sources said.

“They have been given police escorts and our officers to visit the areas in Kolkata,” the Chief Secretary later said. When asked as to whether the team would also visit Howrah and other red zones like North and South 24 Parganas, he said “let them first ask for permission and then we will take a decision in that regard.”

Close on the heels of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee shooting off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that protested Delhi’s “unilateral” observations on the status of war against coronavirus in Bengal, senior Trinamool Congress leaders Derek O’ Brien and Sudip Bandopadhyay lashed out on the Centre for sending teams on “adventure tour” to the State.

The TMC leaders’ statements came in tandem with reports that the Central team had been stopped by the Kolkata Police from moving around in Kolkata.

O’Brien said, “The IMCT team is on an adventure tour,” complaining how the Chief Minister was informed about its visit three hours after it landed.

“Why such teams haven’t been sent to States like Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, with higher number of coronavirus cases and many more hotspots,” he asked pointing out the fallacy of bracketing districts like Kalimpong, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri where the instances of corona infections were few and far between.

“The last Covid-19 positive case reported in Kalimpong was on April 2, in Jalpaiguri on April 4 and Darjeeling on April 16. Why have these districts been selectively chosen? What are the criteria?” he asked.

Incidentally the Chief Minister too in her resentful letter to the Prime Minister referring to the above stated districts wrote: “It shows that selection of districts and observations made unilaterally are nothing but a figment of imagination and unfortunate.

“The State Government is proactively enforcing the lockdown measures as notified by the Government of India and is maintaining a closed liaison with concerned Central Ministries,” saying, “I am sure that you will kindly agree that such unilateral action on the part of Central Government is not desirable at all, especially in the backdrop when both Central and State Governments are working together relentlessly to contain the Covid-19 crisis.”

Elsewhere the Chief Minister personally hit the streets on Tuesday touring some specific areas from where complaints of defiance had been coming for the past several days, sources said.

The Chief Minister was seen going about to Raja Bazar, Park Circus, Topsia etc with a mike in hand announcing the importance of lockdown and social distancing. “This is not an order by the State Government. This order has come from the Centre … you must keep indoors and maintain social distance to remain safe,” she said.

Meanwhile, Bengal reported 29 new corona cases spreading across the Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas, Nadia and Hooghly, taking the total number of infected cases to 274.

The new cases included medical staff of Calcutta Medical College.

The State also recorded 3 more deaths taking to the total number of corona victims to 15, he said adding the State had already increased its number of testing with 713 tests being conducted on Tuesday. “The total number of tests conducted in Bengal till now is 6,182,” he said adding 5,016 people have been kept in Government quarantine whereas 33,305 people have been sent to home quarantine.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/war-of-words-intensifies-over-central-team-in-west-bengal-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/war-of-words-intensifies-over-central-team-in-west-bengal.html
227,22-4-20,"'Venom 2' gets official title, new release date","The sequel to Tom Hardy-starrer ""Venom"", has been titled ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"".

Hardy will be back as journalist Eddie Brock, who unites with an alien symbiote to form Venom.

Actor-director Andy Serkis is aboard the much-awaited project as the director, taking over from Ruben Fleischer who helmed the first part.

The studio, Sony Pictures, also gave a new release date to the film. It will now bow out in the US on June 25, 2021, instead of its earlier date of October 1, 2021.

The shift in release date comes a day after Warner Bros decided to postpone Matt Reeves' ""The Batman"" to October 1, 2021 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The film's title makes it official that Woody Harrelson's Cletus Kasady aka Carnage, who made a last-minute cameo in ""Venom"", will be the main villain in the sequel.

""Venom"" was a global hit for Sony when it released in 2018. Despite the mixed reviews it received, the film made a splash at the box office, earning over USD 850 million in worldwide gross.

The film also featured Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed in pivotal characters.

228,22-4-20,Hydroxychloroquine shows no benefit in COVID-19 patients: Study,"Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug termed potential ""game changer"" for COVID-19 by US President Donald Trump, showed no benefit in treating patients with the disease in Veterans Health Administration medical centres in the US, says a study.

In fact, the risk of death was found to be higher in those treated with hydroxychloroquine than in the group that included patients not treated with the drug, according to the findings published in the preprint repository medRxiv.

For the study, the researchers performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalised with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection in all US Veterans Health Administration medical centres until April 11.

Patients were categorised based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with the antibiotic azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19.

A total of 368 patients were evaluated. Rates of death in the hydroxychloroquine alone group was 27.8 per cent.

The rate of death in the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin group was 22.1 per cent and in the no hydroxychloroquine, it was even lower, 11.4 per cent, the results showed.

The researchers found that the risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group and in the HC+AZ group, compared to the no HC group.

""In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalised with Covid-19,"" said the study carried out by Joseph Magagnoli from Dorn Research Institute, Columbia VA Health Care System and colleagues.

""An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs,"" the researchers concluded.

Despite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19, the US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible.

Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence in several countries.

229,22-4-20,"Netflix adds 15.8mn new subscribers, posts $5.7bn in revenue","Video streaming giant Netflix has added 15.8 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020 which is a growth of 22 per cent (year-over-year), registering quarterly revenue of $5.77 billion.

Netflix now has over 182 million subscribers worldwide.

The positive results, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuating US dollar, saw Netflix stock up 3.3 per cent in early after-hours trading.

""In our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end. What's clear is the escalating human cost in terms of lost lives and lost jobs, with tens of millions of people now out of work,"" the company said in its letter to the shareholders after announcing the quarter results late Tuesday.

""At Netflix, we're acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term,"" the letter added.

Like other home entertainment services, Netflix is seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth.

""In our case, this is offset by a sharply stronger US dollar, depressing our international revenue, resulting in revenue-as-forecast,"" said Netflix.

""While our productions are largely paused around the world, we benefit from a large pipeline of content that was either complete and ready for launch or in post-production when filming stopped,"" the letter further said.

""So, while we're certainly impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021.""

Netflix acknowledged that there are three primary effects on its financial performance from the crisis.

""First, our membership growth has temporarily accelerated due to home confinement.

""Second, our international revenue will be less than previously forecast due to the dollar rising sharply. Third, due to the production shutdown, some cash spending on content will be delayed, improving our free cash flow, and some title releases will be delayed, typically by a quarter,' it elaborated.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/netflix-adds-15-8mn-new-subscribers--posts--5-7bn-in-revenue-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/netflix-adds-15-8mn-new-subscribers--posts--5-7bn-in-revenue.html
230,22-4-20,US will have second wave of coronavirus: health official,"A second wave of the novel coronavirus will hit the US later this year with even more difficult ramifications than the current COVID-19 crisis that has claimed more than 45,000 lives and infected over 824,000 people in the country, a top American health official has warned.

Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told The Washington Post that the US will have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.

If the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak and the flu season had peaked at the same time, it could have been ""really, really difficult in terms of health capacity,"" he said.

Luckily, the arrival of the novel coronavirus in the United States came as the regular flu season was waning, he said.

""There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,"" Redfield told the daily.

""We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,"" he said, adding that having two simultaneous respiratory outbreaks would put unimaginable strain on the health-care system.

The White House emphasised on continuing with preventive measures to fight the coronavirus and increased testing.

""We were very clear in the guidelines that we believe we can monitor, again, monitor communities at the community level by using the influenza-like illness and the syndromic respiratory and gastrointestinal temp components of this particular virus,"" Dr Deborah Brix, member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus told reporters when asked about the second wave.

""Obviously, when we have flu, and were working on an algorithm that you test for flu and then you test for COVID-19 and making sure that we are building the testing capacity to be able to do that because I think it's very important that you're going to be able - on the surface, a patient, when they come in with early flu and early COVID-19 can look very close to identical,"" she said.

There is need to have testing in place to be able to separate and ensure those patients receive the best treatment, Brix said.

""We are also hoping by that time we have additional treatment options for people with COVID-19 so that there will be additional treatment available in the fall,"" she said.

Responding to a question, Brix said that the situation could be pretty bad if the second wave of coronavirus hits the country in the winter.

""When you see what has happened in New York, that was very bad. I believe that we'll have early warning signals both from our surveillance that we been talking about in these on the vulnerable populations,"" she said.

""We're going to continue that surveillance from now all the way through the fall to be able to give us that early warning signal. I think what we've learned is how good Americans are about immediately reverting to all of those issues that they need to do in order to ensure that they are protected and their families,"" Brix said.

231,22-4-20,Trump threatens to terminate trade deal if China does not honour it citing coronavirus crisis,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to terminate the trade deal with China if Beijing did not honour its provisions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the country.

While China has reported 82,788 novel coronavirus cases, including 4,632 fatalities, the US registered over 824,600 cases and more than 45,290 deaths -- the highest in the world.

China and the US in January signed Phase-1 of the trade deal as the world's two top economic powers move forward to end their bitter tit-for-tat two-year tariff war that had rattled markets and weighed on the global economy.

The deal, which calls on China to buy USD 200 billion worth of US products, is set to move ahead as planned. However, the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in a report said China could invoke a clause in the agreement that allows for fresh trade consultations between the two countries ""in the event of a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event"".

""If that happens, we'll do a termination and we'll do what I can do better than anybody,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday during his daily White House press conference on coronavirus.

The president was responding to a question as to how confident he is that the Chinese are not going to invoke the natural disaster clause mentioned in the trade deal.

""There is nobody ever been tougher on China than me,"" Trump said, reiterating that China had been ripping the US off for years till he was elected as the president.

""Take a look, USD 200 billion, USD 300 billion, USD 400 billion, USD 500 billion a year. How did they ever let a thing like this happen? Now, if you look at this last year, the deficit went way down to the world,"" he said.

Trump launched the trade war with China in 2018, demanding Beijing to reduce the massive trade deficit, which was USD 375.6 billion in 2017.

The two countries so far have imposed additional tariffs on nearly USD half trillion worth of goods. The US has imposed tariffs on more than USD 360 billions of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on over USD 110 billions of American products.

""Now it's much different. But a lot of things are happening. Great things were happening except all of these sudden out of nowhere came the invisible enemy. We think we know where it came from, and we'll be talking about that probably a lot, but came the invisible enemy. There's nobody tougher than me on China,"" Trump said.

233,22-4-20,Trump suspends issuing of new Green Cards for 60 days,"President Donald Trump has said that he will halt the issuing of the new green cards or legal permanent residency for the next 60 days as part of his executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the US.

Trump, however, said on Tuesday that the move will not have any impact on those entering the country on a temporary basis.

As per the existing law, the US can issue a maximum of 1,40,000 employment-based green cards every year with a per country cap of seven per cent.

Accordingly, in fiscal year 2019, Indian nationals received 9,008 category 1 (EB1), 2,908 category 2 (EB2), and 5,083 category 3 (EB3) green cards. EB1-3 are different categories of employment-based green cards.

Many have interpreted that those on non-immigrant work visas like the much sought-after H-1B, popular among Indian professionals, issued mainly to foreign technology professionals will not be impacted. The seasonal immigrant workers for agricultural purposes too will not be impacted.

In any case, the executive order to be signed by Trump on Wednesday will impact a large number of tens and thousands of Indian-Americans, who are waiting to get a Green Card. This is expected to further delay the process.

""We must first take care of the American worker... This pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people based on economic conditions at the time,"" Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.

""This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving green cards, big factor, will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis,"" he asserted.

Without elaborating, he said, that there will be exemptions.

""Some people will be able to get in. We have to do that, obviously, even from a humane standpoint,"" he said.

""We have a solemn duty to ensure these unemployed Americans regain their jobs and their livelihoods. Therefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States.

""You heard about that last night. By pausing immigration, we'll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens,"" he said.

It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad, he asserted.

Trump said, moving forward, his administration will examine what additional immigration related measures should be put in place to protect US workers.

""We want to protect our US workers, and I think as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them,"" he said, indicating that more such measures were being prepared.

As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 22 million American workers have applied for unemployment benefits, which is a record in itself.

In the coming weeks, several more millions are expected to be laid off as the US economy is in tatters.

Trump said that this pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources for American citizens.

""A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we're talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans,"" he said.

Responding to questions, Trump explained that he has to take this unprecedented measure because of the massive impact that coronavirus is having on the US economy.

""The last thing we want to do is take American workers' jobs. It's one thing when we were at essentially--they used to call it full employment and it's another thing right now, he said.

""Right now, we have people that have lost their jobs and we hope they're going to come back and come back fast and then we can have an even deeper discussion. But right now, we have to have jobs for Americans, he asserted.

According to a recent report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), currently there are almost 1 million lawfully present foreign workers and their family members waiting to receive a green card.

This employment-based backlog is projected to double by financial year 2030.

""Under current law, and owing to a limited number of green card issuances, the current backlog of 568,414 Indian nationals would require an estimated 195 years to disappear, CRS said.

234,22-4-20,China steps-up testing at borders as imported coronavirus cases cross 1600,"China has reported 30 new COVID-19 cases, a majority of them are the Chinese returning from abroad, taking the number of imported infections in the country to 1,610, the health officials said on Wednesday, as the authorities stepped-up the testing and treatment facilities in all border regions.

The death toll due to the novel coronavirus remains 4,632 with no new fatalities were reported on Tuesday, while the overall confirmed cases climbed to 82,788, of which 1,005 patients are still being treated and 77,151 have been discharged, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said.

China's imported cases have risen to 1,610 with 30 new cases, including 23 imported infections. Of the total imported cases, 811 people are being treated with 41 in severe conditions, it said.

A total of 42 new asymptomatic cases, including seven from abroad, were reported on Tuesday, taking the total to 991 asymptomatic cases. All of them were under medical observation, the NHC said in a report.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

By Tuesday, 1,029 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in the Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao SAR and 425 in Taiwan including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China has scaled-up testing and treatment for COVID-19 infections in border areas as the country faces a rising risk of imported cases.

With an over 22,000-km land border dotted with 91 land ports, along with a large number of shortcuts and side routes, China faces a high risk of coronavirus importation via its land border, Xinhua report said.

However, the medical service capacity in some border regions is relatively insufficient for the epidemic response, Guo Yanhong, an official with the NHC told media on Tuesday.

The NHC has instructed the country's nine provincial-level regions with land ports to make targeted response plans in a bid to intensify containment efforts and get prepared for imported cases, Guo noted.

Describing the epidemic control in border areas as a priority in the current stage, Guo said that the commission had conducted a thorough assessment of the capacity for laboratory testing and medical treatment in border cities.

Groups of medical professionals and epidemic containment experts have been dispatched to some border areas facing a mounting challenge of imported cases, such as Suifenhe, a border city in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.

Meanwhile, the essential medical equipment, including mobile P3 laboratories, computerized tomography (CT) scan machines, have also been sent there to improve the local ability to detect and cure COVID-19 infections, Guo said.

235,22-4-20,'Office Office' will stay relevant for years to come: Pankaj Kapur,"Pankaj Kapur says his show Office Office , a satirical look at the corruption in government offices, will stay evergreen as the issues it addressed still exist everywhere.

Kapur played common man Mussaddi Lal Tripathi in the show that aired in 2001 and was lauded for its projection of people's woes in government offices.

It is now among the classic shows that have made a comeback on television, which is falling back on older hits to fill the spot as shooting stays suspended on new ones due to the coronavirus led lockdown in the country.

Kapur said ""Office Office"" was one of his most popular shows and he is glad to see it return on TV.

It is delightful that one of your shows that was extremely popular and did very well with the audiences by creating social awareness through humour, is back on television. Whatever entertainment it can provide to people in such times, I think that's wonderful, Kapur told PTI in an interview.

For Kapur, the show is special because of its theme and the experience he had while working on it.

It has always had a soft spot in my heart because we had wonderful time working for about four and four-and-half years on this project. The show created social awareness with humour, which is its asset. It'll stay evergreen for years to come because the problems that it talked about are there everywhere. We can talk about it for years.""

Kapur was supported by strong actors such as Sanjay Mishra, Deven Bhojani, Manoj Pahwa, Hemant Pandey, Asawari Joshi and Eva Grover on the show, people who became family for those years.

The 65-year-old actor said every day was special while working on the show.

The fact that we had an excellent team of actors and a director, who brought everybody together and the writer, who was providing good content, so every day was special to us. All of us would get together and we all became like a family for those three-four years.

Many shows of the past have made a comeback on TV during the lockdown, but Kapur said the return of these shows should not be restricted to crisis situations.

The sad part is it (shows comeback) is happening because of the circumstances we are caught up in right now. The shows had certain quality in terms of content and presentation. They should have been brought back earlier and they should be brought back later as well. So at a time when new shows are not being made, people are able to see what was interestingly done earlier.

The actor, who is happy to see his wife Supriya Pathak's popular TV serial Khichdi making a comeback, said it is a delightful show and he used to enjoy watching it very much.

Kapur said some of his old shows such as Zabaan Sambhalke , Philips Top 10 , can also be brought back and audiences can watch and have fun.

I am not saying only light-hearted shows (should be back) because we were talking about humour which is why (I mentioned those shows).

Otherwise any good show that was made at that point and this includes those shows of which I was not part of. Like Buniyaad' was a wonderfully made series. Gulzar sahab's work, when he made a serial on Premchand ji, some of that work can be shown.

236,22-4-20,Apple Maps expands its 'Look Around' feature,"The Look Around feature from Apple Maps has now expanded to Chicago, adding another area to the 3D imagery that is similar to Googles Street View.

The feature is also available in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Las Vegas, Houston, the Hawaiian island of Oahu, Boston, Philadelphia and the Washington DC area.

In areas where ‘Look Around' is available, a binoculars icon will appear in the top-right corner of Apple Maps. Tapping that icon opens a street-level view in a card overlay at the top of the screen, which can then be expanded to a full-screen view, reports MacRumors.

The feature works relatively similar to Google Street View, wherein the view can be changed by swiping the display, while tapping part of the road in the distance will move the camera to that point.

Instead of relying on third-party mapping services for its information, Apple has had its fleet of vans hit the road sporting cameras and sensors to develop its own in-house maps.

The actress took to Instagram to recite her poem that goes: ""Today and everyday I am grateful to the sunrise and the sunset, for the forest full of trees, the animals and birds, rivers, lakes and seas; I'm grateful for all we have built, our bridges and our streets, I am grateful for the love that binds us and the wind that sometimes knocks us off our feet; in these uncertain times I feel grateful for those who put themselves in danger for us, our saviours, the world's warriors; today and everyday I promise to care for our planet and all it has to offer, I promise to value our home by doing a little better; I choose to celebrate earth day today and every single day.""

""Today and Everyday. My attempt at writing a little something to celebrate earth day. #Earthdayeveryday,"" captioned the actress.

Earlier, Sare Ali Khan posted beautiful pictures of holiday spots she has been to the world over, with a short self-composed poem as a tribute to Earth Day. Incidentally, Sara posted her poem and pictures on Monday -- a day before Earth Day -- and actor Ishaan Khatter wittily resorted to some poetry of his own to point out the mistake.

249,22-4-20,Full-time Facebook workers now reviewing harmful content too,"As Facebook content moderators who are mostly on contractual basis have temporarily been sent home owing to the coronavirus pandemic, full-time employees at the company are now sifting through harmful content.

According to the company, it has asked some of its full-time employees to review content related to real-world harm like child safety and suicide and self-injury in absence of a content reviewing team.

""Last month, we announced that we would temporarily send our content reviewers home. Since then we've shared updates on changes we've made to keep our platform safe during this time, including increasing the use of automation, carefully prioritizing user reports, and temporarily altering our appeals process,"" the company informed late Tuesday.

Facebook said its offices are unlikely to return to business as usual in the near future.

""Some of our full-time employees will continue to review sensitive content, but as Mark (Zuckerberg) referenced last week we will begin working with our partners to bring a small number of content reviewers back to offices to support these efforts in the coming weeks,"" said the social networking giant.

Returning to the office will be voluntary. Facebook said it will work with its partners to put protections in place to keep content reviewers safe.

These will include greatly reducing building capacity in offices to ensure government guidelines on physical distancing can be observed, implementing strict cleaning protocols and providing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves as well as temperature checks at the beginning of every shift.

254,22-4-20,Family donates Stephen Hawking's ventilator for coronavirus patients,"The family of Stephen Hawking, one of the world's best-known theoretical physicists, has donated his ventilator to a National Health Service (NHS) hospital in Cambridge to add to the additional supplies required during the coronavirus pandemic to treat the infected patients.

The 76-year-old physicist, who had motor neurone disease, used the ventilator constantly from 2013 until his death in 2018.

His daughter, 49-year-old Lucy Hawking, said her father had received ""brilliant, dedicated and compassionate"" medical care at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, also his home, and therefore his relatives were delighted to be able to play a small part in the battle against the coronavirus.

“As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times. We realised that it would be at the forefront of the COVID-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help,” Lucy said.

“After our father passed away, we returned all the medical equipment he used that belonged to the NHS but there were some items which he bought for himself. We are now passing them to the NHS in the hope they will help in the fight against COVID-19,” she said.

The hospital said the ventilator has now been added to its fleet after an inspection by the hospital's clinical engineering team.

Mike Davies, clinical director for respiratory medicine at Papworth Hospital, said: “It was lovely to hear from the Hawking family again and we are so grateful for them for donating this equipment.

“We are now extremely busy caring for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 and the support we are receiving from patients, their families and the local community means a great deal.”

The Royal Papworth Hospital said it has expanded its critical care department to more than double its usual size due to the increasing number of coronavirus admissions.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/family-donates-stephen-hawking-s-ventilator-for-coronavirus-patients-2020-04-22.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/family-donates-stephen-hawking-s-ventilator-for-coronavirus-patients.html

256,22-4-20,"Two new red zones in Delhi's South district, total 12","Two more containment zones were added in Delhi's South District on Wednesday, taking the total such zones in the district to 12.

SDM, Saket, Ankit Mishra made two areas in Lado Sarai as the new red zones in the city.

In two separate orders, the areas around house number F-258, Campa Cola Gali, and the area around house number F-313 (near Shiva Mandir)and F-274 in Lado Sarai have been sealed.

The area in the Campa Cola Gali was sealed after two people living in the same house tested Covid-positive.

""The samples of two more people living with them have been sent for testing,"" the order signed by Mishra said.

The order said one of these, having symptoms, had visited grocery stores and had interacted with other such essential service providers in the locality.

""The geographical location has a particularly dense population distribution wherein there is a high potential for local transmission that may lead to clustering of cases in time and space, epidemiologically linked to these positive cases.""

In the other location, two health workers living in two different houses in the area have tested positive.

""Both of these patients were asymptomatic and had been doing their regular work and meeting people.""

This area is also densely populated and there is a high potential for local transmission.

Both the areas have been sealed till May 5, the order said.

Apart from the South district, one more location was sealed on Wednesday -- Gali number 1, Raj Nagar-II in Dwarka in the South-West district.

So far, according to the Delhi government, 89 containment zones have been formed, excluding the new red zone in the South-West district.

257,21-4-20,Avoidable health apocalypse,"Had the healthcare experts been prepared and had the Government paid more attention to the sector, the curve could have been flattened fairly easily

Late last year, when the doctors in the city of Wuhan, China, reported that they were treating multiple adult patients having pneumonia with an undetermined cause, the world could not have gauged that there was a pandemic in the making. However, soon the situation turned alarming, as human to human transmission was confirmed and other countries confirmed cases. Indians continued to live in psychological denial; ignoring the scientific evidence about something that was progressing with alarming speed, fooling themselves into thinking that the virus would not touch us. The airports had screening processes in place, so that the people who screened positive could be quarantined or asked to self-isolate but it soon became apparent that asymptomatic transmission was occurring, too. By the first week of March, Delhi, Agra and Jaipur had confirmed cases.

For over three months, the virus has wreaked havoc on the planet, gripping around 213 countries and territories. This has put the spotlight on India’s already crumbling healthcare system. The positive cases have increased exponentially since the country reported its first case on January 30. In March infections were reported pan-India. Now, with close to 17,500 people already infected and the death toll crossing 500, it comes into question whether the Indian healthcare system can successfully avert a “health apocalypse.” If the virus can spread at lightning speed and can overwhelm the healthcare systems of Italy, France and the US, then it’s only fair to assume that with the current state of the economy and public health status, India is a sitting duck.

As a measure to control the spread of the virus, the country went into a complete 21-day lockdown, which now stands extended. It has disrupted all economic activities and threatens the already fragile economy. The population of 1.38 billion also comes as a bane in this time of turmoil and social as well as economic distress. This lockdown has left millions of people struggling to make ends meet, out of which, a majority are migrant, daily-wage workers who have been left stranded, without a job, money or a home. This has led them to travel back to their native villages, in search of a safe haven and has also caused several of them to die on the journey home. This is a glaring evidence of our under preparedness in the face of the pandemic and how the current measures have taken a toll on vulnerable groups.

As speculated by healthcare and economic experts, India is severely inadequately equipped to handle an outbreak. Decades of low investments and insufficient fund allocation to the health sector have rendered people unable to receive care and they are dependent on out-of-pocket expenditure. Kerala is the only State that has tested extensively and reported comparatively higher number of cases which further highlights the inadequacy of other States in doing so. As soon as the initial cases were reported, Kerala took stringent steps towards quarantining the patients while the Centre delayed in announcing any such measures. It has also reported the highest numbers of recoveries. The State employed aggressive testing measures, intensively tracing the contact history, increasing the duration of quarantine and arranging shelters and camps for migrant workers. All these have collectively led to a significant fall in Kerala’s cases, while the other States lag in terms of testing itself.

One plausible explanation for India’s poor testing ratio is its insufficiency in terms of medical infrastructure and the number of frontline healthcare workers.

In contrast with China, which has 4.2 beds per 1,000 inhabitants, India only has 0.7, with some States such as Bihar only having 0.11 beds per 1,000 people. As per the latest trend, infrastructure development has been privatised to such an extent that less than a third of cases of disease are now treated by public services.

The unwelcoming attitude of the general public towards services like health insurance cover also cripples people and leaves them unable to receive the required treatment in most instances. India spent barely 1.28 per cent of its GDP on health services in 2017-18, as per the figures released by the Government.

As testing is vital to check the spread of the virus, India is importing testing kits from other countries, which has delayed the country’s efforts to follow the Kerala model nationwide. The testing laboratories are unable to cater to the needs of the entire population, without which, several hundreds of cases might go undetected and the lack of preventive measures will further overwhelm the system. Not just testing, isolation wards where the patients are admitted are unsanitary. The Government has also been struggling with the availability of quarantine facilities. As per experts, the lack of testing and isolation measures also lays India open to the danger of “community transmission.”

Had its health services been good, India could have opted for the isolation and treatment strategy. But, except in the metropolitan and big cities, the patient to bed ratio and doctor to patient ratio are far below the national average.

As far as estimations go, if the worst case scenario prevails, India will see around 2.2 million cases by mid-May, out of which, around five to 10 per cent of the population will need life support. Only an estimated amount of around 70,000 ICU beds and 17,000 to 25,000 ventilators are available in India, so clearly the system lags severely. Although the Government has been able to curb the spread of infections to a significant extent by implementing “behavioural interventions” such as hand washing, social distancing, self-isolating when sick and others, the country is still prone to the spread of infection in high population density areas with poor supply of water, food and sanitary provisions. The alarming spread of cases in Dharavi, South Asia’s largest slum, has already got the Government of Maharashtra on its toes to prevent the further spread of disease. As per the latest data, Kerala is leading the nation in terms of curbing the illness, while Maharashtra is leading in terms of the spread of infections.

The district of Bhilwara in the State of Rajasthan is a commendable example of how an inevitable large-scale Coronavirus outbreak has been successfully contained due to vigilant and ruthless containment measures. Immediate case mapping, contact tracing, cluster mapping, tracing secondary contacts and imposing a curfew in the entire district were some of the intelligent measures that made Bhilwara emerge triumphant in avoiding the havoc that an outbreak could have caused.

If India’s healthcare infrastructure had been strong, the Government could have adopted the Singapore model, as per which, the city-State has not shut any of its operations and its people do not wear masks. The authorities are still keeping their defences up against the virus by implementing constant monitoring and testing and isolating confirmed cases immediately. It is safe to assume that Thailand and Taiwan’s previous experience of battling a similar virus in 2003 has also helped their governments. Thailand is keeping cases under control by employing aggressive public health campaigns and only 47 total deaths have been reported. The Taiwanese model of tackling the pandemic utilises a combination of vigilance, proactive decisions and maintaining transparency. This has led to only 422 cases reported and six deaths.

All three countries have relied on IT and a strongly geared medical system. The same measures could have been implemented in India if the healthcare system had been dependable and the country did not already have a crippling economy. The nation’s under-preparedness and its struggle towards curbing the spread of the disease, while also compromising the state of its economy, is a testament to the very foundations of our inefficient economy and how a multi-fold increase in focus is required for the healthcare sector.

The pandemic has rendered our economy non-functional and incapable of recovering the loss it has already undergone any time soon. Had the healthcare experts been prepared and had the Government paid more attention to the sector, the curve could have been flattened fairly easily. India could have easily dodged the destruction caused by the pandemic and utilised this as an opportunity to surpass China in the global economic arena. But with the current scenario, all this seems far-fetched and the country only has more restrictions to look forward to in the future.

""But it is a good beginning,"" he said, without elaborating.
