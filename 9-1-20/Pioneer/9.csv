0,09-1-20,Centre decides to shift BPNSI to K’nagar,"The Union Government has decided to shift the Biju Patnaik National Steel Institute (BPNSI) from Puri to Kalinganagar in Jajpur district, where a steel hub is in the making.

With Union Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan harping on establishment of India’s first steel hub in Kalinganagar, shifting of the BPNSI, which is run by the Ministry of Steel, would be useful for the hub. For this, the Centre has requested the State Government to provide 50 acres of land.

The BPNSI was set up in 2002 for the development of steel sector with an emphasis on the secondary steel sector.

The institute had adopted a three-pronged approach, namely ‘Education and Training, Research and Development and Consultancy, to boost the steel sector.

Affiliated to the AICTE, the institute is offering Advanced Certificate Course on iron and steel manufacturing. The Ministry has also decided to set up set up a steel skill development centre (SSDC) under the administrative control of the BPNSI.

Sources said the Ministry of Steel is in contact with the State Government in this regard. The BPNSI along with its SSDC would be able to generate massive pool of skilled workforce of young boys and girls for the steel sector.

International organisations imparting training in steel sector would be roped in for SSDC to provide advanced training to youths, who would be required for steel industries to be established in the steel hub at Kalinganagar.

With a target to produce 300 million tonne of steel per annum (MTPA), the Ministry is taking all sorts of steps to improve the capacity and boost the downstream industries.

Under this backdrop, shifting of the BPSNI and setting up of SSDC woud go a long way in serving the steel sector, said officials.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/centre-decides-to-shift-bpnsi-to-k---nagar.html
1,09-1-20,TV channel owner Das held for fraud,"The Commissionerate police on Tuesday arrested a television channel owner on charges of duping an ex-Service man of the city.

The accused is Manoj Das, managing director (MD) of Kamyab TV.

He was apprehended by the Markatnagar police under Sections 420 and 34 of IPC following complaint by former Army personnel Bisweswar Rout.

The complaint, a resident of CDA area in the city accused Das of defrauding him of Rs 20 lakh on the guise of providing him a job at his television channel.

Reports said Das had taken the money from Rout promising him of a job in his television channel in February 2019. After Rout did not receive any appointment letter from the organisation, he lodged a complaint against Das and his associate Ashok Patnaik, who had introduced him with the accused.

While Das was arrested by police, Patnaik is still at large.

During investigation, police came to know that the accused has also duped two others of Rs 40 lakh.

Earlier, CBI had arrested Das in connection of Artha Tatwa (AT) Group chit fund scam in 2014. He was lodged at the Jharpada Special Jail in Bhubaneswar for two years. After walking out of jail on bail, he had planned to revive his TV channel, which was closed briefly following his arrest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tv-channel-owner-das-held-for-fraud.html
2,09-1-20,Workers hold demo before D'nal DM,"More than 200 members of Tata BSL Industries Shramik Union took out a huge rally from its Dakhinakali office and demonstrated in front of Dhenkanal Collector’s Office against cheating of the company and its labour contractors Barsha and TSPL.

Er Debashisha Hota led the rally and demonstration.

The agitators urged arrest of the owners of contractors companies, alleging exploitations of labourers by them. Also they demanded payment of their retrenchment compensation immediately.

Later, Collector Bhumesh Chandra Behera assured to fulfil their demands within 15 days.

Hota alleged the authorities of the industries and their labour contactors did not care the notices of the DLO Manabhanjan Pradhan and flouted laws.

""The DLO does not take any strict action. Poor labourers could not afford to fight their pending cases at the far away tribunal by which the industries and their labour contactors get benefitted,"" Hota said.

4,09-1-20,Dambapur project yet to be completed,"The construction of the Dambapur Irrigation Project over the Mahendratanya river in Gajapati district is yet to be completed due to the callous attitude of the State Government, said Parala Swabhiman Manch convenor Dr Tirupathi Panigrahi after a visit to the site on Sunday.

The State Government had laid foundation stone for two irrigation projects in 2008 at Jalang canal and at Dambapur in Rayagada block over the river.

But the project at Jalang can be claimed as a dead project and the construction work at Dambapur is running at very slow pace which might take years to complete, said Panigrahi, adding that the project site at Dambapur is not situated at the right place.

Instead of constructing the project over the Julang Canal, which is the base for the river flow, why the Government is constructing the dam at Dambapur, a less water flow site, and making people fool, he questioned.

The Manch threatened that if the Government fails to provide water get to the farmers they would resort agitation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dambapur-project-yet-to-be-completed.html
5,09-1-20,Puri activist demands ban on congregation in Talabania,"One Hector Mishra under the banner of ‘Voice of People’ wrote to Puri Collector Balwant Singh demanding a ban on events beginning from the upcoming Monday at Talabania in Puri.

In his letter, Mishra opposed the permission from the administration given to a group to gather over Talabania field as it violates the laws of sweet water zones.

Since Talabania is strictly protected against any event or public activities as it comes under sweet water zone, Mishra stated a danger to ground water tables due to rising urinary and defecation activities by a huge gathering of people. Besides, there is threat to the wildlife sanctuary remaining within 200-meter from Talabania sweet water zone.

The letter reads, ""The use of laud-speakers and excess sound bites from event will hamper the peace of Balukhanda wildlife sanctuary situated closer to Talabania. Besides, the festival will affect studies of students of Kendriya Vidyalaya which is also close to this place."" Mishra also enclosed some legal documents and criminal case pending in police station.

By laws, Talabania is protected for drinking water supplies to city, Mishra wrote opposing a permission to group for celebration.

Reportedly, a festival is going to be organized on Talabania field with participation of hundreds of thousands of devotees from different States. Followers along with their gurus and clerics will congregate at Talabania in large numbers and hold functions there for two days. They are scheduled to hold a religious rally in the pilgrim city to mark visit of their Guru to Puri for darshan of Lord Jagannath.

However, the contention is despite a ban already in force with a case pending in court against misuse of Talabania for public activities, how permission was given to a group to organise the fair, the petitioner said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/puri-activist-demands-ban-on-congregation-in-talabania.html
6,09-1-20,HDB defaulters to get one time to clear dues,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the Housing and Urban Planning Department to start one time settlement (OTS) scheme for three months for the defaulters of the UP Housing and Development Board and development authorities.

Yogi said to draw maximum benefit from the scheme, it should be widely publicised and the application process should be online as well as offline.

The chief minister gave these instructions to the officials after reviewing the presentation of One Time Settlement (OTS) Scheme 2020 made by Housing and Urban Planning Department at Lok Bhawan here on Wednesday.

The chief minister said the OTS scheme should be run for three months. “Applications should be taken from the defaulters in the first three months and disposed of in the next three months and then action should be initiated against the remaining defaulters, he said.

Yogi said to promote the scheme, officials of the UP Housing and Development Board and development authorities should organise camps at various places and make people aware of the scheme.

“Data should be collected from all cities. Along with this, the officers and employees should go among people and organise seminars in this regard so that more and more people take benefit of the OTS scheme,” Yogi said.

The chief minister further said the accountability of the officers and employees concerned be fixed regarding action taken against defaulters of the UP Housing and Development Board and development authorities.

He asked the officials to set up a committee to ensure transparency in the implementation of the scheme.

Principal Secretary (Housing and Urban Planning) Deepak Kumar, Principal Secretary (Finance) Sanjiv Mittal, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, SP Goyal, and other senior officials were present in the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hdb-defaulters-to-get-one-time-to-clear-dues.html

8,09-1-20,Dangers of a digital world,"With the number of active web users growing every day, piracy remains a big threat and needs to be addressed through multiple strategies targetting different areas

The previous decade was noteworthy for a number of reasons, not least of which was the sharp rise in the number of Internet users — more than a billion people from across the world joined the new Internet bandwagon in the last six years alone. This has had massive cultural implications, requiring the revision of legal, economic and technological frameworks. Intellectual Property (IP) frameworks have received much importance in this era, especially because they can impact areas beyond IP. For instance, copyright laws can have implications beyond the digital content ecosystem and can extend to an array of areas such as free speech, the flow and availability of information and the manner in which cultural products such as art, music, film and the like are produced and exchanged.

Such cultural products in the creative industry play an important role in a country’s economy. For instance, the Indian creative industry (largely comprising the media and entertainment industry) is poised to be worth $31 billion by 2020 and is expected to create over a million jobs by 2022. However, this industry has repeatedly highlighted copyright piracy as a major issue that eats into its profits significantly. While this is an issue that has practically been around since the beginning of the copyright framework, technological advancements have meant that it is now possible to make perfect replicas at a scale almost instantaneously and with much easier access.

One of the first steps to tackle piracy is to understand its underpinnings and to assess the factors that contribute to it. A few studies in this regard have been there in India and they indicate that piracy is influenced by several factors — ranging from personality-based to social and cultural. However, the overall lack of information about various aspects of this issue is a problem. There is no recent academic literature on the drivers of piracy and more importantly, there is a lack of reliable data on the total size of the cultural economy in our country.

This lack of information complicates policy and law-making in this area. While the standard legislative response has been to use stringent penalties for copyright infringement without accounting for differences in the kinds of infringement and infringers, this approach has had limited success. Then there are also other challenges that relate to tackling digital piracy. We have an overburdened judicial system, disparate enforcement mechanisms, a fragmentate supply chain and more generally, the absence of a widespread understanding of “copyright.” Additionally, since “law and order” is a State subject under the Constitution, enforcement relies on respective police forces, making it difficult to implement centralised and uniform enforcement strategies.

Other measures that have been effective in controlling piracy include a reduction in the “windowing period” between releases abroad and in India. This means lesser the time taken for a new release to be made accessible through legal platforms, the more likely is it that users will consume such content through legal means.

This can be effective when such content is easily available on various over-the-top (OTT) platforms for content that is highly anticipated. Another development that has been instrumental in reducing piracy rates has been the introduction of online streaming services, making legal content easily available at a reasonable price. However, the effect of the stark increase in the number of streaming services, all with their own catalogues and separate pricing plans, is yet to be seen.

Nevertheless, other technological measures can be useful in this regard. For instance, various forms of water-marking techniques have been used to identify the source of pirated content, fingerprinting and related technologies have been used by platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, which host user-generated content, to combat infringement by helping to identify and block the illegal use of copyrighted content.

More recently, blockchain technology is also beginning to be explored as a means to combat infringement, both as a way to establish a chain of contact for content and to expose piracy through the use of Bitcoin rewards to incentivise the detection of pirated content. While these methods have varying rates of success in combating infringement, upgrades and innovations in technology, especially those that combine various existing methods, can be expected to make them more viable in the future.

The use of soft-law approaches along with public-private partnerships have also been effective in targetting piracy, especially where they target revenue models of those indulging in large-scale piracy. For instance, infringing website lists, which identify websites that host pirated content, have been used to reduce advertising, thereby disrupting revenues. Such lists are usually prepared by law enforcement or other arms of the Government in partnership with the private sector. For instance, the UK’s Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit partners with experts, companies and law enforcement agencies in other countries to counter crime on an international scale. It compiled an IWL as part of its “Operation Creative” initiative, which helped reduce advertising on illegal websites.

More localised and country-specific lists are also being used to target the revenue of websites hosting pirated content. In India, the Maharashtra Cyber Digital Crime Unit, which is a part of the State’s cyber police force, works on a model that relies on collaboration with the private sector. It has taken down hundreds of websites that host pirated content and has sent notices to different brands and networks advertising on such websites.

Piracy is, therefore, a complex issue with numerous drivers and needs to be addressed through multiple strategies targetting different areas of the ecosystem. In this context, a report by the Esya Centre titled, Trends in Copyright Infringement and Enforcement in India, explores the issue of copyright piracy and the challenges in effectively countering it. It examines legislative, judicial, policy and technological best practices both from India and internationally to inform next steps in this regard.

What is clear is that in framing responses to piracy that are effective and time-sensitive, it is essential to have in place judicial safeguards to ensure that all interventions are narrowly tailored and aimed only at addressing piracy. This because of the impact that these laws can have on issues of free speech and access and because it is important to also account for fair dealing exceptions provided for under copyright law. Ultimately, copyright forms a part of larger goals of increasing innovation, promoting research, progress in the arts and sciences and providing fair wages to creators of various kinds, among others. It is essential to situate copyright in that larger context and tailor remedies for infringement within those bounds.

9,09-1-20,Slowing economy,"This time Govt data pegs GDP growth at a dismal five per cent. The FM should work out a practical and honest Budget

Gloomy economic forecasts over the last quarter are not new and no matter what the source of research, they haven’t been the least bit reassuring. And now the Government’s own data has confirmed our worst fears of not just a slowdown but a guttural halt as India’s GDP growth has dipped to an 11-year low of five per cent. This has been attributed to a poor showing by the manufacturing and construction sectors. Clearly, the stimulus package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the form of corporate tax rate cuts and boost to the realty sector has not been good enough. And just when fears fuelled by food and retail inflation are galloping, worryingly, the manufacturing sector growth has been projected to decelerate to two per cent in 2019-20, down from 6.9 per cent in the previous financial year. Likewise, the construction sector growth is estimated at 3.2 per cent as against 8.7 per cent in 2018-19. Consumption and demand are at their lowest and the financial sector stress, which spread from banks to non-banking financial companies, shows that we are yet to tame the effects of reckless lending of the first decade. The non-performing assets (NPAs) of public sector banks are projected to increase by September 2020 and this poses fresh concerns regarding their ability to take prudent lending decisions when liquidity is the need of the hour. For the Government, the rate cuts on corporate taxes and lower GST collections mean that its revenues have already taken a substantial hit.

Observers say while Sitharaman’s packages have focussed too much on the supply side, there has hardly been any attempt made to prod demand. Besides, critics fear that the corporate tax cut has not percolated to spur growth in business and infrastructure. In fact, many suspect that most companies might have used the cuts to better their books instead of investing in new projects that could have generated jobs and production. Of course, the stressed Government cannot be ambitious enough about mega projects but at least needs to encourage smaller core sector activities that have a quicker turnaround time. In this respect, MSMEs still remain transformative. It needs to further boost liquidity in rural India and create demand. Clearly the Government can no longer live in denial that we are badly stuck in the trough of the “U” and need desperate measures to climb out of it. It has already delayed interventions, which were made in late August, and the full results are only expected to manifest themselves a few months down the line. Also, though the Government has been speeding up privatisation of state-run firms to boost investment and foster growth, the takers for debt-ridden enterprises are few and far between and as in the case of Air India, there are no suitors. India’s problem is that no matter what its corrective push to attract investment, the global slowdown means that there isn’t enough big-ticket interest. With a squeeze on domestic credit and weak corporate profits, leave alone recovery, signs of a pick-up look bleak. Our GDP needs to grow at around eight per cent annually to create jobs for the millions of our young people who join the labour force each year. Or else, we could become the worst victim of a demographic drag. The preparations for the Union Budget are on and Sitharaman would do well to present a realistic, honest estimate than give in to the politics of manoeuvring. Some talk is going around about the need to cut personal income tax rates to put more money in the hands of consumers but that, too, is a short-term solution. A practical and scalable reform process needs to get rolling. Remember, we do not know what kind of oil shocks we have to bear given the US-Iran tensions in the Middle East. That could throw all calculations awry.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/slowing-economy-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/slowing-economy.html
10,09-1-20,"Finally, a closure","The verdict in the Nirbhaya case is out but unless judicial processes are time-bound, rape survivors are not safe

When a paramedical student was brutalised and gangraped on a bus in New Delhi on a cold December night in 2012, the savagery of it brought out the nation’s guilt at not treating rape as the most heinous of all crimes. It brought about furious debates and discussions, even drove changes in the criminal justice system, led to the death penalty and a consciousness about the public safety of women. But rapes have not stopped in India, giving us the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous country for women anywhere in the world. And Nirbhaya’s family had to suffer for seven long years before they got justice despite a systemic overhaul, new laws and her case being classified as the “rarest of rare.” All her violators will now be hung to death. Yes, justice has been delayed inordinately. But the only satisfaction is that there will be closure after following due processes of law.

The Nirbhaya case will forever be our conscience call and hopefully the delayed verdict will now fast-track judicial processes and build in deterrence in our societal systems. Post Nirbhaya, the conviction rate of rapists has risen, though still at 32 per cent. There has also been an increase in reportage of crimes against women. But when the proportion of rape crimes is pitted against the suspects being convicted, the entire idea of progress comes under question. Also, the death penalty for heinous cases has emboldened predators on the prowl in public spaces, the recent rape and burning of a 26-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad being a prime example. Only 20 per cent of the `3,200 crore Nirbhaya Fund, which was meant to strengthen safety of women in public spaces, ensure on-site rapid responses and quick rescues, has been utilised. Laws and funds alone cannot make a difference. One of the reasons why the Hyderabad police encounter of rapists got massive support was because the masses are fed up with the way our judicial processes work. In fact, for the criminal, there is no deterrent. But once he knows he can be hunted and chased to the corner of the earth, he will at least think twice. Or slow down. For that to happen, we need to fast-track procedures and at the same time ensure swift justice. This calls for certain institutional as well as behavioural reforms in society. At present, fast-track courts are no different from the usual courts in terms of case pile-ups and vacancies, taking up to eight months to settle complaints. The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) says rape trials should be completed in 60 days but that never happens. A quick and unbiased judicial set-up with requisite number of judges is a sine qua non. The inquiry process should factor in sensitivities of rape survivors while families and communities should be counselled to rise above stigmas. And the criminal concerned should not, under any circumstance, get bail pending full inquiry, lest he intimidate the survivor. At the time of writing, a rape survivor in Uttar Pradesh committed suicide as she was being bullied into withdrawing her complaint. Only a continuously responsive system can serve as an effective deterrent and inspire confidence in the community to pursue justice. The Hyderabad encounter case had itself led to the Andhra Pradesh Government introducing the Disha Bill, which mandates that cases involving crimes against women must be settled in 21 days through special courts. Let’s talk less, implement more.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/finally--a-closure-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/finally--a-closure.html
11,09-1-20,Need for multilateralism,"The Indo-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean in particular have become the epicentre of geopolitics and India has emerged as a key player

In recent days, Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced efforts to strengthen Australia’s involvement in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the importance of working with India in defence and other activities. Speaking at the 2019, Raisina Dialogue in Delhi — a geopolitical conference co-hosted by the India — Payne said: “Our respective futures are intertwined and heavily dependent on how well we cooperate on the challenges and opportunities in the Indian Ocean in the decades ahead.”

In terms of global political significance, the Atlantic Ocean can be viewed as the ocean of our grandparents and parents; the Pacific Ocean as our ocean and that of our children; and the Indian Ocean as the ocean of our children and grandchildren. There is an obvious sense in which the region is the future. The average age of people in the region’s countries is under 30, compared to 38 in the US and 46 in Japan. The countries bordering the Indian Ocean are home to 2.5 billion people, which is one-third of the world’s population.

Having heard the Australian Minister and read a few expert comments from Australian scholars of international affairs, it becomes clear that Indo-Pacific in general and the Indian Ocean in particular is being viewed as the epicentre of geopolitics and India as the key player in this region. The need of economic partnership among the littorals is of utmost importance while having a collaborated approach to address geopolitical risks. India, being the largest country, has a logical role to play as a leader bringing the nations of IOR on multilateral platforms.

Multi-nation platforms: There are multi-nation platforms existing, which have mutual growth as their aim but their effectiveness is questionable when compared to other oceanic platforms. For example, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) was established by nations bordering the Bay of Bengal in 1997. In more than two decades, it is still gaining momentum but cannot be compared with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Australia, along with 21 other border states, is a member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) which seeks to promote sustainable economic growth, trade liberalisation and security. Australia’s 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper seeks to support IORA in areas such as maritime security and international law. It also aims at strengthening its ties in the region such as with India and Indonesia —and also build new connections, particularly in Africa.

It brings out the Australian perspective which is outreaching and focusses on multilateral cooperation with the stakeholders. The Indian perspective becomes clear from the Foreign Secretary’s words: “The challenges we all face today, and all of us know this, whether they be the traditional security issues such as nuclear proliferation, armed conflict and so on, or newer non-traditional issues such as terrorism, migration and refugee flows and environmental degradation — all of these, in our view, require more, and not less, multilateralism. India’s vision of engagement in the Indo-Pacific region will be based on the values of peace, stability and prosperity on a free, open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific with the ASEAN regional bloc central to the concept, which serves the long-term interests of all countries in the region and of the world at large. Our Prime Minister’s articulation of the vision of SAGAR — ‘Security and Growth for All in the Region’ will continue to provide the basis for our maritime engagement.”

Cooperation is key to maritime security: Maritime security is a major challenge for the poorer coastal and island countries of the IOR. In particular those that have large zones of maritime jurisdiction. There are 48 independent countries in the region, including hinterland and landlocked states of East Africa and South Asia. There are 18 in Africa, 11 in the Middle East, seven in South Asia, six in Southeast Asia, five island states and Australia. Managing maritime security is a challenging endeavour. It requires cooperation between regional countries and between those with a stake in regional security. Maritime security is no longer the sole prerogative of navies with more non-military agencies now involved.

Maritime security is a priority for the IORA, currently the main regional organisation for economic and security cooperation. It recently committed its members to working on increasing cooperation among navies and other maritime security forces in the region. The plan is to do this collaboratively with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), a voluntary initiative by India to address shared maritime security challenges and threats.

However IONS’ main focus has been on naval cooperation and it has been successful in terms of bringing navies and coastal security forces together in the form of joint exercises. There is some scepticism about the symposium’s ability to make a broader contribution to maritime security.

Defence cooperation: The Foreign Minister of Australia also pointed to increasing defence activities in the Indian Ocean, noting that in 2014, Australia and India had conducted 11 defence activities together, with the figure reaching 38 in 2018. This shows the positive approach from Australian counterparts to build a strong security-oriented partnership with India.

In 2018, the Indian Air Force (IAF), for the first time, participated with fighter aircraft in Exercise Pitch Black that was conducted in Australia. During the transit to Australia, the IAF contingent also had constructive engagement with Indonesian and Malaysian air forces. In recent times the IAF has shown its capabilities of reaching anywhere within the IOR at an unimaginable short notice and also has undertaken exercises across the bays around, so as to make itself familiar with the region. In its pan-India exercise Gagan Shakti-2018, special attention was given to maritime air operations. The operation was the largest-ever series of air exercises conducted by the IAF. It crucially demonstrated an air operational range with the help of air-to-air refuelling by the IL-78 Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA). The Su-30s, airborne from a base on the eastern coast, engaged multiple targets towards the western seaboard of India at distances beyond 2,500 km and landed at a southern base, thus covering a total distance of 4,000 km in a single mission, which is less than average distance between India and many IOR countries.

Among other defence cooperations, the air forces of two nations can work together by using the respective island territories as regular refuelling halts during ferries or conduct joint exercises with navies of friendly countries around. For example the Cocos Keeling Island and Christmas Island (Australian external territory) have 8,000 and 7,000 feet runways respectively which are fit for operations by all kind of aircraft.

They are located south of Indonesia and almost midway between India and Australia. The distance between Port Blair and these islands is 2,675 km and 2,833 km respectively. Similarly, Andaman and Nicobar Islands can be used by the Australian Air Force for the same purpose. With these kinds of practices of using island runways and conducting joint exercises, the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations in actual contingencies will be conducted more efficiently when time is a critical factor and decision-making delays cannot be afforded. The same is applicable for any other contingency which imposes challenge to safety and security of IOR countries.

Security and growth for all through multilateralism is the only viable solution against problems arising in today’s geostrategic scenario because of unilateralism and trade wars. India’s active and frequent friendly engagements with IOR countries’ armed forces will boost the confidence of all the participants as well as the littoral countries and will give stability to the maritime security of the IOR. The IAF thus can prove itself to be an important tool in furthering the vision of SAGAR.

12,09-1-20,A tale of three theocracies,"More empathy and an outreach by those in power towards those who fear the introduction of the CAA are imperative

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a well-drafted, welcome piece of legislation. It passes with flying colours the triple test of Aristotelian logic, the Indian Nyaya school and Confucian principles.

CAA seeks to provide both the physical and epistemological comforts of home in a land of refuge, India, to religiously persecuted minority communities of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. All three of these states are theocracies with Islam enshrined in their respective Constitutions as the state religion. I shall refer to them “Group I states” for the purpose of this article.

Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal, also in the neighbourhood, are non-theocratic states with no state religion. These may be termed the “Group II states.”

It follows, therefore, that what in legalese is termed “reasonable differentia” is clearly established in that distinction between these two groups of South Asian nation states. Which is also why the CAA cannot be extended to include minority communities claiming religious persecution in Group II states such as the Rohingya in Myanmar, Tamils in Sri Lanka and Ahmadiyya/Ismailis/Shias in Pakistan.

Unless, that is, any of the Group II states decides in the years ahead to adopt a state religion and convert itself into a theocracy. And a political party in India included such a demand in its election manifesto, got democratically elected and followed through on bringing its promise to fruition with legislation to that effect.

Were this to come to pass, support for fast-tracking Indian citizenship eligibility for minority communities living in future theocracies within Group II states in the Indian sub-continent would be entirely valid. But only then, not before.

As for Group I states, their Muslim citizens are excluded from the ambit of the CAA because they cannot, by definition, be religiously persecuted in a theocratic country where the state religion is Islam.

This is not to say members of the majority community in Group I states are not persecuted; far from it.

Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests our Muslim neighbours who have chosen to found and live in theocratic states in South Asia are discriminated against on a plethora of grounds including political, sectarian, factional, regional, economic, gender et.al. by oppressive state apparatuses.

But, and without intending to make this sound like Philosophy 101, it is one thing to say all citizens of Group I states regardless of faith have a disability; it is quite another to assert that they all suffer from the same disability.

It stands to reason, thus, that the palliative for specific disabilities will differ depending on the particular disability one is aiming to ameliorate.

The CAA’s architecture is designed to deal with a specific disability; that of the disappearance of minority communities from Group I states which were, till 1947, either directly or indirectly part of Britain’s Indian empire. The Act does so in a humane, practicable and ethical manner. Some may disagree. But that’s for lawyers to scrap over in court.

If the Supreme Court of India, which has admitted a bunch of petitions challenging the Constitutional validity of the Act, holds the amended citizenship law to be kosher, excellent. If it doesn’t, then it will not be the law of the land.

Either way, as law-abiding citizens of the republic, it would behove each one of us to accept with grace the verdict once appeals if any are disposed of or, if required, bring in a fresh law.

In any event, there can be no justification for anti-CAA protesters inciting anarchy via arson, destruction of public property, wanton violence and mindless lumpen behaviour.

Governments, for their part, both at the Centre and in the States, must ensure the might of the law is brought to be bear upon rioters including punitive measures such as those initiated by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Government in issuing notices under the law to confiscate the immovable assets of those charged with destroying public property as compensation.

Simultaneously, administrations must adopt a policy of zero-tolerance for the use of disproportionate force by police without neutering them or hampering their effectiveness.

It’s tough, in Indian conditions, but that’s Raj Dharma.

Making incendiary remarks targetting co-citizens, especially among the Indian Muslim community, is unacceptable. Doubly so if they come from those in positions of responsibility. Whatever the provocation.

More empathy and an outreach by those in power towards those who fear the introduction of the CAA, however unjustified their apprehensions may be, are also a categorical imperative.

What is puzzling beyond all measure, though, is what the rationale behind opposing the CAA is by those who term themselves “secular.” Is their collective self-loathing so acute?

Surely, they cannot stand in favour of oppressive theocracies and swear by secularism in the same breath.

On second thoughts, the history of the 20th century teaches us that perhaps they can — taking a line from their support for the Khilafat movement to the overturning of the Shah Bano verdict and opposition to a Uniform Civil Code for India.

The conviction grows that they are here to bury secularism, not to praise it. And when erstwhile mainstream political parties become its pall bearers, it is time to worry.

I do not propose to blame it all on Nehru & Co.

On the contrary, as a proud secularist albeit from an Indic tradition I am grateful that the founders of the Republic did not enshrine Sanatan Dharma as the national faith. It would not only have been oxymoronic but undermined the whole notion of an Indic exceptionalism.

But choosing to be Constitutionally faith-neutral if very different from trying to force Indic faiths into an Abrahamic mould and normalising the characterisation of Hinduism as a “religion.”

Approximations just don’t cut it.

These fine distinctions, however, would surely have gladly been forfeited by the ethnically-cleansed minority communities of Group I states if they had not been murdered, raped, humiliated, delegitimised and dehumanised for 72 years because of religious persecution. The CAA, read as it is, aims to redeem secular India’s solemn pledge at the time of Partition.

If not wholly, then at least very substantially.

13,09-1-20,Global forests and ecology in peril,"As the going gets tough for the world’s ‘green assets’, it is being predicted that the Amazon rain forests are now the most threatened with a projected loss of 48 million hectares by 2030

The ongoing bush and forest fires in Australia are presenting a daunting challenge to the authorities and are proving to be a painful and tragic end for the wildlife affected by the blaze. This countrywide catastrophe, mainly caused by drought and extreme heat, has so far claimed 24 lives, destroyed 18 million acres of forest and bushland and has also consumed 1,200 homes.

However, the brunt of the fires has been borne by the wildlife and approximately half a billion animal lives have been lost. Australia is not new to bush fires but this season’s blaze has been anything but predictable and bearable, as the scale has hit astonishing levels.

The spectre of climate change in the form of global warming is transforming the definition of natural disasters as rising temperatures, droughts and strong winds become a lethal combination of fanning even the smallest of a bush fire into a countrywide inferno.

This is evident in Australia’s case as well because this year saw the mid-December temperatures going as high as 42 degree Celsius in the midst of winds that were recording speeds of 120 kmph.

Yet another aspect, which precipitated this disaster in Australia was the fact that the country witnessed its driest spring season in the last 120 years and this rendered the bushland, forests and grasslands dry and fit for a blaze.

The 2019 Amazon forest fires, too, were an unfortunate occurrence as they saw over 906,000 hectares of prime forest land — that was rich in ecology and wildlife — being burnt to cinder.

Here, too, the role of man cannot be ruled out, as every year, the countries bordering the forest areas of the Amazon rain forest illegally slash and burn the woodland to clear land for agriculture and habitation. These countries are unable to take strict action to stop this practice and as a result, sometimes this clearing process gets out of hand and unfortunately results in mega-disaster events.

Amazon forests, considered the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sink, are now at peril, too, thanks to climate change and anthropogenic activities.

According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Global Land Outlook report, 70 per cent of the global forests are at peril thanks to deforestation and man-made disasters such as forest fires. The report states that tropical jungles are at the highest risk and to illustrate the point the report presents a staggering fact that nearly 5.5 million hectares of rich forestland disappeared annually between 2010-2015.

As the going gets tough for the world’s “green assets”, it is being further predicted that the Amazon rain forests are now the most threatened with a projected loss of 48 million hectares by 2030. The inability of mankind to take care of nature and safeguard the precious natural resources is very unsettling.

India, too, has good forest wealth but, some years ago, that also came under threat as hundreds of acres of valuable forests in Uttarakhand’s Himalayan foothills became a casualty of tremendous fires.

The callous selfishness of human actions is leading to spiralling temperatures, which in turn are making the flora and fauna’s survival difficult. Add to these woes are the afforestation efforts which are progressing at snail’s pace. All this means that we are compromising those very carbon sinks that can have a major role in climate change mitigation.

In the wake of these global forest fire episodes, the world environmental community must introspect to find a lasting solution to safeguard nature’s assets from these recurrent disasters.

In this regard, it becomes clear that the global community lost a great opportunity at the recently-concluded UN Climate Change Conference COP 25, to put in place systems and checks that can play a pivotal role in preserving the global green canopy.

The forests are the last remaining barriers between mankind and the consequences of climate change. They need to be treated as a national priority and be accorded sufficient protection. The strict and non-negotiable segregation of habited areas and forests is probably the first step towards forest conservation.

In addition to this, the forest protection laws that are currently lax and implemented even more poorly need to be overhauled so that woodland protection becomes a serious matter.

In India, too, the forest department is woefully understaffed and ill-trained to protect these precious resources. All these aspects must change if India and the world want to keep whatever forests are still left.

This must be done expeditiously before it is too late to undo the damage, else man will have to pay a heavy price for this indiscriminate and mindless pillage of natural wealth and future generations will pay for our crimes against nature.

14,09-1-20,K'handi tribals observe ‘Toki Mara Parba’,"The tribal festival “Toki Mara Parba” (sacrificing a young girl), which is observed in every 12 years in Kalahandi’s tribal region, was held recently. According to sources, a female goat representing a young girl was sacrificed in hope of a good harvest alongwith peace and harmony in the community.

Around 50-60 years ago, tribals used to sacrifice a girl of the village Jani (village head), who believed that by sacrificing her, they would be showered with blessings of the Dharni Penu (a local deity).

A lecturer, Parmeswar Mund of Bhawanipatna who has been researching on tribals, said the age -old tradition of sacrificing a girl had been changed to a female goat being sacrificed in the last four decades.

Earlier, the tribals believed that since a mother took care of her children, a girl, after being sacrificed, would also save the family members from all the evils. “Gradually their belief changed who are now chosing to sacrifice a female goat instead of a girl,” said Mund.

Recently in many tribal pockets of Kalampur, Thuamul Rampur, Koksara and Lanjigarh block of Kalahandi, the tribals observed the festival. “We believe that the deity saves us from all the difficulties and simultaneously hope for a good harvest,” said Goutam Munda Disari, a local.

According to a custom, after sacrificing the female goat, tribals of Kondh and Parja community take a piece of meat which is buried in their respective farmland. ""The tribals believe that unless the meat is buried, there would not be good harvesting,” said Lanjigarh MLA Pradeep Disari who took part in the festival.

Apart from that, two days after concluding the ""Toki Mara Parba"", tribals observed “Dhangdi Dola” which involved a custom of choosing a bride of their own community.

The young boys and girls danced in a function where a boy chose a girl of his own wish and then he pulled the girl upto 50-100 meters in front of the society. “Finally in the community the bride and groom are announced as married,” said a local resident of Lanjigarh, Kailash Sahoo.

Mund said the custom of pulling a girl on his own wish turning into marriage was too an age-old ritual and the community enjoyed a lot in the event.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/k-handi-tribals-observe----toki-mara-parba---.html
15,09-1-20,Centre OK’s NINL disinvestment,"The Union Government on Wednesday decided in favour of disinvestment of equity shareholding in the Kalingaagar-based Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL), which is in dire need of working capital.

A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi gave its ‘in-principle’ nod for a strategic disinvestment of the equities in the NINL.

According to sources, the Cabinet approved disinvestment of equity shares of Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation Limited (MMTC) (49.78%), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) (10.10%), MECON (0.68%) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) (0.68%) and two Odisha Government PSUs, Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Limited (IPICOL) (12.00%) and Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) (20.47%) in the NINL to a strategic buyer, identified through a two-stage auction procedure.

The NINL is a joint venture company, in which four Central PSUs, MMTC, NMDC, BHEL and MECON and State PSUs IPICOL and OMC are shareholders.

The proposed strategic disinvestment in the NINL aims at unlocking resources to be used to finance the social sector and developmental programmes of the Government benefiting the public. It is also expected that the successful strategic buyer may bring in new management, technology and investment for growth of the company and may use innovative methods for development of the business operations of the company, which may generate more employment

About 700 tourists from Delhi had visited Odisha recently. After darshan of Lord Jagannath in Puri, they were to depart by various air carriers from Bhubaneswar on Wednesday.

“We have been sitting here since 3 am without having breakfast and tea. However, we spent quality time by performing Bhajans and Kirtan with other passengers, a tourist from Paschim Vihar, Delhi said.

Clapping their hands and moving to the beats of songs, the passengers appeared happy with others even as the nationwide strike disrupted normal life outside the airport. The Bhajans reverberated in the airport premises with the music of Tannumai, a percussion instrument.

“Those in politics are observing the bandh. But we remained unaffected,” another passenger said. “We will wait for our flights. Till then, we will do Satsang and chant Bhajans,” said the women tourists chanting ‘Radhe Radhe’.

The tourists termed the bandh as ‘inappropriate’.

Besides Krishna, some other IPS officers posted as district police chiefs may also face action as their names figure in the 5-page letter reportedly sent to the chief minister by Krishna.

Sources said that ADG/IG of Meerut Zone, Alok Singh, who was handed the enquiry against Krishna for his role in the alleged leakage of the confidential letter sent to the chief minister, visited Lucknow last Monday and reportedly briefed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the DGP on his findings. The sources said that Singh also submitted his findings.

However, Singh termed his meeting as a courtesy call after being promoted from IG to ADG rank.

The sources said that Singh told the CM and the DGP that Krishna had denied his role in the leakage of the confidential letter. Sources in the government confirmed that action against Krishna was delayed as a press conference called by Krishna after his objectionable video went viral of social media in which he had mentioned the letter, was held on the direction of a very senior IAS officer.

However, on Wednesday, Yogi Adityanath summoned the DGP and took first hand information about the entire episode.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Avanish Awasthi was also present during the meeting with the chief minister.

Now stern action has been contemplated against the infighting among the members of IPS cadre.

It may be mentioned that last Friday, in a hurriedly called press conference to clear the controversy over the confidential letter, the DGP had said that Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna had been given 15 days’ time to explain whether he had flouted service rules by leaking the missive.

25,09-1-20,Farmers spend winter nights with paddy bags,"Farmers of Kalahandi have alleged that delay in procurement of paddy by the authorities had forced them to wait for their turn by sleeping at night in the cold wave.

While the State Government claims that paddy is procured within 24 hours of date of purchase mentioned in the token, farmers have been shivering at the Dasigaon PACs for the last 15 days.

Once a centralized token is generated, farmers are issued the tokens where date of procurement is mentioned. A farmer will have to bring his produce at the mandi on a particular date which is purchased by the PACs, so go the norms.

The farmers alleged that despite receiving tokens, paddy could not be procured on the given date by the Dasigon primary agriculture co-operative society (PACS).

Owing to a shed in the mandi of Dasigaon village, around 30-40 farmers had been sleeping nearby their produce partly covered with polythenes. They alleged the administration focused on big farmers earlier and now lacked in lifting paddy of small farmers.

A 60- year -old farmer Dhanurjaya Naik said, “I had brought 50 bags of paddy at the Dasigaon PACs which was to be lifted on December 24 but till today it could not be purchased and I have been shivering in the cold with sleepless nights.”

Another farmer NrusinghaKhamari (55) alleged that he had 95 bags of paddy which was to be lifted 10 days ago but no millers were seen."" It is quite tough to sleep in the cold wave,” he said.

Govind Kumar, a farmer who had 60 bags of paddy said without a shed, he was forced to keep the paddy under the sky and he did not know how long it would take to purchase his produce.

In Kalahandi, the target of 25 lakh quintal paddy procurement, at a cost of Rs1 815 a quintal, was achieved in December for Kharif season. 74 PACS and 23 SHGs procured the paddy in the district, said sources.

However, the State Government had further instructed to purchase another 7.35 lakh quintal paddy in the second phase.

The civil supply officer of Kalahandi, Siba Shankar Dora said that due to lack of the labourers, delay was seen in various mandis. ""Due to the heavy load at the mandis, paddy could not be procured in time owing to the labour problem. However, all the paddy will be procured,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/farmers-spend-winter-nights-with-paddy-bags.html

28,09-1-20,BSP may contest all Delhi seats,"Two major opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh — Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party — have decided to chart different paths for the Delhi assembly elections.

The BSP is likely to contest all the 70 assembly seats while the SP has decided to skip the Delhi polls.

SP said it had decided so skip the Delhi assembly polls to prevent division of secular votes.

Both BSP and SP had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in alliance but the pre-poll tie-up failed to deliver as expected by both the parties.

Even after a dismal performance in states like Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, BSP sources said on Wednesday the party was preparing to contest all the 70 seats in Delhi with its focus on 12 reserved seats.

Delhi has been important for the BSP, especially due to significant number of Dalit and migrant voters being present in the national capital. The BSP had bagged two seats in the 2008 Delhi assembly elections but had drawn a blank in 2015 despite contesting on all 70 seats.

“A high-level meeting, chaired by BSP chief Mayawati, was held recently in which directions were given to the party leaders from western Uttar Pradesh to start preparations for the Delhi assembly polls. It was mainly the ruling AAP which had dented the BSP’s Dalit votes in the elections.

However, the sources said the actual challenge before the BSP was to counter the growing clout of Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Ravana. He recently hogged headlines by leading the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act from Jama Masjid in Delhi and his subsequent arrest. Smelling the rat in the protest, Mayawati has termed it as a conspiracy to foist Bhim Army to counter the BSP.

Bhim Army wields considerable influence in Meerut and Saharanpur divisions of western UP, which shares boundary with Delhi.

BSP chief and former chief minister of UP, Mayawati, had recently cautioned her voters against Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad and had termed him as an agent of parties working to split the BSP votes in Delhi. Mayawati’s attack on Azad came after he announced to contest all the 70 assembly seats in Delhi.

Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, on the other hand, has distanced itself from the Delhi assembly polls as its leaders are of the view that it might split the anti-BJP votes. The move is also seen as an attempt to extend support to the ruling AAP. However, a formal announcement from the party chief is awaited.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bsp-may-contest-all-delhi-seats.html
29,09-1-20,"A yr on, Ujjwala Didi drive fails to take off","A year after launch of the Ujjwala Didi campaign by the Centre for women empowerment, the programme’s benefit is yet to be available out to the intended women beneficiaries in Odisha.

As the Government has not initiated any step for appointment of Ujjwala Didis, a huge amount of sanitary napkins stored at various Sahaj Jan Seva Kendras remain unsold.

The Government had provided equipments worth around Rs 3 lakh required for manufacturing sanitary napkins to four Jan Seva Kendras at Jatni, Khordha and Bhubaneswar last year. The Jan Seva Kendras had also deposited Rs 25 each as security for making of the napkins involving a number of women under the scheme. However, nobody purchased the napkins from the public service centres.

The users reportedly prefer sanitary napkins of several brands available at markets. But the products manufactured by the Sahaj Jan Seva Kendras are not in demand due to lack of Ujjwala Didi campaign among women.

The Government has appointed women under the campaign at panchayats. But the beneficiaries did not participate in the programme actively, informed the scheme coordinator in Khordha district. He, however, said initiative would be taken to address the issue it in future.

Notably, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had launched Ujjwala Didi campaign in Khordha on February 23, 2019.

The Government took the initiative to strengthen them financially by promoting them. In the last one year, the State Government has fulfilled the 7 promises of the manifesto related to cottage and village industries. Process has begun to fulfill the remaining 7 promises.

The State Government gave an opportunity to the students of National Institute of Fashion to connect with Mrignayani Emporium in the first year of its tenure. Under this scheme, if a design by the NIF student is developed for the weavers, 2 to 5 percent of the amount received from its sale will be given as royalty to the concerned students. A wide market was made available to the handloom and handicraft products of the state by signing a contract with Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.

Decision was taken to start new Mrignayani showrooms at Sagar and Chhindwara.

Training and marketing facilities were provided to artisans of Chhatarpur, Morena, Gwalior and Jabalpur districts to increase employment opportunities in the field of stone crafts.

For the first time weavers from Chanderi and Maheshwar were encouraged to produce and market high-grade and quality wedding dresses from the Mriganayani sales centres. As a result, the textile named ‘The Royal Heritage Collection’ of garments made by the weavers of Madhya Pradesh has got a place in the country’s wedding sarees market.

New Mrignayani sales centres were started in Hoshangabad and Betul. Mriganayani showrooms were also started in Hyderabad of Andhra Pradesh, Kevadia in Gujarat and Raipur city in Chhattisgarh. New activities were started in Bhopal’s Gauhar Mahal along with Urban Haat, Indore and Shilp Bazar, Gwalior.

38,09-1-20,Gandhi was born in India but made in South Africa,"On this day in 1915, Mahatma Gandhi had returned from South Africa to India for good. In 2003, it dawned upon some sensible non-resident Indians that migrant Indians should have a commemoration day. They chose ‘January 9' to be known as the Prabasi Bharatiya Divas. Incidentally, South Africa crops up in Indian discourses only when Gandhiji figures in the topic because he had lived there from 1893 until 1915. But Indians had first arrived there in 1860 to work as indentured labourers on the sugar plantations in Natal.

Gandhi had studied law to become a Barrister at Inner Temple in England between 1888 and 1891. He started practising law at the Bombay High Court but could not impress clients at all. Then, he shifted to Rajkot and failed there too. By this time, a few adventurous Indians had migrated to South Africa and set up business ventures. But only a lucky few had met with success. The most prominent among them was Abdullah Haji Adam Jhaveri, who ran a firm, Dada Abdullah & Co with his brother Abdul Karim Jhaveri. The company was one of the biggest South African trading firms operating 15 branches for dealing in imported goods from Germany, India, and England. It also owned a fleet of steam ships. Incidentally, Dada Abdullah had put his cousin Tayob Haji Hkan Mahomed to manage the company's Transvaal branches. In 1890, Tayob bought out the firm's Transvaal operations and incorporated them as ‘TayobHajee Abdulla & Co'. But he messed up business operations and defaulted heavily on payments, for which big legal problems cropped up entangling Abdul Karim.

Dada Abdullah had heard of Gandhi as a British-trained young lawyer in India. He invited Gandhi to be the company lawyer for one full year with a salary of 105 pounds in addition to comfortable stay, food and travel expenses. Gandhi found the offer extremely lucrative as his struggle in India was getting worse than ever before. He accepted the offer instantly and arrived in Durban aboard a ship.

For company work, Dada Abdullah organised a trip for Gandhi to Pretoria by train in first class. But the train authorities threw him out of the compartment because a white man was uncomfortable about an Indian sharing the same space with him. This very incident turned Gandhi stubborn about fighting racial discrimination and inequalities across South Africa. Gandhi resolved never to return until the plight of non-whites changed in South Africa. After his contract with the Abdullah company was over, he worked as a lawyer-cum-activist; and non-whites, particularly Indians, began to recognise him as a messiah. So, he spent 21 years of his most productive life in South Africa to fight for rights of the discriminated lot.

By May 1894, he had organised the Natal Indian Congress. In 1896, he came to India only to organise support from some prominent Indian leaders and went back to South Africa with 800 free-minded Indians whose arrival was vehemently resisted. An enraged white mob attacked Gandhi physically, but he exercised unusual self-restraint as if obeying a divine commandment. His philosophy of winning the detractors with peaceful restraint, thus, turned a habit to subsequently become a lethal, failsafe weapon. Fortunately then, the British government put heavy pressure on the South African administration not to disfranchise Indians arriving there. The Natal Indian Congress by now was engaging in regular nonviolent protests against the oppressive treatment of the white government. When the Boer War broke out in 1899, the humane Gandhi gathered 1,100 Indians to establish ‘Indian Ambulance Corps’ for the British soldiers.

Gandhi suddenly felt he had to start movements in India. Africa was on its own now. So in 1901, he returned to India with family and travelled extensively. He also opened a law office in Bombay to start life afresh. But South African Indians broke down as their crusader of justice was abandoning them. They kept pleading with him not to leave them halfway. So, he returned dutifully to South Africa in 1902 to complete the mission he had begun.

By 1903, Gandhi was leading a life of exemplary discipline and self-restraint. His diet had become severely simple; he was his own doctor; the ‘Bhagwat Gita' had become his handbook of life; and he had begun confronting untouchability issues fiercely. By 1906, after undergoing many trials and tribulations of self-abnegation and eventually Brahmacharya (celibacy), he had become the most formidable force the South African government had ever feared to encounter. Except God, he feared none.

Gandhi set up the Phoenix Farm near Durban, where he trained his cadres on Satyagraha (peaceful restraint). Phoenix Farm is, therefore, known as the birthplace of Satyagraha. Tolstoy Farm was his second unit where Satyagraha was moulded into a unique weapon. He always said English artist John Ruskin's book ‘Unto This Last' had greatly inspired him to set up these human-manufacture outfits. In 1906, Gandhi organised a real big Satyagraha to protest against the Transvaal Asiatic ordinance constituted against the local Indians. Again, in 1907, he held another Satyagraha against the Black Act. In 1908, he was jailed for leading these movements. So in 1909, after a three-month jail term, he went to England to seek assistance of the Indian community there. In 1907, he organised yet another big nonviolent protest against the compulsory registration of Asiatics, which was known as The Black Act. In 1908, he had to go to jail for two months. However, he was released after a special compromise with Jan Christian Smuts, the South African statesman, military leader and philosopher, who was Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1919 to 1924. But he was misunderstood and attacked by his own community for conniving with the enemy. Eventually, Smuts broke the agreement and Gandhi re-launched his Satyagraha with bigger force and vigour. In 1909, he was jailed for three months. After release, he sailed straight for England for support for Indians.

In 1913, he campaigned against nullification of marriages not solemnised according to Christian rights. Then, he launched a huge Satyagraha by leading 2,000 Indian miners across the Transvaal border. He was put in jail. But in no time, they released him unconditionally because he was already a colossal public figure who could cause bigger trouble for the administration. Gandhi's ‘ahimsa’ (nonviolence) weapon had triumphed. Even Smuts had said, “Gandhi is an inspiration for mankind.’

People have completely forgotten Dada Abdullah without whose trust and support Gandhi would never have become a ‘Mahatma’. Abdullah did not have any son to succeed him. And his sole daughter was married in India. Thus, upon his death in 1912, the firm appears to have been dissolved in South Africa. AB Moosa, a fourth-generation descendant of the Abdullah family, takes great pride in the fact that his ancestors had been instrumental in Gandhi's becoming a great soul.

South Africa experiments gave Gandhi the skills of peaceful resistance, which later helped him lead India to Independence. Gandhiji has severally confessed that he was born in India but made in South Africa.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gandhi-was-born-in-india-but-made-in-south-africa.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party Anusuchit Jati Morcha national office bearer Sanjay Nirmal said this while addressing the media here on Wednesday.

He said that SC and Dalit community members have been persecuted the most in Pakistan and Bangladesh. “They are not allowed to undergo education or have the right to equality in society there. They are there only to do menial jobs. They are also forced to convert with the Dalit community facing religious persecution the most. Minorities in Pakistan had dwindled from 23 per cent to three per cent.

They have either been forcibly converted or been killed. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is in their favour but the Congress and other opposition parties are opposing the Act,” said Nirmal. He thanked the prime minister Narendra Modi and Union Home minister Amit Shah for the CAA, stating that the scheduled and Dalit communities are grateful for this.

The public awareness campaign will be stepped up further to inform the members of the scheduled caste and Dalit communities about the CAA and to expose the lies being spread about this Act by the opposition, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opposing-caa-is-anti-dalit--says-sanjay-nirmal.html

Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore on Wednesday presided over a high-level meeting of senior UT officers, wherein the issue of ESZ around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary was discussed.

“The Administration has decided that it will oppose Punjab Government’s proposal, which it has sent to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) proposing only 100 meters of ESZ area around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. In its comments to be submitted to the Union Ministry in the regard, the Administration will raise its objections,” said a senior officer of UT Administration.

In 2017, Chandigarh had declared eco sensitive zone around the sanctuary in the area that falls within the boundary of union territory of Chandigarh. The width of this ESZ in Chandigarh ranges from 2 - 2.75 kms.

However, the area that falls under Punjab and Haryana is yet to be notified as ESZ. Punjab Government has sent a proposal to Government of India recommending only 100 meters width area as ESZ from the boundary of Sanctuary.

This is not the first time that Punjab Government has sent this proposal to the Union Ministry. In 2014 also, the neighboring State Government had proposed just 100 meters area as ESZ around the Sanctuary.

At that time also, the Administration had raised objection to Punjab Government’s proposal following which the Union Ministry had issued directions to the State Government to re-consider its ESZ proposal and make amendments in it. The Administration had also urged the Union Ministry to constitute an Eco Sensitive Zone Authority to oversee the ESZ development.

Meanwhile, Haryana Government is also yet to notify ESZ area around the sanctuary falling under its jurisdiction.

The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary spreads over an area of 26 sq km. According to the UT officials, the catchment area around the Sanctuary is around 36 running kilometers. Out of the total area of catchment, around 10 percent of the perimeter of Sanctuary abuts the city and the major part is along neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana.

Notably, contrary to the guidelines of Union Ministry, the Chandigarh Administration, Punjab and Haryana had in 2012, decided to submit separate proposal of ESZ around the sanctuary falling in their respective jurisdictions.

According to the Union Ministry’s guidelines, “In cases where the boundary of a protected area abuts the boundary of another state/union territory where it does not form part of any protected area, it shall be the endeavour of both the state/UT government to have a mutual consultation and decide upon the width of the ESZ around the protected area in question.”

Admn to provide additional land to the PGIMER

With the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) reeling under immense pressure due to ever-increasing rush of patients, the Administration has decided to provide additional land to the institute to decongest the Outpatient Department.

This was assured by the Administrator during his meeting with Director PGIMER, Dr Jagat Ram to discuss upon various issues pertaining to the institution wherein the support of Administration is required.

The Director PGIMER highlighted the issue of increase in number of patients in the OPD, on which the Administrator decided to give extra land to PGIMER to decongest the OPD. In addition to this, the Director has showed interest in buying two towers from Chandigarh Housing Board for doctors’ accommodation.

The Administrator has also ensured that the officials will deliberate upon shifting of Langar facility to some other place.

UT Admn to increase fare of AC and non-AC buses

During the meeting held under the Administrator, it was decided to increase the fare of buses of both local and long routes by 5 percent.

UT Secretary Transport, A K Singla said that it has been decided that there will be a 5 percent increase in the fares of AC and Non AC buses of both local and long routes buses to neutralize GST.

At present, the CTU has a fleet of around 500 buses which are operating from four depots. Of them, around 400 are plying on intercity routes and the remaining on long routes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-admn-to-raise-objection-on-govt---s-esz-proposal.html
61,09-1-20,AAP seeks white paper on Punjab’s financial status,"Blaming the Congress Government for the acute financial crisis in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said that the steps being initiated to get out of the financial mess by the Capt Amarinder Singh government were “more disappointing”.

“Financially speaking, Punjab Government has been on ventilator. Capt Amarinder Singh and Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, instead of salvaging the economy out of the mess, are pushing it into abysmal financial crisis,” said AAP leaders, including the state core committee chairman and MLA Principal Budh Ram, Deputy Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Sarabjit Kaur Manuke, NRI state wing president Jai Singh Singh Rouri and MLA Kulwant Singh Singh Pandori, in a joint statement.

“It would have been better had the government taken on all kinds of mafias, rampant corruption from top-to-bottom corruption and plugged other leakages to bring back the state economy to the pink of health,” said AAP leader while accusing the Government of buying time to save its skin by resorting to immature measures, which reflected its proclivity to mend the loopholes.

AAP leaders said that the government doctors were denied the non-practice allowances (NPA), by allowing them to do private practice, forcing the police personnel to do 24-hour duty instead of eight-hour, and denying them 13-month salary in lieu of that they had been receiving for decades, its hard decisions by imposing a quantum cut to the tune of 20 percent in government departments, which would not suffice enough to salvage it from the financial crisis.

As long as the Capt Government did not show enough willpower and honesty and continued to extend protection to sand mafia, alcohol mafia, road mafia, power mafia, cable mafia, transport mafia, market mafia, health mafia, education mafia and land mafia and end deep-rooted corruption, the state would continue to be reel under the financial, they said.

Principal Budh Ram and Manuke demanded that the government should bring out a ‘white paper’ on Punjab’s financial health during the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha session. “Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal should share their concrete strategy to overcome the financial crisis with the people at large,” they said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-seeks-white-paper-on-punjab---s-financial-status.html

66,09-1-20,"Train, bus services hit in Brahmapur","The Bharat Bandh was successfully observed by activists of the central trade unions, the Congress and the Left parties here on Wednesday.

By its impact, train and bus services were disrupted and shops, hotels and bazaars remained closed till afternoon as activists kept blocking roads and staging picketing at different places in the city.

Agitators alleged that the NDA Government at the Centre has failed in brining development during the last six months. “Prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed. The country has been pushed to a weak economy. While unemployment problem has been acute, employees are not getting equal pay for equal work. The Union Government is planning to change labour laws in favour of corporate houses,” alleged actives of INTUC, CITU, HSS, AITUC, AICCTU and all bank associations.

They demanded that the Government take early steps for controlling pries of essential commodities and providing minimum wage of Rs 21,000 per month to workers. The other demands include stopping of amendment of labour laws in favour of corporate houses, preventing of privatization of public sector undertakings and stopping of 100 per cent FDI in retail markets.

Besides central TUs and political parties, members of local organisations like Odisha Adarsha Vidyalaya Class IV Union and Brahmapur Mobile and Electronics Retailers’ Association organised rallies separately.

Protestors were also seen holding banners with mentions of slogans like “Reject CAB”, “Boycott NRC”, etc.

67,09-1-20,BJP will have to pay heavy price for stubbornness on CAA: Amarinder,"Taking former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Shiv Raj Chauhan head on over the threat of the Centre implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at any cost, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would have to pay a heavy price for such stubbornness.

“An elected government, which refuses to heed the voice of its people or respond to their anger, is bound to lose their confidence and collapse,” warned the Chief Minister, adding that the BJP’s stance on the issue smacked of a dangerously fascist approach that would lead to their eventual downfall.

At the same time he made it clear that as far as the Congress led Punjab Government was concerned, “there is no way it will allow the brazenly divisive Act to be implemented in Punjab”.

“You cannot force us to do so,” he declared, even as he reiterated that neither he nor the Congress was against grant of citizenship of persecuted minorities in other countries, such as Sikhs in Pakistan, but “they are completely opposed to the discrimination in the CAA against certain religious communities, including Muslims”.

Despite the nationwide public outrage over the controversial CAA, the BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre was refusing to acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the legislation, said the Chief Minister, lashing out at Chauhan for his shockingly inconsiderate remarks on the issue.

It was obvious that Chauhan, like other BJP leaders, had no inkling of the implications or consequences of the CAA, nor did he apparently want to understand the same, said Capt Amarinder in a hard-hitting reaction to the comments made by Chauhan a day before in Ludhiana.

“Chauhan absolutely had no idea what he was talking about, nor had he bothered to study the Act, which has triggered massive public protests across the country,” said the Chief Minister adding that there protests were not “the brainchild of the Congress” or any other party, as Chauhan was claiming, but the result of a spontaneous outrage among Indians cutting across religious and party lines.

“Does Chauhan really believe that the lakhs of people, including youth and students, who had come out on the streets to brave bullets and lathis, were Congress supporters?” asked Capt Amarinder. “Can’t he or the other BJP leaders hear the voice of these protestors, majority of whom have no personal stake in the matter?” he added.

It was obvious that the CAA had become an ego issue for the ruling BJP and its leadership, which had closed its eyes to the damage it would cause to the Indian democratic polity, especially in conjunction with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said.

The people of India were no fools, and could see how the CAA was designed to destroy the nation’s secular charter, said the Chief Minister, adding that India would not forgive the BJP and its allies for their attempt to demolish the bedrock of its future.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-will-have-to-pay-heavy-price-for-stubbornness-on-caa--amarinder.html
68,09-1-20,Sukhbir dares Capt to cancel PPAs,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Wednesday challenged Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to cancel the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) arrived with private thermal plants with immediate effect if there was anything wrong in the agreements which were drafted by Dr Manmohan Singh led Congress Government at the Centre.

At the same time, Sukhbir alleged that money had changed hands and private players had been benefitted by the Congress Government which practiced deliberate laxity in pursuing disputes involving Rs 2,500 crore on account of coal washing charges and a Rs 1,602 crore Tribunal award.

“Punjab and the interests of Punjabis are paramount to the SAD. In case there is anything wrong in the PPAs, they should be cancelled. In fact, it is strange why this is not done since three years. The entire PPA and how it was drafted under the leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh should be probed,” said Sukhbir.

“Anyone accusing us of signing wrong PPAs with private companies is in fact accusing Dr Manmohan Singh of preparing a faulty PPA as we followed central directives word to word,” he said.

He added that that party demand an independent probe into the undue benefit of Rs 1400 crore given to private thermal plant managements and an additional benefit of Rs 1100 crore expected to be given imminently on account of coal washing charges which had been falsely claimed by them.

“Congress Government did not pursue the case against release of coal washing charges to private plants appropriately in the Supreme Court. This is a case of match fixing. It is because of this underhand deal with the private plants that the State will have to pay Rs 2,500 crore to them despite the fact that during the previous SAD-BJP government, the case was properly pursued and the contention of private plants was rejected both by the PSERC and APTEL,” he argued.

Sukhbir said that in the second case, the Congress Government’s petition for review of Rs 1,602 crore dispute was rejected by the High Court because it did not challenge the award of the Tribunal dismissing its application for two and a half years.

“This inexplicable delay has given an undue benefit to Eastern Minerals and Trading Agency (EMTA) also seems to be a result of match fixing. Both scams should be probed by an independent agency and the latest power tariff increase should be taken back pending inquiry,” he demanded.

Giving details, the SAD president said that if the common man and the industry were suffering in Punjab today due to repeated power tariff hikes, it was due to the corrupt practices of the Congress Government as well as its inefficiencies.

“Repeated power tariff hikes have resulted in an Rs 8,000 crore increase per annum putting an additional burden of over Rs 20,000 crore on the people which has affected the monthly budget of every family in the State,” he added.

He said that despite a clear track record, the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were trying to mislead the people to hide their failures.

Terming the Congress Government as the most incompetent, insensitive and inefficient government ever, Sukhbir asked Pradesh Congress president Sunil Jakhar not to play politics and ask his government why the PPAs were not being cancelled.

“Jakhar should realize he is not leader of the opposition. If PPAs are not in interest of the State, why haven’t they been cancelled since three years? If Jagan Reddy can cancel the State capital Amravati, what is a PPA? The Congress government cannot pass on the buck to us,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sukhbir-dares-capt-to-cancel-ppas.html

75,09-1-20,Tabrez Ansari’s lynching case rocks Assembly,"The Jharkhand Assembly on Wednesday witnessed uproarious scenes when Congress legislator Irfan Ansari dragged the name of RSS and BJP into the lynching of Tabrez Ansari last year.

Ansari, the Congress MLA from Jamtara, speaking on the thanksgiving motion to the Governor’s address said that BJP and RSS were responsible for the killing of Tabrez Ansari, inviting wrath from BJP lawmakers.

Tabrez Ansari, a labourer and weilder in Pune was lynched last year June when he had come to his hometown Seraikela to celebrate Eid when he was captured by locals at Dhatkidih village over suspicion of trying to steal a motorcycle.

The police probing case first had dropped murder charge against 11 accused in lynching case but brought back the same charge after obtaining a fresh medical report.

Speaking on thanksgiving motion, Irfan Ansari said, “This is Hemant Soren government there will be no Kamal Club.

The Government will carry out probe on all the schemes and project launched by previous governments as there is smell of corruption in all. The government will also carry out probe in mob lynching case of Tabrez Ansari as BJP/RSS members were behind the mob lynching case.”

As Irfan mentioned the name of RSS/BJP behind Tabrez’s murder, the BJP lawmakers started demanding that the ‘unsavoury’ remark made about the BJP and the RSS should be expunged and said that the Congress legislator should express regrets about making such a comment. The legislators came to the well of the House demanding an apology and expunging of the remark.

As the BJP members were adamant over the demand seeking apology from Irfan, there was heated debate between Congress and BJP members. Speaker RN Mahto tried to maintain decorum of the House, but the BJP members were adamant over the demand.

Senior BJP leader and former Assembly speaker CP Singh said, “Irfan Ansari before making any allegation should understand the matter. What is the proof of the Irfan Ansari’s allegation?”

Assembly Speaker Rabindranath Mahto pacified the BJP legislators and asked them to return to their seats, but the BJP lawmakers were adamant to their demands. The Speaker later expunged the Congress legislator's remark. However, the BJP MLAs stuck to the demand for an apology by Irfan Ansari and again came to the well of the House. “Dismiss Irfan Ansari from House” and “Irfan Ansari must tender apology” were some of the slogans raised by the BJP legislators.

As the Speaker’s move to pacify the BJP legislators failed, the Speaker left the apology issue to the conscience of the Congress MLA. But Irfan Ansari refused to apologise leading to BJP legislators raising more slogans forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House.

Reacting on the issue State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Sahdeo said, “What Irfan Ansari alleged today would be considered a dark chapter in parliamentary history of State. People like Irfan Ansari are not aware that RSS is an organization strengthening national ideology.

And, crores of its volunteers are engaged in the service of the country day and night. Similarly, BJP does politics of service and not power.

The march converted in rally at Raj Bhavan. Hundreds of people from various areas of Ranchi came on the streets to join the Mahadharna. This led to traffic jams on many major roads of the State Capital. At the same time, former MP Pappu Yadav, Congress leader Ajay Nath Sahdeo and activist Dayamani Barla also reached the spot and addressed the people.

The protesters also raised slogans like Freedom (Azadi) from NRC and CAA. People arrived to join the Mahadharna with Tricolours in their hands and placards written against the CAA, NRC and NPR. Earlier, people from minority community closed their shops on Main Road in Ranchi city to join the agitation.

People joined the march from Daily Market, Doranda, Hindpiri, Ratan Talkies and Ekra Mosque and expressed outrage against NRC and CCA. The police had made elaborate security arrangements. At the same time, Shivaji Maidan of Palamu was evacuated in protest against CAA and NRC.

Due to the sudden arrival of thousands of people in the procession on the streets, the traffic was completely halted the main road area of the State Capital. Vehicles were parked on the streets. People continued to look for alternative routes, but they could not get rid of the problems. Despite the traffic police’s efforts, people could not get rid of the traffic jam. School children were completely trapped in the jam.

Addressing the protesters at the Raj Bhawan, Yadav alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central Government was trying to implement NRC in the Country to target a particular community. “Minorities are being targeted under the Act. The Union Government wants to oust the minorities from and want to snatch the voting rights of this community. This is time to unite against atrocities of the Government and fight against it,” he added.

“The protests have broken out across the Country. The Act seeks to amend the illegal immigration for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. It discriminates against Muslim and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution,” said Yadav.

The former MP said that this violates basic tenets of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, the right to equality to all persons.

“The basic structure of the Constitution cannot be reshaped by any Government and yet the Government maintains that it does not discriminate or violate the right to equality,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protests-begin-in-state-against-caa--nrc.html

83,09-1-20,Over 440 mutation cases disposed in Palamu in a day,"Palamu administration has cracked whip against circle office level employees to expedite cases of mutation.

DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said on Wednesday, “During my review of the land revenue matters, I noticed a good number of mutation cases pending.

I decided to hold a special camp for this on January 5 and got it done as our Anchal offices remained opened this Sunday, where our officials did more than 440 cases of mutation.”

Asked that mutation of land is to be done in 30 days from the date of the filing of application for it Agrahari said this is very true but sometimes there crops up many objections and complaints and that hold up the mutation but nevertheless even such cases are to be disposed of in 90 days.

Sources said that two big elections in one calendar year with a strict imposition of model code of conduct left many things either non started or unfinished as human resources got busy in it.

When told that lower rung revenue officials, who handle register 2 a very vital land record sleeps over the issue of mutation DC Agrahari said the State knows this very well and here measures have been taken to screw them not to sit tight over any mutation matter.

“A common man gets too happy if his bought land gets mutated in his name.

He begins to deposit land lagan as well. The more it is done fast the more it wins the confidence of the people,” he said.

On January 5, 20 circle offices remained opened and solo work mutation was undertaken. Sources said NIC Palamu too was kept opened as there is a portal of it and in case of any server error the revenue officials at Anchal level could have taken help from the NIC.

Sources said there occurred some server error on Sunday otherwise the number of completion of mutation cases would have gone up further.

Sources said as the administration is feverishly identifying a chunk of 10 acres of Government land to set up a multi crore solid waste material management plant its officials stumbled upon a shocking fact that people with whom GM land was settled for their being landless, homeless at one point of time and which is in no condition a transferable or saleable one but inheritable one, such beneficiary of land has sold such land much in contravention of rule of GM land bandobasti to which DC said, “ No GM land settled so can be sold, purchased or transferred except its possession by inheritance and any breach of it gives the administration power and right to take back such land in the event of its being sold, purchased and transferred.

Close to this mutation camp that was held on Sunday the administration is toying with the idea to start a similar camp for disbursement of caste certificates among the applicants to which DC said, “We are working on it too.

The date for this is not yet finalised but let me assure that there will be a camp across the district for disbursement of caste certificates also.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/over-440-mutation-cases-disposed-in-palamu-in-a-day.html

90,09-1-20,Various trade unions participate in strike against Govt policies,"Various trade unions undertook part in the nation-wide strike held on Wednesday. A number of union members participated in the protest demonstration despite the rain in Dehradun.

State working president of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Samar Bhandari said, “Everyone from the public to the private sector including banks, defence, transport, oil, coal have come together in opposition of the anti-worker policies of the current Government which makes it easy to deduce the damage done by the Government across the country.

Besides, the laws and orders which were approved after considerable struggle in the past for labourers and employees have been shamelessly transformed,”he alleged.

Power engineers association general secretary Mukesh Kumar said that the Government claims that all of its policies and decisions are for the public, but everyone knows privatisation of the PSUs is not for public welfare.

In fact, the whole point of privatising some PSUs is to benefit certain powerful people who in turn help Government during elections, he alleged. He further said, “The strike is just a representation of people’s anger and disappointment withGovernment policies. If the Government ignores our voices, the next time our protest will be more firm and stronger.” Members of the Left parties also participated in the strike and the protest against the Government.

“All these years, the Government has been disappointing the people of working class from all sectors. Moreover, the Government has failed to do anything prolific and functional for the youth.

If truth be told, the Modi Government has made the situation worse. The increasing rate of unemployment and uncontrolled inflation in prices of every item are the best examples of the proper functioning of the Government” said Pranjal Mishra, a member of Communist Party of India (Marxist). Apart from trade unions, some college students participated in the strike too. “We are here to show our disappointment towards the Government. Under the supervision of current ministers, to get an education has been made impossible for economically backward students”, said Abhishek Gusain, a DAV College student.

Giving his own example, he explains, “Our examination fee in the college has hiked almost three-fold from Rs 700. I belong to a lower middle-class family and students like me cannot afford to pay such a hefty amount during every examination session. The Government should at least spare education and poor students.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/various-trade-unions-participate-in-strike-against-govt-policies.html

The three hired shooters allegedly carried out the murder for an offer of Rs 10 lakh given to shoot Alam by Abid who shared an old rivalry with the victim. The police arrested Naeem and Salman for the murder and Dilshad for being involved in the crime.

Alam was shot dead by bike borne assailants outside the court in Ramnagar, Roorkee on the evening of December 20. Addressing the media, the superintendent of police (rural) Swapn Kishore Singh said that police investigation focused on the old animosity Alam had with Kamelpur resident Abid.

Alam's brother Muzammil was murdered in 2010 allegedly by Abid and his family members. After this, in 2012, Alam had allegedly murdered Abid's brother Farooq. The investigation after Alam’s murder revealed the involvement of Abid and his elder brother Ashiq in the murder.

Abid had offered to pay Rs 10 lakh to Muzaffarnagar resident Wasim for killing Alam.

Abid met Wasim while in jail in the Muzammil murder case. There are more than 30 cases against Wasim in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Wasim sent his brothers Naeem and Salman to assassinate Alam.

Abid’s relative Farhan helped the duo identify their target who was shot on December 20. The SP further informed that Abid had planned the murder while in jail.

99,09-1-20,Ranchi Science Centre to order ‘attractive’ tickets for visitors,"The Ranchi Science Centre (RSC) has placed orders for fresh entry and parking tickets, with pictures of the infrastructure, in order to attract more guests and keep objections regarding the lack of proper tickets at bay, officials said on Wednesday. The development came in the wake of objections raised by some visitors against the temporary arrangement of tickets for parking and entry purposes.

Lately, the RSC was using old entry tickets as parking tickets and giving entry tickets printed on plain white papers to visitors. Some visitors had raised objections to the use of old entry tickets as parking tickets and also questioned if the money taken as entry fee was going to the proper authority or siphoned off by middlemen.

“We have placed orders at a printing press for fresh parking and entry tickets. The tickets will have pictures of the Ranchi Science Centre. They will not only be attractive, but also help in minimizing any possibility of financial anomalies or misappropriation of funds,” said RSC Director GSP Gupta.

Gupta agreed that the RSC administration was taking steps to check expenses due to lack of fund in its treasury. He said that the RSC had surplus entry tickets that were not valid anymore and decided to use them as parking tickets – Rs.10 handwritten on them with pen. “We do not have sufficient funds in our account. All the money coming from parking and entry tickets goes directly to our bank account. However, we had to get fresh tickets printed as some visitors raised objections,” added Gupta.

A Yoga teacher, Prashant, recently met the RSC Director and raised objection to the use of old tickets and sought a clarification on how the cash was accounted. The Yoga teacher also shared a copy of the tickets with The Pioneer. “The visitors have the right to know whether their money is going to the right people. The Science Centre authorities should use only authentic tickets in order to avoid any confusion,” he said.

The RSC – an infrastructure that also boasts Ranchi’s only planetarium – charges Rs.10 for parking and Rs.20 as entry fee. On some instances, students are given free entry too, said officials. Inaugurated in October last year, the planetarium has a 360 degree hemispherical projection screen, on which the animated sky is projected. Built at a cost of Rs 26 crore, the planetarium is spread in 2 acres and has seating capacity of 145 people for watching the celestial, starry and astronomical motions. The planetarium built by Jharkhand Council of Science Technology & Innovations, which is part of Department of Science and Technology has been named after Varahamihira, an Indian philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchi-science-centre-to-order----attractive----tickets-for-visitors.html

Work on the undergrounding of cables has been undertaken in various parts of the city and is now about to be started at the Har ki Paidi and surrounding area.

City president of the Vyapar Mandal, Sanjeev Nayyar said that the meeting was held with the officials in view of the thousands of people who arrive in the area daily.

He said that the market area in the locality is small, so if the ground is dug up and left as in the other areas, it would create major inconvenience.

General secretary of the Vyapar Mandal, Pradeep Kalra said that officials of the electricity department should start the work when they have enough resources, otherwise the problem will increase for both the traders and the electricity department. Executive engineer of the undergrounding project, Ankit Jain said that the survey for the work is going on in small market area. Since the road in the market is small, the sewer line and other facilities had been laid in a zig zag pattern which would make the undergrounding project a bit difficult.

If the department is convinced of the feasibility, the project will be executed in the market area but work in Har ki Paidi and upper road will begin soon.

It is pertinent to mention here that with the first week of January already passing, the advent of pilgrims in Haridwar is expected to pick up pace around the Shivratri fair in February.

115,09-1-20,Patiala Central jail Supt shifted out,"Days after the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee’s (SGPC) delegation met Khalistani militant Balwant Singh Rajoana — currently on death row for assassinating the then Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh — inside Patiala Central Jail, the jail superintendent Bhupinderjit Singh Virk has been shifted to the Punjab Police’s headquarter at Chandigarh.

Virk will be replaced by Kapurthala Central Jail Superintendent SP Khanna, who joined his new posting on Wednesday.

The decision came a day after a probe was ordered into the meeting at Patiala Central Jail Superintendent’s office and photos were also clicked inside the office. The probe was ordered after Beant Singh’s grandson and Congress Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu submitted a written complaint to Punjab Jail Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and sought to probe the matter.

The Minister had directed the state Principal Secretary (Prisons) to conduct the probe by going through the jail manual and act against the erring official.

Demanding probe, Bittu had pointed that the Patiala Central Jail Superintendent had “violated the jail manual” by allowing the SGPC delegation, led by its president Gobind Singh Longowal, to meet Rajoana in his office.

“It is even more disturbing that photos of meeting were circulated by SGPC. A group photo of delegation seated around Rajoana comes as a shocker, especially to the Congress workers, who have fought relentlessly against terrorism,” wrote Bittu.

Bittu had asserted that he was unable to comprehend the rules of the Jail Manual under which the delegation entered the office with their cell phones, and click photos with terrorist sentenced to death.

“Moreover, all this is happening when our party is ruling the State,” he stated while demanding a detailed investigation and punishment to the jail administration for “defying” jail rules.

Taking serious note of the incident, Randhawa had underlined that it was a serious matter as no visitor was allowed to carry the phone inside jail.

The Minister noted that the SGPC president can visit the Superintendent office, while at the same time pointing that no one should have been allowed to carry their phones inside the jail premises.

Notably, Rajoana has deferred his January 11 hunger strike after meeting the SGPC president who assured him of all help in pursuing his appeal for commuting his death sentence.

Rajoana had decided to go on a stir against the SGPC for its “lack of support” in pursuing his appeal for commuting his death sentence.

Earlier, the Central Government had included Rajoana’s name to the list of Sikh prisoners for granting special remission as a humanitarian gesture on the 550th parkash purb of Guru Nanak Dev.

However, in December first week, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted in the Parliament that no pardon was granted to Rajoana.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/patiala-central-jail-supt-shifted-out.html

Sweeping changes for the sector have been envisioned in the new MSME Development and Startup policies- 2019. The new development plans, besides offering a raft of incentives also provide for the ease of doing business in the state.

The new MSME policy provides for a grant for building construction, besides plant and machinery, and aims at boosting participation from women entrepreneurs and those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

While the state provides 40 percent assistance to any new entrepreneur, the grant has been raised by eight percent in case of women, scheduled castes and tribes, and 10 percent in case of women belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes.

Enterprises involved in export will now be provided a grant amounting to 52 percent, while an additional subsidy on electricity consumption has been made available to power-loom units of up to 20 horsepower.

Special packages have been formulated for power-loom, readymade garments and pharmaceutical industries.

The Startup policy has created a revolving seed support fund of Rs 10 crore and plans are afoot for creation of a venture funding capital of Rs 50 crore.

Provisions have been made for providing up to Rs 50 lakh advance support for projects under the Technology Business Incubation (TBI) plan approved by the central government.

Additional incentives have also been planned to promote startups established by women and those belonging to the SC/ST classes.

Officials say that startups will be reimbursed expenses incurred while participating in national and international programmes to promote their businesses. They affirm that ventures in the state will be provided all assistance at every stage.

Economists say the MSME sector is crucial to socio-economic progress and describe it as an 'engine of growth'. They explain that besides creating large scale employment opportunities and arresting regional disparities, the sector is vital for the distribution of wealth in a society.

Industry watchers say that the presence of Kamal Nath at the helm of the state government has enthused entrepreneurs who look forward to drawing on his vast experience in the sphere of commerce and industry.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/policy-revamp-for-msme-sector-in-mp.html

121,09-1-20,"AAP failed to fulfil its pre-poll promises, claims BJP think-tank","After Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia challenged the BJP to showcase its model of development, BJP think tank claimed that before the 2015 Delhi election, the Aam Aadmi Party had promised it would add 30,000 beds in city Government hospitals if elected, but it could manage just 394.

BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Public Policy Research Centre (PPRC) director in presence of party MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Meenakshi Lekhi released a report on Wednesday called 'Delhi: A City on Ventilator'.

The report, based on RTI queries and field visits of hospitals and other health infrastructure of Delhi Government, also listed ""shortcomings"" in Mohalla Clinic network, a pet project of the AAP Government.

Sumit Bhasin, another PPRC director said that healthcare in Delhi has been one of the main planks of AAP government's publicity. ""In this background, it is pertinent that the Government is held accountable for the steps that it claims to have undertaken for bettering healthcare services in its hospitals,"" he added.

Bhasin said that when asked about the education system of Delhi, Manish Sisodia panicked and tried to mislead the people of Delhi by pointing at other states. ""Why is he so scared to even talk about the Delhi's education? Because the truth is that the AAP government crushed millions of futures,' he said.

He further said that AAP Government cheated the people of Delhi by not sanctioning a single government school in the last five years while it promised to construct 500 new schools before coming to power. ""AAP should answer why Delhi government schools' class X pass percentage came down from 95.81 per cent in 2015 to 71.58 per cent in 2019. On the other hand, KendriyaVidyalayas improved from 99.59 per cent to 99.79 per cent in same period,"" he added.

""Far from tripling hospital beds to 30,000, the Kejriwal government could add a mere 394 beds in five years. It stands exposed on this front since it could add only 7 beds every month for the first 56 months of its rule,"" Bidhuri said, pointing out the findings in the report.

Speaking on the performance of Mohalla Clinics, Sahasrabuddhe said they do not match the standards of a primary healthcare centre and are more like health sub-centres.

Lekhi pointed that the AAP government in its five-year tenure has been pulled up multiple times by the Delhi High Court over its inability to meet the growing healthcare demands of people in the city.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-failed-to-fulfil-its-pre-poll-promises--claims-bjp-think-tank.html

132,09-1-20,"Govt did nothing to improve health, edu sectors: Cong","Launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government, the Delhi Congress on Wednesday alleged that the Government has done nothing to improve health and education sectors in the national Capital.

Congress Chief Spokesperson Mukesh Sharma said that nearly 7,809 people died at the Dilshad Garden Cancer Institute in the last five years from 2014 to 2019 due to the negligence of the Government. ""The Kejriwal Government has broken the backbone of health services in Delhi by making people depend on Mohalla Clinics for treatments while the senior AAP leaders including Chief Minister spent in lakh for treatment in private hospital,"" he added.

Citing a data, he said that Kejriwal has spent Rs 12, 80,271 for his treatment in private hospitals outside Delhi. While Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia spent Rs 13, 21,329 for his treatment and Minister Gopal Rai spent over Rs 7 lakh for his treatment, he said, asking that why they did they visit private hospitals if they believe that they have improved health services in Government hospitals in Delhi.

Addressing the media, Sharma explained that out of the sanctioned strength of 283 doctors, only 187 posts have been filled while out of the sanctioned strength of 820 para-medical staff, only 493 posts have been filled that too when Congress was in power.

""The AAP Government has not opened a single new blood bank in the last five years while during the Congress rule 25 new blood banks were added,"" he said. He said that in the current financial year, out of the allotted budget of Rs 3,737 crore, only Rs 259.73 crore were spent till September, 2019.

He said the AAP had promised to construct 500 new schools before the 2015 assembly elections but opened only one single school in the last five years.

Sharma said that four operation theatres in the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital have been shut due to shortage of equipment while 17 per cent operation theatres in various Government hospitals are lying unused due to lack of facilities, he said, adding that a 500-bed Government medical college and hospital at Dwarka has been constructed but has not been made functional yet.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-did-nothing-to-improve-health--edu-sectors--cong.html

to Tiwari's poll promise, Kejriwal said ""Five times more subsidies. Meaning? Instead of 200 units you will give 1,000 units free. Instead of 20 thousand litres, 1 lakh litres of water will be given free? You are making fun of the public with such promises,""

Implement it before Delhi elections in any one BJP ruled state?"" he said in a tweet, tagging a news report about Tiwari promising five times the present subsidy.

135,09-1-20,CRPF DIG charged with throwing hot water on jawan; probe ordered,"Having burnt his mouth upon drinking hot water served to him by a jawan, an enraged Deputy Inspector General of CRPF allegedly threw it on the subordinate’s face. The paramilitary has since ordered an enquiry into the incident.

The purported incident took place on Tuesday at the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Recruit Training Centre (RTC) in Bihar’s Rajgir district.

DIG D K Tripathi, who was staying at the officers’ mess of the RTC for an official work, had ordered hot drinking water. Constable Amol Kharat was on duty at the facility and he served him the water in a thermos flask, officials said.

The officer, posted at the CRPF group centre in Mokamaghat in Bihar, is said to have burnt his mouth upon drinking the hot water, following which he summoned Kharat. An altercation ensued between the two and the DIG “threw” hot water on the jawan’s face. The injured jawan has been admitted to a local hospital, they said.

Officials said a preliminary enquiry by an Inspector General of the CRPF has been ordered. The enquiry report, along with specific recommendations, is expected by January 10 only after which the exact sequence of events and culpability could be established, they said.

An association of ex-paramilitary officials said the jawan “is being pressured to give statement that the burn injuries were due to spilling of boiled water from the flask”.

Visual footages that immediately went viral showing how the policemen were smashing the wind screens of cars parked in a big field with rifle butts, pouring fuel and then setting ablaze immediately drew large-scale media attention. The incident took place within metres of a spot where pro-bandh agitators were barricading the high way.

“Such heinous plans to torch the vehicles and then hold the CPI(M) workers liable were fortunately shot by the locals... The incidents only make clear the real face of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Her police is no different from the police of Yogi Adtiyanath… They did it in Lucknow to frame the anti-CAA rallyists, the Bengal Police did it in Bengal,” senior CPI(M) leader Md Salim said adding “in a State where not a leaf turns without the instruction of the Chief Minister how could they torch so many vehicles. It must be probed.”

President of the Pradesh Congress which also co-sponsored the general strike demanded an “impartial inquiry to get to the core of the conspiracy.” Another Congress leader and former Minister Manoj Chakrabarty demanded “judicial probe into the incident so that things become clear.”

Eye witnesses said how the police men were seen smashing the windscreens with rifle butts and stones. They were also seen carrying petrol cans to the vehicles, soaking them before setting them afire, sources said.

While there was no word from the Chief Minister her senior ministerial colleague Partho Chatterjee said the “culprits will be brought to

book,” adding it would be looked into details to figure out whether some Left miscreants were doing the mischief in the garb of police men or some cops were genuinely

involved.

“No one will be spared by committing violence… this is the policy of our Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee,” he said even as sources said the Malda Superintendant of Police had been asked to probe the matter.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde asked the Centre to devise appropriate methods to ensure compliance of this condition.

“We see no reason why the area which has been mined should not be restored so that grass and other vegetation including trees can grow in the mining area for the benefit of animals.

“We are of the view that this can be achieved by directing the Union of India to impose a condition in the mining lease and a similar condition in the environmental clearance and the mining plan to the effect that the mining lease holders shall, after ceasing mining operations, undertake re-grassing the mining area and any other area which may have been disturbed due to their mining activities and restore the land to a condition which is fit for growth of fodder, flora, fauna etc,” the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said.

143,09-1-20,"Interact more, take students into confidence, V-C advised","The HRD Ministry on Wednesday made it clear to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar that he should not only be more communicative with students but also take them into confidence.

Jagadesh was summoned to HRD Ministry where he met HRD Secretary Amit Khare. Jagadesh had “missed” important meetings at the HRD Ministry at the backdrop of violence in JNU.

Sources said that senior HRD Ministry officials questioned the V-C as to why he did not inform the police as soon as the scuffle between two groups was brought to his notice. He was told that normalcy should be restored at the earliest since the prestigious university is being discussed across the world now as it has international students as well, the sources maintained.

“The V-C was taken aback by the tough stand by the HRD Ministry and took time to respond. In his reply he said that he did not presume that the clash between the two groups could turn out to be so violent that too so soon. He committed for a safe university and a more responsive administration,” sources said.

The JNU V-C, who has been severely criticised by students and faculty members for not doing enough when they were brutally attacked by a masked mob on the campus on Sunday evening, told the ministry officials that efforts were being made to facilitate the semester registration process for “willing” students.

“Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare and Joint Secretary GC Hosur had a meeting with JNU VC at the ministry on Wednesday about the efforts being made to restore normalcy on campus. He informed the officials about efforts being made for facilitating semester registration for willing students and a conducive environment for their academic pursuits,” the ministry said in a press release.

The VC later took to Twitter to inform about the meeting at HRD Ministry. He clarified that university has not made any suggestions to temporarily shut the varsity and efforts are being made to restore normalcy.

On Monday, a day after the violence on JNU campus, JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar visited the ministry and updated the top brass about the situation besides submitting a detailed report on the sequence of events that led to the violence. The V-C did not attend the meeting. On Tuesday, he urged students to “put the past behind” and return to studies.

The Left, that controls JNUSU, and the ABVP have blamed each other for the violence that continued for two hours. That night, the HRD ministry sought an immediate report from the registrar. CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said around 100 MPs will write a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind demanding sacking of the JNU V-C. “Many MPs, around 100 of them, have been contacted and they have decided to write a letter to the President, who is the Visitor to the University, demanding sacking of the VC,” Yechury said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/interact-more--take-students-into-confidence--v-c-advised.html
144,09-1-20,Violence marks bandh in Bengal,"Normal life was considerably hit in Bengal even as sporadic violence and arson marked Wednesday’s general strike sponsored by Left and Congress trade unions prompting both Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the BJP to interpret the bandh as a desperate attempt by a moribund Left Front to catch limelight once again.

Reports of violence poured in from Barasat, in North 24 Parganas, Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, Burdwan, Malda, South Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri and other places police said adding 170 strikers including CPI(M) Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakrabarty had been arrested.

Violence reached its crescendo at Sujapur in Malda district where police fought pitched battle with angry protesters opposing CAA and NRC. About eight vehicles including a few belonging to the police were torched allegedly by the protesters leading the cops to burst tear gas shells and fire rubber bullets injuring a number of them.

Though life reverted to near-normal by late noon the Left and the Congress took out long processions in parts of Kolkata demanding immediate release of its leaders. At Park Circus Maidan (a minority dominated area) hundreds of Muslim women sat on indefinite dharna demanding withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens.

The strikers who had initially targeted socio-economic issues as subject matter of the bandh in the final hours smartly included CAA and NRC to widen the scope of

participation. The tactic seemed to partially pay off with the strike witnessing more than 50 percent success sources in the administration said adding however that the Government offices in the wake of a strong circular from the State secretariat witnessed near-99 percent attendance.

While air services remained normal train services were substantially affected authorities said adding about 127 suburban trains from Sealdah and 47 from Howrah had to be cancelled. This, in addition to about the route of a dozen express getting changed due to the impact of the strike.

Sources in the State electricity boards reported lesser consumption of power indicating partial success of the bandh. “Reports collected at 10 am showed the power consumption level at 4012 MW, 250 MW less than the normal, driving home the fact that strike had its impact despite contradictory claims made by the Government,” said one of the striking leaders adding “the power department stopped releasing further reports for obvious reasons.”

Even as the day peaked reports of violence came in from various parts of the State. At Hridaypur in North 24 Parganas crude bombs were recovered from underneath a local train. Buses and other vehicles were vandalised in Burdwan, Durgapur, Howrah and Kolkata even as the drivers were seen driving their vehicles with helmets on.

Traffic were blockaded by the Left and Congress workers at Jadavpur and Rashbehari crossing with their supporters throwing burning tryres on the roads. The impact of the strike was near complete at Raiganj and Durgapur, the home town of JNSU president Aishi Ghosh where the protesters were seen attacking bikers.

All banks and post offices remained closed causing immense hardships to the people. Schools were however partially affected as the number of attendance was thin.

Meanwhile the Chief Minister attacked the Left for sacrificing its ideology. “CPIM has no ideology. Planting bombs on railway tracks is nothing but ‘gundagardi, she said. In the name of movement, commuters are being beaten up and stones are being pelted. This is ‘dadagiri’, not a movement. I condemn this. I will not allow such movements.

The Marxists are trying to get back their relevance but they will never be able to do that unless they change their style of functioning. I think the communists of Kerala are far better than those in Bengal. At least they have a policy and act according to ideology. In Bengal they are all ruffians.”

Attacking the hoodlums BJP’s Dilip Ghosh said “the Trinamool Congress has helped the Left Front to make violence a success because they want the Left to get some oxygen so as to divide the anti-TMC opposition in Bengal. But people have understood and will give Mamata Banerjee a befitting reply.”

The Left leaders including politburo member Biman Bose congratulated the people for making the bandh a success “despite brutal attack by the police and the TMC goons on the bandh supporters.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/violence-marks-bandh-in-bengal.html
145,09-1-20,Should Deepika visit RSS HQ in Nagpur if not JNU: Congress,"The Congress on Wednesday took a swipe at the BJP asking if Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone should visit the RSS headquarters in Nagpur instead of JNU. The Opposition party’s reaction came amid calls, including from some BJP functionaries, to boycott Padukone’s upcoming movie ‘Chhapaak’ for her visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University on Tuesday to express solidarity with the students who were attacked by a mob.

“The ruling party has reduced (itself) to indulging in petty social media polls, faking videos. Should she (Deepika Padukone) go to Nagpur, the Sangh headquarters, to promote her movie? What do they want this country to be?” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, when asked about a strong reaction from a quarter of the BJP on the actor’s visit to the university.

Khera said the government is filing FIRs against students and youth instead of hearing them out. “If someone is showing concern to the protesting youth, you raise questions on him/her,” he said, alleging the ruling BJP claims it is the world’s largest party but it has a “small heart”.

“If there is unrest across universities, we expect the Prime Minister to go there, we expect the Home Minister, the senior leader of the BJP to go and listen to the youth of this country, whichever campus we are talking about,” he said in reference to protests by youth and students on various campuses.

A four-member fact-finding team of the Congress also visited JNU to probe the attack on students and faculty members. The team comprising All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, party MP from Ernakulam Hibi Eden, former NSUI president of JNU unit Syed Nasser Hussain and former NSUI president and ex-president of Delhi University Students’ Union Amrita Dhawan interacted with students on the issue.

147,09-1-20,Welcome any peace initiative by India: Iranian envoy,"Iran on Wednesday said it will welcome any peace initiative by India to de-escalate tensions with the US following the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

Stating this, Iran Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni also said here his country wants peace not war and hoped there will be no further escalation in hostilities between his country and the US.

Taking note of the prevailing situation in the Middle-East, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday had a conversation with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, voicing India’s concerns over the escalation of tensions. India has reached out to several stakeholders in the region over the security situation prevailing in the Middle East.

Jaishankar also separately spoke to Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf Alawi, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as well his Jordanian and Qatari counterparts Ayman Safadi and Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani respectively, on the tense situation in the region.

The Iranian ambassador’s comments about India came hours after Iran launched over a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces’ are stationed in Iraq. Tehran said it was a “slap in the face” of America.

“India usually plays a very good role in (maintaining) peace in the world. India belongs to this region. We welcome all initiatives from all countries, especially India as a good friend for us, to not allow escalation (of tensions),” Chegeni told reporters after a condolence meeting for Soleimani at the Iranian Embassy here.

“We are not for war, we are looking for peace and prosperity for everybody in this region. We welcome any Indian initiative or any project that can help peace and prosperity in this world,” he said.

Soleimani, the head of Iran’’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Noting that India is a “good friend”, Chegeni said, “My minister (Javad Zarif) talked to Dr Jaishankar, they had a very good discussion. Recently we had the joint economic commission in Tehran...We see a very good future for the relationship. We have no problem with India.” He said Iran and India can jointly work for peace in the world.

Asked if Indian officials have reached out to the Embassy with a condolence message, the Iranian envoy said the embassy had opened a condolence book for two days and he expects Indian officials to come but it is “up to the Indian side”.

“Usually we have good relations and sympathy between the two countries,”

he said. The Iran Embassy here has been seeing a steady stream of envoys coming and expressing condolences on the death of Soliemani.

Talking about the US drone strike that killed Soleimani, Chegeni said, “He was in a third country. So this is very important for the world to not allow such an inhuman, illegal act which is against international rights.”

“He (Soleimani) was the one who removed the threat of ISIS from the world. Why you should kill him. That means you are supporting terrorists.

“You (Centre) will not communicate, you will not explain, you will not try to understand people, then what is the meaning of democracy?” Pilot asked. “Winning an election does not mean that you have become supreme. We should keep our hearts, minds and ears open, and listen to people.”

The State Congress president said the government should leave its “ego” behind and hold a dialogue.

“Whatever is going in the JNU, the police are going to different universities, people wearing uniforms are seen in colleges and universities — is not a good sign for any democracy for any country,” Pilot told reporters in Jaipur.

According to Pilot, a shutdown occurs when all options fail and there was a lack of communication from the central government’s end.

149,09-1-20,Fear of coup prevented CDS appointment earlier: ex-Army chief,"Terming the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) as a welcome move, former Army chief General (retd) Shankar Roy Chowdhury on Wednesday said it had not been done earlier owing to the then political bosses’ fear of a coup.

He said the appointment of a CDS was due for a long time and the services wanted it to be there in the country so that the Army, Navy and Air Force come under one umbrella, “but the problem was political.”

“The fear of a coup was ingrained among the earlier political bosses if all the three forces — Army, Navy and Air Force — were brought under one umbrella and that was the only reason that a post of

CDS was not created,” Roy Chowdhury told newspersons here.

General Bipin Rawat, who retired as the Army chief on December 31, has taken charge as India’s first Chief of Defence Staff the next day with a

mandate to bring in

convergence in the functioning of the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force and bolster the country’s military prowess.

Gen (retd) Roy Chowdhury said the military is always subordinate to the civil authorities in the country, but an “unsubstantiated” fear of a coup if the forces were brought under one head had prevented the then political

establishment from taking a decision on it.

“This is the single reason why the country did not have a CDS so far,” the former Army chief said. He said the post of CDS is important for the coordination of the three forces.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fear-of-coup-prevented-cds-appointment-earlier--ex-army-chief.html
150,09-1-20,MVA sweeps Maha rural elections,"Close on the heels of it losing power in Maharashtra, the BJP on Wednesday suffered a

humiliating defeat in local body elections in the State, as the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) captured power in five out of six Zilla Parishads and walked away with majority Panchayat Samiti seats in five out of six districts where the polls were held.

It what came as personal setback for former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, the Amit Shah-led party lose power in the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samitis in his home district of Nagpur.

The MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, captured power in the Zilla Parishads of Nagpur, Washim, Akola (all three in Vidarbha region), Nandurbar (in north Maharashtra) and Palghar (in coastal Konkan region), while the BJP managed to come to power in Dhule ZP in north Maharashtra.

In a repeat performance in the Panchayat Samiti polls, the MVA won a maximum of 310 seats out of a total 552 seats in five districts — Nagpur, Washim, Akola, Nandurbar and Palghar, while the BJP managed to maximum of 70 out 112 seats in Dhule district. In five districts, the BJP secured 124 seats, while the MVA bagged 32 seats in Dhule district.

The MVA put up an impressive performance in the Zilla Parishads of Nagpur, Washim, Akola, Nandurbar and Palghar, where it won as many as 165 seats out of total 276 seats, as against 67 seats won by the BJP. However, in Dhule Zilla Parishad, the BJP emerged as the victor by winning 39 out of 56 seats.

The ZP and Panchayat Samiti poll outcome has eroded the stock of Fadnavis in Vidarbha region where the BJP has lost power in all three Zilla Parishads – Nagpur, Washim and Akola – that went to polls. The BJP’s defeat in Nagpur ZP polls has come as an embarrassment for Fadnavis, where the Congress —which is a constituent of the MVA — has by itself won a majority of 30 out of total 58 seats in the local body.

The poll outcome has come as a boost to State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP who hails from Katol taluka in Nagpur, while senior Congress minister K C Padvi and BJP Girish Deshmukh share credit for the poll performances in Nandurbar and Dhule districts of north Maharashtra.

While the MVA — of which the Congress is a part —has captured power in the Nandurbar Zilla Parishad, the BJP has come to power in Dhule ZP. The only regret for Padvi is that his wife Hemlata Padvi was defeated in the Nandurbar ZP polls by a candidate of the Shiv Sena, which is also a constituent of the MVA. There was no pre-poll between the MVA constituents in the ward where Hemlata Padvi contested.

The Opposition BJP may take a solace for its defeat in the fact that is for the first time that the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have come together in the ZP and Panchayat Samiti polls and that too as a post-poll arrangement in a few of the Zilla Parishad.

But, the BJP will have to live with the home truth that as long as the MVA is power in the state, it will have to stay away from power in a maximum number of local bodies — including ZPs, Panchayat Samitis and municipal bodies — across the State",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mva-sweeps-maha-rural-elections.html

Fadnavis, a former Maharashtra Chief Minister, and Raj Thackeray met in Prabhadevi here on Tuesday. The meeting lasted for nearly two hours, sources had said.

Asked about the Fadnavis-Raj Thackeray meet, which took place in the backdrop of political realignment in the state, Maharashtra

BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar did not provide any details, but pointed out that nobody had expected that the Shiv Sena will join hands with the Congress-NCP.

It was a courtesy meeting between the two leaders... there was nothing political, but anything can happen in the future.

“Nobody had predicted that the Shiv Sena would go with the Congress-NCP. People would term someone talking on these lines as crazy, but it happened, said the former State BJP president

who was a member of the Fadnavis cabinet. The Shiv Sena, a long-time ally of the BJP, walked out of the saffron alliance in November last year and joined hands with the Congress-NCP combine to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the State.

The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), founded by Raj Thackeray in 2006, fared poorly in the October assembly polls winning just one seat.

Raj Thackeray is expected to hold a public rally on January 23, where he might announce a ‘key’ decision, an MNS official had said on Tuesday. It is being widely speculated that Raj Thackeray, estranged cousin of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, may announce a shift to the right amid changed political scenario in the state.

“The National Conference will not take part in any election till the pre-August 5 position of Jammu & Kashmir is restored,” Lone told reporters after a party meeting here.

Lone said he was hopeful of a favourable verdict on the petition regarding the restoration of the special status in the Supreme Court.

Asked about the new political front led by former PDP leader Syed Altaf Bukhari, Lone said “such elements were used by Government of India from time to time since 1953 to undermine people’s aspirations”. “Many of those who are part of this front were the same people who brought down the Farooq Abdullah Government (in 1984) and formed a new Government. Everyone knows how long that Government lasted. They will be used and thrown away,” the Lok Sabha member from Baramulla said.

He said the BJP might be able to take their agenda to people of Kashmir, the leaders who are part of the new front did not have any public standing. “They will be rejected by people,” he added. In response to a question, Lone said the hype around the domicile law for Jammu and Kashmir was of no value.

“We will not even spit on such a law. Our agenda remains the same as that of (NC founder) Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah,” he said.

As soon as the question hour ended, Leader of Opposition M K Stalin said NEET went against the tenets of social justice and the interests of rural students and accused the ruling dispensation of “huge betrayal” on the issue.

He sought to know about the state filing a plea against the test in the Apex Court just two days before the last date (6 Jan, 2020) to apply for NEET ended.

Health Minister C Vijayabaskar retorted saying if at all it was a betrayal, the seeds for it were sowed by the DMK when it was part of the Congress-led Centre.

On 27 December 2010, the notification for the test was issued by the Union government, he said. Only after the notification, the national test took shape and the opposition to it also had to be fought in the Madras High Court and later it went as far as the Supreme Court, he noted.

Also, bills were passed by the Assembly seeking to exempt Tamil Nadu from the test, he added.

The Minister said the government was taking legal steps and also handles the matter politically to oppose the test.

Asserting that the government continued to be firm in its policy of opposition to NEET, he said, “Now a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging section 10 (d) of the Indian Medical Council Act. The main petition in the matter was still pending in the top court.”

The NEET was behind conducted under section 10 (d) and this section was inserted through an amendment to the IMC Act. Tamil Nadu filed the fresh plea after the top court said during the case hearing last month that the State had the freedom to challenge this provision, the Minister pointed out. He also wanted the opposition to specify if this move of the government was “right or not.” DMK deputy leader Duraimurugan countered asking what the government intended to achieve by filing the fresh plea.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aiadmk--dmk-in-war-of-words-over-neet-in-tn-assembly.html

Mutual fund houses witnessed an overall outflow of Rs 61,810 crore last month as compared to an inflow of Rs 54,419 crore in November.

Fund managers attributed the drop in the asset base to outflow of Rs 78,940 crore from debt-oriented schemes.

Among debt-oriented schemes, liquid funds, with investments in cash assets such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper for shorter horizon, witnessed a pull-out of over Rs 71,000 crore, the highest among the fixed-income segment last month.

Besides, overnight funds, which invest in securities with a maturity of one day, saw outflows of over Rs 8,800 crore. However, banking & PSU funds, which have a high allocation to highest rated bonds, received funds to the tune of Rs 4,770 crore.

“Fixed income categories, especially those having modified duration or average maturity less than a year witnessed net outflows during the month. However, this is on expected lines as these categories typically witness net outflows during the quarter end months on account of advance tax payment obligation,” said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager (research) at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

Naveen Kukreja, CEO at Paisabazaar.com, attributed the decline in monthly asset base to sell-off in debt schemes.

Equity-oriented funds continued to attract investments tracking the surge in domestic markets in December. Such funds saw a net infusion of Rs 4,432 crore last month. In comparison, net flow of Rs 933 crore was seen in November and Rs 6,015 crore in October.

“The small cap and mid cap indices are underperforming currently. The industry has seen inflows in the large cap funds and it will continue to be the biggest attraction among equity funds,” Kukreja added.

Further, collection through systematic investment plan (SIP) has surged to over Rs 8,518 crore in December from Rs 8,273 crore in the preceding month. The asset base of SIP rose to an all-time high of Rs 3.17 lakh crore from Rs 3.12 lakh crore reflecting positive sentiment in

equities.

Amfi chief executive NS Venkatesh said,” Retail investors continue to repose trust in mutual funds as reflected by continued flows through SIPs, despite challenging domestic economic scenario and global trade issues and conflicts.

“Markets have rallied and indices scaled new peaks, which is reflective of resolution coming through structural policies like IBC and lowering of interest rates, as also, expectation from Budget,’’ he added.

Besides, gold exchange-traded funds saw an inflow of Rs 27 crore in December, while the same was over Rs 7 crore in November.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mutual-funds----asset-base-slipped-2--in-dec-on-sell-off-in-debt-schemes.html

168,09-1-20,Deep discounts given by e-commerce sites major area of concern: CCI study,"Deep discounting on goods and services offered by large online retailers has emerged as a major area of concern in a study conducted by CCI, particularly in case of mobile phones, and the fair trade regulator will probe all cases of possible abuse of market dominance.

Releasing the findings of the study and its own observations, the the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said marketplace platforms need to adopt self-regulatory measures to address all areas of concern flagged in the study and also bring out clear and transparent policies on discounts.

The study, Market Study on E-Commerce in India, was initiated by the regulator in April 2019 with a view to better understand the functioning of e-commerce in India and its implications for markets and competition.

The study released on Wednesday found that issues like lack of platform neutrality, unfair platform-to-business contract terms, exclusive contracts between online marketplace platforms and sellers/service providers, platform price parity restrictions and deep discounts among others may directly or indirectly have a bearing on competition.

While highlighting competition issues, CCI said that the price points at which sellers sell the products on the marketplace platforms are in many instances lower than the cost price for the brick and mortar retailers.

These retailers maintain that they either have to match the online discounts at a significant loss or the online market would be foreclosed for them.

This was pointed out to be a particularly pressing concern in the case of mobile phones, where online markets constitute around 40 per cent of the total sales in the country.

Making observation about the goods category, the regulator said the issue raised by the sellers relates to online discounts on major goods platforms purportedly pushing the prices below cost and impairing the offline small retailers’ ability to compete in certain product categories.

“The platforms denied any involvement in pricing,” CCI said. It further added that “unfair pricing contravenes the competition law under Section 4(2) of the Act when indulged in by a dominant enterprise.”

Regarding services category, it said, “...Discounts are offered by even the pure intermediary platforms following marketplace model with no control over the inventory sold through them”.

Discounts are purportedly funded by platforms for consumer on-boarding. It is causing the service providers, i.E. Hotels and restaurants to lose control over the price of their products sold/distributed through online platforms, which also affects price and sales through other channels.

Discounting is a common business strategy but where the design of the discounting schemes is misaligned with the rational business practices of the service providers, the use of such discounts as a competitive strategy comes into question.

CCI, with a view to reduce information asymmetry and promote competition on the merits, has urged e-commerce platforms to put in place certain transparency measures.

It urged the platforms to bring out clear and transparent policies on discounts, including the basis of discount rates funded by platforms for different products and suppliers and the implications of participation and non-participation in discount schemes.

Besides, it said the business users should be notified about any proposed changes in terms and conditions.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/deep-discounts-given-by-e-commerce-sites-major-area-of-concern--cci-study.html
169,09-1-20,Airlines advised precautionary measures over Iran airspace,"Civil aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation has asked Indian airlines to remain vigilant and take all precautionary measures when flying over Iranian and Iraqi airspace.

The development comes after US-Iran geopolitical tensions in the region escalated on Wednesday.

“A meeting was held with all concerned airlines which operate flights over these airspaces,” a senior DGCA official told IANS.

“We have sensitised them to remain vigilant and take all precautions.”

At present only Air India uses the Iran-Iraq airspace for operations to Europe and other destinations. Currently, no Indian airline flies directly to Iran, however, Air India flies to Najaf in Iraq.

On its part, Air India decided to reroute flights over Iran.

“In light of the tensions within the Iranian airspace a decision to temporarily reroute flights of Air India and Air India Express over flying Iran has been taken,” a spokesperson for the airline said.

170,09-1-20,Government puts restrictions on import of refined palm oil,"The Government on Wednesday imposed restrictions on imports of refined palm oil, a move which could discourage the inbound shipment of the commodity from Malaysia.

According to a notification of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), “import policy” is amended from “free to restricted” for refined bleached deodorised palm oil and refined bleached deodorised palmolein.

Putting the commodity in restricted category means an importer will require licence or permission for the inbound shipment.

India, the world’s largest importer of vegetable oils, buys nearly 15 million tonne annually. Of this, palm oil comprises 9 million tonne and the rest 6 million tonne soybean and sunflower oil.

Indonesia and Malaysia are the two countries which supply palm oil.

Malaysia produces 19 million tonne of palm oil in a year, while Indonesia produces 43 million tonne, the trade data showed.

The move comes in the backdrop of remarks by Malaysia on the new citizenship law and Kashmir issue.

On December 20 last year, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad had reportedly said, “I am sorry to see that India, which claims to be a secular state, is now taking action to deprive some Muslims of their citizenship”.

“If we do that here, you know what will happen. There will be chaos, there will be instability and everyone will suffer,” he had said.

Earlier, Mahathir had said in the UN General Assembly that India had “invaded and occupied” Kashmir.

Further according to industry source, the government has advised importers not to buy palm oil from Malaysia.

“We import 30 per cent of the palm oils from Malaysia, while 70 per cent from Indonesia.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/government-puts-restrictions-on-import-of-refined-palm-oil.html
171,09-1-20,"Economic situation “bad”, 5% growth estimate ‘imaginary’:Sinha","Former Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday questioned estimation that the economy will grow at 5 per cent in 2019-20, saying the figure is “imaginary” and raised doubt about the Modi Government’s capability of tackling economic issues.

Talking to reporters, Sinha also demurred Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding “pre-budget consultation”, saying it is “unprecedented” and asked what the latter’s Finance Minister is doing.

India’s GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and construction sectors, Government data showed on Tuesday.

“Even this 5 per cent growth is imaginary. Because this does not include what has happened, the damage which was caused as a result of demonetisation and GST on the MSME and the informal sector,” Sinha told reporters here.

The former Union Finance Minister said several economists are suggesting that India is experiencing negative growth if the factors caused by demonetisation and GST are to be kept in mind.

The economic situation is “too bad”, he added. “You (reporter) talked about budget. The budget has lost all its meaning. The budget has lost its sanctity which was there at some point of time,” he said while replying to a query.”I have grave doubts about the capability of this Government to tackle economic issues,” the former BJP leader added.

Sinha said there is no magic wand to correct the course of economy and added there is a need for sustained effort to put things on track.

“But frankly, I don’t expect anything much from the Government either before or after,” he said.

Sinha further said earlier budgets were worked out in the finance ministry and noted it was “unprecedented” for the prime minister to hold pre-budget consultations.

“But where it (the budget) is being made today I don’t know. But they have the mouthpiece who will read out the budget in the Lok Sabha,” he said.

Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan, who accompanied Sinha, said the plunging economic numbers are a “matter of grave concern”.

He said former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian had last year talked about GDP growth rates being inflated by 2.5 per cent.

“That is condition and it is not 5 per cent, it is 2.5 per cent,” he said about the estimates.

Chavan accused the Modi government of not consulting experts during crisis situation and said the issues of CAA and NRC are being raised to distract people’s attention from economic woes.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/economic-situation----bad-----5--growth-estimate----imaginary----sinha.html

175,09-1-20,Gujarat Chief Minister talks to fishermen as part of ‘Mokla Mahe’ interactive session,"In his attempt to reach out to the communities across Gujarat, Minister Vijay Rupani has started meeting people to understand their genuine grievances and also understand their expectations from the government.

Keeping with his initiative, Rupani met 65 fishermen from 15 coastal districts, extending from Saurashtra & Kutch to south Gujarat, as part of the state government’s ‘Mokla Mane’ interactive session at his official residence.

Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that an Rs.1, 200-crore project to build nine new harbours in the state has been started in consultation with the Central Government. The state will take steps needed to develop inland and marine fishery in sync with Prime Minister Narendrabhai Modi’s call for total revolution. “Fishermen’s children will live so long fishlings live,” he said.

Talking to The Pioneer, the chief minister said, “Gujarat government considers fishermen as ‘Sagar Khedut, meaning ‘farmers of the sea’. They have requested me to issue Kisan Credit Cards to them on the lines of farmers, I have directed concerned department it out for them. We have also started to provide big trawlers to small fishermen for their survival” he said.

The state government is also mulling issuing permits to fishermen of neighbouring states for fishing in the Gujarat’s territorial waters. “This is imperative since others states do not allow fishermen from Gujarat to fish in their waters since the coastal areas are well defined. A problem typical to Gujarat’s fishermen is the state’s territorial water bordering that of Pakistan, inadvertently entering one another’s territory or being forcibly captured – a sensitive international issue. Gujarat has asked the Central Government to ensure early release of such Gujarati fishermen from Pakistan’s detention”, the chief minister added.

“We are providing subsistence allowance of Rs.300 per day to the families of each of such detainee. As far as fishermen declared missing in high sea during storms or cyclone, the state government provides ex gratia compensation as compassion towards the kin of such fishermen who do not return for five years”, Ruapni said.

During interaction, farmers’ representatives from Devbhumi-Dwarka suggested that chief minister should inaugurate the new harbour at Okha. It may be noted that Rumania had earlier held ‘Okla. Mane’ interactive session with representatives of slum-dwellers, teachers, differently baled and nomadic tribes.

“After every interactive session, officials of the concerned departments work on the feedback and petitions that are received from people. This initiative has gone a long way in ameliorating the condition of the underprivileged class. I hold this session with the representatives of various sections of the society on the fourth or fifth of every month” the chief minister said.

A senior official of the chief minister’s office said that participants are mostly from the underprivileged and disadvantaged classes of society and they are called to meet the chief minister irrespective of religion, caste or sex to be a part of the programmed. These informal interactions help in solving problems as they provide instant feedback.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gujarat-chief-minister-talks-to-fishermen-as-part-of----mokla-mahe----interactive-session-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/gujarat-chief-minister-talks-to-fishermen-as-part-of----mokla-mahe----interactive-session.html

179,09-1-20,Steel players hail Govt’s decision to open coal sector,"Indian steel industry on Wednesday welcomed the Government’s decision to promulgate an ordinance to open up coal mining in the country to non-coal companies.

In a statement, apex steel industry body Indian Steel Association (ISA) said it hails the decision of the Cabinet to amend MMDR Act 1957 and Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act 2015.

“This is a huge reform announced by the Government on commercial mining in Coal. This change in Act will help the country to reduce its dependence on coal imports and help attract investments from Indian and Global corporates,” it said.

The amendment, ISA said, will remove the end-user restrictions besides allowing seamless transfer of environment and forest clearance in operational mines.

The step taken today was a long pending reform which will make the domestic steel industry more competitive on a global level, the association said.

JSW Steel Chairman Sajjan Jindal said the move will go a long way in reducing the coal imports.

“Huge reform announced by the Government on commercial mining in coal. This will go a long way in reducing the coal imports which is over USD 15 billion/year,” he said. In today’s time when the oil prices are very uncertain, Jindal said, the decision was path breaking in making India self-reliant. Continuity of all forest and environment clearances for iron-ore mines for a period of two years is another great reform, he added.

“This was a long pending reform which will make the Indian Steel industry more aggressive and competitive on a global level,” he said.

JSPL Chairman VR Sharma termed the decision as a ‘game changer’ for the industry.

India has reserves for another 300 years and the time is ripe to use it. If it is not utilised now, it wont be able to utilised in future as developed countries are against coal usage.

“They are spreading on international platforms that using coal is damaging the environment, which is incorrect. Like we do at our Angul plant which is India’s first and largest syngas-based DRI plant and coal gasification plant (CGP) for steel-making,” he said.

Coal can be converted into syngas which can be used for producing petrol, diesel and other petroleum products, which can reduce dependence on crude oil imports, he added.

The Government on Wednesday approved an Ordinance to amend a law in order to ease rules for auctioning of coal mines and opening it for non-coal companies. The decision taken by the Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will also do away with end-use restrictions of the mining blocks, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said. “The Cabinet has approved promulgation of Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2020,” the minister said, addressing media after the Cabinet meeting.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/steel-players-hail-govt---s-decision-to-open-coal-sector.html

186,09-1-20,Living free,"Students of Shiv Nadar School have created innovative silicone-based prosthetic limbs for amputee dogs to help them walk again. By Team Viva

Prosthetic limbs for humans are common. But have you heard the same for dogs? Well, a few grade X students of Shiv Nadar school have made innovative silicone-based prosthetic, ergonomically designed ones to comfortably fit the limbs of amputee dogs. The components of the prosthesis are plastazote, silicon, medipop bandage and rubber.

The innovation was done under Colloquium, an exhibition, where students follow a six-month long process to identify a probable real-world issue, strategise and then chart a tech-enabled solution for it. The students who made this project, Pawsitivity, are Arushi Shah, Navya Aggarwal, Navya Jain, Shreeya Mittal, Sprihha Singh and Utpal Chauhan.

They were spurred on by a news report which said that around 1,000 stray animals were injured in road accidents in four months. It also said that the animals lead miserable lives as they mostly lie at one place and struggle to walk. The stray dogs usually go unnoticed and even if people notice them they do not have the means to help them. In such a scenario, they realised that, a free of cost prosthetic limbs would help many dogs to live a normal life.

Ayushi Shah, a student of class 10 says, “When we were asked to identify a societal problem and solve it, we initially started researching about prosthetics for human disabilities. But soon we realised that while there are many solutions available for humans, there aren’t many for animals. All our group members are dog lovers and we decided that we would take this up as our mission to make amputee dogs self reliant.”

It demanded a lot of research on part of the students. Another student, Shreeya Mittal says that initially they studied many solutions that were tried previously such as wheelchair for dogs and a fixed leg tied to the limbs. The students visited Sophie Memorial Animal Relief Trust in Noida to understand the on ground challenges faced by the dogs and the NGOs trying to help them. “After studying, analysing and understanding the biology of front and hind limbs of seven to 10 different dogs we were able to define three categories: amputed paws, front limbs missing and hind limbs missing. Based on this we were able to design specific models that would help each of the target areas differently. The kind of materials, the shape and design of our model were the had to be decided and researched upon. So spring motion was used as a replacement for the hop motion for the front limbs since many dogs rely on the joint closer to paws for movement. The kind of cladding and scaffolding needed depended on the type of loss and other issues specific to each dog,” says she.

Through this, the students aim to make every dog in India self reliant as this would meet their needs and restore the ability to not just walk but run and lead a healthy normal life again.

Both the girls said that they deeply believe that every member of our society wants to come forward and help in every possible way. We just need to provide them with a simple and easy-to- help mechanism. “We are currently working on 3D printing these legs by creating a model for it and using various cloning softwares. We are hopeful that we will be able to turn this around into a simple three step process where people will be able to help dogs and other such animals using their phones and our guidelines in the near future,” they added.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/living-free-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/living-free.html
187,09-1-20,NAREDCO seeks steps for rental housing in Budget 2021,"Even as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget for the fiscal 2020-21 next month, the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) on Wednesday sought initiatives to incentivise rental housing in the country.

NAREDCO in a statement said that rental housing will play a vital role in achieving the target of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, and recommended grant of tax incentives to boost the segment.

Speaking to the media here, NAREDCO President Niranjan Hiranandani referred to the concept of “notional income” from housing property held as stock-in-trade, which attracts tax on unsold property after a certain time period under Section 23(5) of the Income Tax Act.

Section 23(5) of the IT Act provides that in respect of unsold property, held as stock-in-trade and not let out, the annual value of the property for the period up to two years from the end of the financial year in which completion certificate is received from competent authority, will be taken as nil. Thereafter, it will be assessable as income from house property on the basis of its notional rent.

“This is an extremely ‘subjective’ criteria, which will obviously be open for misuse,” the NAREDCO statement said.

“This provision is very harsh and is creating genuine hardship to real estate developers, who are already under pressure in the ongoing sluggish market,” it said.

“The real estate industry is already struggling with large unsold inventories. Taxing notional rent, after one year from the end of the financial year in which completion certificate is received from competent authority, will lead to severe financial implications for the developer/industry.”

The realtors’ body also suggested to the government that no rent should be taxed for the period up to five years from the end of the financial year in which the certificate of completion of construction of the property is obtained from the competent authority.

The self-regulatory body, under the aegis of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, has urged the Finance Minister to demand more measures to ease the liquidity situation in the long-subdued real estate segment, including the one-time roll-over of loans given to developers.

“The industry has been demanding restructuring of loans or one time roll-over in case of the stressed assets at the options of banks. In such cases, the borrower will retain the asset classification of the restructured standard accounts as standard and the same will not be treated as NPA,” it said.

It also said that interest rates on home loans should be below 7 per cent per annum and suggested that the stamp duty rates should be reduced by 50 per cent for all the real estate transactions entered and agreements registered on or before March 31, 2020.

The organisation also sought a relaxation in the definition of affordable housing. According to NAREDCO, the Rs 45 lakh price cap for the classification of a property as affordable housing should be done away with as it keeps most of the projects in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) out of the ambit of “affordable housing”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/naredco-seeks-steps-for-rental-housing-in-budget-2021-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/naredco-seeks-steps-for-rental-housing-in-budget-2021.html

This is 40.4 per cent higher than the level attained in FY19, it said.

Given the growth slowdown, this looks unlikely in the near term, but is not an insurmountable task, according to Ind-Ra.

""Such levels of labour productivity growth have been achieved in the past...India's labour productivity growth, like other nations, came under pressure in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, especially during FY11-FY15,"" it said.

However, it recovered thereafter and grew at 5.8 per cent during FY16-FY19, it added.

The challenge on the productivity front for India is two-fold, it said. ""First, how to raise the overall labour productivity to a level that delivers the required GDP growth rate, and secondly how to lift the labour productivity in the lagging sectors so that growth is more evenly balanced and sustainable over the medium- to long-term.""

World number six Sindhu will face Aya Ohori of Japan in the second round.

The other Indian in the fray, London Olympics Bronze medallist Saina needed just 36 minutes to get the better of Belgium’s Lianne Tan.

The unseeded Saina brushed aside Tan 21-15, 21-17 in their first meeting against each other.

Both Sindhu and Saina have struggled recently, making a series of early exits with the former failing to defend the World Tour Finals crown last month.

Earlier, Praneeth made a first round exit after going down tamely to Denmark’s Rasmus Gemke 11-21, 15-21 while Srikanth lost to Chinese Taipei’s Chou Tien Chen 17-21, 5-21 in only 30 minutes.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saina--sindhu-start-with-win.html
199,09-1-20,"Boult, Latham doubtful for India series","New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult and wicketkeeper batsman Tom Latham are doubtful starters for the home series against India after the duo suffered fractures in the recently-concluded Test series against Australia.

Boult was ruled out of the final Test after fracturing his right hand and coach Gary Stead said the pacer was “touch-and-go to be available” for the Twenty20 series against India.

“Boult has been resting his broken right-hand and will return to bowling later this week,” Stead said in a statement on Wednesday.

“He’ll be touch-and-go to be available for the Indian T20 series later this month and we’ll continue to monitor him closely over the next few weeks,” he added.

The 27-year-old Latham broke his right little finger while claiming the catch of Marnus Labuschagne on day four of the third Test agaisnt Australia in Sydney, ruling him out for days.

“An X-ray has confirmed a fractured finger for Tom Latham. He will require approximately four weeks of rehabilitation after the fracture to his right pinky finger,” New Zealand Cricket said in a statement.

200,09-1-20,"Lewis, Joseph script WI win","Opening batsman Evin Lewis fell agonisingly short of a century as his undefeated 99 helped West Indies to cruise to a five-wicket win over Ireland in the first one-day international at Kensington Oval on Tuesday.

The 28-year-old left-hander made his runs off 99 balls with 13 boundaries and two sixes.

After dismissing Ireland for just 180, the West Indies reached their target with 100 balls to spare.

For Lewis, it was his eighth ODI half-century but he made a gallant attempt to go to what would have been a third century.

With the scores level, he launched Barry McCarthy over extra cover but his hopes of a six to end the game in style fell just inches short.

Earlier, West Indies fast bowler Alzarri Joseph picked up four wickets as Ireland stumbled to 180 all out in the 47th over.

“For me, it’s a really good start to the year,” said man-of-the-match Joseph.

“It’s about putting in the hard work in training and doing the yards.

“I kind of had an idea of how I wanted to bowl today, and I just kept it simple and bowled to my plans.”

Wicketkeeper Lorcan Tucker was Ireland’s top scorer with 31 as the tourists collapsed following a solid start at Kensington Oval.

The three-match ODI series continues at the same venue today and concludes in Grenada on January 12.

That will be followed by three Twenty20 internationals in Grenada (January 15) and St Kitts (January 18 and 19).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lewis--joseph-script-wi-win.html

202,09-1-20,Rights warrior,"Actor-producer Ajay Devgn tells Chahak Mittal that the film Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is his attempt at bringing stories of unknown heroes to the forefront

He seems to be quite busy on his phone. Completely engrossed. As I break the silence and begin the conversation by congratulating actor-producer Ajay Devgn for his latest and 100th film, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, he interrupts me, “Actually, we never planned it to be my 100th. It just happened by chance. During the shoot, we realised that it’s a century (laughs).”

Directed by Om Raut, the film is set in the 17th century and is based on the life of Tanhaji Malusare, the military leader of Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who took part in the plan to recapture Kondhana fort near Pune from the army of Mughals headed by UdayBhan.

Ajay took up this role as he was fascinated by Tanhaji. “He was not just a warrior, he was a son, a brother, a husband, a leader and a soldier who did for his land and his people what he felt was right. He fought against the enemy in one of the longest standing battles, the battle of Sinhagad,” he says while elaborating on the reasons why he felt it was important to tell this story to people. Ajay points out that we have a history of such fighters whom we should feel proud of. “He was an important figure of our history but most Indians do not know about him, let alone the international audience. He is in textbooks but then who knows the real story?” he adds.

This is why, he says, he has conceptualised the idea of a franchise, Unsung Warriors, in which many such stories of courage will be told. “This film made me want to start a project like this where we could tell stories of those whose struggles and victories haven’t been rightly praised. We are working on some scripts. We are meeting new people for the series. And they are not just kings, queens and rulers of the bygone era, they are common, everyday people, who are struggling hard to make a difference in society but their musings are unrecognised or unheard. And it could be anyone,” says he.

Isn’t the industry shirking its creative job by relying on too many biopics, most of them from history? Ajay asks a counter question, “When we are gifted with a rich history, then why not? Also, earlier, there weren’t modern equipment or technology to support historical story scripts. Today, there is that animation and enhancement technology which bring out such stories so beautifully. Period dramas like Mughal-e-Azam, Lagaan were always being made. It is the way of relating the story and shooting has changed today. Even Tanhaji has been given such amazing special effects which haven’t been used in any other film before.”

When working on a period film, one’s background research has to be on point. All the facts and figures need a thorough check and accuracy in order to answer questions raised by experts. Ajay says that their research began approximately “four years ago,” where they not only dug out information but also spoke to scholars and researchers to get their facts right. “But yes, there’s no personal research that I did for my character beyond what we, collectively, were doing,” adds he.

However, even as one gives out the correct information and data, a film always need to have an element of entertainment. So how did he strike this balance between fact and fiction in Tanhaji? “History has infinite possibilities of storytelling. And when you’re telling the audience about a specific chapter of history, you cannot just flood them with information. There needs to some comedy and things need to be dramatised for fun. Having said that, we also have to make sure the facts don’t get lost amid an attempt to entertain. That’s just how we have worked here,” he says.

Ask Ajay, who is also producing the film, whether taking on the mantle of a producer adds to him as an artiste, he says, “I wouldn’t say that it is adding because I look at it as a product. I am creating something for the audience and that’s all that matters.”

His recent roles in Raid, Drishyam, Singham, Golmaal and more are evidence that the actor has never shied away from embracing versatility or experimentation. So what makes him understand such different characters in order to portray them better? Ajay doesn’t follow method acting but his approach seems to be a little similar to that. “I don’t try to ‘understand’ my character in anyway. I just react to it in a way that my character would have in that particular situation. In this film, I did what Tanhaji would have done during that time. I am not Ajay Devgn at that moment. I am my character,” he says, more through his eyes than words, reminding one of Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha (1998).

Well, many of such roles also shape or transform actors in a way since they, after all, put themselves in somebody else’s shoes. Ajay somewhat agrees and says, “Yes, they do make you think at times and impact you in some ways. For instance, after playing Singham, I paid more attention to traffic rules and small details which we otherwise tend to ignore. Another instance would be of when I had played Bhagat Singh. I wondered what kind of people were they who existed in that era and fought for the nation so bravely. We cannot even imagine. His ideologies and sensibilities are very much relevant even today. So some roles can teach you things.”

De De Pyaar De, Ajay’s last, opposite Rakul Preet Singh, in a way rekindled the conversation about acceptance in the Indian society of a couple who have a wide age gap. The actor eagerly replies, “I think the film was very well received by the Indian audience which itself is an evidence of the evolving society. The change is very much here. We are following the West. Of course, not all things can be borrowed since our culture needs to be followed too.”

(The film releases on January 10.)

203,09-1-20,Hollywood’s firefight,"Celebs donate millions to help Australia wildfire efforts

Elton John and Chris Hemsworth are among the celebrities donating big bucks for relief efforts as wildfires engulf Australia.

Hemsworth, the Australian actor who plays Thor in the Marvel film franchise, took to social media on Monday to share that he will donate $1 million and asked his millions of followers to show support as well. He added that “every penny counts.”

So far, the wildfires have scorched an area twice the size of the US state of Maryland. The blazes have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes. The fires, fueled by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record, have been raging since September, months earlier than is typical for Australia’s annual wildfire season.

John announced during his Farewell Yellow Brick Road concert in Sydney, Australia, that he will also donate $1 million. The singer said he wanted to bring attention to the devastation that wildfires have caused, saying it has reached a “biblical scale.”

Hemsworth and John join a growing list of celebrities who have pledged to donate toward relief efforts, including Nicole Kidman, Pink and Keith Urban.

“I am totally devastated watching what is happening in Australia right now with the horrific bushfires,” Pink wrote in a recent social media post. “I am pledging a donation of $500,000 directly to the local fire services that are battling so hard on the frontlines. My heart goes out to our friends and family in Oz,” he added.

Metallica announced a donation on Tuesday night of $750,000 to a firefighting agency and emergency services agency in Victoria.

An emotional Rose Byrne, who is Australian, spoke about the crisis and the relief efforts on Tuesday night at the New York premiere of her film Like a Boss.

“Really what people need is just donations because it’s all volunteer based, the firefighters and all the rural services and the wildlife services trying to rescue the animals,” she said.

She added: “It’s devastating. It’s such a beautiful country. There’s always drought but this is the hottest year on record and they need rain but a lot of rain, not just a little bit which is what’s happening now. They need like a downpour and it’s just getting hotter and out of control. A climate crisis is what it is.”

At the Golden Globes on Sunday, Phoebe Waller-Bridge said she would auction off her Globe outfit and have the proceeds go to firefighter relief.

Russell Crowe wasn’t at the Globes to accept his trophy for best actor in a limited series or TV film for playing former Fox CEO Roger Ailes in the Showtime miniseries The Loudest Voice. Instead, the actor was in Australia trying to protect his home from the wildfires, sending a speech that Jennifer Aniston read.

“Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based,” Crowe’s statement said. “We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way, we all have a future.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hollywood---s-firefight-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/hollywood---s-firefight.html
204,09-1-20,‘No country has developed without the participation of women’,"Shobha Mishra Ghosh, Assistant Secretary General of FICCI, addressed students at the fourth edition of Dr Paarivendhar Lecture Series at SRM Institute, Kattankulathur

The future of jobs is the biggest challenge that we are facing today. And to overcome it, student-centric learning should be adopted, which includes teaching entrepreneurship. Professors should be mentors and they should also keep learning,” said Shobha Mishra Ghosh, Assistant Secretary General, FICCI.

She spoke to the students of MBA, BBA, BCA, Science and Humanities, and Science and Technology at the fourth edition of Dr Paarivendhar Lecture Series held at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur. She addressed the students on the topic, “Future Jobs in India and the Role of Universities.” Dr V Ponniah, Dean of SRM, said, “In future, it will get difficult to judge jobs and hence this lecture will throw some light on what to expect and how to cope up with the change.”

In his presidential address, founder-chancellor of SRMIST, Dr TR Paarivendhar said, “The scope for the job in the future is going to change. Such lectures are useful than classroom teaching. Students must show more interest as it presents exposure and help to know what is happening around. It could also help in clearing campus interviews. We are trying to nurture you with lots of information so that you can face this world in several new ways. If you stop learning, you stop living.”

Focussing on the purpose of education, Shobha said, “Apart from knowledge, employable skills, research and innovation, it is far more important to evolve and be an empathetic human being.” She added that our education system should contribute towards making students a good human being. This implies to thinkers and philosophers, entrepreneurs and professionals, scientists and researches.

“Everyone is talking about innovation. We should also see if this innovation is solving issues that we are facing today,” she questioned.

Talking about key global changes in the present scenario, she highlighted the impact of climate change, exponential technologies, urbanisation, demographic on the future jobs in India. We are now in the fourth industrial revolution and the change from the third to the fourth took place in a very short time. The transition to the fifth stage will be in less than three years, she emphasised.

“The effective working age of the population is reducing. The use of robots and cobots is gaining more popularity thereby replacing people. Now in developed countries, people will spend more time on leisure activity. This is something that we need to pay attention to as a developing nation. Soon customers are going to play a vital role in the manufacturing sector. Hence having a set of skills and upskilling is the need of the hour,” she said.

Speaking on how we are still lagging behind in our education system, Shobha said, “Our education still remains in the second revolution stage. Only a handful of countries have moved on to cater to the needs of the present time. Although India has advanced well in terms of rapid urbanisation, technology adaptation, we still need to harness our rural economy which contributes to 16 per cent of our GDP.”

Highlighting the workforce matrix 2022, she elaborated that nine per cent would be deployed in new jobs that do not exist today, 37 per cent would be in jobs that have radically changed skill set and 54 per cent will fall under the unchanged job category. These changes will primarily be in IT/BPO, automobile, banking and insurance, textile and apparel, retail. Most jobs will end and give way to 55 unique jobs roled across eight technologies such as VR, IoT, Big Data Analytics, AI, Robotic Process Automation, 3D Printing, cloud computing, social and mobile.

Talking about the new age pedagogy, she said, “The changing paradigm in our education has led to new age pedagogy. This leads to global classrooms, experiential learning and addressing diverse learners. Universities should teach students to think and be aware of what is happening around themselves. The learning in this 21st century is way different and the management must adopt them. Mentors should also take up different calibers of teaching. Many institutions are not adopting the latest technologies. Faculty should not shy away from learning from students. The creative economy has transcended into several sectors including IT, therefore our universities should also focus on liberal education.”

Shobha concluded by saying, “Women’s participation should increase. No country in this world has developed without the participation of women in the workforce.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---no-country-has-developed-without-the-participation-of-women----2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---no-country-has-developed-without-the-participation-of-women---.html

Addressing the gathering, Patnaik said, “Education is empowerment and the real transformation can be possible only with the help of education.” Patnaik thanked KISS authority and Adani Group for establishment of school.

Dr Priti Adani said, “Education is the most powerful tool for social transformation. Adani foundation is happy to strengthen the scenario in the far off tribal areas of Odisha by partnering with the prestigious Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS).”

In his welcome address, Dr Achyuta Samanta, said, “Almost 28 years back, KISS took initiatives to include tribal community in the mainstream. Now KISS is the largest tribal institution and the first tribal university in the world. More than 30,000 students are currently pursuing their education from KG to PG, while 20,000 students completed their education successfully and are placed in different sectors. It is not important for KISS that 60,000 students are getting educated rather it is important that it has created awareness among more than 60 lakh tribal students of Odisha and other states of India.”

Dr Samanta said, “Many tribal organisations and intellectuals requested many times to open a branch in Mayurbhanj district for under privileged children. Today their requests have been fulfilled. The poor tribal students of Mayurbhaj district will get quality education. It has been decided that only the candidates of Mayurbhanj will get employment in Adani-KISS.

207,09-1-20,Literature can bring a change: Rajat Kapoor,"Human values are the essence of literature”, opined the dignitaries at the 17th Kadambini Literature Festival and Patrika Hat. Gracing the occasion as a chief guest, former External Affairs Minister, Salman Khurshid, said, “Human values enjoy the uniformity across the religions. But it differs when presented in diverse languages.”

“The inclination towards English has been soared to such a level, it is envisaged that not any of Indian languages will be able to upkeep its existence in the years to come,” said guest of honour, Rahul Dev, an eminent journalist. In fact, India is a multi-lingual nation. “However, our excessive affinity towards English has thrown our own languages into jeopardy,” added Dev.

He said, “There is a direct link between language and literature. Anybody can create potent creation though his/her own language and literature. Remarkably, advanced nations like China, Japan, Russia, Germany and South Korea are developing without the medium of English language. Their technology and science have been prepared in their respective languages. But it is surprising to observe that such trend is not followed in our nation. Though such exercises demand a little pain but we will fetch long term dividends in science and technology. In this context, the educational institutions have greater roles to play. They should encourage their pupils to carry forward research and create innovations in their own languages.”

Gracing the occasion, Mridula Garg said that literature is gradually losing it sheen, following the readers’ apathy. That’s why the reader base is declining day by day. Now, there is a widespread difference observed between the ethical (moral) and corporal values in our nation. “While basic traits like compassion, kindness, humility and tolerance fall within the domain of moral values, only literature can uphold these. The rapid depreciation of human values are taking its toll on its very survival. In such circumstances, we have to sustain our literature in order to upkeep our moral values at any cost,” added Garg.

Only literature can bring a change in the society, said Rajat Kapoor, renowned filmmaker, director and actor. Without money, a book can be created but not a film. On this occasion, the prestigious National level Nilimarani Sahitya Samman-2020 was conferred upon distinguished novelist Anuradaha Ray. She was given Rs 5 lakhs as cash award along with a silver medal.

Professor Shantanu Acharya said, “Literature is nothing but visiting one’s inner self. It has no link with the society. As life is full of joy, therefore, it should be drafted into literature in various humorous forms.”

On this occasion, the latest edition of Kadambini, Kunikatha and the English version of Iti Samanta’s novel Shankuntalara Jhia (Shakuntala’s Daughter) were unveiled by the guests.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/literature-can-bring-a-change--rajat-kapoor-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/literature-can-bring-a-change--rajat-kapoor.html

209,09-1-20,Rahul can put Dhawan under pressure: Gambhir,"Former India opener Gautam Gambhir reckons that Shikhar Dhawan would be under pressure to keep his place as opener in the Indian team since KL Rahul is doing extremely well.

Dhawan, making a comeback to the team after two months due to a knee injury, scratched his way to a 30-ball-32 while Rahul struck a 32-ball 45 as India chased down a modest target of 143 in the second T20 against Sri Lanka.

“Rahul is in unbelievable form. It amazes me every time I see Rahul bat, that, why didn’t he play the same way in Test cricket. With the kind of quality he posses, he is someone who can get you a 50-ball 100 in Test cricket as well. The kind of shots he has is superb,” Gambhir said during a post-match show for host broadcasters Star Sports.

Gambhir indirectly suggested that Rahul is better suited to partner Rohit.

Muguruza will play Zarina Diyas in the quarterfinals after the Kazakhstan player defeated Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-7 (9), 6-4.

“My goal is to play as many matches as I can, so I’m looking forward to my next match and to keep advancing in the tournament,” Muguruza said. “I’ve never played (Diyas) so I’m looking forward to facing a new opponent.”

Wednesday’s victory was the first time Muguruza has had consecutive wins at a WTA tournament since last year’s French Open, where she advanced to the fourth round.

Fifth-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova extended her winning streak to seven matches when she defeated 2014 finalist Peng Shuai 7-6 (7), 6-1 in 83 minutes.

In earlier American victories, Alison Riske beat Barbora Strycova 6-3, 6-4 and Danielle Collins defeated Yulia Putintseva 6-1, 6-0.

Playing in combination for the first time in their careers, Williams and Wozniacki beat top-seeded Johanna Larsson of Sweden and Caroline Dolehide of the United States 6-2, 6-1 after beating Nao Hibino and Makoto Ninomiya of Japan in their opening match.

Williams was a driving force in their win on Wednesday, dominating the court, though she paid tribute to Wozniacki who, she said, “never missed.” Wozniacki will play Lauren Davis in the second round of singles today while Williams will play fellow American Christina McHale.

Eugenie Bouchard came into the tournament as a wild-card entry after a difficult 2019 season and progressed to the quarterfinals with a 6-4, 6-4 win over eighth-seeded Caroline Garcia.

213,09-1-20,Spain sweep into ATP Cup quarters,"World number one Rafael Nadal steered Spain into the ATP Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday despite an uncharacteristically error-ridden performance, with Argentina also powering through.

After six days of round robin play at the inaugural team event across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, eight teams are left standing from the 24 that started.

Australia, Serbia, Russia and Britain booked their spots in the knockout phase on Tuesday, with Spain — who won the revamped Davis Cup in Madrid in November — and Argentina rounding out the six group winners.

Belgium and Canada joined them as the two best-placed runners-up.

All the quarter-finals are in Sydney with Australia facing Britain in the first encounter today, followed by Argentina against Russia.

Novak Djokovic’s Serbia take on Canada tomorrow, while Spain are pitted against Belgium.

Nadal saw off the brave challenge of Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, but the 19-time Grand Slam winner made 36 unforced errors.

“It was important the first set, and then in the second I had some tough moments but at the same time I was able to manage well to have a break at the right moment, so happy for the victory,” said Nadal, who is yet to drop a set.

He came on court after teammate and world number 10 Roberto Bautista Agut downed Go Soeda 6-2, 6-4 to secure the tie.

Djokovic was also a winner, continuing his unbeaten record at the tournament as he warms up for a crack at an eighth Australian Open crown.

The superstar eased past Chile’s Cristian Garin 6-3, 6-3 as Serbia won their tie 2-1, with Dusan Lajovic also clinching his singles match.

“I really am really happy with the challenges that I’ve had in the last six, seven days here, and hopefully that can allow me to build my form for Sydney and Melbourne later,” said world number two Djokovic.

In other action, emerging Polish young gun Hubert Hurkacz upset world number four Dominic Thiem for his third win over a top 30 player at the tournament after beating Diego Schwartzman and Borna Coric.

Poland’s 2-1 win over Austria ended Thiem’s team’s chances of topping their group, leaving Croatia and Argentina to battle it out to secure an automatic quarter-final place.

Left-hander Guido Pella got Argentina off to a strong start, defeating former world number three Marin Cilic 7-6 (7/1) 6-3, before a focused Schwartzman crushed Coric 6-2, 6-2.

It was not all doom and gloom for Croatia, who still had the chance to sneak into the last eight as one of the best runners-up.

After losing their two singles, they needed to win the doubles, but Ivan Dodig and Nikola Mektic blew the chance, allowing Canada to go through instead.

David Goffin’s Belgium, who were not playing on Wednesday, also crept into the knockouts at the expense of France and South Africa.

214,09-1-20,Sub-continent can make you doubt your abilities but we're ready for India: Finch,"The sub-continent can make visiting players doubt their abilities, Australia captain Aaron Finch said Thursday as he and his team headed to India for a three-match ODI series, aiming to upstage Virat Kohli's on-song team in its own backyard.

Australia scripted an unexpected comeback to win the five-match ODI series 3-2 in India 12 months ago after losing the first two games. The upcoming series starts January 14 in Mumbai.

""It just gives us confidence that our game plan in those conditions is good enough,"" Finch told 'cricket.Com.Au' ahead of the team's departure when asked about the series win in India last year.

""What can happen when you play in the sub-continent is you start to doubt your game plan because they're so dominant when they get on top. India or Pakistan... Or Sri Lanka. They can make you start doubting yourself.

""Knowing that our game plan is good enough and knowing that our skills are good enough to beat India in India. That gives us a lot of confidence going there,"" said Australia's limited overs skipper.

The second ODI will be played in Rajkot on January 17 and third in Bengaluru on January 19.

The in-form Marnus Labuschagne is set to make his ODI debut against India after earning a maiden call-up at the back of his stellar form in Tests.

Finch feels there is no reason why Labuschagne cannot carry his Test form into white-ball cricket.

""We know that he's not going to be overawed by the occasion. He's come back into Test cricket after missing out at the start of the Ashes and he's been unbelievable, so hopefully he can continue that.

""The form that he showed in the (Marsh Cup) one-day games was outstanding. He's averaging up around 40 there batting at three, batting at four for Queensland on what's been a little bit tougher batting conditions over the last couple of years in domestic cricket.""

Labuschagne is good against spinners and that will help him in India, said Finch.

""Playing on some slower wickets that spin quite a bit, to be able to come in and do that role really well for Queensland is obviously what's got him a place in the side, as well as his current form. I don't see why it wouldn't translate.""

Australia made a lot of changes to the ODI squad, leaving out experienced hands like Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Usman Khawaja and Nathan Lyon. Finch backed all of them to make a comeback.

""It's never closed, but when you're picking a side there has to be a spot there. It just comes down to being in the right place at the right time and having the right match-up,"" he said.

Head coach Justin Langer has got some much needed rest and assistant coach Andrew McDonald will be in charge of the team in India.

215,09-1-20,"Dhoni may end his ODI career soon, says Shastri","Two-time World Cup winning India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may ""soon end his ODI career"", head coach Ravi Shastri has revealed.

Speaking on other issues, Shastri also slammed the ICC's four-day Test proposal, calling the concept ""nonsense"".

""I have had a conversation with MS and that is between us. He has finished his Test career, he may soon end his ODI career... In all probability, he will finish one-day cricket,"" Shastri told 'CNN News18'.

""People must respect that he's played non-stop in all formats of the game for a while.

""At his age, probably the only format he'll want to play is T20 cricket which means he'll have to start playing again, get back into the groove because he's going to play in the IPL and see how his body reacts.""

The coach reiterated that the 38-year-old veteran could still be a contender for the T20 World Cup if he does well in the upcoming Indian Premier League.

""... So he will be left with T20, he will definitely play the IPL. One thing I know about Dhoni is that he will not impose himself on the team. But if he has a cracking IPL, well, then...""

Dhoni's last outing in India colours was during the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand in July where he was run out following a half century.

Shastri said form and experience will be taken into consideration while picking the team for the shortest format's biggest event.

""We will have to consider the person's experience and form. They will bat in the number 5-6 position. If Dhoni plays well in the IPL then he does put himself in contention.""

Dhoni, who is on a sabbatical right now, has turned up for the country in 350 ODIs, 90 Tests and 98 T20 Internationals while effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.

His career is studded with several milestones including leading India to the trophy in the 2011 World Cup where he finished the title clash with a six.

As the discussion turned to four-day Tests, Shastri, like some of the greats of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting, opposed the idea.

""Four day Test is nonsense,"" he said.

""If this goes on we may have limited-overs Tests. There is no need to tamper with five-day Tests. If at all they want to tamper then let the top six sides play five-day Tests and the next six be allowed to play four-day Tests.

""If you want to preserve Tests then let the top six play more against each other. You have the shorter format to popularise the game.""

When asked about day-night Tests, Shastri called on ICC to get the ball right.

""Day-night Test is still under test. I still feel that pink ball does not give any advantage to spinners, they need to get the ball right for day night. During the day you have full Tests, by night it looks like half Test.

""I still feel that you will get more people to watch Tests if you have the top six play each other (more often).""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-may-end-his-odi-career-soon--says-shastri-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-may-end-his-odi-career-soon--says-shastri.html

219,09-1-20,Udana virtually out of 3rd T20,"Sri Lanka head coach Mickey Arthur has indicated that left-arm pacer Isuru Udana is unlikely to feature in the third and final T20 against India in Pune tomorrow after sustaining a back injury during a warm-up session.

Sri Lanka missed Udana’s services while defending a meagre 143 against India on Tuesday after the bowler injured his back just before Sri Lanka went out to bowl.

“Look, I’m no doctor. He was in a hell of a lot of pain in the dressing room. What the diagnosis is I honestly don’t know. I just hope we can get him back for the West Indies series,” Sri Lanka coach Mickey Arthur said.

With Sri Lanka having a packed calendar, Arthur doesn’t want to risk Udana, who has been one of Sri Lanka’s best T20 bowlers in recent times.

“We’ve got so much cricket… the middle of February. I even think that could be a push. So, yeah, I just hope the best for him. It’s something in the back,” added the South Africa.

Sri Lanka did not pick the experienced Angelo Mathews for the second game in a row. Mathews has made a T20 comeback after 16 months.

“I think there’ll be one player who will be a surprise package. Prasidh Krishna is someone who has bowled really well in domestic cricket,” Kohli said after India’s seven-wicket win.

Given that the skipper has mentioned his name, the 23-year-old could be part of the team for the upcoming New Zealand tour.

221,09-1-20,Improved Thakur becomes better T20 bowler,"Having worked considerably on his skill-sets, speedster Shardul Thakur feels that he has become a “better T20 bowler” compared to what he was a couple of years back.

Thakur featured in his first T20I in 22 months. The figures of 3/23 showed that there has been a marked improvement in his death bowling since the 2018 Nidahas T20 Trophy in Sri Lanka where he was a batsman’s delight.

“I feel T20 is such a short format, there are always going to be ups and downs. The more you play, the more experienced you get and you keep learning. Whereas first-class and Test cricket are formats where you have time to think about your game but in T20 you don’t have that time,” Thakur said following India’s seven-wicket win against Sri Lanka.

Playing IPL regularly over the past couple of seasons has been one of the reasons for his success, feels Thakur.

“So whenever you practice, you need to add to your strengths and keep bettering your skills. Over a period of time, while practising I have been developing my skills and brushing it up. Playing last two-three years in the IPL, and domestic cricket, I have gotten better,” Thakur said.

Like all the young pacers, Thakur also spoke about the contribution from Indian team’s bowling coach Bharat Arun as it’s difficult to manage sessions with a personal coach in a heavy duty cricket calendar.

“At this point, it is very difficult to work with a particular coach because I am in and out of the Indian team. Sometimes I play for Mumbai, then Chennai Super Kings. Now I am again with the Indian team. But recently, our bowling coach (India) Bharat Arun has been really helpful,” said Thakur.

He picked all his wickets against Sri Lanka in the penultimate (19th) over and his plan was to keep things simple.

“I just had to bowl as many dot balls (that) I could. Luckily, I got three wickets there. It is satisfying. I have been working hard for it. When it pays off in an international game, it makes me really happy,” said the Mumbai pacer.

Sri Lanka could only manage 142 for nine, which India chased down comfortably. Thakur said it was a below-par total considering the conditions.

“The pitch was very good. It was about 170-180 wicket. I don’t think it was difficult to score runs on that pitch. There was no dew also today.”

He also praised fellow fast bowler Navdeep Saini, who too impressed on Tuesday

“He was really good in this game. The way he uses his bouncers and yorkers is creditable. He was also bowling with some gas,” added Thakur.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/improved-thakur-becomes-better-t20-bowler.html
222,09-1-20,Job only half done for Pep,"Pep Guardiola warned Manchester City of Manchester United’s powers of recovery after his side outclassed their city rivals 3-1 at Old Trafford to put one foot in the League Cup final.

The holders were rampant before the break as Bernardo Silva’s wonder strike, Riyad Mahrez’s cool finish and an own goal from Andreas Pereira put City well on course for a third straight final.

However, Guardiola remains wary after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men recovered from losing 2-0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in last season’s Champions League last 16 to progress.

“It’s a good result, but it is not over because it is United,” Guardiola told Sky Sports.

“Last season is a good example against PSG. Hopefully in front of our fans we can make a good game and reach the final.”

“I am really happy and at the same time I am really proud to win this award,” said Mane at the ceremony organised by the Confederation of African Football in the Egyptian Red Sea city of Hurghada.

“It's a big day for me.”

Mane became the second star from Senegal to be named African Player of the Year after El Hadji Diouf, who was the continent’s best player in 2001 and 2002.

He scored 34 goals and produced 12 assists in 61 appearances in 2019, according to CAF statistics.

Salah’s tally stood at 26 goals and 10 assists in 55 matches while Mahrez accounted for 14 goals and 18 assists in 48 games last year.

The key Senegalese player shared the 2018/19 Premier League Golden Boot award with Salah and Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Gabon.

“I would love to thank all the Senegalese people. They have been for me all the time, they push me,” said Mane, extending sincere gratitude to people from his village Bambali.

The award for the youth category was given to Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi of Borussia Dortmund.

The CAF Team of the Year featured Salah, Mane and Aubameyang as well as Mahrez and Ajax duo Andre Onana and Hakim Ziyech.

The Dalai Lama welcomed the chief minister and presented him with a 'khada', a ceremonial scarf that is offered as a gift in Tibetan culture and is said to symbolise purity and compassion.



Kumar presented the Dalai Lama with a statue of Lord Buddha, who is said to have attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, and a coffee table book on Gaya.

241,09-1-20,Anti-CAA protests force Modi to skip Khelo India launch,"Against the backdrop of protests on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NRC, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not inaugurate the Khelo India Youth Games 2020 in Guwahati on Friday. For the past few days, many organisations, including AASU, had threatened to stage demonstration against the Prime Minister if he visited Assam to inaugurate the games.

Assam BJP spokesman Dewan Dhruba Jyoti Maral first told the media the Prime Minister has cancelled the visit to the State. In the evening, the Sport Ministry officials confirmed that the Khelo India will be inaugurated jointly by Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijju and Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

242,09-1-20,Twitterati Chhapaak Deepika,"As netizens call for film boycott after her JNU visit, Govt denounces act

Bollywood diva Deepika Padukone’s presence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to support student protest against violence on the campus close to the release of her film ‘Chhapaak’ on Wednesday polarised a range of people as she received bouquets and brickbats for her ‘gesture’ in social media.

Amid call of some BJP functionaries and netizens, including Twitterati, for boycotting Padukone’s film, the Government defended Deepika and said anybody could go anywhere and express opinion in a democracy like India.

Padukone got support from a section of Bollywood, including filmmakers Anurag Kashyap, Nikkhil Advani, Hansal Mehta, Anubhav Sinha, actors Richa Chadha, Swara Bhaskar, who advised her for meeting the students at the university.

“The female of the species is, and was, and will always be the strongest of the two #DeepikaPadukone. Chhapak first day all shows. Let’s all those who stand against the violence go to @bookmyshow and show them. Make our silent statement which will be the loudest,” Kashyap wrote on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Deepkia’s upcoming film turned into a raging controversy after a magazine article claimed the name of the antagonist had been changed. By 4 pm, the micro-blogging sites ‘Nadeem Khan’ had clocked close to 60,000 tweets and ‘Rajesh’ close behind with 50,000. The film is based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.

In 2005, Laxmi was disfigured for life when a man called Nadeem and three others allegedly hurled acid at her in Delhi’s upscale Khan Market.

In the film based on her life, the narrative remains the same but the names have been changed. So, Laxmi is ‘Malti’ Agarwal and Nadeem becomes ‘Babboo’ aka ‘Bashir Khan’.

On Wednesday, Swarajya magazine wrote an article headlined, “The Ways Of Bollywood: In Deepika Padukone-Starer Chhapaak, Acid Attacker Naeem Khan Becomes ‘Rajesh’.”

“As part of a backlash against Padukone’s JNU ‘meet and greet’, social media users researched the names of the characters involved in the movie Chhapaak and conspicuously found the name of main perpetrator Naeem Khan absent,” the article alleged.

But in the Meghna Gulzar directed film, there is no mention of any Nadeem or Naeem Khan. Moreover, Rajesh is the name of Malti’s boyfriend.

Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo jumped into the controversy, saying it was another example of “absolute hypocrisy”.

“...When you say all characters are fictitious and don’t have any resemblance with living beings and all of that, this is absolute hypocrisy. When you change the name which also changes the religion, it has been done very deliberately,” Supriyo told a TV channel when asked to comment on the controversy.

South Delhi BJP MP Ramesh Biduri also called for a boycott of the movie.

With Deepika grabbing attention by going to JNU, many appreciated her ‘silent solidarity’ but others criticised her for “supporting the Leftists” and said it is a promotional stunt ahead of the release.

“#Boycott Chhapaak” was trending on Twitter as was “#ISupportDeepika”.

On Monday, the 34-year-old actor told a news channel that she feels proud that people have come out and raised their voice without fear, in reference to the protests against the amended Citizenship Act, the National Register of Citizens and violence in JNU.

Amid calls for boycott of Padukone’s film, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar sought to play cool saying not just artistes, even a common man can go anywhere to express their opinion in a democracy like India.

Nobody objected to such expression of opinions, Javadekar told reporters when asked at a Cabinet briefing about Padukone’s visit to the JNU on Tuesday to express solidarity with the students who were attacked by a mob.

About the call given by some party functionaries to boycott her upcoming movie, the Minister said he had not read their remarks but sought to underscore the significance of his statement, saying he is stating so as a minister and a “permanent” BJP spokesperson.

“This country is a democracy. Why only artistes, even a common can go anywhere and express his opinion,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister said.

To questions about violence in JNU where masked people attacked students on Sunday night, Javadekar reiterated that the ongoing police probe will “unmask” the accused and asserted that violence has no place in a “mature democracy” like India.

“We are a mature democracy and everybody has the right to express their opinion. Violence has no place, especially in universities where people go to study,” he said.

Students body ABVP, which is affiliated to the RSS, has been blamed by several groups for the incident. It has, however, denied its involvement and blamed the rival Left organisations for the violence.

Javadekar said some unions in JNU had earlier decided to stop students from registering in semesters.

“We should not forget that this is an important issue. Stopping students from semester admission is anti-education,” he said.

Left bodies, which rule the JNU student union, have been accused of preventing students from taking admission in semesters as part of their protest against fee hike.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/twitterati-chhapaak-deepika-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/twitterati-chhapaak-deepika.html

245,09-1-20,Obesity linked to higher risks of several common cancers,"Researchers in Denmark found that overweight and obesity were associated with higher risks of several common cancers and according to health experts here obesity may worsen the cancer survivor-ship, including quality of life.

According to the study, published in the Journal of Internal Medicine, there were 20,706 cancers among 313,321 adults diagnosed with overweight and obesity compared with 18,480 cancers that were expected based on information from the general population.

This corresponds to a 12 per cent higher risk associated with overweight and obesity.

Excess body weight or obesity in itself may be a root cause for a number of chronic diseases and some cancers, the health experts said.

Ashish Goel, Associate Director, Surgical Oncology at Jaypee Hospital in Noida said that extra body fat undoubtedly reduces the immune system of the body, and functioning of the hormones and cells which further results in abnormal number of cells and can increase the risk of tumour formation.

""Obesity is a well known predisposing factor for endometrial ovarian breast and stomach cancers and to some extent for kidney cancers,"" Goel told IANS.

The study also revealed that having type 2 diabetes or alcoholism-related diseases in addition to overweight or obesity was linked with even higher risks.

The increased risk was seen for cancers previously identified as obesity-related, including pancreatic and postmenopausal breast cancers, as well as for blood and neurological cancers, it added.

""Yes, this is true that, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of various kind of cancers. Also its also proven that the obesity may worsen the cancer survivorship, including quality of life and also increasing the changes of recurrence of the disease,"" said J.B. Sharma, Senior Consultant, Medical Oncologist at Action Cancer Hospital in New Delhi.

Sharma added that being overweight has been directly or indirectly linked with liver cancer, thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, gallbladder cancer, etc.

""Being overweight after menopause also increases breast cancer risk,"" he said.

Habitual tea consumption was associated with more healthy years of life and longer life expectancy, according to the study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

The analyses estimated that 50-year-old habitual tea drinkers would develop coronary heart disease and stroke 1.41 years later and live 1.26 years longer than those who never or seldom drank tea, the researchers said.

Compared with never or non-habitual tea drinkers, habitual tea consumers had a 20 per cent lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke, 22 per cent lower risk of fatal heart disease and stroke, and 15 per cent decreased risk of all-cause death, they said.

The potential influence of changes in tea drinking behaviour were analysed in a subset of 14,081 participants.

Habitual tea drinkers who maintained their habit in both surveys had a 39 per cent lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke, 56 per cent lower risk of fatal heart disease and stroke, and 29 per cent decreased risk of all-cause death compared to consistent never or non-habitual tea drinkers.

""The protective effects of tea were most pronounced among the consistent habitual tea drinking group,"" said Dongfeng Gu, from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

""Mechanism studies have suggested that the main bioactive compounds in tea, namely polyphenols, are not stored in the body long-term. Thus, frequent tea intake over an extended period may be necessary for the cardioprotective effect,"" said Gu.

In a subanalysis by type of tea, drinking green tea was linked with about 25 per cent lower risks for incident heart disease and stroke, fatal heart disease and stroke, and all-cause death, the researchers said.

However, no significant associations were observed for black tea, they said.

Gu noted that a preference for green tea is unique to East Asia.

""In our study population, 49 per cent of habitual tea drinkers consumed green tea most frequently, while only 8 per cent preferred black tea.

""The small proportion of habitual black tea drinkers might make it more difficult to observe robust associations, but our findings hint at a differential effect between tea types,"" he said.

Two factors may be at play. First, green tea is a rich source of polyphenols which protect against cardiovascular disease and its risk factors including high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia.

Black tea is fully fermented and during this process polyphenols are oxidised into pigments and may lose their antioxidant effects.

Second, black tea is often served with milk, which previous research has shown may counteract the favourable health effects of tea on vascular function.

Gender-specific analyses showed that the protective effects of habitual tea consumption were pronounced and robust across different outcomes for men, but only modest for women.

""One reason might be that 48 per cent of men were habitual tea consumers compared to just 20 per cent of women.

""Secondly, women had much lower incidence of, and mortality from, heart disease and stroke. These differences made it more likely to find statistically significant results among men,"" Wang said.

247,09-1-20,Objective of visit by envoys to Kashmir is to display measures taken to bring back normalcy: MEA,"The government on Thursday said the objective of taking envoys of 15 countries to Kashmir was to help them see the efforts to bring back normalcy in the Valley after abrogation of Article 370 and rejected criticism that the visit is like a guided tour.

The envoys from 15 nations including from the US began a two-day government-facilitated trip to Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday. The Congress accused the government of ""adopting double standards"" by organising ""guided tours"" to Jammu and Kashmir for foreign envoys, but not allowing Indian politicians to visit the Union territories.

Besides the US, the group comprised envoys from South Korea, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Fiji, Maldives, Norway, Philippines, Morocco, Argentina, Peru, Niger, Nigeria, Guyana and Togo, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

""The objective of the visit is for the envoys to see the efforts being made by the government to bring the situation to normal and see first-hand the impact of series of steps taken by the local administration to normalise the situation in recent weeks,"" he said.

Asked why the envoys from the countries of the European Union declined to be part of the group, he said they wanted to visit Jammu and Kashmir in a group, but the government did not extend invite to all.

""We wanted the group to be of manageable size. There was a constraint of numbers. We wanted to have broad-based representation covering various geographical regions...On many issues they (European countries) take group position. Invitation wasn't sent to all (EU) member countries,"" Kumar said.

Diplomatic sources said envoys from several European countries conveyed to the government that they cannot go at such a notice and sought to visit Kashmir without any restrictions.

Kumar said the government would look at the possibility of taking more envoys to Jammu and Kashmir depending on the situation there.

He also rejected criticism that the visit is a ""guided tour"".

The envoys visited Srinagar on Thursday and they will be in Jammu on Friday.

Kumar said the programme for the trip was drawn up keeping in mind the threat posed by terrorism and taking adequate precautions for security.

""Since their arrival today morning, the group had a series of meetings. The first meeting was with the security officials to understand the challenges of maintain security, including threat of terrorism in the union territory,"" he said.

""This was followed by an interaction with civil society from all walks of life and from all over J and K. The group also interacted with the local media as well as a group of political leaders,"" Kumar added.

He said the visit was organised following requests from some envoys based in Delhi.

""Our consistent position has been that any visit to the Union Territory of J and K by foreign dignitaries will be based on assessment by local administration on the prevailing security situation,"" Kumar said.

Asked about political leaders who met the group, he said the visit by the envoys to Kashmir is not yet over.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/objective-of-visit-by-envoys-to-kashmir-is-to-display-measures-taken-to-bring-back-normalcy--mea-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/objective-of-visit-by-envoys-to-kashmir-is-to-display-measures-taken-to-bring-back-normalcy--mea.html
248,09-1-20,Murli Manohar Joshi seeks JNU VC's ouster,"Former HRD minister and senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday called for the removal of JNU Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, saying it is ""shocking"" that he is adamant on not implementing a government proposal to resolve fee-hike crisis in the university.

""Reports are that the HRD ministry had twice advised the JNU VC to implement certain reasonable and working formula for resolving the issue of enhanced fees in JNU. He was also advised to reach out to teachers and students.

""It is shocking that the VC is adamant on not implementing the government proposal. This attitude is deplorable and in my opinion such a VC should not be allowed to continue on this post,"" Joshi tweeted.

Joshi's comments add to the growing clamour for Kumar's removal.

Hundreds of demonstrators, including students and members of civil society organisations, hit the streets on Thursday protesting the recent violence at JNU and demanding resignation of the varsity vice-chancellor.

The HRD Ministry, however, ruled out his removal saying sacking him is not the solution but addressing the core issues on campus.

HRD Ministry officials on Wednesday ""advised"" JNU Vice-Chancellor to increase communication with students, take the faculty into confidence and facilitate the semester registration process, days after violence ran amok on the university campus.

Kumar, who has been severely criticised by students and faculty members for not taking immediate measures when they were brutally attacked on campus by a masked mob, told the officials that efforts were being made to facilitate semester registration for ""willing"" students.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/murli-manohar-joshi-seeks-jnu-vc-s-ouster-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/murli-manohar-joshi-seeks-jnu-vc-s-ouster.html
249,09-1-20,"Trump says no American lives lost, Iran standing down after attacks","As Iran fired 22 missiles at Iraqi bases housing US and other coalition troops in Iraq on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump claimed that no Americans were harmed in the attacks as he offered to embrace peace along with the Iranian leadership, in a significant move to de-escalate the tensions in West Asia. Trump also vowed that he will never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.

“We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases,” Trump said in an address to the nation from the White House Grand Foyer.

His remarks came hours after Iran launched missiles targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces’ are stationed in Iraq, which Tehran said was a “slap in the face” of America.

“All is well!” US President Trump tweeted earlier. “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!, he added.

According to Iranian state TV, the attacks were in revenge for the killing of the commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards, General Qasem Soleimani, in a US drone strike on Friday, which was ordered by Trump. The Iranian state television claimed that “at least 80 terrorist US soldiers” were killed in the strikes. Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group.

In a direct message to the Iranian leaders and the people, Trump said the United States is “ready to embrace peace with all who seek it”.

“To the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve,” Trump said.

Howerver the US President vowed “as long as I’m President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.”

Earlier, Iraq’s Prime Minister’s office said it had received “an official verbal message” from Iran informing it that a missile attack on US forces stationed on Iraqi soil was imminent. However, hours later, Iraq’s President Barham Saleh condemned Iran’s missile strikes on Iraqi bases where US and other foreign troops are based, saying he feared “dangerous developments” in the region.

“We denounce the Iranian missile bombing that hit military installations on Iraqi territory and renew our rejection of the repeated violation of state sovereignty and the transformation of Iraq into a battlefield for warring sides,” his office said in a statement.

“We received an official verbal message from the Islamic Republic of Iran that the Iranian response to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani had begun or would begin shortly, and that the strike would be limited to where the US military was located in Iraq without specifying the locations,” said Iraq PM’s office.

The Iraq Prime Minister’s office said it was simultaneously contacted by the US, as the missiles slammed into the Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq and Harir further north.

Western powers have condemned Iran’s missile attack on the US bases in Iraq. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said, “I condemn the Iranian missile attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq. NATO calls on Iran to refrain from violence.”

Meanwhile, Kuwait on Wednesday denied reports that the US had decided to withdraw its troops from the Gulf state, saying the Twitter account of its official news agency had been hacked.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-says-no-american-lives-lost--iran-standing-down-after-attacks-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump-says-no-american-lives-lost--iran-standing-down-after-attacks.html
250,09-1-20,"Avoid travel to Iraq, advises India; AI flights rerouted","Given the simmering tension between Iran and the US, India on Wednesday took a series of measures, including issuing an advisory to its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Iraq and rerouting the flight path of national carrier Air India.

The Indian Navy is also on standby to evacuate Indians from West Asia in case of any exigency and a warship is already deployed in the Gulf of Oman.

Issuing the travel advisory, the Ministry of External Affairs said, ""In view of the prevailing situation in Iraq, Indian nationals are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to Iraq until further notification.""

It also said Indian nationals residing in Iraq are advised to be alert and may avoid travel within Iraq. ""Our Embassy in Baghdad and Consulate in Erbil will continue to function normally to provide all services to Indians residing in Iraq,"" the Ministry said.

This came after tension increased between Iran and the US following the killing of top Iranian commander General Qassem Soleimani and Iran launching missile strikes against two US military bases in Iraq on Wednesday.

The Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGCA), meanwhile, asked the Indian airline companies to remain vigilant and take all precautions in airspace over Iran, Iraq, Gulf of Oman and waters of Persian Gulf, hours after a Ukrainian airlines carrying 176 passengers crashed near Tehran in Iran.

""We had held meetings with the airlines and have sensitised them to remain vigilant and take all precautions,"" said a senior official of the DGCA on Wednesday.

The Air India would 'temporarily"" reroute its flight to avoid Iran, the airlines spokesman Dhananjay Kumar said adding the rerouting will cover Air India and Air India Express.

Rerouting flights that usually go over Iranian airspace may lead to increase in flying time by 20-40 minutes, he said.

US aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has also asked all US airlines to stop operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, and the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman due to ""events in Middle East"".

As a precautionary measure, the Indian Navy is also on standby to evacuate Indian citizens from the Middle-East if need be. A warship INS Trikhand is already deployed in the Gulf of Oman as part of Operation 'Sankalp' and in case of any emergency the ship will be diverted to the affected region for evacuation, officials said here.

Operation Sankalp was undertaken since June last year after tension in Persian Gulf region and the Indian Navy deployed two warships. Now, one ship is deployed there to ensure the safety of merchant ships especially Indian flagged ones passing through the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Arabian Gulf. In addition, the Navy aircraft carry out aerial reconnaissance in the area since then.

Officials also said the Indian Navy continues to monitor the situation in the Gulf region and is maintaining presence in the region to ensure security of our sea borne trade and the safety of Indian flag merchant vessels transiting through the region.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/avoid-travel-to-iraq--advises-india--ai-flights-rerouted.html
251,09-1-20,176 killed as Ukrainian plane crashes in Tehran,"Won’t give plane’s black boxes to US or Boeing: Iran

A Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, mainly Iranians and Canadians.

Search-and-rescue teams were combing through the smoking wreckage of the Boeing 737 flight from Tehran to Kiev but officials said there was no hope of finding anyone alive.

The vast majority of the passengers on the Ukraine International Airlines flight were non-Ukrainians, including 82 Iranians and 63 Canadians, officials said.

The crash occurred with tensions high in West Asia and shortly after Tehran launched missiles at bases in Iraq housing US troops. But there was no immediate indication of foul play and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against “speculating” on the cause of the disaster.

Meanwhile, Iran’s aviation authority said it would not hand over to Americans the recovered black boxes of the crashed aircraft. “We will not give the black boxes to the manufacturer (Boeing) and the Americans,” Iran Civil Aviation Organisation head Ali Abedzadeh said, quoted by Mehr news agency. “It’s not yet clear which country the black box will go to for the investigation,” he added.

The US aviation authority said it had banned US-registered carriers from flying over Iraq, Iran and the Gulf, and airlines, including Lufthansa and Air France, suspended flights through Iraqi and Iranian airspace.

Footage released by Iranian state media showed a field on fire and the smouldering wreck of the plane. Rescue workers carried body bags and the passengers’ personal items —including luggage, clothes, a Santa Claus doll and a boxing glove — were scattered in the debris.

UIA, the ex-Soviet country’s privately owned flagship carrier, said flight PS752 took off from Tehran airport at 6.10 am and disappeared from radars just two minutes later.

It slammed into farmland at Khalaj Abad, in Shahriar county, about 45 km northwest of the airport, Iranian state media said.

As well as the Iranians and Canadians, the passengers included 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three Britons, Ukraine’s foreign minister said. Eleven Ukrainians — including the nine crew — were also on board.

Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora community and UIA offers discount flights between Tehran and Toronto, with a transit in Kiev. UIA released a list of the names and birth years of passengers. At least 25 were under the age of 18. Iran’s semi-official news agency ISNA said 13 of the passengers were students from Tehran’s Sharif University, the most prestigious in the country.

Two passengers registered on the flight did not board before take-off, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security council, told reporters.

The airline said the Boeing 737 had been built in 2016 and checked only two days before the accident. It was Kiev-based UIA’s first fatal crash. “The plane was in working order,” UIA company president Yevgeniy Dykhne told a briefing in Kiev where he choked back tears. “It was one of our best planes with a wonderful crew.” Zelensky, who cut short a vacation in Oman to return to Kiev, ordered an investigation into the crash and a sweeping check of “all civilian aircraft” in the country.

“I ask everyone to keep from speculating and putting forth unconfirmed theories about the crash,” Zelensky wrote on Facebook. Iranian state media reported that the plane caught fire after crashing, but a video aired by the state broadcaster appeared to show the plane already on fire as it fell from the night sky. Iran on Wednesday fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing the US military, in the first action of its promised revenge for the US killing of a top Iranian general. There is a lot of speculation at the moment it has been shot down — I think that is not going to be the case at all,” said Stephen Wright, a professor of aircraft systems at Tampere University in Finland.

“Planes fly the same routes day in, day out,” he said. “You don’t tend to put... Missiles next to international airways for obvious reasons.” He added: “It could be a bomb or it could be some sort of catastrophic breakup of the aircraft.” The aircraft was not one of the MAX models fitted with anti-stall systems that have been linked with two other recent crashes of Boeing 737s.

Boeing, which has been roiled by a nine-month crisis after 737 MAX was grounded, tweeted on Wednesday: “We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed.” UIA vice president Igor Sosnovskiy told reporters in Kiev that the airline doubted its crew was at fault.

“(The chances) of a crew error are minimal, we simply are not considering them,” he said.

The airline was working with aviation authorities “to do everything possible to find the reasons for the aviation accident”, he said. A statement posted on the Ukrainian embassy website in Iran saying the crash was caused by an engine malfunction and ruling out an act of terror was later redacted, saying all information would be provided by an official commission.

Prime Minister Oleksiy Goncharuk said Kiev was negotiating with Iranian authorities to allow Ukrainian investigators to travel to the crash site.

252,09-1-20,"Masked JNU goons identified, will crack case soon: Police","The Delhi Police is closing on the masked miscreants involved in the Sunday violence which resulted in injury of 36 Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students. Well placed sources said on Sunday that they have identified the face behind those masks and are on the verge of cracking the case.

Meanwhile, protests continued for the third consecutive day on JNU campus. Police though is yet to make any arrest but senior officials tasked with the probe said they have got several vital leads on the identities of the masked miscreants who wreaked havoc on the unarmed students and vandalised the campus.

Police teams are tracing the mobile phones which were active inside the JNU campus and its adjoining areas before and after the violence. “Police teams are also scanning the phone numbers who were talking to each other before and after the violence broke out inside Periyar and Sabarmati hostels,” said a senior police official.

Also, police on Wednesday put posters appealing students to share videos and photos of the incident that were doing rounds on the social media platforms. Police wants original footages not the edited ones. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has also received several videos and information from the students and independent sources on Wednesday.

“Several video clips and photos are being scrutinised and the Delhi Police has also requested the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to also send a computer forensics team to analyse CCTV footages,” said a senior police official.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police maintained its presence in the JNU campus to ensure safety and security of the students. Armed police personnel in large numbers were present on various gates of the university to ensure that no untoward incident takes place. Police has barricaded gates and only visitors with valid identity proofs were being allowed entry.

Devendra Arya, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), South-West district said that the situation is campus is under control and as per request from the JNU administration, the police presence will continue. “Policemen in civil clothes will be inside the JNU campus while personnel in uniform will remain outside the campus,” said the DCP.

In a related development, the SIT has received 11 more complaints, including one lodged by a professor in connection with the violence.

According to a police official, “They have received 11 complaints in connections with the incident on January 5. Out of these, one complaint has been lodged by a professor while the other complaints were submitted aggrieved students. All these complaints are being transferred to Crime branch,” he said.

“Teams of crime Branch and FSL visited the campus to collect evidence again on Wednesday. An appeal has already been made to public to share information and video clips of the incident,” the official added.

Earlier on Tuesday, several teams of the FSL had arrived at JNU to collect evidence in connection with the violence in the campus that injured 34 people. Teams from Physics, Chemistry and Biology divisions of the FSL were in the university.

On Sunday, a mob of masked young men stormed the JNU campus in south Delhi and targeted students in three hostels, unleashing mayhem with sticks, stones and iron rods, hitting inmates and breaking windows, furniture and personal belongings. They also attacked a women’s hostel.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/masked-jnu-goons-identified--will-crack-case-soon--police-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/masked-jnu-goons-identified--will-crack-case-soon--police.html
253,09-1-20,"No proof of children’s murder at Muzaffarpur shelter home, says CBI","There is no evidence of murder of children in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur shelter home, the CBI on Wednesday told the Supreme Court.

The probe agency told the apex court that two skeletons recovered from the premises were found to be of a woman and a man in forensic examination. A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde accepted the status report of the

CBI and allowed two officers to be relieved from the investigation team.

Representing the CBI, Attorney General KK Venugopal told a Bench, also comprising Justice B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, that inmates had given statements that murder of children had taken place and bodies were buried.

“When the probe agency went to the spot where the alleged bodies were buried, two skeleton parts were recovered. On forensic investigation of the skeleton parts it was found to be of a woman and a man and the possibility of murder of minor was ruled out,” Venugopal told the apex court.

The Attorney General said when experts of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) again spoke to the girls who had given the statement, the allegation of murder of minors was found to be false.

Venugopal said the CBI traced the 35 girls who were alleged to be murdered and found them alive.

He told the Bench that the probe was carried out on allegations of rape and sexual assault of children and charge sheets have been filed before the relevant courts.

He said the CBI has investigated cases of 17 shelter homes in Bihar and chargesheets have been filed in 13 of them, while four cases were closed when after preliminary enquiry no evidence of any wrongdoing was found.

Venugopal said trial proceedings in one of the case were complete and judgment was likely to be pronounced in January 14.

Advocate Shoeb Alam appearing for petitioner Nivedita Jha said that under Section 161 of CrPC the minor girls have clearly given statement that inmates of shelter home were murdered.

Contradicting Venugopal’s statements, Alam told the Bench, “Merely because all the girls were found, does not rule the possibility that no murder has taken place and probe agency should look into the allegations”.

Alam said on June 3, 2019, the Supreme Court had ordered the CBI to complete investigation in three months on four counts -- allegations of unnatural sexual assault under Section 377 of the IPC, offences under the Information Technology Act regarding the video recordings of the alleged assault on girls at the shelter home, role of outsiders and officials who were involved and facilitated the sexual assaults on the inmates after administering them intoxicants and human trafficking.

Alam further said the CBI had not investigated all these four aspects and the status report of CBI is silent on them. He also said that the petitioner has no objection to relieving the two officers, who were part of investigation team, but the agency should disclose the status of investigation on these four aspects.

The Bench then said it would like to hear the petitioner on the application of CBI seeking permission for utilising the services of investigating team in other official matter as the probe in the shelter home case is over.

It asked the petitioner to file a reply on the application of the CBI and allowed the two officers -- 1996 batch IPS Bhanu Bhaskar and Devendra Singh, head of special crime branch, Patna -- be relieved from the investigation team.

The CBI, in its status report filed on June 6, said no incriminating evidence proving commission of any criminal offence could be gathered in four Preliminary Enquiries and as such no FIR has been registered.

The agency said that it had forwarded a self-contained note to the Bihar Chief Secretary for taking actions against erring Government servants including 25 district magistrates in all the 17 cases.

It had also said the Bihar Government has been requested to take departmental action against erring officials, and cancellation of registration as also blacklisting of concerned NGOs.

Several girls were allegedly sexually and physically assaulted at the shelter home run by an NGO in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur. The issue had come to light following a report by the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).

Following the TISS report, a petition was filed in SC seeking registration of an FIR and court-monitored probe by an independent agency into the allegations.

The plea filed by journalist Nivedita Jha through advocate Fauzia Shakil had sought “registration of FIR and independent investigations or court monitored probe into the affairs of these 14 (other) shelter homes in Bihar mentioned in the TISS report”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-proof-of-children---s-murder-at-muzaffarpur-shelter-home--says-cbi-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-proof-of-children---s-murder-at-muzaffarpur-shelter-home--says-cbi.html

255,09-1-20,'Chhapaak' storm: Laxmi Agarwal's lawyer plans to sue makers,"Advocate Aparna Bhat, who represented acid attack victim Laxmi Agarwal in court, is upset with the Deepika Padukone-starrer ""Chhapaak"" and has threatened to take legal action against the makers of the film.

""Chhapaak"" is based on Laxmi's life, and Deepika plays a character based on Laxmi in the film. Bhat's contention is the filmmakers have not given due acknowledgement to her in the film's credits. The advocate, who played a pivotal role in real life to ensure justice was served to Laxmi in the case fought at Patiala House Courts, took to Facebook and wrote a few posts to vent her ire, and also announce that she would be taking the makers of ""Chhapaak"" to court.

Bhat wrote in her Facebook post: ""Have never been the one to demand attention to my work. Deeply disturbed by the turn of events post watching Chhapaak. Compelled to take legal action to protect my identity and preserve my integrity. I represented Lakshmi in her criminal trial in Patiala House Courts... tomorrow someone will represent me in my cause...Ironies of life.""

No sooner did she put up a post, there were many people coming out in her support. Overwhelmed by the fact, she wrote another post: ""I thank all my friends who endorsed my contribution and challenged team Chhapaak in failing to say even ""Thank you!!a. I cannot match the powers of these mighty producers of Bollywood but keeping quiet will further endorse injustice. I have decided to take my cause to the next level. Ready to face the consequences.""

This is the second controversy that has erupted about aChhapaak"" within the span of a single day. Earlier on Wednesday, a social media and whatsapp was flooded with the rumour that the name of the real-life acid attacker was changed from Basheer to Rajesh in the film, in order to protect the culprit's religious identity. However, pre-release screenings on Wednesday revealed the name of Nadeem has been changed to Basheer.

Wednesday's controversies over ""Chhapaaka followed Deepika's visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday night. She was at JNU as a mark of solidarity with the students who were victims of a violent attack by unidentified masked men on Sunday night.

Deepika's JNU visit was construed by many as a publicity stunt, and clamour to boycott her new film has been trending online, although a large section of social media has also hailed her gesture.

256,09-1-20,Trump admin doesn't want India to degrade its defence capabilities: US official on CAATSA,"The Trump administration does not want to make a decision that degrades the defence capabilities of India which is its 'Major Defence Partner', a senior US official has said, referring to the potential sanctions under CAATSA which prohibits countries from purchasing significant military equipment from Russia.

The US has said in the past it was working with countries, including India, to help them identify and avoid engaging in potentially sanctionable activities under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

India and Russia signed the USD 5 billion S-400 air defence system deal in October 2018, after wide-ranging talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Responding to a question on implications of India going ahead with its decision to purchase S-400 missile defence system from Russia, the official said: ""I know India has expressed valid concerns... They don't want to have a sustainment line completely shut down... That's the last thing we want to do with a significant partner. We don't want to degrade their defence capabilities"".

The US has said that such a major purchase would come under the purview of the punitive CAATSA sanctions. It has already taken such an action against Turkey.

Many in India believe a Congressional waiver would bail it through. However, the US official insisted that there is no country-specific or blanket waiver for such a major defence purchase.

""What we don't want India to do is to introduce something that as we continue to go forward in this partnership makes it challenging or exposes risk to our technology on future acquisitions,"" said the official requesting anonymity.

""It has been reported in different places, mostly outside of the US, that there was an understanding that there's a blanket waiver. There is not. I would start with that there is not a blanket waiver. Congress certainly never designed that or anticipated that, nor did the (Trump) administration,"" said the official.

While there is not a blanket waiver, there is also not a blanket application, he said.

""There is a case-by-case analysis on where CAATSA sanctions could be applied. CAATSA sanctions also can range in depth as to how deep-cutting and to who, the entities and the people. And those options are always there,"" the official said.

Officials from India and the United States -- which have seen galloping of their bilateral defence trade in last 15 years -- are having intense conversations on this issue. Any sanctions on India would have the potential to undo the improvement in the defence and strategic relationship, he said.

""Indian officials know that there is a risk of application of sanctions. Indian officials also know that we want to work with them to find a path forward where they have historic sustainment lines that certainly don't put them at CAATSA risk.

""The challenge we have with any state like India is new acquisitions on significant systems that would either put at risk our platforms or expose our technologies to an adversary. And so we said this very simple – Turkey was a perfect example. The S-400 put at risk the F-35. The S-400 also could put at risk other platforms, and so we've had these conversations very candidly with all partners,"" said the senior State Department official.

The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system. China was the first foreign buyer to seal a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014 for the system.

The US recognised India as a ""Major Defence Partner"" in 2016, a designation that allows India to buy more advanced and sensitive technologies from America at par with that of the US' closest allies and partners, and ensures enduring cooperation into the future.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-admin-doesn-t-want-india-to-degrade-its-defence-capabilities--us-official-on-caatsa-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-admin-doesn-t-want-india-to-degrade-its-defence-capabilities--us-official-on-caatsa.html

258,09-1-20,Grief and mourning after Iran plane crash kills 176,"Bereaved friends and families joined in mourning after a Ukrainian airliner crashed near Tehran killing all 176 on board, as heartbreaking details started emerging about the victims, most of them from Iran and Canada.

Both Canada and the United States called for a full investigation to determine the cause of Wednesday's crash, which came shortly after Tehran launched missiles at American troops in Iraq in response to the killing of a top Iranian general.

There was no immediate indication that foul play may have caused the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) plane to go down soon after take-off, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against speculating on the crash causes.

Search-and-rescue teams combed through the smoking wreckage of the Boeing 737 flight to Kiev, but officials said there was no hope of finding survivors.

Body bags were lined up on the ground, and the passengers' personal items -- including luggage, clothes, a Santa Claus doll and a boxing glove -- were scattered in the debris.

At least 25 of the passengers were under the age of 18, the UIA said.

According to Ukraine, 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three Britons were on board, as well as 11 Ukrainians -- including nine crew.

About 30 came from the Iranian community around Edmonton, capital of Alberta province in western Canada, where resident Payman Parseyan described the tragedy as ""devastating."" ""Every one of our community members was touched in one way or another,"" Parseyan told Canada's national broadcaster CBC.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his ""sincere condolences"" to the bereaved families.

The head of Iran's civil aviation organisation, Ali Abedzadeh, said Iran would cooperate with Ukraine, but not send the black boxes to the US, with which it has no diplomatic relations.

Without naming Iran directly, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling for ""complete cooperation with any investigation into the cause of the crash."" According to aviation experts, only a handful of countries are capable of analysing black boxes -- notably Britain, France, Germany and the United States.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government would ensure a ""thorough investigation"" and that ""Canadians' questions are answered"".

The country is home to a large Iranian diaspora, and UIA offers relatively inexpensive flights between Toronto and Tehran, with a layover in Kiev.

""About an hour ago, a Ukrainian Airlines plane just landed in Toronto from Kiev,"" Trudeau said at a press conference. ""According to the airline, there were 138 passengers who weren't on that flight because they died in the crash on the earlier leg of their travel."" The Edmonton victims included a couple of university professors and their two young girls, aged 9 and 14.

""Many of these people were international students,"" said Parseyan. ""They worked tirelessly to get to where they were, all to lose it like this."" Siavash Ghafouri-Azar, 35, and Sara Mamani, 36, were coming home from their wedding in Iran, according to The Globe and Mail newspaper.

Hamed Esmaeilion, an Iranian-born dentist, told the paper he had been due to pick up his wife and nine-year-old daughter from the Toronto airport. Instead he was heading to Tehran in search of answers after both perished in the crash.

""I have to go. I'm alone here,"" he said.

UIA, the ex-Soviet country's privately owned main carrier, said flight PS752 took off from Tehran airport at 6:10 am (0240 GMT) and disappeared from radars minutes later.

It slammed into farmland at Khalaj Abad, in Shahriar county, about 45 kilometres (just under 30 miles) northwest of the airport, Iranian state media said.

A video aired by Iran's state broadcaster appeared to show the plane already on fire as it fell.

The airline said the Boeing 737 had been built in 2016 and checked only two days before the accident. It was UIA's first fatal crash.

""The plane was in working order,"" company president Yevgeniy Dykhne told a briefing in Kiev where he choked back tears. ""It was one of our best planes with a wonderful crew."" UIA vice president Igor Sosnovskiy likewise said chances of a crew error were ""minimal"".

Dozens of people gathered in the departure hall at Boryspil airport outside Kiev to pay their respects to the crew, five men and four women.

""There is a lot of speculation at the moment it has been shot down -- I think that is not going to be the case at all,"" said Stephen Wright, a professor of aircraft systems at Tampere University in Finland.

""It could be a bomb or it could be some sort of catastrophic breakup of the aircraft."" Trudeau said he was unable to rule out foul play, but added: ""It's dangerous to speculate on possible causes."" Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said the flight's takeoff was normal.

""However, we lost contact with it, suggesting that something very unusual happened,"" he said.

The aircraft was not one of the MAX models fitted with anti-stall systems that have been linked with two other recent crashes of Boeing 737s.

Boeing said it was ready to help in any way needed.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/grief-and-mourning-after-iran-plane-crash-kills-176-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/grief-and-mourning-after-iran-plane-crash-kills-176.html
259,09-1-20,"Safest JNU now scariest, rue students","The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and the hostel premises were one of the safest places in the country for us even than our home but now it has become the scariest place for all the students, said Pushpa, a PhD scholar in Russian language.

She has been distraught ever since the violence took place inside university hostels. Students, especially women, dread going out alone and have started walking in groups to have some security around them.

“Now we are going out in groups or pairs from one centre to another because we never know what will happen next. When the incident took place even the common innocent students who were not part of it were caught into the vortex of violence and brutally beaten by the goons. Every student of this university knows who are the people behind this violence. I am studying in this university since 2010 and protests were held before but this will be the first time that such incident has taken place and the Vice Chancellor is just idle and doing nothing to instill confidence amongst students,” said Pushpa.

The Pioneer visited the JNU campus on Tuesday and Wednesday to feel the atmosphere there and how students were coping after watching the battered and blood soaked images of their colleagues.

Days after the violent attack, when a group of over 50 masked men and women allegedly belonging to Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarti Parishad (ABVP) and Bajrang Dal entered the campus and Periyar Hostel and beat students to pulp and damaged properties.

A group of students Pawan Parag, Amit, Nivedita and Ravi Yadav from the School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies (SLL&CS) said the students have been protesting for more than 70 days against the fee hike as that militates against the very ethos and culture of the JNU.

“Our parents are scared but being a citizen of this country and a student of this university, it is my right to raise an issue, be it fee hike or Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

I am not involved in any protest or demonstration but every student enrolled in the university is against the arbitrary decision and changes promulgated the JNU administration,” said Parag Pawan, a research scholar.

Pawan sounded worried as to how outsiders managed to enter the campus despite security and administration did nothing except twiddling its thumb. The JNU student unions has been elected by the students and its office bearers represent us. The Vice Chancellor should have at least met them. “The fact that the VC has refused to recognise JNUSU speaks volumes about his mindset vis-à-vis students and their demands. Since the VC has failed to protect us the students, he should demit his office,” Pawan added.

While another student Waris said, “Fee hike is a big issue, people say it is just Rs 10 but the thing is it is mess fees that has caused major worry for us. There are many students who are unable to pay that amount because they come from a very poor economic background. Students never liked the earlier VCs. Now we are forced to believe that previous VCs were far compassionate as compared to the present VC M Jagadesh Kumar. Ever since he has taken charge, there has been unrest in this campus. Apart from the fee hike; it is about seats cut, examination pattern changes and compulsory attendance. If a research scholar will write an objective pattern exams, how will s/he gets indepth knowledge.”

Another student who wants to remain anonymous said, “My parents and friends are scared after Sunday’s incident. I came here to study and it was a peaceful place. Protests do happen in every university but hooliganism and vandalism should be condemned and should never be allowed to happen at the very first place. We want our deaf and dumb VC to take stand for us and act to provide safety to the students within the campus.”

“I want to appear for the exams. My parents have clearly asked me not to involve in any protest and demonstrations but I stay here in the campus and I know what this place is. The student union did not force us to boycott the examinations. The students who wanted to register for the exams, registered. I did register for the exams smoothly and about 3,000 students registered for the examinations. But, as a student, I don’t think the protest against fee hike is wrong. Even I am not protesting with them bit I stand for my fellow mates and whatever is happened in the university is because of the careless attitude of the university administration towards the students. The ruckus is by the ABVP goons,” said a JNU student who wants to stay anonyms.

Rajesh Yadav, a PhD student, said, “Those who left the campus come from a very good family. But here there are thousands of students who are still in the university because their hometown is far and their parents don’t earn much to book a flight for their wards. Now students are locked inside the room in fear. But, everyone is against the fee hike and stand with our fellow students because anyone can come and beat me with no reason.”

“About 30 students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and senior Professors such as Sucharita Sen, were beaten up by a group of masked men on Sunday and till date no arrest has been made,” said students.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/safest-jnu-now-scariest--rue-students-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/safest-jnu-now-scariest--rue-students.html

262,09-1-20,"Ball wasn't in my court, was in a vulnerable place: Pandya's defence on 'Koffee' controversy","""The ball was not in my court,"" said Hardik Pandya as he sought to explain his outrageous comments on women in a TV show that led to his suspension and an outpouring of condemnation last year.

Pandya, along with teammate K L Rahul, drew a lot of flak after their loose talk on women on 'Koffee with Karan' went viral, prompting the BCCI to suspend them and institute an inquiry into their conduct.

In his latest statement on the episode, Pandya said things were not particularly in his control during the interview.

""We as cricketers did not know what was going to happen. The ball was not in my court, it was in someone else's court where they had to take the shot and that's a very vulnerable place, you don't want to be (in it),"" Pandya told India Today's show 'Inspiration'.

Pandya and Rahul were called back from an ongoing series against Australia at that time and their captain Virat Kohli too was openly critical of their comments on the show.

Both eventually came back after explaining themselves and apologising to the inquiry committee of the BCCI. While Rahul is currently playing in the T20 series against Sri Lanka, Pandya is recovering from a back injury.

Talking about cricketing matters, he downplayed comparisons with Mahendra Singh Dhoni who owned the No.7 slot before Pandya's arrival into the team.

""I'll never be able to fill MS' shoes, so I don't even think that way. I'm quite excited for the challenge to be honest. Whatever I do, it will be always for the team you know. It will be one step at the ladder and slowly-slowly that Cup will be there,"" he said.

263,09-1-20,EU chief warns UK must compromise to get Brexit trade deal,"Three weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union, the president of the European Commission warned Wednesday that the UK won't get the ""highest quality access"" to the European Union's market after Brexit unless it makes major concessions.

In a friendly but frank message to the UK, Ursula von der Leyen said negotiating a new UK-EU trade deal will be tough. She also said the end-of-2020 deadline that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed on negotiations makes it ""basically impossible"" to strike a comprehensive new agreement in time.

Von der Leyen, who took over as head of the EU's executive branch on December 1, met Johnson at 10 Downing Street in London on Wednesday for the first time since the British leader's election victory last month.

Johnson's Conservatives won a substantial parliamentary majority in Britain's Dec. 12 election, giving him the power to end more than three years of wrangling over Brexit and take the UK out of the EU on January 31. It will be the first nation to ever leave the bloc, which currently has 28 members.

Britain's departure will be followed by a transition period in which the U.K.-EU relationship will remain largely unchanged while the two sides negotiate a new trade arrangement.

Johnson says the UK is seeking a wide-ranging free trade deal, but doesn't want to agree to keep all EU rules and standards.

Johnson's office said after the meeting that the UK wanted ""a broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas."" But it said ""any future partnership must not involve any kind of alignment"" in which Britain would automatically follow EU rules.

That could cause problems. Speaking at the London School of Economics before her meeting with Johnson, von der Leyen warned that ""without a level playing field on environment, labor, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world's largest single market."" ""With every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off,"" she warned.

The EU worries that Britain plans to cut environmental and employment standards in order to position itself as a low-regulation, low-tax competitor to the bloc.

Johnson sought to allay those fears, telling von der Leyen the UK would continue to maintain high standards ""in areas like workers' rights, animal welfare, agriculture and the environment,"" Downing St said.

International trade agreements typically take years to complete, but Johnson has ruled out extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020, although the EU has offered to prolong it until 2022.

Downing Street said Wednesday that ""both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement to conclude on time."" Von der Leyen said the time frame was ""very, very tight"" and made it ""basically impossible"" to negotiate anything but a skeleton deal.

""The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be,"" she said. ""And without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. We will have to prioritize.""

The German EU chief — who studied in Britain in the 1970s and has proclaimed herself a friend and fan of Britain — did have some encouraging words for Johnson. She said the bloc was ready to strike a tariff-free and quota-free trade deal with Britain, and ""a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope.""

She said the new relationship could encompass ""everything ""rom climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. And we are ready to work day and night to get as much of this done within the time frame we have.” At the start of the meeting, Johnson noted that he and von der Leyen had attended the same Belgian school — the European School in Brussels, where both lived for a time as children. Johnson, 55, is six years younger than the EU chief.

Johnson's election victory broke Britain's political stalemate over Brexit. His 80-seat House of Commons majority means he has the votes to get his Brexit deal approved by lawmakers, something his predecessor Theresa May never achieved.

Johnson's key Brexit bill was approved in principle last month and is expected to pass its final House of Commons hurdle on Thursday after three days of debate. It also must be approved by the European Parliament.

Von der Leyen said she did not anticipate a delay and expected the U.K. To leave the EU on January 31.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eu-chief-warns-uk-must-compromise-to-get-brexit-trade-deal-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/eu-chief-warns-uk-must-compromise-to-get-brexit-trade-deal.html

265,09-1-20,"Australia bushfire crisis: 24 killed, over 6 mn hectares of land burned","Australia's raging bushfire crisis, one of the worst in its history, has killed 24 people, burned over six million hectares of land, reduced to ashes hundreds of homes and pushed many species towards extinction, officials said on Thursday.

Authorities on Thursday issued fresh warnings and evacuation orders in the country's southeast as hot and windy conditions threatened to regenerate huge bushfires.

Around 23 fires were still burning in Victoria, according the state's emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp.

Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews on Thursday announced extending state's first-ever state of disaster ahead of ""significant fire activity"" forecast for the next two days.

""We have forecast conditions of extreme danger, very significant fire activity is likely off the back of a hot day today, a hot day tomorrow and a change not coming through in the east of the state until late afternoon tomorrow and in the northern part of the state not until the evening on Saturday,"" he said.

""This means that we have every reason to believe there will be significant fire activity over the next 48 hours and that means it is appropriate that we continue the state of disaster,"" Andrews said.

There will be messages going out to communities in the fire zone on Thursday and those messages will indicate to people that they are in the fire zone and that if they can leave, they should leave, the Premier of Victoria said, adding that ""we will not be able to guarantee their safety"".

There was a possibility of another round of dry lightning and a wind change which could trigger fires across the state from Friday.

""This is a really significant challenge for us. We don't underestimate it. We don't lightly extend the state of disaster. We have done it because we believe that it will save lives and that, after all, is the most important thing,"" Andrews said.

Victoria's emergency management commissioner Crisp said that in the state, 244 homes were lost or damaged and another 400 'significant' structures impacted.

""We know those numbers will grow,"" he said.

Meanwhile in New South Wales, state premier Gladys Berejiklian announced an additional 1 billion Australian dollar over the next two years into bushfire management and recovery for rebuilding and rehabilitating the fire ravaged zones.

This season saw the worst damages across the state with almost 2000 homes damaged so far and 20 deaths.

Berejiklian said the new funding would prioritise infrastructure repair and help stimulate fire-ravaged NSW communities.

""The bushfire season is far from over but we know how important it is for communities to start the recovery process where possible,"" Berejiklian said in a statement.

She said the funding was on top of 231 million dollar already committed to disaster assistance funding.

In its latest tweet, NSW Rural fire services said: ""Over 2,500 firefighters in the field, prepare for worsening conditions Friday. Currently 122 bush & grass fires, half uncontained"".

In South Australia's Kangaroo Island, the bushfire threat on Thursday was escalated with 'a watch and act warning' issued for a fire near Parndana which according to the Country Fire Service (CFS) was uncontrolled and was burning in a southeasterly direction threatening the safety of people in the area.

The fire has already destroyed 160,000 hectares including the famous Flinders Chase National Park.

A total fire ban has been declared across the island following the high fire risk due to temperatures and winds rise.

""Currently there is no immediate threat to life or property but with increasing wind, warmer weather and ongoing fires on Kangaroo Island, this situation is likely to change,"" the CFS said.

Over six million hectares of land has burned in this year's worst bushfire season of Australian history, claiming 24 lives and damaging hundreds of homes and buildings across several parts of southern New South Wales, northern and eastern Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, according to officials.

The raging fire has pushed many species towards extinction, with the number of kangaroos, koalas and others killed in the crisis keeps increasing.

According to some experts, an estimated 1 billion animals have been killed.

The bushfire crisis has taken a very heavy toll with more than 1,500 homes already lost throughout the course of this fire season, which has been running since September, according to the government.

Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.

Australia's military has been assisting with aerial reconnaissance, mapping, search and rescue, logistics and aerial support for months.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is facing widespread criticism in Australia for his handling of the crisis, on Monday announced an additional 2 billion dollars over two years to a new agency to coordinate a national response to rebuild communities and livelihoods following the deadly bushfire crisis.

The National Bushfire Recovery Agency, headed by former federal police chief Andrew Colvin, will help bushfire affected communities recover.

266,09-1-20,Senate passed bills to extend Gen Bajwa's tenure without debate: Pak dissidents,"The bills giving three years extension to General Qamar Bajwa as army chief was ""rushed"" through parliament without debate, a group of dissident Pakistanis said.

The bills to extend the retirement age from 60 to 64 years for the chiefs of army, navy and air force, and the chairman of the joint chief of staff committee sailed through the Senate or the upper house despite protests from minor parties, Geo News said.

Under the banner of the South Asians Against Terrorism and For Human Rights (SAATH) Forum, the group on Wednesday voiced concern at the manner in which the Pakistan government and main opposition parties “rushed through parliament” amendments to the Army Act.

The bills were passed “without debate as to the desirability or necessity of such legislation, and without due consideration to the implications of such an action on the future of democracy in Pakistan”, the group that includes former journalists and envoys said in a statement.

Senate chairman Sadiq Sanjrani adjourned the session as soon as the bills were passed. The Senate session lasted only 20 minutes and no other agenda other than the laying of a few reports was taken up, the Dawn said.

The bills were already approved by the Standing Committee on Defence.

“It is a fact of history that the desire to perpetuate personal power, army chiefs of Pakistan have time and again disrupted the democratic project in Pakistan.

""While in the past the military has carried out coups, and its chiefs have extended their tenures themselves by force, and while one example also exists where the president of Pakistan extended the tenure of an army chief under duress, there is no example of parliament undertaking such an adventure,” it said.

SAATH condemned “the unprecedented surrender of the political class and the sacred House that represents the will of the people” and attributed it to “political expediency and personal short- term gains” of Pakistan's political leaders.

267,09-1-20,After missile launch Iran says it respects Iraqi sovereignty,"Iran said Wednesday it respects Iraq's territorial integrity, after firing missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops.

The early Wednesday strike led Iraq to say it would summon the Iranian ambassador.

In a letter to the United Nations Security Council and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht Ravanchi, said his country has full respect for ""the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Iraq."" There were no American or Iraqi military casualties in the strikes.

""The operation was precise and targeted military objectives thus leaving no collateral damage to civilians and civilian assets in the area,"" the diplomat said in a letter released by the Iranian mission.

Iran ""recalls its dedication to the maintenance of international peace and security and stresses that it does not seek escalation or war,"" he said.

Iraq's foreign ministry said Wednesday it would call in the Iranian ambassador because of the missile attack, which it called a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.

Iraq had already summoned the US ambassador after the US drone strike last Friday that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad airport.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/after-missile-launch-iran-says-it-respects-iraqi-sovereignty-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/after-missile-launch-iran-says-it-respects-iraqi-sovereignty.html
268,09-1-20,Pentagon chief: US has restored 'level of deterrence' on Iran,"US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday that the United States has reestablished some deterrence toward Iran in the wake of the January 3 drone strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

""I think at this point with the strikes we took against KH in late December and then our actions with regard to Soleimani, I believe that we've restored a level of deterrence with them,"" he told reporters, referring to Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed Iraqi group backed by Iran.

""But we will see. Time will tell,"" Esper said. Esper's comments came after Iran fired a volley of ballistic missiles Wednesday into two bases in Iraq that house US troops, in response to Soleimani's killing.

No US or Iraqi personnel were killed in those strikes, and reports said the US knew that an attack was coming.

The Pentagon also said its own ""early warning systems"" detected the incoming missiles in advance, allowing personnel to avoid injury.

Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley dismissed suggestions that Iran did not intend to kill Americans with its missile barrage, which struck the sprawling Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and a base in Arbil, both housing American and other foreign troops with the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group.

""I believe, based on what I saw and what I know, is that they were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel. That's my own personal assessment,"" Milley told reporters.

""But we took sufficient defensive measures that there were no casualties to US personnel, coalition personnel, contractors or Iraqis."" Esper also downplayed the firing of two rockets into Baghdad's fortified Green Zone late Wednesday, where the US and other foreign embassies are located and many US troops are based.

""We should have some expectation that the Shia militia groups, either directed or not directed by Iran, will continue in some way, shape or form to try and undermine our presence there, either politically or, you know, take some type of kinetic actions against us or do Lord-knows-what,"" Esper told reporters.

A top Iraqi paramilitary commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was also killed in the strike on Soleimani last week.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pentagon-chief--us-has-restored--level-of-deterrence--on-iran-2020-01-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pentagon-chief--us-has-restored--level-of-deterrence--on-iran.html

271,09-1-20,Rangoli Chandel recalls her acid attack ordeal,"Acid attack is currently a topic of discussion on social media as the promotions of Deepika Padukones ""Chhapaak"" are going on in full swing.

The film directed by Meghna Gulzar is inspired by the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, whose character is being portrayed by the actress.

Amid the ongoing discussions on Deepika and ""Chhapaak"" on Twitter, a user asked actress Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel, who is also an acid attack survivor, to reveal her attacker's identity.

In three separate tweets, Rangoli wrote: ""My attacker's name is Avinash Sharma, he was in the same college as me, we were in the same friend circle, he proposed to me I started keeping distance I didn't share same feelings, he would tell people some day he will merry me...""

""When my parents got me engaged to an Air Force officer he became very persistent about marrying me when I retaliated he threatened me to throw acid on me, I brushed such threats aside and never told my parents or went to cops this was the biggest mistake of my life.""

""I was sharing PG house with four girls, a young stranger came asking for me my friend vijaya said someone asking for you I opened the door, he was carrying a jug full of ....and just then in one second CHAPPAK...""

As per latest figures from the National Crime Records Bureau, acid attacks have been rampant in the last decade with shocking cases being reported from different parts of the country. Topping the list are states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Odisha and Kerala. A total of 244 acid attack cases were recorded across the country only in 2017.

272,09-1-20,'WhatsApp from Facebook' arrives for new users in 2020,"Taking another step towards monetising and making all its apps -- WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram -- into one unified experience for billions of users, the social networking giant has added 'WhatsApp from Facebook' for new users on its instant messaging platform in the New Year.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed his plans last year to integrate its chat services -- WhatsApp, Messenger and photo-sharing app Instagram -- to let their users message each other across platforms.

Calling it a long-term project, Zuckerberg said the cross-app functionality will happen in 2020 or beyond.

The new feature was spotted by WABetaInfo, a fan website that tracks WhatsApp updates, on Thursday.

""WhatsApp from Facebook is added to the WhatsApp Status for newly registered users!' posted the website.

A follower replied: ""This is a feature that they know how to implement faster!""

WhatsApp in September quietly rolled out a feature for Android users to let them share their status stories directly on Facebook Story and other apps.

Just like Instagram, WhatsApp's status stories lets users post images, text and videos on your profile that disappear after 24 hours.

Facebook's video calling device Portal also works with just a WhatsApp account, allowing users to make video calls to friends and family and access features like 'Story Time' even if they don't have a Facebook account.

According to Zuckerberg, more than the commercial benefits of the chat integration between the apps, he was concerned about data encryption.

""The first reason that I'm excited about this is moving more to end-to-end encryption by default in more of our products. People really like this in WhatsApp. I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future,"" he told analysts during a conference call.

""There are also a number of cases that we see where people tell us that they want to be able to message across the different services,"" Zuckerberg noted.

The move could let the social networking giant tout higher user engagement to advertisers, further ramping up its advertising division.

275,09-1-20,To test bench strength or not? India face selection dilemma ahead of third T20,"To go with a winning combination or give much needed game time to Sanju Samson and Manish Pandey? That is the dilemma India are facing ahead of the third and final T20 against Sri Lanka here on Friday.

An inexperienced Sri Lanka was no match for India in Indore and considering that, a case could be made for the inclusion of Pandey and Samson.

Pandey has played just one in the last three series, including the current one, while Samson is yet to get a game since he made a comeback with the Bangladesh series in November.

India have been experimenting ahead of the T20 World Cup in October-November but these two players are yet to be tested.

On the other hand, the absence of senior pacers has opened the doors for Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini to make an impression, which they did in the previous game by sharing five wickets among themselves.

Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube, who took the injured Hardik Pandya's place, have got significant opportunities to show what they are capable of.

After the win in Indore, skipper Virat Kohli spoke on how his team is getting better with each passing game.

Most of the players select themselves while he hinted that someone like a Prasidh Krishna could be the surprise package he is looking for the mega event in Australia.

Samson and Pandey must be a tad frustrated to sit out game after game but Friday could be their day. However, what can also not be discounted is the fact that the team management will pick the eleven with the sole aim of winning the series.

Focus will also be on Shikhar Dhawan, who is competing for the second opener's slot alongside K L Rahul. At the moment, Rahul seems ahead in the race to partner Rohit Sharma in Australia.

Jasprit Bumrah did not have the best of outings in his comeback game on Tuesday and he will be raring to go full tilt in the final game.

If he gets to bat, Dube will have do something spectacular to retain his place in side after Pandya returns to action.

Thakur and Saini were impressive in Indore. Thakur was brilliant in the death overs while Saini rattled the batsmen with pace and bounce.

With Sri Lanka having several left-handers, spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-38) and Washington Sundar (1-29) are likely well retain their place, which effectively means that Ravindra Jadeja and Yuzvendra Chahal will have to sit out.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have a lot to work on if they are to trouble the home team. The batsmen will have to make it count after getting starts, which they were not able to do in the second T20.

All-rounder Isuru Udana being ruled out of the game is also a setback. Their main bowler, as put by skipper Lasith Malinga, did not bowl in Indore after injuring himself during warm-up.

The Sri Lankans can definitely do with some experience in the batting department.

Angelo Matthews, who has made a T20 comeback after 16 months, was not picked for the second game in a row. But he could be in the eleven on Friday.

""After that batting performance, everybody has a chance of playing,"" said coach Mickey Arthur following the seven wicket loss.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (c), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur, Manish Pandey, Washington Sundar, Sanju Samson.

Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (c), D Gunathilaka, A Fernando, A Mathews, D Shanaka, K Perera, N Dickwella, Dhananjaya De Silva, I Udana, B Rajapaksa, O Fernando, W Hasaranga, L Kumara, K Mendis, L Sandakan, K Rajitha.
