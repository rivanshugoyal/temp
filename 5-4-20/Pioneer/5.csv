0,05-4-20,Lockdown saboteurs lack common sense,"Everyone is going through such an enormous amount of personal inconvenience? Why is the world order being turned upside down? It is because we are confronted with a dreaded disease with no cure in sight… Now people are angry because what is clear a public health issue have been projected as an issue of religious identity

Nearly every English-language newspaper this Saturday morning has at least one sombre piece warning readers to not go overboard with their reactions. That is always good advice, whether dealing with anger, sadness or happiness. Controlling emotions — the proverbial stiff upper lip — was something that was drilled into those of us who went to schools that modelled themselves on the English public schools. We were never meant to cry — at least not in public; even happiness had to be regulated in its expression; and despondency was invariably greeted with the advice to cheer up and get on with whatever we were doing.

Why, in an age when political correctness has banished the notion of self-restraint from our value system, are we suddenly being advised to get a grip on our feelings? The answer is obvious. For the past 10 days or even more, most law-abiding citizens of India have physically withdrawn from the outside world both for self-preservation and as an act of social responsibility. Those who are experts in the field of public health all over the world have advised us that the only effective way to contain the coronavirus pandemic is social distancing. Each one of us have adjusted our lives drastically, cancelling long-standing plans and disrupting our social and professional lives. Owners of small businesses and the self-employed are living nervously, not knowing whether their lives will ever be the same again. Those in employment are dreading pay cuts or, worse, redundancy. As for casual workers living a marginal existence away from home, their troubles and sadness have been so vividly documented in the media.

Why is everyone going through such an enormous amount of personal inconvenience? Why is the world order being turned upside down? It is because we are confronted with a dreaded disease with no cure in sight. The young are known to be able to cope with COVID-19 better, particularly if they have no other complications. But for the over-60s, the vulnerability is particularly high. In Italy, the average age of the 14,600 or so who have died from coronavirus is 79.5 years. Worse, no one is very sure how long this international crisis will last. The uncertainty is killing.

People have so far responded with good sense and cheer. India is teeming with people and urban overcrowding makes social distancing difficult, if not impossible. It is, for example, not possible to avoid human contact in the vegetable markets or in the queues outside grocery shops. Yet, people are trying their best, protecting themselves with masks, washing their hands with soap and carrying small bottles of hand sanitisers. Yes, precaution and faith in God is what is keeping India going.

It is at such a time that the Tablighi Jamaat has entered the scene. As of last Friday night, the convention hosted by this so-called religious organisation has resulted in 647 coronavirus cases in 14 States from Kashmir to the Andaman Islands. This is probably an underestimate because many of those attended haven’t been traced. Then there are states such as West Bengal that has not been forthcoming with any details.

What can be said with certainty is that the best plans by the Government to flatten the curve and reverse the process of coronavirus spread has suffered a setback because of the Tablighi Jamaat. I can understand if people had quite accidentally strayed into a gathering and, in the process, got themselves infected. This has happened with health workers, doctors and policemen who have been infected as a result of their official duties.

The ones who came from far and wide to Delhi’s West Nizamuddin, a congested Muslim ghetto, to imbibe religious scholarship went there fully aware that the gathering was against all the guidelines issued by the Delhi Government to protect citizens. Most important, the gathering had people who had flown in from overseas and are known to be high risk. By every yardstick, the gathering in Nizamuddin was criminally irresponsible.

People are angry not merely because Government guidelines were violated in a pre-meditated manner but that the organisers were brazen in their defiance, choosing to put out the message that they somehow had divine protection against coronavirus. Now they have gone and spread the disease all over India and continue to be defiant. Those who have been sent to quarantine centres have misbehaved with nurses and doctors. Others who have been traced by the authorities have engineered attacks on doctors and health workers by mobs. Still others are absconding and doing their bit to spread coronavirus across India.

People are angry because what is clear a public health issue have been projected as an issue of religious identity. There are reports from all over India that Muslim localities are defiantly not observing social distancing and continuing life as usual. In the border districts of West Bengal, it would seem that the writ of the Government of India does not run.

People have a right to be not merely angry but furious at the sheer irresponsibility of it all. The behaviour of those who choose to pretend that coronavirus is not their concern are, in effect, helping the enemy in a war. They deserve to be treated as hostile elements.

But instead of getting livid over these rotten apples in the basket of India, our great secular intellectuals are saying we should be restrained in our reactions. Turning the other cheek and showering forgiveness to people who know not what they are doing is good stuff for elevated souls. Unfortunately, it will take some persuasion for people who have a patriotic aversion to saboteurs. This isn’t communalism; it is common sense.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/lockdown-saboteurs-lack-common-sense.html

5,05-4-20,Switch off domestic lights only: Energy Dept,"The State energy department has appealed to people of the State to switch off only household lights at 9 PM on April 05 in a bid to maintain balance in the electricity grids. The department has asked people to continue using all essential electrical equipment during the 9 minute duration when the nation will pray for its triumph against COVID 19.

According to a press communiqué sent by DGM (PR) JBVNL major power distribution firms of the nation held a video conferencing on the situation that may arise due to sudden change in the load on various grids across the country at 9 PM on April 5. It was assessed that sudden turning off of the household lights at 9 Pm will result in sudden reduction of about 1200 to 1300 MW load in the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to people of the nation to light candles, earthen lamps, torch etc at 9 PM on April 5 to show solidarity and fight against the darkness prevailing in the world in the wake of COVID-19. The PM has asked people to switch off the lights before lighting candles, lamps etc.

Therefore, it was decided that the thermal power plants would be run on low-load during the period and hydel plants and gas turbines would be kept under rotation so that the power grids remain balanced.

It was decided in the meeting not to shut any electricity feeder during the period so that emergency services continue to operate.

The Ministry of Power has also issued advisory to people to help maintain electricity supply.

According to the advisory people should switch off only household lights between 9 PM and 9:09 PM for nine minutes and should not turn of other equipments such as fans, television, refrigerator etc. Also, street lights, society lights and other important lights should not be turned off during the nine minute period.

6,05-4-20,AIPEF asks power engrs to be on high alert on Sunday,"



|

All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) representing power engineers in Uttar Pradesh responded to the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for switching off lights for nine minutes on Sunday evening, by advising power engineers to be on high alert and ensure the stability of national power grid at state, regional and national level.

AIPEF chairman Shailendra Dubey took the issue at the highest level on April 3 and wrote to the prime minister and the Union power minister, raising concerns arising out of sudden switching off of all lights.

He requested the prime minister to issue directions to central power utilities to review the situation and issue advisory guidelines to states for reliable and secure operation of grid during the nine minutes of lights being switched off.

Dubey appreciated the prompt response and efforts of the PM Office and power ministry as central power utilities worked on this and instructions were given to the states.

Dubey said that power engineers were prepared to perform under difficult situations and were working round-the-clock to provide uninterrupted power supply.

The AIPEF appealed to power engineers manning thermal and hydro power stations to ensure that the load fluctuation was managed in optimum manner.

The procedures and precautions to be observed were to be analysed and determined in advance so that generating units were able to respond to load changes.

The AIPEF said that state load dispatch centres had to maintain close coordination with respective regional load dispatch centres in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Shillong, so that stability of regional and national grids were maintained under direction and control of RLDCs. Chief engineer of each SLDC has to be available in the SLDC control room for close monitoring and direction.

It said that engineers in charge of 400 kV and 765 kV sub-stations would attend sub-stations for ensuring their safe and smooth operation particularly with respect to high voltage monitoring on Sunday evening.

Following the appeal by the prime minister to the people to switch off lights for nine minutes at 9 pm on Sunday, UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) on Friday ordered load shedding across the state to prevent the power grid from collapsing due to sudden demand drop. As per UPPCL estimates, the demand for power was likely to slump by as much as 3,000 megawatt following the switching off of lights for nine minutes on Sunday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aipef-asks-power-engrs-to-be-on-high-alert-on-sunday.html

10,05-4-20,Priyanka slams govt for plight of medicos,"



|

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the Yogi Adityanath government for the “inhuman working conditions” of medicos and paramedical staff in government hospitals and lack of facilities to them.

On Saturday, targeting the Yogi government, Priyanka tweeted that when doctors and paramedical staff were risking their lives to serve humanity and fight coronavirus, the Uttar Pradesh government was unable to provide even protective kits to the medical staff.

Citing the Banda incident, where doctors were working without personal protection equipment and even their salaries were reportedly deducted, Priyanka termed the move as “inhuman” and said that instead of forwarding all facilities to these warriors, the state government was working against their interests.

She also tagged a video clip in which medical staff of Banda are seen highlighting their problems and the step-motherly treatment meted out to them even as they risked their lives for others.

Earlier, Priyanka also demanded that advance payment of 21 days’ be paid to MGNREGA labourers as they were facing a lot of difficulties due to the nation-wide lockdown.

Meanwhile, UP Congress administrative in-charge Siddharth Priya Srivastava criticised the state government for its apathy towards doctors and other medical staff.

“The government has failed to provide safety kit to doctors and paramedics attending to coronavirus patients and suspects. Besides, resident doctors at King George’s Medical University, nurses association at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and drivers of ambulances have gone on record, complaining about their problems. It is a matter of serious concern that ambulance drivers are complaining that they have not received their salaries in April till now.

16,05-4-20,Over 6000 families from Hindpiri screened,"Members of more than 6000 families staying in Hindpiri alone were screened for Coronavirus by Saturday afternoon, Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray said. The inspection was carried out on Saturday after initial resistance by locals and alleged misbehaviour meted out to some health workers on Thursday, sources said.

""We did not face any resistance from the locals today (Saturday). Members of more than 6000 families living in the area have already been screened,"" Ray said. He, however, did not comment on the findings from the area.

Hindpiri is located at a stone's throw from the Mahatma Gandhi Road of the State Capital –one of the oldest stretches connecting different parts of the city. The first COVID-19 case of Jharkhand, a Malaysian woman, was reported from this locality. The administration wanted to check every person who may have knowingly or unknowingly came in direct contact with the woman since the day she tested positive.

However, on Thursday, some locals resisted the entry of health workers in their houses, suspecting that the data collected from the locality will eventually be used for the National Register of Citizens (NPR) – an idea of the union Government that drew wide criticism from members of a particular community. The Anjuman Islamia committee had to intervene and convince the locals, mostly illiterate people of a particular community, to get tested for COVID-19, sources said.

The 22-year-old Malaysian woman, who happens to be the only positive COVID-19 of capital Ranchi, was apprehended along with 16 other foreign nationals from a mosque in Hindpiri on March 31. She had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi by Rajdhani Express on March 16. The woman's test report brought the entire locality under scanner. However, some locals still resisted medical examinations claiming that the woman was asymptomatic, and only one particular community was being targeted in garb of the testings.

Meanwhile, the lockdown on Saturday was followed strictly across the State capital. A press communique from the district administration said that people were readily using the facilities provided by the Government during the lockdown. ""More than 300 calls were made to a helpline number for senior citizens since the lockdown was enforced. Through the helpline number, many senior citizens sought help in getting edibles, LPG cylinders and even medicines and mobile phones,"" said Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray.

One of the callers, he said, had broken his leg and was in need of medical help. Responding to his complaint, a team of the district administration took him to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) and provided medical assistance, added Ray. The district administration runs helpline numbers for senior citizens, mental health assistance and delivery of edibles and grocery.

The helpline number for senior citizens received around 300 calls and 95 per cent of the complaints were addressed, said Ray, adding that the administration was paying special attention to those senior citizens who stay alone in Ranchi and do not have younger family members to help them out during this crisis. Cops patrolled the streets of Ranchi on Saturday and ensured the people stay indoors.

However, commoners were allowed to move out till 10am for buying vegetables, ration and other edibles. Most areas of the city wore a deserted look during the day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/over-6000-families-from-hindpiri-screened.html

Yadav said that due to the sudden lockdown, some issues were coming forward to which the government machinery was not being able to pay the required attention. He said the quarantine centres in Gonda, Balrampur, Prayagraj and many other districts were in a bad shape and lekhpals responsible for food items and health related items were missing from the duty

He said the government should facilitate the transport of agricultural produce of the farmers to the agricultural mandis and the government should also ensure that the farmers get remunerative price for their produce like foodgrains, vegetables and fruits.

Referring to the sugarcane farmers, the SP chief said their full payment should be made immediately while the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi amount should be immediately be credited in the bank account of the farmers.

The SP president said that the poor people who do not hold the ration cards should also be provided free ration along with financial assistance of Rs 1,000.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-demands-more-support-for-farmers.html

Among these people, 500 are admitted to various hospitals and around 1,800 are in quarantine. We are testing all the 500 people because they have various symptoms and all of them may be suffering from coronavirus which means the number of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi will increase.

I want to request all the senior citizens who are above 55 or 60 years that you should be very very cautious about the situation and do not go outside. All the senior citizens are very precious us and I do not want any of them to suffer. I will also request the people who have serious diseases to be very cautious because Coronavirus can be lethal for them,” Kejriwal said further.

I am personally monitoring the situation in Delhi and I have every record of the persons who are affected by the Coronavirus. We will ensure the best health facility and treatment to these patients in Delhi,” said Kejriwal.

IG Shukla issued a written instruction on April 01 wherein there is an embargo on wearing cap. Shukla said, “We have asked our men and all officials not to wear cap. This instruction has come into effect immediately that is April 01.”

IG further said, “This embargo is till further orders”. He said there is an instruction for wearing full sleeve uniform which is applicable to cops to officers both without any exception. Sources said this instruction is for DGP also.

Asked about this not to use cap by cops and officers IG said, “It is primarily for the hygiene reasons. Caps cannot be washed so frequently and regularly as one gets uniform washed. Hence caps have been taken off from the heads.”

Reminded that DGP has so gone minutely about sleeve of the uniform and the cap but one thing that still may become the source of worry in time of coronavirus is the stars that are on the shoulder of the cops and the DGP as well to which IG Shukla on hearing this issue got concerned saying, “ This too will be discussed with senior officials.”

However, he said that it is the stars that identify the rank of the cops and officials and if it is ‘off’ then there is a fear of greater confusion to set in among the force out in the field for tackling any law and order situation or for containing or foiling any unlawful activity.

“For field formation police need stars. It is a required thing,” the IG reiterated.

However, when alluded to WHO’s note on coronavirus that its virus sits more and longer time on metal he said “ Our stars need to be re looked from this point of view.”

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Our police force here has begun to follow these instructions. We are all out to have our police family safe and fit in this most highly challenging time.”

Linda said, “We were told of people having no suitable or any adequate water resources available to them taking to the river Koyal here, on which I dispatched my SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta to the bank of river to find out who these people were.”

Linda said, “People which included women, girls and some boys were of the extremely depressed and destitute class as women were found washing their kitchen utensils, children’s clothes as they had no water source back home.”

SDPO Gupta said, “Under order of SP we rushed there where we found very few people collecting drinking water for their use.”

Sources said the river Koyal is the life line and it is the lock down that has reduced the dependency of poor on this river to a large extent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/policemen-not-to-wear-cap-due-to-hygiene-issues.html

The report further said that highest number of samples was collected from Ranchi district and the least number of samples were collected from Sahibganj in Jharkhand. Out of the 206 samples collected from Ranchi by Saturday, 200 tested negative and the report of remaining six suspects are awaited.

Sources said that his samples were collected for Coronavirus tests on Friday and the test result is awaited. He had cough, cold and mild fever, doctors said. ""We shifted him to emergency after his health started deteriorating. He died during treatment,"" said a senior RIMS official, requesting anonymity.

42,05-4-20,"Utilise lockdown time, CM, Sisodia message to parents, children","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister on Saturday interacted with parents in a session on ‘Parenting’ in the Time of Corona’. During the session, Kejriwal and Sisodia both answered questioned posed by children and parents on COVID -19

Urging parents to utilise this time with children to the maximum, Sisodia who is also Education Minister in Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Cabinet, said Parents need to be sensitive about this situation and monitor what their children are exposed to in these times.

Kejriwal asked parents to understand the gravity of the situation and explain this to the children is crucial for the parents. “Parents should set an example for their children by those in need around us,” he said. According to data available with Directorate of Education ( DoE ), 44 Lakh students in Delhi are studying in Government, private and corporations schools.

The interaction was joined by the Director of Education Vinay Bhushan and CEO of Meraki Foundation, Seemant Dhadwal.

Kejriwal and Sisodia took questions on COVID-19 and its gravity, and urged parents to take a positive approach and explain to their children sensitively about the gravity of the situation.

Initiating the session, Sisodia said, “If we talk about Delhi, 44 lakh students are studying in Delhi schools including MCD, private and Government schools. As a result of the lockdown, children are at home. It is very important to understand how to sail through these tough times. The aim is to effectively utilise our time at homes during the isolation, and that is why we are holding this discussion on “Parenting in the Time of corona.”

Introducing the session to the audience, Kejriwal said, “We had to close down schools for the last 15-20 days, due to the extraordinary situation that has arisen worldwide. The only way that we can save ourselves from the virus is by following social distancing norms, staying away from other people and ceasing contact with others. Considering the gravity of the situation and to ensure good health of you and your children, we had to shut down schools 15-20 days back.”

“Children are energetic, they want to go out and play, but all their activities have stopped because of the lockdown. I can understand that they must be having questions on Coronavirus and the lockdown. Following our announcement yesterday on ‘Parenting in the times of Corona’ broadcast, we have got interesting questions from the parents and children,” said Kejriwal.

Quoting a question from a parent on the COVID-19, he said, “A 5-year-old girl has asked her mother, if we were all are going to die. Children are innocent, and it is natural for them to have all these questions. We will try to address these questions that children have and those that parents have as well. We will also extend this program further and conduct this session on a regular basis with various experts. Our motive is to change this time of crisis into an opportunity. Everyone is so busy in their lives that we do not get time to sit and have a conversation with our children, even in summer vacations during school when parents are usually working all the time. This is the time when everybody is at home, and parents and children can spend quality time with each other. I hope that by the end of this program parents will be able to know how to constructively engage their children in activities and conversations during these times of the lockdown.”

Bhushan , DoE said, “Children are asking questions on the reasons for the lockdown, and then posing questions on why they can not go out to play and meet their friends. Parents are unable to understand how to answer these questions. I would like CM Arvind Kejriwal to say something on this.”

CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Parents must be explaining to their children about Coronavirus, and how dangerous this new virus is. The parents should explain to their children that this virus is contagious and spreads through direct contact. The first way through which the virus can enter if a person coughs or sneezes on you if you are standing close to him. The second way is somebody covering their mouth and nose with their hands while coughing and sneezing and touching some surface, and then touching that surface and touching your face and mouth again.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/utilise-lockdown-time--cm--sisodia-message-to-parents--children.html

51,05-4-20,Lockdown leaves stray animals starving,"While the effect of the lockdown to contain the spread of novel Coronavirus can be felt in all quarters, among those who have been hit the hardest are the lakhs of stray animals who are left without food. And the worrying question is if these beings will survive the lockdown. Not unless people show kindness and step forward to feed the strays, it seems. For the sheer number is too big to be covered only by the government and animal welfare activists.

Speaking to The Pioneer, Animal Husbandry department director Dr KK Joshi informed that there are 2.5 lakh stray dogs and 13,000 stray cattle in Uttarakhand. “Nodal officers have been appointed in all 13 districts to supervise the task of feeding stray animals. The challenge is more serious in Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar and Dehradun. Government has partnered with NGOs in every district. All efforts are also being made for streamlined fodder supply and no black-marketing but public support is crucial. For any problem or complaint people should call us for help. The phone numbers are listed on our department website,” he said.

“Majority of these survive on leftovers from markets, restaurants, food carts, footfalls, tourist sites, temples, institutions and hotels. And if their starvation is not addressed, there might be mass deaths of animals, which will not only be tragic but also pose another public health challenge. The impact of the lockdown on stray animals can already be seen as stray dogs are beginning to show signs of aggression by chasing passersby out of extreme hunger,” said officer-in-charge of the State Animal Welfare Board, Dr Ashutosh Joshi.

The Animal Welfare Board of India, Government of India, has written to all states and UTs stating, “Feed and fodder for large animals and food for companion and stray animals is an essential service and may be kept operational during lock down. District administration, may if need be, allot specific time during the morning and evening hours for individual volunteers to provide food and water for street animals and birds. It is requested to kindly issue necessary directions to all concerned authorities to create awareness among the public to take care of stray animals during the lockdown due to COVID-19 the law-enforcement authorities be directed to see that animals and birds do not suffer due to hunger…kindly treat the matter as most urgent.”

In a community initiative in Dehradun people have formed a Facebook group ‘Save The Stray During Lockdown’. This group has got over 200 members in only three days and together these individuals are feeding around 2,500 dogs and cows in Dehradun.

While around forty are going out to feed within administrative rules and maintaining social distancing, those who cannot go out are contributing grocery items and even cooking fresh home food themselves for street animals.

Every morning at 7 AM, Niharika Kapoor steps out with bags of bread, buns, rusk and biscuits to feed strays in Kishan Nagar area of Dehradun. She then moves on to Rajendra Nagar, Ambedkar Stadium and ONGC colony giving food to around 70 hungry dogs. This feeding drive takes her around three hours. The 23 year old can again be seen on these roads from 6 PM to 8 PM daily, with packs of starving dogs following her as she serves them food.

Similar is the routine for Balwant Singh Chhettri, who is feeding around 60 stray dogs in and around Dehradun Cantonment beginning 5 AM every day.

Some restaurant owners like Sandeep Nautiyal have asked their resident staff to offer a portion to strays from their meals while the establishments remain shut.

Animal lovers are urging people to keep a bowl of water and food outside their houses for strays, and initiatives like ‘Each One Feed One’ can make a huge difference.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-leaves-stray-animals-starving.html

STAFF REPORTER n

RAIPUR

Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel in a letter to Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ramvilas Paswan, on Saturday said the state government can provide rice requirement of other states for the public distribution system (PDS).

In the letter, the CM said, 83.67 lakh metric tons of kharif crop of paddy was procured from 18.20 lakh farmers at the minimum support price in 2019-20 in Chhattisgarh.

Paddy procurement and custom milling of rice is done in the state as per a MoU signed between the state government and Union ministry of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs.

According to the MoU, there is a provision of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), procuring all the surplus rice.

A letter from the Union food and public distribution ministry in December 2019, allowed procurement of 24 lakh tons of usna rice under the central pool of the FCI.

In Chhattisgarh, out of the 56.51 lakh metric tons of paddy produced, 83.67 lakhs metric tons of kharif paddy is procured during the 2019-20 fiscal, out of which 25.40 lakh metric tons of rice was to be procured by the state for PDS requirement.

After contribution of 15.48 lakh metric tons of rice into the central pool and 9.92 lakh metric tons into state pool, 31.11 lakh metric tons of rice was surplus.

The Centre gave permission for procurement of only 24 lakh metric tons of rice by the FCI, which resulted in redressal of only 73.20 lakh metric tons of paddy out of the total paddy procured, leaving nearly 10.47 lakh metric tons of paddy (proportionate to 7.11 lakh metric tons of rice) unredressed.

The state government earlier also had requested through a letter in February 2020, for permission to procure 31 lakh tons of rice by the FCI.

At present, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chhattisgarh government is willing to contribute rice requirement of other states and is seeking permission to increase the FCI’s procurement limit from 24 lakh tons to 31.11 lakh tons of kharif rice in produced in 2019-20 fiscal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-writes-to-paswan-to-hike-rice-procurement-to-31-11-lakh-mt.html

“There were constant reports of unnecessary travel and petty excuses given by people for coming out on to the streets in the last few days. Strict instructions have been given to the police officials to implement the lockdown in the state capital,” SSP Sheikh said.

Essential services will, however, not be affected by the action, but if people are found roaming around with valid reasons, then they will have to face the action, he added.

59,05-4-20,PM’s appeal of switching off lights,"In view of the appeal made by the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi to the countrymen to switch off the lights of their homes on April 5 at 9 pm for 9 minutes the UJVNL would operate its Khodri, Chibbro and Dharasi power projects at their minimum capacity. The authorities are expecting that the power demand is expected to decrease by 200 Mega Watts (MW) for nine minutes on Sunday night. The power secretary Radhika Jha convened a meeting of officials of the all three power corporations on Saturday to discuss the implications of the appeal made by the PM. In the meeting elaborate discussions were held on the decrease in power consumption on Saturday night. In the meeting it was decided that power production from Khodri, Chibbro and Dharasu power projects would be minimized by 8.57 pm on Sunday. The output from these projects would be brought back to normal from 9.07 pm so that no pressure on grid occurs. Jha said that the government of India has made it clear that only the domestic lights would be switched off and consumers should not disconnect equipment such as TV, refrigerators and ACs. The street lights too would not be switched off. Similarly lights of hospitals, police stations, municipal services and street lights would remain illuminated like normal times. In the meeting it was decided that the officers of rank of superintending engineers (SE) and AEs would remain deployed at all power sub stations on Sunday night. During this period all capacitor banks would remain closed and all reactors would remain active. A call centre would remain active at Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) during this period and the consumers can also call at 1912 for their queries.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pm---s-appeal-of-switching-off-lights.html

61,05-4-20,U’khand allows agri activities during lockdown,"In a decision aimed at providing relief to the farmers the Uttarakhand Government has said that the all activities related to agriculture can take place during the lockdown enforced in the state. The Government has relaxed the provisions of the Uttarakhand epidemic act (COVID-19)-2020 to provide much needed succor to the farmers. The agriculture department has also set up a control room at the state level to solve the problems of the farmers. The farmers would inform the control room about their problems like availability and transportation of seed, fertilisers and farm equipment and the officials concerned would offer solution to them. The department has also decided to make special passes for its employees so that they don’t face problems in movement of fertilisers and other things needed for farmers. In an order the agriculture secretary, R Meenakshi Sundaram said that the relaxation to the farmers would be provided during the period of lockdown on the lines provided to the movement of essential services. He said that for smooth operation and coordination, a state level control room would be set up at agriculture directorate located at Nanda ki Chowki in Dehradun. The Joint director agriculture (quality control), Dinesh Kumar would be the in charge of the Control room while Joint director agriculture ( Organic farming), Anjani Kumar has been made the deputy in charge. The secretary has also made the agriculture department as nodal department for agriculture and other related departments like Horticulture, cooperative, IFFCO and KRIBHCO.

64,05-4-20,Switch off only light-emitting devices: Power Company,"Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi call for solidarity, asking Indians to switch off household lights at 9.00 pm on April 5, for nine minutes in the fight against Covid-1, power companies in the state, fearing an outage, requested people to switch off only light-emitting equipment during the 'lights off' exercise.

Chhattisgarh State Power Companies’ additional general manager and PRO Vijay Mishra in a statement said, doubts are being raised about what will happen if all the electrical equipment are shut down all at the same time.

“It might affect the power supply system across the country and result into a major power outage across the country,” Mishra said.

Mishra in the statement said, power engineers have asked people to switch off only light-emitting equipment in their houses. Other equipment like fans, ACs, refrigerators and should be kept switched on.

PM Modi, in a video-message on Friday, asked Indians to switch off their lights for nine minutes at 9pm on Sunday and hold up a light in a symbolic act to “challenge the darkness spread by the corona crisis.

The experts feel that along with household lights, all other electrical equipment is shut down across the country at the same time, then power supply load can increase or decrease and the national power grid may trip.

The best way to control such fluctuation, experts said to implement the call of the Prime Minister, is to switch off only bulbs, tube lights or other equipment that emits light.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/switch-off-only-light-emitting-devices--power-company.html
65,05-4-20,Corona-led leadership challenges for Trump,"The American leadership seems perplexed despite being on the anointed pedestal of being the most powerful nation endowed with a mammoth defense paraphernalia which the nation can wield in the international sea, land and air firmament

Elections and Presidential leadership in the United States are a spectacle par excellence. This is equally true for both the elections for the anointed Presidency and the Congressional polls locally. Awareness and deliberations about the US foreign policy across the larger international system are everyone’s pet peeve but the scenario in the domestic politics remains an domain orb, which has been investigated to a lesser extent elsewhere in the international system. Also, it is a theoretical principle in the discipline of international relations that there lies a continuum between the domesticity of a nation and its larger footprint in the global comity of nations. It’s in this partisan narrative, where-in the domestic political discourse gladly but confrontationally subsists.

In the contemporary American firmament, President Donald Trump is going through the toughest phase of his Presidency which is even more serious concern than the impeachment proceedings in the US Senate, which he had to be content with. As a related fact, it is the COVID-19 virus which poses a national security and a health challenge for a besieged American nation. As the trail of coronavirus patients mounts in the United States, the American leadership seems perplexed despite being on the anointed pedestal of being the most powerful nation endowed with a mammoth defense paraphernalia which the nation can wield in the international sea, land and air firmament. It’s the Calvinist self doubt of an incessant urge for self enhancement and continuously being on guard which should be utilised by the American establishment in this hour of crisis when the entire comity of states is seemingly strangulated by the new pandemic.

Apart from the pandemic, it is the threat of global terror and the vitriol in the aftermath of the impeachment proceedings which cause a big snarl-up and a vitiation of the political ecosystem in the United States of America. Frequent ego-trips that President Trump has had with the various Secretaries and his other top official machinery has marred the taint-free expectation of confused hoi polloi. Despite being the unstinting confidants of President Trump, several Cabinet members have been shown the door despite their scathless records of efficiency and loyalty towards the Trump’s dominion.

One stand-out aspect of the US Democratic primaries has been the fact that Bernie Sanders, the left of the centre, Democratic Presidential hopeful, has been sidelined out of the race with Joe Biden being the candidate from the Democrat side of the fence to take on the political juggernaut of President Trump. One singular perspective out of many in the context of the American public sphere concerning the leadership performance of President Trump has been the idiom of myriad flip-flops which President Trump has undertaken in the light of the various position and portfolio changes in his Cabinet. Secondly, President Trump has been changing the quintessential American point of view in the light of the climate change policies, American judiciary and the American policy perspective in the context of South Asia, where-in India’s stance has always been that of negating the hyphenation of itself (India) with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The win-win economic leadership by inking a mega trade deal with India along with the quarantining of India concerning the stipulation of GSP (Generalized System of Preferences) has been the characteristic goggles through which some sections of India perceive the American policy perspective to be. Another poser on his political leadership happens to be that of frequent changes in the visa-related work conditions vis-a-vis India, which renders New Delhi slightly doubtful, especially the old guard in New Delhi’s political and diplomatic leadership. One area where President Trump’s leadership of the new world has been proactive is that of a peacemaking role in the Afghanistan conundrum and his tie-up with the Taliban based in Doha, Qatar. Even in the context of a turmoil-ridden “Middle East”, the Washington leadership has done well with a mixed outcome in the context of the Syrian quagmire. In the context of Iran, President Trump got rid of General Suleimani but did not retaliate when the American assets in Iraq were targetted by Tehran thus casting aspersions on a cleansing and aggressive posture of the American leadership. It was this BOP run policy which took the steam out of the acolytes of the leadership in Washington.

Jeffrey A Jenkins writes in his authored book titled, Leadership in American Politics, that, “There is a leadership gap in American politics between the leadership needed to address the country’s most pressing problems and that provided by the nation’s elected and appointed leaders. If we turn to political scientists to shed light on such leadership issues, we find their work often lacking. As important as leadership is in explaining political choices and policy outcomes, studies of leadership are limited in many subfields of political science research and are missing altogether in others.” Still, despite traces of whims and flip flops, the domestic WASP fraternity and the white blue collared workers still root for President Trump despite his leadership and popularity rankings transforming in the aftermath of individual situations.

His appeal lies in the leadership gung ho, loud chaperoning and symbolically stiff upper lip political nonchalance embedded with a sense of American hyper puissance which takes wings with the presence of a cacophonous political leadership and opposition.

As an adjunct imagery, one can cite the speech of President Whitmore in the original patriotic flick, Independence Day. On the occasion of the launch of the American counter attack on the Alien Mothership, the embattled American President perches himself atop a F-16 and orates, “We the people of the free world and the American people shall not falter. We will not disappear into the night. We will not wither away into darkness and shadows. We will put up a struggle against the Alien Mothership. We shall overcome and it will be a historical moment when the world’s fighter jets gather together for the largest aerial battle of the world, since World War-II along with the brave American flyers.”

Thus, the practice of Presidential leadership is a reflection of the larger impact on the commoners which rings true in the leadership framework of President Trump, also, whenever the American homeland faces a crisis or a holocaust of impactful proportions. The venerable Pew Research Center too reported in January 2020 about the dismal support to President Trump’s foreign policy. It was argued that, “Despite negative trends in his popularity as a true blue leader, his standing has improved. The current Pew Research survey finds an uptick in some countries since 2018 in ratings for President Trump and the US, though the degree of change varies from modest to solidly positive.

At least two plausible factors may be behind these shifts. First, support for Trump has increased somewhat on the ideological right in many nations.” The 63 per cent recorded disinterest and dissatisfaction with President Trump’s policy has been generated maybe because the world is flat since a long time but the domestic panning out of his electoral prospects might be a completely different leadership ball game altogether in the context of the American homeland.

66,05-4-20,Why poor migrants need to fend for themselves,"While many view the Covid-19 lockdown as an instance of the efficacy of the administration, the moot point is why the poor people want to run out of cities. This urban middle-class India refuses to see their contradiction. If the poor work so hard in the cities, why must any emergency make them leave the city to return to the village? Isn’t the city their home too?

Published in 2002, poet and writer Dom Moraes in the co-authored book with Sarayu Srivatsa, Out of God’s Oven: Travels in A Fractured Land, wrote: “India had the most brutally stupid middle-class in the world.”

That observation comes to Moraes, a prolific and privileged man, after journeying through and writing about the world in the 1960s and 1970s. He returns in 1980 to India for good. In his remaining 25 years, he produces journalism, non-fiction, travelogues, while struggling through the desertion of his poetic muse that returns late in his life.

Moraes, like VS Naipaul, is dismayed with subcontinental poverty, violence and brutality, while awed by its cultural pasts. Owing to the stark class divide that has arisen due to India’s struggles with tackling Covid-19, his comment has resurfaced online in recent days. In one way, Moraes’ observation reeks of western condescension, but it carries insight that allies with concern: A society’s fiercest critic is often its truest lover.

A mass of the middle-class of this country views the Covid-19 driven lockdown as an instance of the efficacy of the administration. Some members have gone on to question why poor people are walking from cities to the innards of rural India. Many, mainly middle-class people, have defended police excesses like spraying disinfectant on the walkers, or worse, converted the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi, into one about Muslim bashing.

There’s proof that the Union Government didn’t take the threat seriously at the time; law enforcement both at the Centre and Delhi State was lax; major shrines of other religions were open. But, none of those seem to matter. Our “Hindu-Muslim” framing is set.

This majority middle-class India lauds the Government when it sends airplanes for countrymen abroad who need to be retrieved to escape the coronavirus. But a hodgepodge quarantine for the unwashed masses is par for the Covid-19 course. It’s easier and cheaper to send airplanes for a few Indians abroad, it’s harder to arrange for transport for thousands of daily wagers in the big cities who belong to villages.

This urban middle-class India refuses to see their contradiction here. If the poor work so hard in the cities, why must any emergency make them leave the city to return to the village? Isn’t the city their home too?

Your essayist departs from the Moraes rapier thrust into the Indian psyche. It was made long back. A part of it is true now. The India that he wrote of is removed from us. In some ways for the good, in many for the worse. A part of today’s Indian middle-class is perhaps more brutal than it’s stupid. It isn’t ready to see the mess that’s the lockdown: There have been 22 documented deaths of migrants while walking back to their villages; many have said they’d die of hunger before the coronavirus kills them. If our poor feel so, what does that mean about our boisterous nationalism?

India’s urban culture has made the poor seem sub-human. Our poor are our invisible people. Almost no big country in the world that battles Covid-19 has witnessed its urban poor walk back to its native place. Our daily-wage workers slave in the cities for decades. Many even have papers that enlist them as domiciled residents. But they are made to feel that they really don’t belong. There is middle class acceptance to their unbelonging. The collective emotion is one of wonder and disconcert: Ah, millions-are-marching to oh no, get-them-back-in-the-sty! Yes, there are middle-class exceptions. But nobody has been able to convince them to stay back, least of all the Union Government. They banged plates saluting our healthcare workers the day the Prime Minister announced the lockdown. No sooner, they set foot for home.

However, it’s essential to steer away from binaries: We may empathise with the urban poor but can’t demonise the majority of India’s urban middle-class. Many sections of today’s collective urban middle-class, wasn’t unlike the poor. Most of them have had tough lives, have seen their ancestors toil. They too came from villages some generations back. Exactly like today’s urban poor, they lived cheek by jowl and were exploited.

One assumes, one’s sufferings, makes one a better human being towards other sufferers. It’s not true. Our middle class has its origins in discord. But they will behave exactly like their class superiors who exploit and may look down on them. That’s why our poor are poor. Poet WH Auden, who encouraged Moraes as a teenaged poet, wrote in his poem “September 1, 1939”: I and the public know/What all schoolchildren learn/Those to whom evil is done/Do evil in return”. This moment sums up subcontinental middle-class mores.

67,05-4-20,Breathe@47,"Amid the COVID-19 lockdown, rising cases and deaths, one thing that the citizens can take heart is the improved air quality index which is down to less than 50 in many parts of the country, a number that had stood at 222 a couple of months back in Delhi-NCR. SHALINI SAKSENA speaks with experts to tell you more

Back in the 70s, 80s and even 90s, there was a time when azure sky was a norm. Then everything changed. Globalisation opened doors and the almost empty roads and no traffic snarls soon became a thing of the past. Soon the air quality index was touching 1,000 and beyond and many people ended up with several breathing problems.

Cut to March 25, 2020. Clear blue skies, a smattering of stars in the night sky and a clear view of the Capital for miles on end from the roof top without the usual haze is what Delhiites are waking up to since the lockdown. While the circumstances that have led to the present situation is extremely unfortunate given that the number of COVID-19 cases as of April 4, 2020 stands at 3,474 and deaths at 91, there are a few numbers that are falling and people can take heart from it and breathe easy due to improved air quality.

According to a data by SAFAR (March 30, 2020), the Capital has seen a reduction of 63 per cent in NOx and 49 per cent fall in PM2.5. Mumbai too witnessed a decrease in numbers — NOx 57 per cent down and PM2.5 down by 53 per cent, Pune: NOx stands at reduced percentage of 55 and PM2.5 at 38 per cent.

According to Anumita Roychoudhary, associate director general at the Centre for Science and Environment, the overall air pollution levels have dropped sharply after the lockdown because vehicles, factories, construction has stopped. “We don’t want to depend on this kind of emergency to bring this change. But this crisis has proved that if health risk perception can provoke emergency response it can galvanise far reaching changes. Collective community action during this pandemic has forced us to reinvent solutions to reduce our vulnerability to toxic risk. We have made massive lifestyle adjustments to practice social distancing,” Roychoudhary says.

She tells you that whether this crisis induced change can throw up long-term solutions to air pollution is a question that we need to address. This means that we have to make systemic changes to institutionalise some of the emergency responses in terms of maximising potential of digital world to alter the concept of workplace, scale up public transport options to reduce vehicle miles travelled and personal vehicle numbers, roll out electric mobility to move towards zero emissions, ensure zero tolerance for non-compliance with emissions control regulations and standards, among others, only then post pandemic period can gain from this short term breather from emergency action.

“Health risk associated with the ongoing air pollution problem also needs emergency response. There are concerns that during post pandemic period, it will be business as usual and pollution will go out of control once again. But people need to understand that air pollution kills 1.2 million people and makes many more ill annually. This requires similar emergency response and public support for strong action. This pandemic has also brought to light the evidence that air pollution increases vulnerability to pandemic because poor air pollution has already compromised lungs and overall health of people. It is important to deepen awareness and public understanding of this connection and overall health risk associated with air pollution to build the momentum for hard action. We need strong and sustained action across regions and give our national clean air programme effective teeth,” Roychoudhary says.

Environmentalist BS Vohra tells you that the reduced AQI levels has one message to give. “It was all manmade. It was our fault that we allowed polluted industries to function and we allowed vehicular pollution to reach levels that people in Delhi were choked. Nature has given us a strong message — when we try and correct the wrong — when we stop things that create pollution — things change for the better,” Vohra says.

Also, there is now no scope of ambiguity. “Today, we know the exact reason for the high AQI levels. Earlier, there were many studies that threw up different reading on what was contributing to the air pollution. Now, we know the real reason. We are being told that the mistake was ours and we need to take corrective action,” Vohra tells you.

He paints a dismal picture if we don’t learn the lesson this lockdown has taught us. “First, the lockdown was not something that human did to combat air pollution. It was forced due to COVID-19. The improved AQI doesn’t mean man has done something. If the virus has not been there, things would be as it was before. There would have been no improvement in AQI levels. Second, there is going to be no long-term impact. If today, the lockdown is opened, it would not take more than a fortnight for things to be back to what they were. The AQI is going to shoot up once again if we allow the industries to work at the same pace and just as many vehicles to ply on the roads,” Vohra says.

Dr Gufran Beig, chief project scientist, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology tells you that they have put up data of the last two years to compare the NOx levels and PM 2.5 in the four SAFAR cities – Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. “This lockdown has given us chance to validate inventory emission levels. Once we are back to normal, we will be in a position to combat pollution levels. It is unfortunate that COVID-19 has forced this situation on us but it has made it possible for us to correct the earlier findings and provided us an opportunity to set our priorities right for the future,” Beig explains.

Besides the AQI, another pressing question staring at us is whether this will have an impact on the climate. Beig tells you that when one studies climate, one looks at a long-term impact. He tells you that it is early days but some ongoing international studies suggest that there may be changes. “Some changes are taking place in the air circulation leading to faster recovery of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. But these are early days to reach any concrete conclusions for now,” Beig says.

Prarthana Borah, India director, Clean Air Asia, that propagates reduced economic activity as a strategy for reduced air pollution, tells you that what is encouraging is that sectors will now think of reorganising activities to benefit air quality and use new technology like virtual platforms to replace existing ways of work, travel and conducting business which may lead to a positive impact on air quality.

“We don’t need something as drastic as the fear of death from a pandemic caused by a virus as a solution to air pollution. We must try to understand that while air quality has improved it has improved due to the complete absence of economic activity be it traffic -- road, rail, air, stopping of construction and industry and any other polluting activity. This can never have a long-term impact as we can’t envisage a world of no economic activity. In the last week, PM2.5 was as low as 35 and PM 10 between 55 and 70. This means while it is not as good as the WHO standards, we are capable of having a baseline that meets the national ambient AQ standards. This will guide the process of targets we need to set for ourselves with increased economic activity and how much of this increase matches with achieving the 20-30 per cent decrease in air pollution levels we want to achieve,” Borah opines.

She tells you that it is easy to maintain the present AQI levels once things are back to normal. “What we need is to figure out the right way to reduce our negative impact on the environment. For this we need regulations that limit our activities. We need to set targets and then work on restricting or improving economic activity by introducing the right technologies that will continue to restrict air pollution. Once these quantitative figures are in place it will be easier to work on developmental work that prioritise clean air targets. However, there is also a danger that priorities post COVID-19 will be different and many other pressing issues like air pollution and climate change may take a back seat. We can already see this in the postponement of the 2020 COP Climate talks. The same may be with air as cities will be battling with COVID-19 recovery and it may take some time for them to start talking about air,” Borah says.

The lockdown has left its mark on wildlife as well. There are several videos on social media doing the rounds where people have filmed a civet in Kerala, deer in Haridwar, Nilgai roaming the deserted streets of Noida, leopard spotted in Chandigarh and a pod of dolphins spotted along the seashores of Mumbai. There are many who believe that since humans are now confined to their homes, this is Nature’s way of claiming what was its territory.

According to Dr Ravi Chellam, CEO, Metastring Foundation & director of Mission Secretariat, National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-being, this is one of way of viewing it.

“It does tell us about the remarkable resilience of Nature to come back if we give it the slimmest of opportunity. It is time that we humans recognise, accept and work with the fact that we are part of Nature and it is the foundation for our existence and development. There is a price to pay for destroying Nature and the cost will always be higher than any projected economic benefit. Even places like Chernobyl which was abandoned after the nuclear disaster became a thriving wildlife habitat. Nature is very resilient and when given an opportunity it would try to re-colonise and make a comeback,” Chellam says.

Pawan Sharma, founder of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare, based out of Mumbai agrees with Chellam and tells you that one can say that is partially true that Nature’s way to take back what was rightly its.

“There is need to co-exist with the animals. Till now they co-exited with us, now it is our turn to give back. What we are witnessing that had led to the lockdown is the damage human intervention can do. Nature has its way to balance itself out. We had only read it in books but today we are living it. It is time to slow down. In our quest to develop we destroying Nature but development and conservation needs to go hand-in-hand. Animals don’t understand manmade boundaries. Man has encroached on their habitat and damaged it. Since there is no disturbance now, animals are curious and are out exploring,” Sharma says.

Chellam is quick to point out that reports of wild animals roaming the streets need to be viewed in the right perspective. “Even before the lockdown it was not unusual to see lions, leopards, elephants, gaur, rhino, many species of deer and antelopes including nilgai and blackbuck, many other smaller mammals like jackals, mongoose, many reptile species including monitor lizards, different species of snakes, many species of birds including large ones like Sarus cranes, either on or by Indian roads. These sightings were when things were normal. With the lock down, human presence and disturbance has gone down drastically and hence we are getting to see these animals much more frequently and also more often during day time,” Chellam explains. There are several reasons why these animals are in the cities to begin with.

First, many of these animals live around cities and their habitat may be fragmented by the city and hence they would be using the city for passage from one part of their habitat to another which would have been difficult when there was traffic and human presence. It should not be forgotten that it is we humans who have settled in wildlife habitats and in some sense, we are the intruders and not the animals. Second, could be that the city offers resources, primarily food (mostly in the form of garbage and food plants in our gardens and parks), domestic animals including dogs and pigs and water. It is also important to understand that these animals haven't settled in the urban areas. They are only using it for some time.

Chellam sees a way forward. “It is absolutely crucial that humanity learns the right collective lessons from this pandemic. It would be a huge mistake to revert to business as usual once the worst of the pandemic is over or a vaccine is developed. If we continue to develop in ways that destroy Nature and pollute the environment and without compassion for all fellow human beings, such tragedies are only bound to be repeated. We have to recognise that we live in an inter-connected world not just with citizens of other countries but equally if not more importantly with Nature and all species that occur in the wild. We need to completely re-prioritise and invest more in restoration of Nature and functional ecosystems, basic but very essential needs of all people like health, sanitation, adequate nutrition, safe housing and education instead of grandiose infrastructure projects and the military. The re-prioritised development model will enable much greater levels of equity, much more sustainable development and build resilience,” he tells you.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/breathe-47-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/breathe-47.html
68,05-4-20,Talktime : ‘Negative roles were for brilliant actors’,"Kay Kay Menon | He is one gem of an actor and what makes him so is his down-to-earth nature and not to mention natural acting skills. He speaks with Musba Hashmi about his debut and how he is dispassionately passionate about his projects

Tell us about your character Himmat Singh in Special OPS?

He is a chief analyst with RAW. He is the brain behind all the strategies and plans. He has to deal with his personal and professional life without one affecting the other. He is an interesting character in all. He tries to be as fair as possible with his team.

What made you take up the role?

Neeraj Pandey, Sheetal Bhatia and I have known each for the longest of time. Neeraj’s writing are very exclusive and he has a skewed way of looking at a scene. Whenever he writes the screenplay, it will surprise you everytime. At the same time he has got great sense of humour even at the darkest of situations. He has a special flair for writing and that makes it all the more interesting. Another reason was when I read the script for the first time, I was about to just read the first episode but I read the complete series in one go, The story was that interesting and gripping. The man behind the machine and the machine itself were extremely good and was the reason for me to say yes.

How did Naseem happen?

It was my debut. I used to do theatres a lot those days. The film happened with me because Mak (Makrand Deshpande) thought that I was the best actor back then. We used to do our rehearsals together. One fine day he told me ‘come lets meet Saeed Akhtar Mirza (writer-director of the film)’. He saw me and suddenly the role of that religious fundamentalist came about and I was casted for that.

How easy or tough was the way ahead?

It is like any other profession. Ups and downs do happen, but that’s not a matter to worry about. I also did TV when it was not like what it’s today. We used to do small films and one hour episodes. The journey was good. It was a time when people believed if you are a brilliant actor then you can only do negative roles. We started from there. One thing that we maintained was persistence and every thing went well.

What are the things that you look out for before taking up a project?

I don’t compartmentalise it. It is just like an attraction to the project. The moment I feel like I have to do this, I go for it. At the same time, I am at a stage when I have a lot of substantial stuff to do and not something which I am over-qualified for. So this is one thing that I look for rest everything falls in place.

A role that came close to you or the ones that was most challenging?

I find these questions very difficult to answer, I am not that narrow minded as an actor. Everything that I have done is equally close to my heart. As for challeging, there is nothing as such. Challenging is a word used by those who don’t have the capability or capacity of doing it. I see things as interesting or uninteresting. And I have done a lot of interesting stuff along with uninteresting ones too. It’s been a journey and journey can’t be unidirectional. There are always twists and turns, the same has been for me. I too have seen ups and downs, but at the end of it I can sum it up by saying ‘no complaints’.

A project that you were apprehensive about but it came out well.

Nothing as such. I don’t usually jump into something without knowing what it is. There are many projects otherwise where I thought this particular script has good potential to make it big and I got involved with it but it didn’t turn out well. You can’t do much about these things. You can just only with go with good intention about it as an actor and how will it turn out depends on the destiny of the product.

Is it hard to cope with such disappointments?

Initially, I used to feel flustered when a project didn’t do well or like I expected. But then I realised the best way to live an artist’s life is to dispassionately passsionate about things. By this I mean, I am extremely passionate when I am working but the moment the last day is over I become dispassionate about it. I don’t hold on to the longing of it because that is beyond my control. After I have completed shooting, I would look at it like any other and not like the one who have been a part of it.

It makes life easier, if I would continue hanging upon it then I would have been landed in a mental asylum by now. (laughs)

How do you define acting? What is your approach towards it?

I am a simulator. I simulate things and make it as believable as possible, that’s my intent when I am acting. I try and make things so believable that I can even work if sci-fi movie. Many people indulge in realism talks but realism is a myth. The moment you have editing process, realism can’t exist because you are jumping in time. Realism happens in real time. If you will look for it, you can’t make sci-fi movie. Take for example Avatar, it is a sci-fi movie but it is extremely believable. It should be ina way where one can feel, touch and smell the characters. That has been my motto.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------negative-roles-were-for-brilliant-actors----2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------negative-roles-were-for-brilliant-actors---.html
69,05-4-20,New wave of tattoos,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with tattoo artist LOKESH VERMA about the audible body art that is trending and how the idea hit him

While tattoos have been here for a while but what is taking the industry by storm today are the sound wave or audio tattoos. Yes, you read that right. Tattoos that have a voice and can be heard. Hard to believe? Meet Lokesh Verma, founder of Devilz Tattoos who is making it come true.

“This is a new technology in India. The tattoo industry was static for so many years with no inventions but now with these dynamic sound wave tattoos we are taking the industry a step further. What we mean by this, is you can hear a sound from your tattoo, it’s not the simple static tattoo any more,” he says. Verma may be the first and the only one in India to have adapted this technology but it is originally an American idea.

“This was in trend in the US two years back. However, it has only been a year since I brought the concept here. Intially, there were not many takers. But slowly it caught the attention of the people. And in the last few months this technology was acknowledged by people and more and more people are getting it done. Till now, we have inked around 80 people with sound wave tattoos,” Verma tells you who a few minutes back was busy inking another customer but comes out to tell you more about this new trend.

As complicated it may sound, the process is quite easy. The client is asked to record a five to 30 second sound clip of anything that they want to cherish. It may be their baby’s first cry or their dog’s voice or even a message from their loved ones who are no more. Then a sound wave is created out of it using various softwares and put out on paper.

“Once the visual of the sound wave has been created, we take a print out of it and then ink it on our client’s body line by line. Once it is inked, we upload the picture of the sound wave on our website. People can scan it using the sound wave app on their mobiles and hear the audio message in it as many times as they want. It is just like the way QR codes work, you scan something and it redirects you to another site,” he tells you.

A year, when Verma came to kow about this technology, it attracted him and he made his mind to know more about the art.

“I am always looking to bring something new in the field. When I got to know about this, I knew that this is something that I have to bring to my country. I started doing my research and read a lot about it. I knew that such a technology would require a lot of specialisation. Before executing the idea, I did many trials to see how it would work. I used skin pads to test it and only when we were successful I decided to do it on people,” Verma says who inks these tattoos with his team of experts. It didn’t take too long for Verma or for that matter his team to excel in the skill, all thanks to his 17 years of experience in the industry.

Like any other person who is stepping into unchartered waters, Verma too was apprehensive about the idea.

“Intially, I was a bit apprehensive about introducing the concept because the lines of the sound wave are intricate. There is no room for even the slightest of error in such tattoos. If a single line is not correctly made because the artist is inexperienced, the sound wave will become crooked and the tattoo will not work. This needs specialisation in line work and the artist should have super steady hands to draw the lines. It is not like the usual tattoos where if something goes wrong, you can just shade and fix it. Each and every line of the sound wave has to be precise,” he says. The cost of the tattoo starts at Rs 15,000 for a clip of five seconds.

There is a reason why people are opting for these tattoos. “One is able to keep the loved ones near you and heard their voice even if they are hundreds of miles away. My wife got our baby’s voice inked when he was two years old. She was never interested in tattoos but this was something she couldn’t resist,” he tells you.

Mostly married couples and people with young children, who are 35 to 45 years of age go for this because they can keep that commitment.

Though the tattoo industry has come a long way but the mindset of people still has to change. “There is a need for change in the mindset when it comes to getting a tattoo. Many are apprehensive before getting one and seek for help from family and friends. When someone gather enough courage to walk into the tattoo studio they are so confused that they ask their friends for help. People have to start taking their own decisions. Having said that, one change that I have seen is that earlier people used to go for random designs because tattoo was something new and they just wanted to get one. Now people have started putting thoughts behind their tattoos. They tend to express their faith or attitude towards life through them,” Verma tells you. His first tattoo was that of a devil’s face he inked on his father.

There’s a story here. “I came into this profession because I was fond of tattoos but back then there were not many studios and the ones that were there were expensive. I thought why not buy a machine myself as it will cost less and I can make as many tattoos as I want. I bought the machine but was too scared to try it on myself so I walked up to my father and asked if he would be interested in getting inked. I was surprised when he agreed. I made a random design, which he still has on his hand — a devil’s face. It went pretty well and that gave me confidence to make more designs and taking this up as a career. This is how I started Devilz Tattoo,” he tells you.

Verma, of course, is a celebrity of sorts. People seek him out for his quality work. “Back in 2008, Remo D’ Souza was the first celebrity to visit my studio. He was in Delhi-NCR for a shoot and that’s when he came to my studio to get inked,” he tells you.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-wave-of-tattoos-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/new-wave-of-tattoos.html
70,05-4-20,‘Doing SOTY 2 opened my eyes’,"Youtuber Harsh Beniwal, who has recently done Who’s Your Daddy, to be aired on ZEE5 and ALTBalaji, speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about his latest project, experience of doing a film and challenges faced

How did your journey in the entertainment industry begin?

I had not planned how to go about it but it all began back in 2015. I always wanted to entertain. When I was in school, college and with family and friends I would always crack jokes and became the centre of attention. I started making videos and make a second vine ad put it on my page which got replies from friends. But then slowly people started commenting. People shared memes on Instagram which I used to put. By 2016, I had a million followers on Insta. Then there was a boom in Internet and today I have more than eight million subscribers on my YouTube channel.

Was it tough to get noticed on YouTube?

Initially, I was under the impression that there was no point in putting video here. I had Insta fans but the people on this platform are different from YouTubers who have far more patience. But I asked my team member to start putting videos on the YouTube. A friend told me that the channel was doing well. I started putting longer videos here. I can’t say it was easy, nor can I say that it was tough. All I can say is that I had loads of fun. It was slow process to garner that kind of attention.

How was the experience of doing the movies?

Student of the Year (SOTY) 2 was amazing. I had never such a huge crew. I never knew how things worked. What different things were for? I didn’t know what assistant director did. The movie has taught me so many things that I use on my channel. Take spot dadas. I had heard of them but never realised what their work was. Tiger bhai (Shroff) was standing next me so I thought the man holding the umbrella was for him. But then he moved away but this man continued to hold the umbrella over my head. It was then I realised he was doing it for me. It felt so amazing. I got to learn so much including how to face the camera from Tiger Shroff.

Tell us about your latest project — Who’s Your Daddy?

It is a web series. It is an amazing story set in Delhi. It is about relationships. First, when I was a kid and my relationship with my father and then with my son. Second, my relationship with my grandmother. Third, my relationship with my friends. Then there is a love angle and my relationship with her. When I read the script, I loved it and laughed a lot. It has been written so well.

What made you say yes to it?

I am very particular when it comes to content. Even when I create content I don’t go ahead unless I am convinced with it. When I was offered the role, I took it up on just listening to the narration. It was much later that I read the screenplay. People know I do comedy, here I have gone a step ahead. People will see me romancing, crying and even getting angry. I wanted to show my fans different facets of myself.

You have around 8 million subscribers. What makes your fans come to your channel?

I do my best to try and give as much time to them as possible. I reply to their comments. But I rarely have time for my family so it is not always possible to be constantly in touch with them. However, I try to do as much as I can and meet them in person and talk to them.

What are the challenges to ensure you stay where you are?

It was not as if I have had to face many. I just love doing what I am doing. When I was doing the web series I have had to shoot round the clock and loved every moment of it. I never feel that my professional life has put up any roadblocks till now and hopefully it will be so in the future as well. Yes, schooling was a challenge.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---doing-soty-2-opened-my-eyes----2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---doing-soty-2-opened-my-eyes---.html
71,05-4-20,Pets are man’s best friend,"COVID-19 have had us confined to our homes leading to lockdown blues. During this time, your pet can be a source of much needed joy and strength

Could you have imagined being locked-down in your home because of a global epidemic? Bizarre as it sounds, this block-buster movie scenario has come to pass, and we all find ourselves trapped in our homes, unable to move out or even interact with anyone from the outside world.

This situation has caused a surprising amount of frustration to humans across the world, with many plummeting into depression and states of despondency. And, as we all know, since there is a mind-body connect, staying mentally strong goes a long way in keeping your immunity up, and your defences strong against the disease. So, if you are caring for a cat, dog or any other animals, here’s how they’re helping you stay on top of things.

Mental strength means physical strength: It is a proven fact that families, or individuals, with pets are emotionally and mentally healthier than people who don’t have pets. This means you are less likely to suffer from depression, or other kinds of mental and emotional problems that could bring your immunity down. Having a pet has therefore made you physically more resilient to any kind of disease, including viral infections.

A reason to go on: For people who do fall sick with the virus, or any other disease, resilience has a lot to do with wanting to get better and get back to life. Those of us who have had pets will vouch that better emotional ties with those around us puts us in the correct frame of mind for recovery. Since our relationship with our cats and dogs is more unconditional, and uncomplicated than how we relate to most humans, having a pet means we're more inclined to recover faster and return to caring for them.

Good company: The long-term benefits of having a pet aside are that those of us with pets to care for are not likely to succumb to boredom, depression and unhealthy habits like binge-eating, not exercising, or binging on our gadgets. Not only do our pets keep us on our toes, because we build healthier mental neurons while interacting with our pets, our general disposition is more productive and proactive while being home-bound, thanks for the fur balls in our lives.

Myths busted

Myth 1: Dogs can spread the Covid-19 virus

Fact: According to the WHO, there is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 in the form that it appears in humans can spread onto companion animals or, for that matter, can an animals spread the virus to humans.

Myth 2: So pets can skip the hygiene protocols

Fact: A senior vet at the American vet charity PSDA says the hygiene protocols even for pets is still important. For instance, if your pet in taken out, it could bring back the virus through its paws, which can contaminate your home for humans. So don’t skip sanitising them.

Myth 3: Since dogs or cats can’t spread the virus, they can be around patients with COVID-19

Fact: It is not recommended. Not so much for the sake of the pets as much for the patient who may be recovering from the virus. Their immunity would be low at such a point, so it’s actually a good idea to keep both animals and humans away from them since animals may carry bacteria or germs from being taken outdoors.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pets-are-man---s-best-friend-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/pets-are-man---s-best-friend.html

75,05-4-20,Sleep in the times Of Corona,"Children react in different ways due to lack of ample sleep or even excess of sleep impacting their health, writes Kerry Bajaj, as she shares tips on how to ensure that your baby or child is able to sleep peacefully during a time when anxiety is running high in the family due to Coronavirus lockdown

Before the coronavirus lockdown, did you ever think your house could be capable of so much multi-tasking? My house is now a one-room schoolhouse, an office, a gym, a restaurant that’s turning out three meals a day, a messy art studio, a global pandemic monitoring station, and the place where our family relaxes and sleeps.

Speaking of sleep, I’ve never been so grateful that my kids have an early bedtime — 7 pm and 8 pm for the 4 and 5-year-old — and happily sleep through the night. As a sleep consultant, I’ve been speaking to many parents about how to navigate this challenging time. I’ve always preached that ensuring a good night’s sleep is a precious gift for our children, and I believe it now more than ever. Here’s why:

Sleep is a powerful immune-booster. Both adults and children that are sleep-deprived are more susceptible to illness. Without sufficient sleep, your body produces fewer cytokines, which is a protein that targets infection.

Sleep supports our emotional health. Sleep is a mood-booster, and acts as a soothing balm for our emotional balance. Much-needed at the moment.

Sleep is crucial for all aspects of our physical health, from cardiovascular to metabolic to respiratory to immune system.

As Matthew Walker says in Why We Sleep, “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.”

Here’s my guidance on how to ensure your baby or child is able to sleep peacefully during a time when anxiety is surely running high in the family.

The Daytime Schedule

The hundreds of parenting decisions we make during the day will impact our children’s night sleep.

Anchors. As I say in Sleep, Baby, Sleep, routine is like a magic wand for parents to keep their babies happy, healthy and secure. But let’s face it — our young children have nowhere to go and no pressing deadlines. Yet we can still create a predictable routine, which provides a sense of normalcy and safety. For my two daughters, I’ve put a focus on creating “anchors” in our day, points of stability in the ocean of free play. After breakfast, we do our math lesson. While eating lunch, we listen to a storytelling podcast (Listen & Play by the BBC). In the afternoon, we work on phonics. In the late afternoon, we call the grandparents. Before dinner, my husband does physical exercise with the girls. These are the predictable touchpoints that they can count on every single day. There’s no need to be rigid, but having a daily rhythm with anchors gives children a sense of security.

Exercise. Our stir-crazy little kiddos need physical activity — and lots of it! Movement is great for releasing endorphins and will help our children to sleep well at night. Even when stuck inside, we have options — you can have a dance party, water play in a small kiddie pool or bathtub, Cosmic Kids Yoga, or hopscotch, relay race or frog jumps in the hallway. I’ve even seen videos of kids biking, roller skating and skateboarding inside the house. Be creative! Get the kids up and moving at least 3 times a day — and join them, because it’s a good stress-buster for you, too!

Screentime. As soon as the WHO declared a global pandemic, I decided that my strict stance on screentime could be relaxed during these weeks at home. My kids don’t nap anymore, and we all need downtime. Every day after lunch, we pull the curtains, turn off the lights, snuggle up under blankets and “go to the zoo.” Meaning we visit the Cincinnati Zoo Home Safari via their Facebook page. Hanging out with the hippos and porcupines is soothing, sweet and educational. If you’re juggling cooking, cleaning, laundry, work, and homeschooling — choose a nice programme

(I love Daniel Tiger for toddlers) and give some guilt-free screentime. Since we have a set time for screens, the kids aren’t bugging me to watch videos the rest of the day, which is an added bonus.

Note: please don’t use screentime for the 2 hours before bedtime, because it may be too stimulating and interfere with a good night’s sleep.

The Bedtime Schedule

Many families that I consult with have trouble setting a bedtime routine because they have family functions, weddings, and travel. Since all of that is off the table, it’s a perfect time to establish an age-appropriate bedtime for your little one.

Early to Bed. Babies and young children need 11 to 12 hours of continuous night sleep. This means that if your baby wakes up at 7 am, bedtime should be between 7 and 8 pm. Sleep is essential for your child’s mood, growth, development and immunity. To shift your child’s bedtime earlier, I recommend pulling the curtains and turning off the bright overhead lights after sunset. Create a bedtime routine. It can be simple — dinner, bath, books, bed. Write it down on a piece of paper, let your child decorate the bedtime chart, and hang it on the wall in their bedroom.

Comfy, Cozy Bedtime. I always encourage clients to think of bedtime as the best part of the day, rather than a power struggle. Cuddle up with your child, read books, sing a lullaby or say a prayer. In order for your child to relax enough to “let go” of the day and fall asleep, they should feel secure and connected. Every night I ask my daughters what they want to dream about (it’s often cake and unicorns) and then I spritz them with imaginary “dream spray.” This puts happy thoughts into their minds about sleep.

White Noise. I recommend white noise to every parent that wants their baby or child to sleep better. White noise provides a soothing rumbly backdrop for sleep and helps drown out the household noises. Especially these days when you may be taking late-night conference calls from the living room, play some white noise for your child. The easiest way to try it is by downloading a free app (such as Sleep Pillow) on your phone or tablet.

Will your child get “addicted” to white noise? This is a common question and the answer is no! If you want to wean off of white noise in the future, you can simply reduce the volume for a few days.

Sleep Training. I spoke with a mom of twins who has let go of her domestic helpers during quarantine, has a job in banking that has converted to work-from-home because of coronavirus, and is exhausted from the night wakings that used to be handled by a nanny. Her elderly mother is attending to one twin, and she is attending to another and they are both up twice at night, for as long as an hour each time. For babies over 6 months, you can do sleep training and proactively shape the sleep patterns so you don’t have so many night wakings. In my book Sleep, Baby, Sleep, you will get the complete guidance to help your baby sleep through the night. In the book, I also cover newborn sleep, baby sleep, toddler sleep and nap schedules for age 0 to 4 years.

Soothing Their Worries

It’s mission critical to be mindful of what we’re saying in front of the kids. Our children will surely struggle with sleeping peacefully if we are exposing them to too much talk and worry about coronavirus.

Turn Off the TV. Put the TV news on a 21-day lockdown. There is absolutely no reason to expose your child to sensational and scary news reporting. If it’s terrifying for you as an adult, then please protect your child. Also, don’t talk on the phone about the gory details of coronavirus in front of your kids. They are always listening and absorbing what you say on the phone. Remember, the beauty of having an early bedtime is that you can watch the news and make your phone calls at night.

Invite Questions. I’ve given simple and honest explanations about coronavirus and the lockdown to my kids. Since their world has drastically changed from school, playdates and sports to 24/7 at home, I do check in with them once a day. I simply ask “do you have any questions for me?” Most of the time they don’t, but they know that the lines of communication are open. They know it’s safe to have questions. If we can help our children process their concerns in the day, they will better be able to relax and surrender to sleep at night.

Manage Your Own Triggers. To help your child’s anxiety, you have to manage your own. For me, that means having an extra loaf of bread and the freezer and an ample supply of chocolate. It means not looking at Whatsapp while I’m playing with the kids because the news is too triggering. It means talking to a friend when I’m feeling scared or anxious so I can work through it, but not in front of the kids. It means focusing on what I can control — staying home, washing my hands. And letting go of what I can’t control — the actions of others, how long this will last.

Empowering Messages. Since the kids understood from their school friends that coronavirus is a big, scary thing, I have focused on what our family is doing to stay healthy. They know that children are mostly not getting sick from coronavirus, but I’m sure they’re scared about their parents getting sick. I tell the kids — I eat healthy food, I exercise, I take vitamin C and I sleep well. I’m strong and healthy. I’ve assured them that if I do get sick for a few days, my body will fight the virus and bounce back.

Honour Ambiguity. We are on a 21-day lockdown, but there is no guarantee that it will end there. This is an ambiguous situation. Please don’t get your heart set on having freedom on April 15 and then feel crushed if it doesn’t happen. When my 5-year-old asks how long we’ll be at home, I tell her the truth — I don’t know. It may be 21 days, or it may be 100 days. You may also want to consider the possibility that this could be a long road ahead, so that you’ll also be able to emotionally support your children in the weeks ahead.

Love Them Up. I tell the kids every single day that I love being at home with them. That this is such a special time for our family to be together. That there is no one I’d rather be stuck home with. You may be spread thin and stressed out of your mind, but don’t underestimate what a gift it is for your children to have bonus time with their parents.

So there you have it — create a flow for your daytime routine, enjoy cozy bedtime snuggles, and protect your children from nonstop coronavirus conversation. In doing so, we can create a virtuous cycle where our kids feel good during the day and sleep peacefully at night, thus boosting their physical and emotional resilience. For all the essential workers on the front lines of this crisis, endless thanks for your service. For all the rest, please stay home, stay safe, take care of each other and wash those hands!

76,05-4-20,Article 370: A fresh perspective,"Kashmir: Beyond Article 370

Author : Bashir Assad

Publisher : Pentagon Press, Rs 595

Bashir Assad’s new book provides a refreshing narrative of the actual situation obtaining in Kashmir, not touched upon otherwise by the so-called Kashmir experts, writes Prof K WARIKOO

Bashir Assad, the Kashmiri writer has come out with yet another interesting and insightful study of Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370. To quote Bashir, he has brought out the “bitter truth following his inner voice” underscoring the Islamisation and Pakistanisation of narratives in Kashmir. And he blames the political leadership in Kashmir which remains “mired in conservatism and short-sightedness around Muslimness” for the troubled situation. Competing schools of Islamist extremism have sway in Kashmir with the local political leaders, intellectuals, media, social and cultural activists, lawyers, businessmen, employees etc. spearheading the Islamist extremist movement. Being witness to the steep decline of the unique Kashmiri culture, Assad calls upon the silent majority of Kashmiri Muslims “not to be carried away by the frenzies of the extremists who thrive on violence”.

As regards the decision of the Indian parliament to revoke Article 370 and reorganise the J&K State into two UTs of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, the international community has by and large viewed this decision as India’s internal affair, with the exception of Pakistan and its ardent supporters-China, Turkey and Malaysia. However, there has been concern over the restrictions imposed in the State following this decision. So far as the local response to this historic decision is concerned, Assad is right in his analysis that in north Kashmir (excepting Sopore and Rafiabad belt in Baramulla district which is dominated by Jamaat-e-Islami), the local people have remained peaceful. And the new narrative of the Indian Government revolving around empowerment, investment and development (EID) has found resonance among the people in rural Kashmir, Gujjars and Bakarwals, Paharis, Kupwara, Handwara, Gurez and most of the Jammu region.

In case of south Kashmir, Jamaat-e-Islami has been influential in Kulgam, Tral, Pulwama, Bijbehara, Anantnag, Kokernag, Doru and Pahalgam and that gets reflected in the different political response and incidents of violence there. In central Kashmir, Srinagar city remains the hotbed of separatism nerve centre of Pakistani narrative being parroted by the political elite, intelligentsia, academia, journalists and civil society.

Coming back to Article 370 , Assad believes that the idea behind this Article was to allow the unique Kashmiri identity based on composite culture, social harmony and brotherhood to flourish. This very foundation of Kashmiriyat collapsed with the ethnic cleansing and forced exodus of the entire indigenous minority community of Kashmiri Pandits in January 1990 and thereafter. The Pandits continue to live in forced exile for the past 30 years now. And there is no prospect of their return to their homes, as all their landed properties, houses, business and educational establishments and even the temples have been occupied in an organized manner. And with the digitisation of land revenue records going on in full swing in Kashmir, all these properties are being conveniently transferred in the names of their illegal occupiers. Here it would be pertinent to mention that all through the past 75 years, the successive State governments have legalised the settlement of non-Kashmiri Muslims in the State. Over 26,000 Afghan Pashtuns were provided land and State citizenship in 1950s at Gutli Bagh, Ganderbal. Similarly over 650 Tibetan Muslim families were provided land and State citizenship in Hari Parbat area in Srinagar around 1959-60. And after 1970s, one has been noticing the ingress and silent settlement of radical Muslims belonging to Allah Wale group from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar etc., who set up their shops and captured the local mosques. So much so, over 800 local Kashmiri Muslim Imams were silently replaced by these radical fire-brand non-local Muslims who contributed a lot in radicalising the Kashmiri Muslim society by weaning them away from the local Sufi-Rishi tradition of Islam. Assad has been honest in pointing out that most of the Kashmiri Muslim employees who would shift to Jammu during the annual Durbar move, have purchased land or houses in Jammu particularly during the past decade or so. This is in quite contrast to the fact that none of the Hindu employees shifting from Jammu to Srinagar during the Durbar move, have ever purchased in any land or house in Kashmir. One may add that thousands of acres of forest and nazool land has been occupied by influential Kashmiri Muslims and Gujjars/Bakarwals, which was subsequently regularised by Farrooq Abdullah and GN Azad governments under the Roshni Act. All this has been done to change the demographic character of Jammu region into a Muslim majority one, so that the narrative of Muslim and separatist politics is extended to Jammu region as well.

Assad makes yet another valid point stating that the NC government under Chief Ministership of Farooq Abdullah (1996-2002) rebuilt the “completely collapsed infrastructure including hundreds of bridges, schools, hospitals, shrines and government buildings.” Yet the NC and its leadership never highlighted these achievements in their 2002 election campaign. Instead their election plank was the restoration of autonomy. Here one would recall how the NC stalwart Mirza Afzal Beg would during his election campaign in 1977 flaunt a piece of rock salt (of Pak origin),and a green handkerchief (rumal) in order to emotionally blackmail the local Muslim population. Assad is emphatic in saying that both the “NC and PDP used Article 370 for winning elections. They only complained about the erosion of authority when out of power. For them, Article 370 was laying golden eggs”. The abrogation of Article 370 once again brought the think tanks, NGOs, human rights groups, media etc. to the fore, with the local political class propagating “soft separatism”. The problem is compounded because the “political family fiefdom has taken deep roots in Kashmir. And this political kinship survives in the conflict, with both the separatist and mainstream political elites being the conflict profiteers”. So the challenge for the Government of India is to make peace more profitable for these political elites than the conflict.

Assad argues that the increasing Pakistanisation and Islamisation of the Kashmiri narrative, actually prompted the Modi government to abrogate Article 370. He blames the separatists and the NC and PDP leaders by holding the threats of secession, for the dilution of Article 370. As regards the impact of the abrogation of Article 370, Assad is right in saying that “the majority of Kashmiris are happy that the political class, which exploited them emotionally, economically and politically for decades, is finally made to pay the price for it. The common people want these corrupt leaders to be arrested on charges of corruption, misappropriation, embezzlement, nepotism and favouritism”.

Now that Article 370 is history, new tasks for the government are to restore the confidence of the people through EID, de-radicalisation, rational delimitation to give due representation to deprived sections both in Jammu and Kashmiri regions, and to undo the artificial merger of areas in a particular constituency initiated by Mirza Afzal Beg in post-1975 period to prevent the Shias, Kashmiri Pandits, Gujjars and other communities from getting elected from their territorial strongholds. To conclude, the book provides a refreshing narrative of the actual situation obtaining in Kashmir, not touched upon otherwise by the so called Kashmir experts. As such it is a must for all those interested in understanding the social and political dynamics in Jammu and Kashmir.

77,05-4-20,Stories that inspire action and change,"The Museum of Broken Tea Cups: Postcards from India’s Margins

Author : Gunjan Veda

Publisher : Yoda SAGE Select, Rs 525

Gunjan Veda’s book seeks to celebrate the everyday heroes, who have, despite all odds, managed to change not just their own lives, but the lives of those around them. An excerpt:

Ten kilometres from the Pratap Singh High School, on the road to the famous Kaas Plateau, Maharashtra’s very own Valley of Flowers, is the picturesque campus of the Bhartiya Bhatke Vimukta Vikas Va Sanshodhan Sanstha (Indian Institute of Research and Development of Nomadic and De-notified Tribes). Inside, there is a School of Social Work, a junior college, hostels and an Ashram school with 250 students from classes 1 to 10.

At 2 pm on a weekday, the place is abuzz with activity. Students and teachers have just returned from an invigorating lunch break, ready to resume their quest for knowledge. I head to the first floor of the double-storeyed institute building that embraces a circular courtyard. Here in a small corner room, a group of 50 students await me-the youngest is 12 years old, the oldest 16. Some play the tabla, the dholki and the Congo drums. Others create music on the synthesizer and the harmonium. Together they form the school’s orchestra-one that has won name and fame in the district.

They are often invited to sing for the All India Radio and at local programmes. As the strong voices of the girls and the boys in the group decry casteism and call for equality through their songs, a new energy pervades the room, and with it, a new hope.

It is these students whose stories I wish to tell…

Aishwarya

Aishwarya Umesh Dharase is 13 years old. Slim, with a deep sepia skin tone, she wears a bright, sleeveless red and gold salwar suit. Her jet black hair is oiled and tightly pulled back into a pony. ‘I want to become a lawyer and fight for the truth,’ this Class 7 student tells me. She also wants to learn to play the harmonium and the tabla. After all, she spent the first few years of her life around these musical instruments. Aishwarya’s parents lived in the Bijapur district of Karnataka. Her father played the dholki, tabla and pakhawaj in an orchestra, while her mother was a singer. She also sewed garments to feed her family. Then one day, when she was barely six years old, Aishwarya’s mother died in an accident. Shortly after, her father abandoned her. ‘I was very small then. I didn’t understand what was happening. Suddenly I had no family, no one to call my own,’ she tells me matter-of-factly. Life as Aishwarya knew it was over. Initially her paternal grandparents looked after her. Soon however, her mausi (maternal aunt) took over.

Aishwarya does not know if she is related to her mausi by blood. She doesn’t know her maternal grandparents either. ‘Mausi says my mother was her sister and she treats me like her own daughter. That’s all that matters. I have seen her work in the fields to raise me. It is her name-Bharti-that I write when I am asked for my mother’s name.’ Bharti first got Aishwarya admitted into a Kannada-medium school but she wasn’t happy with the quality of education. She decided to send her to the Ashram school where her own daughter Vaishnavi was studying. It was in Class 6 that Aishwarya came to Satara. ‘I have been here for a little over a year now. Each day I learn new things. When I feel low, I think of my mausi. She is my inspiration. One day I will make her proud,’ she tells me, the quiver in her voice only emphasizing the determined look on her face.

Pragati

Next to her sits a slim bespectacled girl in a white, printed salwar suit. 13-year-old Pragati Ranjeet More is a student of Class 8. Eyes brimming with tears, she narrates her story.

‘When I was born, my mother abandoned me in the hospital and went to live with her parents. She didn’t take me home. Didn’t hold or hug me.’ Pragati’s father collected her from the hospital and took her to Pune. There he left the tiny infant with his sister. ‘My bua raised me. She put me in a school in the city. Then one day my dadi turned up. She said that I shouldn’t stay in Pune. She fought with my bua and brought me to Phaltan in Satara district. Since that day my bua stopped talking to us.’

Young Pragati was once again uprooted. She lost the only life and family she had known. But she was a survivor. She began to adjust to her new life. Just as she was learning to cope, another tragedy befell the family. Their house in Phaltan collapsed.

They had to move to Satara. Pragati’s father used to be a construction worker. But he drank heavily and gradually stopped working. In fact, it was his drinking that had driven Pragati’s mother away. In Satara, her grandfather took up work in a hotel to feed the family. Pragati enrolled in a nearby school.

One day, when she was in Class 3, her grandmother and father fought bitterly. ‘My dadi burnt herself. She died,’ Pragati recounts in a stony voice. Her mother used this opportunity to divorce her father.

That was when she discovered that she had a younger brother. ‘My mother never came to see me. I didn’t know that my father used to visit her. After they divorced, I found out that I had a younger brother, Omkar. He is now in Class 4.’

Despite all the tragedies that life had heaped on her, Pragati did not give up. She had learnt how to cook when she was barely five years old. While her grandfather helped her with the housework, he also had to go out and earn. So young Pragati went to school, did housework, cooked and looked after her brother. One day, in the newspapers, she read about the Ashram school in Satara. She quietly went to her father and said she wanted to join the school.

He agreed. Thus began a new journey.

78,05-4-20,Astroturf : Be ready to combat evil forces,"The first calling of the present pandemic is not to panic. Should you panic, you may lose your sense of reasons and alert, which may not let you carry on your fight prudently in all strength. Let us brave the situation by exercising all the care and caution as suggested by the experts. We have braved many such pandemic in the past. Even this one will pass. Rest assured, the situation may begin to ease out soon.

In the cosmic game plan, global health situation is figured out through a look at progressive movement of the Sun. That is about to reach its zenith on April 14th. Till then, watch your health carefully and remain live to our collective obligations as well. Situation may begin to gradually ease out thereafter. Once the Sun moves considerably beyond the Rahu-Ketu axis by June end, the situation may expectedly be in control.

Even otherwise, if we ever lose our alertness and become complacent, we could be taken for a ride. Only a few days back, Chaitra navaratra got over, when the devout would have offered prayers to Mother Goddess Durga, believed to be repository of Shakti. Mind it, it is a period of major weather change in India when one needs to rejuvenate oneself and be well geared up to face the challenges during the emerging season. We maintain austerity and regulate our food regime to tone up our digestive system, vital to our overall health condition. Regular prayers help clear off the clutters of mind, regain confidence, and strengthen vital forces playing within.

It may be pertinent to note here that all ancient puranic stories necessarily discuss terror — fight between devtas (high born) and rakshas (demon), in which, the latter always have the first laugh. Why? Perhaps, the devtas would have been complacent, not been alert against impending danger from unseemly forces, and forgotten their sense of collective obligations. Hence their fall. But when all devtas gather, invoke the divine — the all-powerful and all-knowing eternal element of consciousness, which drives all our dynamic functionalities including power of knowing — they outsmart the demonic forces and regain their lost ground. Import of the above simile does not need any further elaboration.

Mother Goddess, in the form we perceive, is shown with 10 hands — carrying weapons in eight, a conch shell (blowing instrument) in one, and lotus flower in the other — having two imports. First, the ten directions. Second, the 10 sensory organs — five each of perception and action. She combats negative energies flowing through eight directions with her armouries, with the rest two marked with productivity.

The conch-shell when blown excites a sound note comparable to ‘O?’ — the primal-sound that supposedly got excited when the first motion happened at the primordial source, which, in turn, excited the creation chain. The conch-shell thus naturally symbolises the source energy, up above in the cosmos. The majestic lotus flower in all colours made of numerous petals signifies enormity and diversity of creation. Mind it, lotus flower grows in the mud underneath water body. But not even a trace of mud or water droplet can stay on flower leaves, which implies that though being all-powerful, yet, she does not carry any sense of ego, or attachment to the primal elements making it.

The evil forces are in evidence all across, making us vulnerable to their onslaught. Their killing potential would be felt much faster and relatively cover a fairly wider range than our productive initiatives, which could take us for a ride if ever we become complacent. We, therefore, need to be fully on guard in a combative mode against the evil forces to make optimum use of our productive potential, vital to our existence.

Now, why weird form assigned to the demons? It is said that demons are conjurors, capable of hoodwinking us by making varied illusionary presences and take us for a ride. Remember, no such form-existence is in evidence anywhere in the world. It is so characterised just to exemplify in clear terms the danger inherent in the evil forces playing from within or beyond. Coronavirus could be taken as one form of unseen demonic force available in our surrounding carrying killing potential. Negative memory implants in our minds are another form of negative forces playing within, which often make us lose our sense of reasons and order that may cost us heavily. Let us be always war-ready to combat such demonic forces for a smooth sail of life.

All the 200 such personnel, including top officials, have been advised self/home quarantine and are accordingly observing the protocols as a precautionary measure.

The list of the contact tracing including CRPF DG AP Maheshwari and Senior Security Advisor of MHA K Vijay Kumar have been advised home quarantine or quarantine at CRPF facilities till the test reports are out. However, these top officials have not exhibited any symptoms of the novel coronavirus, top CRPF officials said.

At least three Inspectors General, whose wards returned from foreign countries, have also been quarantined as a precautionary measure. Former CRPF DG Vikram Srivastava has also been self-quarantined as a preventive measure.

The CRPF chief, who has himself subjected to home quarantine, is supervising the work of the Force from home. While Maheshwari is currently free from any Covid-19 symptoms, he is undergoing the quarantine drill as a precautionary measure, officials said.

A CRPF spokesperson said, “A CRPF officer has tested positive for COVID-19. All personnel in contact with the officer have been quarantined. The DG CRPF had an indirect contact with the officer. As per protocol, DG is observing quarantine.”

“We will win together. The only Mantra is social distancing. To all of us let this be the religion as well as spirituality of the day. Save oneself to save others. Save humanity,” Maheshwari has tweeted tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMO, HMOIndia and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Liaison Officer and Assistant Commandant of CRPF P Raja, who had been quarantined after Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak was tested Covid-19 positive, is being tested for novel coronavirus.

Meanwhile, around 2,500 CRPF men posted at Force's headquarters and other attached offices (CoBRA, RAF, Northern Sector) here have been barred from leaving the station without due permission from superiors but the same is being flouted by some men who are visiting their home towns in adjoining States of Delhi on weekends posing threat to those posted at the CRPF directorate here. The top brass of the CRPF is seized of the issue and is likely to initiate sharing of live locations of those posted at the headquarters here so that the personnel do not resort to unauthorised movement and virtually become coronavirus carriers, sources said.

The CRPF has already issued directives that those on leave should continue to be on leave till April 15 and those reporting back should first contact the Chief Medical Officer of the CRPF at RK Puram here before joining duty.

84,05-4-20,Govt OK’s five-phased corona containment plan,"With coronavirus cases rising by hundreds and deaths multiplying with each passing day, the Government on Saturday came out with a five-phased ‘containment plan for larger outbreaks’ on the perception that current Covid-19 spread mimics the H1N1 pandemic of 2009.

“This suggests that while the spread of COVID-19 in our population could be high, it’s unlikely that it will be uniformly affecting all parts of the country. This calls for differential approach to different regions of the country, while mounting a strong containment effort in hot spots,” said the document that visualises five different step-wise scenarios in case of any such outbreaks in the country.

It begins with travel-related cases reported in India followed by local transmission of COVID-19, large outbreaks amenable to containment, wide-spread community transmission of COVID-19 disease and finally to the point, if or when India becomes endemic for the deadly disease. The Government current strategy is focussed on these five points aiming to combat the deadly disease.

So far, the virus has killed over 80 people and infected over 3000 in the country. Large number of cases has been reported from Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.

“Large scale measures to contain COVID-19 over large territories have been tried in China,” notes the document prepared by the Union Health Ministry.

In India also, clusters have appeared in multiple States, particularly Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and UT of Ladakh while 211 districts are now reporting COVID-19 cases and the risk of further spread remains very high, as per the document.

Current estimates of the incubation period of COVID range from 2-14 days, and these estimates will be refined as more data become available.

Strategic approach for scenario include travel related cases reported from India which focuses on early detection through universal screening of all International passengers at Points of Entries (PoEs) and tracking travellers in the community who have travelled from affected countries.

Talking about the possibility of local transmission of COVID-2019 disease, which so far the Government has denied, the document said that local transmission will lead to clustering of cases in time and space, epidemiologically linked to a travel related case or a positive case that has links to a travel related case. The cluster containment strategy will be extensive contact tracing and active search for cases in containment zone, testing all suspect cases and high risk contacts, as per the document.

“Geographic quarantine and containment strategy proposes defining the area of operation, active surveillance for cases and contacts in the identified geographic zone and expanding laboratory capacity for testing all suspect cases, high risk contacts and SARI cases. Implementation of social distancing measures with strict perimeter control and providing chemoprophylaxis with Hydroxychloroquine to all asymptomatic healthcare workers and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases has been further course of action.”

However, if the containment plan is not able to contain the outbreak and large numbers of cases start appearing, then a decision will need to be taken by State administration to abandon the containment plan and start on mitigation activities, it stated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-ok---s-five-phased-corona-containment-plan.html

The MHA said that social distancing and proper hygiene practices must be ensured in each of these activities.

The decision seems to have been taken in view of the urgent need for trucks to ply normally, given they carry most of the essentials including vegetables and grains. India is amid a nationwide shutdown for 21 days where all services are suspended save few essentials.

""Several Tablighi Jamaat members who attended a congregation at the Nizamuddin Markhaz in Delhi in March fled to other parts of the country, carrying and spreading coronavirus. Many have tested positive,"" Karandlaje said at Chikkamagaluru, about 250 km from here.

Of the hundreds of Tablighis who attended the 3-day event on March 13-15, as many as 600, including around 250 from Karnataka, have tested positive and been quarantined.

Terming the Tablighis as ""corona jehadis"" for staying put at their centre and not reporting to authorities for testing, the BJP lawmaker said one community was not cooperating with the government in fighting the pandemic.

""Some of the community members attacked women health workers in Bengaluru's northern suburb on April 2 when they went to check if Tablighi returnees had taken the test,"" she said.

88,05-4-20,Tamil Nadu positive cases jumps to 485,"With the number of patients testing positive for coronavirus reaching 485 by Saturday evening in Tamil Nadu, the State Government has asked the Chennai office of the National Institute of Epidemiology to undertake a study on why the returnees from the congregation at Nizamuddin were afflicted with this pandemic.

This was stated by Beela Rajesh, secretary to the department of health and family welfare while addressing the daily media briefing on Saturday. She said 74 persons tested positive on Saturday alone. “Out of the 485 persons tested positive for coronavirus in the State, 422 are either Nizamuddin returnees or people with whom they had interacted. There are only 63 persons who tested positive for corona virus who do not have anything to do with the religious congregation,” said the health secretary.

Despite the sudden spurt in the number of corona positive cases in the State, Tamil Nadu is still in Stage -2 of the disease and the administration has launched all-out containment activities to control and check the situation from vitiating further, she said.

“By Sunday, all medical colleges in the State would have set up the testing facilities which is expected to bring down the time taken for testing the corona virus attack. More than 29 lakh people in the State had been screened since the outbreak of the disease,” said Rajesh. She said the State was on the alert from January 18 onwards and all passengers reaching the airports in Tamil Nadu had been screened and tested. This is one of the reasons for Tamil Nadu effectively controlling the corona virus spread. But the Tablighi Jamaat conference and subsequent developments had contributed in upsetting our work. Now we are in a State of medical emergency,” said Rajesh.

She asked the people not no panic and to observe strictly the social distance rules. “All senior citizens with history of blood pressure and sugar are asked to undergo tests for the same in the changed situation,” said the health secretary.

In Chennai, the civic administration along with the department of health officials have identified ‘eight hotspot clusters’ in the city where multiple corona virus cases have been identified. The civic officials along with police sealed the entry and exit points to all these clusters to prevent the movement of vehicles as well as unauthorised persons.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy, who is the overall commander of the fight against the pandemic asked the people to strictly adhere to the social distance and not to come out of the houses unless it is an emergency. “We have given full authority to the police to take legal action against those who wander around the metro,” he said in a video message. The Chief Minister also disclosed that cash assistance of Rs 1,000 would be provided to each of the rice ration card holders in the State and this amount would be delivered at the doorsteps itself by Government staff so that people need not come out of the houses and stand in queues.

91,05-4-20,"Jamaat attendee falls for free, tasty food!","The season of coronavirus or COVID 19 is not about fear, anxiety and tension alone. The pandemic has a lighter side too. An interaction with Government staff working round-the-clock for corona virus detection and to trace the persons suspected of carrying the virus brought out some interesting facts. It has the potential to send one in splits notwithstanding the tiresome work being put up by the team of officials.

It all began with the Markaz Nizamuddin congregation and in the backdrop of reports that 1500 delegates from Tamil Nadu attended the international conclave held to re-energise the Tablighi Jamaat operations in India.

The Chennai Corporation officials and the Domestic Breeding Checkers zeroed in on a returnee from the Nizamuddin meet and went to examine the person on March 23. He is a resident of Korukkupet, an area dominated by the community to which the man belongs.

The members of his house and some of the neighbours told the officials that the suspect was not there and he has gone to a relation’s house outside the city. The officials believed what they told and went back.

But when they were told again by the family members on March 28 and 31 that the man has not returned, the officials smelled a rat and sought the help of local police. The local police in Chennai has their own “intelligence agents” who informed them that the person whom they are looking for was present in his house and was in hiding. The corporation officials with the assistance of the local police barged into the residence in the wee hours of Friday only to be welcomed by the man they were searching for!

“Though he was reluctant to agree that he was the same person whom we were looking for, the man finally came round and accompanied us to the Stalnely Medical College for tests. He was tested positive and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. He had reservations in getting admitted to the hospital but the menu of the delicacies served free of cost for the patients did him in. Till he is found negative, the man would be provided with Idli, Pongal, chutney and sambar for breakfast, egg biriyani for lunch and dinner , tea/coffee and snacks in the evening,” said one of the officials.

Once they admitted the man in the isolation ward, the officials rushed to Korukkupet to quarantine the entire street and are in the process of examining all the people in the neighbourhood. “Though he gave us enough headache, our modus operandi to make him fall in line and his passion for food made up for all our efforts,” said the health official.

City of Chennai and the Old Mahabalipuram Highway (also known as IT highway because of the number of IT majors in this stretch) wore a deserted look on Saturday as vehicles and persons stayed off the roads. Sriperumbudur , the hub of automobile giants and engineering companies resembled a ghost city with no vehicles or persons coming out in the open. Trade bodies said that the industrial hub is losing Rs 2,500 crore per day because of the lock down. Liquor is the most sought after commodity in Tamil Nadu as in neighbouring Kerala. The entire liquor stock in Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) retail counters are being shifted to secured marriage halls in the State to save the ‘stuff” from the preying eyes of spirit bandits.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/jamaat-attendee-falls-for-free--tasty-food-.html
92,05-4-20,Cong slams Kerala Govt for goof-up on Centre's coronavirus guidelines,"As the total number of persons testing positive for coronavirus crossed the 255 mark in Kerala by Saturday evening, a widely respected Congress leader, PT Thomas, who is also a member of the State’s Legislative Assembly, has accused the LDF Government of goofing up the directive issued by the Centre on February 26 to check the spread of the pandemic.

“The Kerala Government’s callous attitude towards the guidelines resulted in some of the travelers from Britain, Italy and West Asian countries who reached the Cochin International Airport hoodwinking the health officials and succeeded in coming out of the airport. These passengers were all carriers of Corona virus and many persons who interacted with them ended up as corona patients” Thomas told The Pioneer on Saturday. The law maker said that this happened after the March 16 press briefing by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who had claimed that Kerala was well fortified against corona virus.

Thomas’ statement comes at a time when Kerala has 295 confirmed corona virus cases and 251 were undergoing treatment for the same in various hospitals as on Friday evening. He said the health system in Kerala which was once the envy of other States is in total disarray now because of the callousness of the powers that be (read Pinarayi Vijayan-led CPI(M) Government). “Though I had pointed out that the State flouted the guidelines issued by the Centre on February 26, I was shouted down by the hangers-on around the Chief Minister. They pose as the supporters of the Chief Minister but they are spoiling his name and reputation through their deeds,” said Thomas.

The Congress leader pointed out to Television images of Pinarayi Vijayan being placed along with Chinese President and South Korean Prime Minister with claims that he is the one and only leader from this part of the world who leads the war against Corona effectively.

He also disclosed that there were many instances of violation of the medical protocol issued by the World Health Organization and the Centre. “A public servant in Idukki who tested positive was admitted to hospital. But he was not discharged despite him testing negative for corona virus in two successive tests.

Though the district medical board had agreed to discharge him, authorities in the State capital ordered against it. He was discharged from the hospital only on Friday evening following a public uproar. It is with pain I point out that in Kerala all decisions are being taken by political authorities and not based on guidelines formulated by WHO or the health experts,” said Thomas who also sent a letter to the chief minister.

In yet another shocking incident, the Government issued the order to quarantine health department officials who were on duty at Cochin airport during March 19 to 24 only on March 29 and that too after it found that two officials tested positive. “Certain passengers who reached Cochin from abroad were allowed to go scot-free without any tests and this is the main reason for the sudden spurt in the number of corona virus patients in Kerala,” said Thomas.

He also said that the local media was working as Public Relations consultants for the chief minister . “There is a limit for sycophancy. But in the case of Vijayan, I do have doubts about the intentions of those who make these social media posts,” said Thomas, who himself is a journalist-turned-politician.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-slams-kerala-govt-for-goof-up-on-centre-s-coronavirus-guidelines.html

99,05-4-20,"‘Economic recovery to be smoother, faster in India’","Once the Covid-19 pandemic ebbs, the course of economic recovery in India will be smoother and faster than that of many advanced countries, according to KPMG.

UNCTAD in its latest report on Covid-19 impact on developing countries has predicted that the major economies to be least exposed to recession would be China and India.

KPMG has said that steps taken to prevent the spread of the virus, such as the lockdown, have brought the economic activity to a standstill and could impact both consumption and investment.

The abrupt halt in urban activity could lead to a steep fall in consumption of non-essential goods. In addition, around 37 per cent of salaried employees in urban India are informal workers who will face uncertain income following the stall of urban activity.

KPMG has prepared three scenarios that can play out for the Indian economy. If there is quick retraction across the world, including India, by end April to mid May, India’s GDP growth for 2020-21 may be in the range of 5.3 per cent to 5.7 per cent.

The second scenario assumes that while India is able to control Covid-19 spread, there is a significant global recession. In this scenario, India’s growth will fall to 4-4.5 per cent.

In the third scenario, if there is proliferation within India and lockdowns get extended coupled with a global recession, it will be a double whammy for the Indian economy. India’s growth will fall under 3 per cent in this scenario as a prolonged slowdown would exacerbate economic troubles.

However, experts also pointed out that to show higher GDP growth in revised numbers recently, the government has reduced the base in the previous year.

In that case, the government should have revised and lowered GDP growth for previous year. So, projections are taking place as per official numbers. It is now not the question whether government numbers are right. The historical government numbers are incorrect now, experts said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---economic-recovery-to-be-smoother--faster-in-india---.html

These two steps will ensure sizeable household demand continues irrespective of lights-out. Power System Operation Corp Ltd — the agency responsible for managing the grid - has mapped all India lighting load and estimated such demand at 12-13 gigawatts (out of a total consumption of 125-126 GW).

Unlike normal operation, this reduction in load of 12-13 GW would happen in 2-4 minutes and recover nine minutes later — within 2-4 minutes. This sharp reduction in load and recovery, which is unprecedented, will need to be handled through hydro and gas resources. The drop in load and subsequent rise will be managed by using hydro and gas generators that require the least amount of time for ramp up.

All regional entities have been advised to maintain their interchange with the grid as per schedule. Distribution companies have been advised to avoid any feeder switching operation from 20:00 to 22:00 hrs.

Also, control room staff at national and all regional/ state load centres will be strengthened and grids will be closely monitored to tackle any contingency. State load distribution centres have asked distribution companies to ensure that substations and housing society/ residential apartments’ main supply is not be switched off at feeder / mains level.

A 9-minute lights-out by most of households on Sunday evening can potentially collapse the grid due to sudden drop and then a quick surge after the event. But to manage the dramatic changes in electricity and its impact on the grid, the government has drawn an elaborate plan to manage it. Following are the broad plan of action.

102,05-4-20,PM to videoconference with floor leaders of various political parties,"As the three-week lockdown continues and may not be eased at one go, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with floor leaders of various political parties via a video link on April 8.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the Prime Minister will interact with floor leaders of all those parties which have more than five MPs in both houses of Parliament on April 8 at 11 am.

Covid-19 and countrywide lockdown are likely to be discussed during the meeting.

This will be the prime minister's first interaction with opposition leaders after the lockdown amid criticism that the former has not taken the latter in confidence and not informed about the state of medical and other contingencies.

Keeping in mind the norms for social distancing and travel restrictions, the much-coveted meeting will be conducted through a video conference.

Many opposition leaders have been asking for an all-party meeting with the Prime Minister on the pandemic wanting to have the first-hand information on the steps to cope with the crisis which may not end too soon in time.

In the meeting, Government officials said that the Prime Minister will seek suggestions from different parties on the future road map to contain the deadly virus. The meeting will start at 11am with Modi’s opening remarks in which he will appraise the party leaders of the steps his government has taken so far.

The meeting will also be an opportunity to build a broad political consensus on India’s fight against Covid-19, according to officials.

Besides Modi, union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, parliamentary affairs minister and Leader of the Rajya Sabha, Thawar Chand Gehlot are also expected to be present.

Meanwhile, BJP’s vice-president Jay Panda has dismissed Congress charges of government not being ready to deal with the crisis which has claimed 75 lives and the numbers of those positive reaching 3,000 in the country as of today. Panda said all the suggestion made by the state governments have been implemented by the Prime Minister and that “ Prime Minister is coordinating with the states run by the opposition parties”.

Pointing to a survey, the BJP leader said “ 83 per cent of people have expressed confidence with PM’s leadership during the ongoing crisis”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-to-videoconference-with-floor-leaders-of-various-political-parties.html
103,05-4-20,DRDO designs full-body disinfection chamber to fight virus,"Focusing on in-house solutions to fight coronavirus pandemic, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has designed a full-body disinfection chamber called Personnel Sanitisation Enclosure. This walk-through enclosure is designed for personnel decontamination, one person at a time. The DRDO is already manufacturing and supplying sanitisers and masks to the Delhi Police while the Navy has manufactured handheld temperature gun at a cost of Rs 1,000 which is much less than the ones available in the market. The DRDO has also developed portable sanitisation spray which can be used to spraying disinfectant.

Giving details about the latest endeavour, defence ministry officials said here on Saturday the portable system is equipped with sanitiser and soap dispenser. The decontamination is started using a foot pedal at the entry. On entering the chamber, electrically operated pump creates a disinfectant mist of hyposodium chloride for disinfecting. The mist spray is calibrated for an operation of 25 seconds and stops automatically indicating completion of operation. As per procedure, personnel undergoing disinfection will need to keep their eyes closed while inside the chamber.

Moreover, the system consists of roof mounted and bottom tanks with a total of 700 litres’ capacity.

Approximately 650 personnel can pass through the chamber for disinfection until the refill is required. The system has see-through glass panels on side walls for monitoring purpose and is fitted with lights for illumination during night time operations. A separate operator cabin is provided to monitor overall operations.

The system has been manufactured with the help of M/s Dass Hitachi Ltd, Ghaziabad, within a time span of four days. This system can be used for disinfection of personnel at the areas of controlled ingress and egress such as entry and exit to hospitals, malls, office buildings and critical installations.

Earlier, the DRDO also developed face protection mask for health care professionals handling COVID-19 patients. Its light weight construction makes it convenient for comfortable wear for long duration.

This design uses commonly available A4 size Over-Head Projection (OHP) film for face protection. The holding frame is manufactured using Fused Deposition Modeling (3D printing). Polylactic Acid filament is used for 3D printing of the frame. This thermoplastic is derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane and is biodegradable.

The face mask will be mass produced using injection moulding technique for volume production. Nearly 100 face shields are being produced daily and provided to PGIMER, Chandigarh. Similarly, 100 are produced and handed over to ESIC, Hyderabad.

A demand of 10,000 masks been received from PGIMER and ESIC Hospitals, they said.

In the continuing quest for developing indigenous solutions to combat the pandemic, the DRDO is ready with technologies for sanitising areas of different sizes. The Centre for Fire Explosive & Environment Safety (CFEES), Delhi has developed two configurations of sanitising equipment. These are spinoffs from technologies developed for fire suppression applications.

The CFEES, Delhi with the help of its industry partner has developed portable sanitisation equipment for spraying decontamination solution consisting of one per cent Hypochlorite (HYPO) solution for sanitisation of suspected area.

The portable system can be mounted as a backpack and can be carried by the operations personnel.

This system incorporates low pressure twin fluid (air & disinfectant liquid) technology to generate very fine mist. The system is capable of disinfecting upto 300 square metre area.

The application areas can include hospital reception, doctor chambers, office spaces dealing with general public, corridors, pathways, metro and railway stations, bus stations, etc.

The Centre with the help of its industry partner has also developed a higher capacity which is carried on a trolley. The system incorporates low pressure single fluid (disinfectant liquid) technology generating very fine mist. It is capable of disinfecting upto 3,000 square metre area. It has a tank capacity of 50 litres and has a lancing (throw) distance of 12-15 metres.

This is useful for disinfecting hospitals, malls, airports, metro stations, isolation areas, quarantine centres and high risk residential areas.

Two of these systems are being provided to Delhi Police for immediate use. These can be made available to other agencies with the help of industry partners.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/drdo-designs-full-body-disinfection-chamber-to-fight-virus.html

105,05-4-20,India’s S Asian offer hits China’s Covid narrative,"India’s offer of a regional South Asian response to tackle the coronavirus pandemic has been an effective counter to China’s attempts to change the narrative on the deadly disease, according to an American think-tank expert.

Aparna Pande, Director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute, made the remarks on Friday during an online discussion on China’s attempts to change the narrative on COVID-19 and how countries in the world are responding to the major health crisis.

“China has pushed a charm offensive in South Asia both through offering medical teams, sending test kits and protective equipment and offering to build hospitals. However, the results have been a mixed bag,” Pande said.

India’s offer of a regional South Asian response has been an effective counter to Beijing’s attempts to change the narrative, she said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 13 proposed formulation of a joint strategy by the SAARC nations to fight the coronavirus, a suggestion promptly backed by all member states, barring Pakistan.

Calling on the SAARC members to set an example for the world, Modi reached out to the eight-member regional grouping and hosted a video conference among the leaders to chalk out a strong strategy to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Pande, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are heavily dependent on Chinese largesse, especially under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and have been the most open to and reciprocated Beijing’s charms.

For Pakistan, strategic relations with China take priority over everything else, including the health of its own people, she said.

Pakistan refused to evacuate its citizens, especially students from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus infection, when the pandemic broke out and, like Iran, did not suspend flights to and from China, she noted.

Further, Pakistani officials including a former ambassador to the UN and the Prime Minister’s Scientific Advisor are “peddling conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus, blaming the US and the UK and absolving China of any responsibility,” Pande said.

Sri Lanka, she noted, “has gone ahead and signed a 10-year loan of USD 500 million with China Development Bank to help the country mitigate the financial impact of the crisis.”

India “while avoiding open criticism of China, has sought to counter any Chinese charm offensive by seeking a coordinated regional response through building quarantine shelters in Maldives and Nepal and the SAARC COVID fund to which India has contributed USD 10 million and other countries offered money and aid as well.

“India also has 2 naval ships ready to be deployed to any country that needs assistance in the region,” she noted.

There is a vast difference between India and China’s responses as would be between a democracy and an autocratic country, the Hudson scholar said. Lack of proper and detailed planning before imposing a nation-wide lockdown in India have created problems, she added.

“However, it can be blamed on lack of planning, not malevolent intent. The state did not anticipate the migrant crisis and so struggled for a few days to deal with it. However, it is not just India, many countries are facing challenges keeping people under lockdown,” Pande said.

“So, it should be easier to understand the problems facing the world’s largest democracy, a country of 1.3 billion people, as it seeks to keep people indoors, curtail the spread and avoid burdening its weak healthcare infrastructure,” she said.

“For countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan — that were deep in China’s grasp — Beijing’s grip will be strengthened. For those like Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh this will actually strengthen ties with India and wariness of close ties with China or aid from China and I think here India’s offer of a South Asian response, aid and technical assistance has helped strengthen those bonds,” Pande added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india---s-s-asian-offer-hits-china---s-covid-narrative.html
106,05-4-20,ICMR issues advisory for rapid antibody-based blood tests for virus,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday issued an advisory to start rapid antibody based blood tests for COVID-19 in areas reporting clusters and in large migration gatherings or evacuee centres.

The decision for recommending these tests was taken at an emergency meeting of the National Task Force held recently.

The move comes in the wake of the country reporting 3072 COVID-19 cases including 75 deaths so far.

The results of antibody tests similar to blood tests are available in 15-30 minutes.

“Cases of influenza-like illness to be monitored in health facilities. Any surge in cases to be monitored and brought to the notice of surveillance officer/CMO for additional investigation,” the advisory said.

As a matter of abundant precautions, all symptomatic persons with influenza-like illness should be advised home quarantine for 14 days. At facility level, symptomatic individuals with influenza-like illness to be tested using rapid antibody tests, the apex health research body said in its advisory.

If antibody test comes out negative, then if warranted, it can be confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using throat/nasal swab.

At present, the government uses the RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests to detect the coronavirus from samples of throat or nasal swab of people with symptoms or high-risk individuals who might have come in contact with a positive patient.

RT-PCR negative indicates the likelihood of a non-COVID-19 influenza-like illness while RT-PCR positive means it is a confirmed case and action as per protocol should be initiated for isolation, treatment and contact tracing, the advisory stated.

If the antibody test comes out to be positive, there has to be a clinical assessment and treatment in hospital or isolation as per protocol.

Action as per protocol should be initiated for contact tracing.

“If symptoms worsen, refer to designated COVID-19 hospitals. When home quarantine is not feasible, consider facility-based quarantine,” the advisory stated.

It also listed some general guidelines according to which healthcare workers doing the rapid antibody test should use gloves, mask, and head covers.

Healthcare workers collecting throat/nasal swab should follow standard national infection control guidelines, it said.

The rapid antibody tests approved by US-FDA/CE-IVD or non-CE-IVD validated by ICMR-NIV with marketing approval by DCGI should be used.

In order to ensure that all such cases are monitored and necessary action is initiated with respect to infectious disease management, details of all test results shall be uploaded in ICMR portal.

“All such organisations are duty bound to register themselves to ICMR portal and upload the data in real-time. Failure to do so, they will be held liable to action under Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the advisory stated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icmr-issues-advisory-for-rapid-antibody-based-blood-tests-for-virus.html

UK Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove revealed the latest death toll during the daily Downing Street briefing, during which he reiterated the government’s plea for the public to continue to strictly observe social distancing over what is set to be a pleasant weekend.

“If we weigh up an hour or two outside and weigh it against the lives of those we love and the lives of those on the NHS (National Health Service) frontline, then it should be clear, I hope to all that we should follow the advice,” said Gove.

“The sun might be out, but that doesn’t mean you should be out,” Stephen Powis, NHS England’s National Medical Director said.

A statement from the NHS on the latest deaths in England said that patients were aged between five years and 104 years old.

The latest figures emerged as police forces across the UK put on extra patrols in parks and outdoor areas, amid fears that large numbers of people will be tempted to go outside and break social distancing rules in the warmer weather.

During the daily briefing, Gove also announced that hundreds of ventilators were being manufactured in the UK every day and more had been sourced from abroad, including Germany and Switzerland and a batch of 300 invasive ventilators from China arrived on Saturday.

“I’d like to thank the Chinese government for their support in securing that capacity,” he said.

120,05-4-20,"7L jobs gone in 14 days, worst yet to come in US","The worst stage of coronavirus pandemic became visible in the US when the Donald Trump Government reported that employers cut over 7 lakh jobs in the first two weeks of March — close to the May 2009 financial crisis peak of 8,00,000 job losses.

Most of the job losses were reported from restaurants and bars, followed by retailers. It was the first decline in payrolls since September 2010, CNBC reported. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 per cent — from 3.5 per cent — the first job decline in a decade, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

The Labor report, however, doesn’t capture “the nearly 10 million laid-off and furloughed Americans who filed initial jobless claims in the past two weeks as much of the nation’s economy was shut down to contain the spread of the virus”. According to a USA Today report, that’s because Labor’s survey was conducted the week ending March 14, before most states ordered residents to stay at home and nonessential businesses — such as restaurants, movie theaters and most stores — to close.

It means the job loss numbers for March will actually be way high. The US Labor Department on Thursday revealed that another 6.6 million workers filed jobless claims last week.

“The report does capture the first stumble in the economy’s historic free fall. The number of workers filing initial jobless claims rose by 70,000 — the most since 2013 — to 282,000 in the week of Labor’s survey”. The April jobs report, which won’t be released until May 8, could include the nearly 10 million Americans who filed for first-time unemployment benefits as the pandemic forced businesses to close and people to stay at home, CNN reported.

Job losses over the next few weeks will come from a wider range of sectors, according to Daniel Zhao, senior economist at careers website Glassdoor.

“White collar jobs are not safe from this,” Zhao was quoted as saying.

“If this is an indication of what was happening before the full force of the crisis hit, then it will be hard to come up with the words to describe the numbers in future months,” added Nick Bunker, economic research director at job search site Indeed.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/7l-jobs-gone-in-14-days--worst-yet-to-come-in-us.html
121,05-4-20,Trump recommends Americans wear face masks in public,"All Americans should cover their faces with scarves or homemade cloth masks when they leave their homes as part of the desperate efforts to curb the massive spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, President Donald Trump has suggested.

Citing the latest recommendations from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Trump, who has decided not to wear a mask, urged people to wear face coverings like scarves or homemade cloth masks, and to keep medical-grade masks available for the health workers who are struggling to contain the growing number of COVID-19 cases.

The guidelines issued by the CDC, the Government’s public health advisory agency, came as the US reported more than 1,100 deaths in a single day — the highest total for a 24-hour period anywhere in the world.

Senior officials at the CDC told the White House this week that stronger guidelines were necessary to prevent the virus from spreading between asymptomatic people, US media reported.

The US has so far confirmed 278,458 cases of Covid-19 and more than 7,100 deaths. New York state remains the worst hit area, with nearly 3,000 deaths.

The deadly coronavirus has so far infected over 1,131,000 people and claimed the lives of over 59,800 people across the world, according to latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University.

Until now, health authorities here said that only the sick, or those caring for patients of coronavirus, should wear masks, but newer studies suggest that covering up one’s face is important to prevent inadvertent transmission.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-recommends-americans-wear-face-masks-in-public.html
122,05-4-20,Gabon bans eating of pangolin and bats amid pandemic,"Gabon on Friday banned the sale and eating of bats and pangolins, which are suspected of sparking the novel coronavirus in China where they are highly prized in traditional medicine.

President Ali Bongo Ondimba also announced the government was planning to lock down the capital Libreville and unveiled an emergency package for those hard hit by the pandemic.

The novel coronavirus is believed to have come from bats, but researchers think it might have spread to humans via another mammal.

Pangolins are critically endangered and have long been protected, but they are sold in the markets of the capital Libreville, as are bats, and their meat is popular.

The central African nation is 88 per cent covered in forest and hunting and bush meat have long been a way of life.

The water and forest ministry said the novel coronavirus was a “combination of two different viruses, one close to bats and the other closer to pangolins”, and claimed to be quoting a scientific study published in Nature.

Gabon has declared 21 COVID-19 infections, but none from animals, the ministry said. “A similar decision was taken by the authorities when our country was affected by the Ebola virus — a ban on eating primates,” Forestry Minister Lee White said.

The national parks agency ANPN announced in mid-March that tourists would no longer be allowed to interact with great apes to avoid any risk of contamination by the coronavirus.

The pangolin, the world’s most heavily trafficked mammal, also called the scaly anteater, is believed to have possibly been a vector in the leap of the novel coronavirus from animal to human at a market in China’s Wuhan city last year.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/gabon-bans-eating-of-pangolin-and-bats-amid-pandemic.html
123,05-4-20,"OPEC, allies to seek response to coronavirus pandemic","OPEC and its allies are due to discuss oil production cuts next week following US President Donald Trump’s claim that leading producers Russia and Saudi Arabia will slash output to boost tumbling prices.

The meeting was originally expected to be held via video conference on Monday, but now looks likely to be pushed back to “take place later in the week,” said a source close to OPEC, who asked not to be named.

On Thursday, kingpin exporter Saudi Arabia called for an urgent meeting of OPEC and other countries to “stabilise the oil market” following a phone call between Trump and Saudi Crown Prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman.

Oil prices have tumbled since the beginning of the year due the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic — which has weighed heavily on economies and demand — and a price war between OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia, the key player in OPEC+.

The two countries failed to agree further output cuts at a meeting at the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last month, leading Riyadh to open the oil taps to flood the market.

OPEC+ member Azerbaijan’s Energy Ministry said in a press release that next week’s meeting would aim to discuss the adoption of a “new declaration of cooperation”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow was prepared to discuss “a reduction in the volume of about 10 million barrels a day, a little less, maybe a little more.” “I believe that it is necessary to combine efforts in order to balance the market and reduce production,” Putin said.

According to a Russian source cited by the TASS news agency Friday, US officials have been invited to take part in the meeting. Trump surprised investors on Thursday by tweeting: “I expect & hope” Riyadh and Moscow will be cutting back “approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more”.

“Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels,” he added in a subsequent post. Oil prices — which hit 18-year lows earlier this week — rallied sharply following Trump’s statements, marking a record rise in a day’s trading on Thursday.

On Friday, Brent stood at $34.11, up 14 percent, and WTI at $28.34, up 12 percent.

However, a deal “at this stage seems more like speculation than something likely to happen quickly,” warned Carlo Alberto De Casa of ActivTrades.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/opec--allies-to-seek-response-to-coronavirus-pandemic.html

SAI plans to hold meetings with presidents, secretary generals, high performance directors, head coaches and chief executives of all National Sports Federations to reassess their long-term plans, qualification scenarios and strategies to align with the Olympics.

In that direction, SAI director general Sandip Pradhan and other officials held a meeting with Hockey India representatives, which included its chief executive officer, executive director, high performance director David John and the men’s and women’s teams’ chief coaches, Graham Reid and Sjoerd Marijne.

Various modalities pertaining to the sport, including the teams’ training, domestic competition structure and foreign exposure, were discussed.

According to a statement from the SAI, a number of viable solutions and alternatives to the earlier planned strategy were deliberated upon in view of the ongoing lockdown.

Also discussed were options such as training under quarantine (physical and psychological aspects) and possible restricted cross-border movement once the lockdown is lifted.

The men’s team chief coach Reid expressed confidence about their Olympic preparations.

“We had a very productive meeting and discussed the planning process for the next 16 months. We informed SAI that the team and staff are being well cared for, while in strict quarantine,” Reid said.

“We discussed various scenarios and await decisions as to when we can re-start full training. We also agreed to remain as flexible as possible with the aim of being ready to go as soon as international competition recommences.”

National women’s team chief coach Marijne agreed with Reid and said the meeting was a very productive one.

“We had a positive discussion about the state of affairs and we indicated our preferences once the situation improves and as soon as more is known about the possibilities in the future.

“We also mentioned about our preference about players staying in national camps during domestic tournaments in order to avoid injuries in the lead up to the Olympics next year,” the Spanish coach said.

“I particularly liked the pro-activeness of SAI and Hockey India and I am very optimistic about our preparations for the Tokyo Olympics.

127,05-4-20,Belgian federation in UEFA talks over end to its season,"The Belgian Football Association (URBSFA) announced on Saturday that it is working with UEFA toward a “constructive” solution regarding the premature end to the Belgian championship.

On Thursday, the Belgian Pro League recommended that the season be declared finished due to the coronavirus pandemic with the present table accepted as final. It became the first European league to propose such a measure, though others could follow.

On Friday, the governing body of European football (UEFA), in a joint statement with the European Club Association and the European Leagues, warned that “abandoning domestic competitions is, at this stage, premature and not justified”.

UEFA threatened to ban all teams from European competitions next season if they did not complete their league season.

The URBSFA released a statement on Saturday saying that its president, Mehdi Bayat, had spoken to the president of the governing body of European football, Aleksander Ceferin.

The statement did not specify the nature of this “jointly” negotiated solution, saying only that the Belgian association would present the UEFA executive committee with its “recommendations for stopping its championship”.

The Pro League board’s voted unanimously on Thursday to advise its general assembly not to resume the 2019-2020 first division campaign.

Club Brugge, who are 15 points clear with 11 matches to play, would become Belgian champions.

The AGM is expected to ratify this decision on 15 April but its board will present the proposal to UEFA’s executive committee.

The Belgian federation, which will also present its recommendations and aims to “preserve Belgium’s European places in the 2020-2021 season”, said the statement.

The statement also reminded UEFA that it had called for solidarity within European football during the coronavirus crisis and said Bayat had “advocated a flexible approach to this concept, which allows the specific circumstances of each league to be taken into account.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/belgian-federation-in-uefa-talks-over-end-to-its-season.html

The Premier League is currently under indefinite suspension as the United Kingdom grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. Liverpool were hurtling towards a first league title in three decades before the suspension and have a 25-point lead at the top of the table with nine games left. They hence need two more wins to confirm the title.

“People are suggesting to give the title to Liverpool, and honestly they deserve it the way they had been playing, nobody was going to catch them,” Berbatov, who scored 56 goals in four seasons at United told Betfair.

“With the way they play their games, the football they produced and how far they are in front, they fully deserve the title this season.”

The motormouth former Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, suggested that the proposed commission on COVID-19 under the UN Convention on Biological Weapons, 1975 might comprise of virologists, scientists, professors, researchers, analysts and experts in the fields of microbiology and virology, the Dawn News reported.

Making the letter public at a press conference through a video link, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Malik said the commission should present its report to the UN secretary general in three months, and give recommendations to prevent future breakouts of such viruses, and international standards for coordination in case of a breakout. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city, has so far killed 59,456 people worldwide and infected more than 1,122,320 in 190 countries. For the proposed UN commission on COVID-19, Malik has proposed seven ‘terms of references’ to the UN secretary general. These include accurate identification of the geo-location of the COVID-19’s origin, identification of areas with zero patient, discovery as to why the behaviour, intensity and fertility rate of COVID-19 varies from country to country, investigation whether it is a man-made or naturally-grown virus and examination of the allegations of transportation of the virus from one place to other destinations in the world, as a ‘biological warfare tactics’.

With the highest number of infections in Europe and their hospitals overwhelmed, Spain and Italy struggled to protect medical staff on the front lines of the outbreak, while 17 medics in Egypt’s main cancer hospital tested positive for the virus.

As the number of infections has grown to more than 1.1 million worldwide, health care systems are straining under the surge of patients and lack of medical equipment like ventilators as well as protective masks and gloves, giving rise to growing concerns about the exposure of hospital personnel.

Italy and Spain, with combined deaths of more than 25,000 and nearly a quarter-million infections, have reported a high percentage of infections among health care workers.

Carlo Palermo, head of Italy’s hospital doctors’ union, fought tears as he told reporters in Rome of the physical risks and psychological trauma the outbreak is causing, noting reports that two nurses had committed suicide.

“It’s a indescribable condition of stress. Unbearable,” he said. “I can understand those who look death in the eye every day, who are on the front lines, who work with someone who maybe is infected, then a few days later you see him in the ICU or die.” U.S. President Donald Trump announced late Friday he would prevent the export of N95 protective masks and surgical gloves to ensure they are available in the U.S. - prompting neighboring Canada’s prime minister to respond that cross-border aid goes well beyond supplies.

“I think of the thousands of nurses who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every day,” Justin Trudeau said. “These are things Americans rely on.” The number of people infected in the U.S. Has now exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000. New York state alone accounts for more than 2,900 dead, an increase of over 560 in just one day. Most of the dead are in New York City, where hospitals are swamped with patients.

World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned African leaders of an “imminent surge” in coronavirus cases on the continent, urging them to open humanitarian corridors to allow the delivery of badly needed medical supplies.

More than half of Africa’s 54 countries have closed air, land and sea borders to prevent the virus’ spread but that has delayed aid shipments. Virus cases in Africa are now over 7,700, and the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned some nations will have more than 10,000 cases by the end of April.

In the Philippines, Sen. Richard Gordon, who is also head of the local Red Cross, said lockdown measures have meant millions of poor families are unable to fulfill basic needs.

“A lot of people are hungry. They’re asking for milk, they’re asking for diapers. They say it’s not going fast enough,” Gordon said, threatening to have local officials arrested if they steal from government aid for dirt-poor families.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/front-line-medical-staff-deaths-grow--highlight-virus-risksv.html
136,05-4-20,Anti-parasitic drug kills virus in lab grown cells: Study,"Researchers have found that an anti-parasitic drug already available around the world can kill the novel coronavirus grown in cell cultures within 48 hours, an advance that may lead to the development and trial of a new clinical therapy for COVID-19.

According to the study, published in the journal Antiviral Research, the drug, Ivermectin, stopped the virus, SARS-CoV-2, from growing in cell culture within 48 hours.

“We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,” said study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia.

The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus.

However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out in people.

“Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that’s the next step,” Wagstaff said.

“In times when we’re having a global pandemic and there isn’t an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,” she said.

Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus ‘dampening down’ the host cells’ ability to clear it.

“As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,” said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/anti-parasitic-drug-kills-virus-in-lab-grown-cells--study.html
137,05-4-20,"Verma prepares to maintain form, focus till 2021 Olympics","Ace pistol shooter Abhishek Verma says maintaining focus and form till the Tokyo Olympics, postponed to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will be a huge challenge, but one that he is equipped to take on.

The ongoing nationwide lockdown has halted training schedules of all the sportspersons.

And the ensuing postponement of the quadrennial Games may threaten to disturb his focus a bit.

“Hitting the peak and then maintaining it, maintaining my concentration and focus is going to be challenging. Though it gives us more time but one year is a lot of time,” two-time World Cup Gold medallist Verma said.

The 30-year-old Verma is confined to his home in Chandigarh at the moment, but his mind is in a Gurgaon paying guesthouse, where his training tools, including SCATT, are awaiting his return from what was supposed to be a short two-three-day trip to his parents’ place.

SCATT is an advanced equipment, involving sensors, and used by top shooters to keep track of their progress while training both indoors and outdoors.

The lockdown meant compromise with his training. He is happy to be home but for a shooter who prefers to practice through the year, Verma is finding spending time without his equipment “odd”.

“I like to practice 365 days a year but right now I am able to do only dry practice. When I came home, the plan was to only stay for two-three days, but then the lockdown was announced and I got stuck here.

“But there is no other way at the moment given the situation. I can only hope that things normalise and I am able to go back and start practising again.

“Definitely, it will be different now that the Olympics have been postponed. It’s not easy to maintain the focus and form. So I will concentrate on maintaining my form and focus till the Games,” the double World Cup Gold medallist said.

In the absence of his key equipment, Verma’s training is restricted to dry practice, simulation, exercises, yoga and meditation.

Verma had secured an Olympic quota place by winning the 10m air pistol Gold medal at the Beijing World Cup in April last year, before winning another yellow metal in the same event at the Rio World Cup in August-September.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/verma-prepares-to-maintain-form--focus-till-2021-olympics.html
138,05-4-20,Rai builds muscles to retain shape for his third Oly,"Amid the nationwide lockdown, veteran Indian archer Tarundeep Rai is busy building shoulder muscles at the Army Sports Institute in Pune, which he believes will keep him in shape for Tokyo Olympics.

The postponement of the Tokyo Games was a bitter pill to swallow for the two-time World Championship Silver medallist as he will get one year older when he takes the field for his third Olympics.

“For me, the postponement of Olympics means I will get older by one year, so it will be a new challenge,” the 36-year-old said.

He has been forced to change his training due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic and his daily routine now is to search YouTube for videos on “how to build shoulder muscles” and train at the gym for long hours.

“It’s a big risk to go to the trainers, so YouTube is the constant company now. I follow some channels and pick some videos,” Rai, who competed in 2004 Athens Olympics and 2012 London Games, said.

“Now I’m not shooting that much. It’s more of dry shooting practice so that the body is tuned to bow and arrows,” the 2010 Asian Games individual Silver medallist said.

Rai, along with India number one Atanu Das and his Army colleague Pravin Jadhav, had clinched quota place for the men’s team while winning a Silver at the World Championships at Den Bosch in the Netherlands last year.

The trio was placed in the top-three in the trials to pick the Indian squad for Tokyo Games when the COVID-19 pandemic brought to a halt to all the sporting activities.

“No doubt I’ve a bit ahead in terms of experience, but the real challenge will be to stay fit and compete with the rising young talents. In this one year, many 20 to 22-year-olds will come up and compete for a place in the team. I think by building shoulder muscles, I will be able to withstand the challenges ahead,” he said.

Rai hopes the current situation will normalise in about three months and when the season resumes, he will again pick up his bow and arrows.

“I estimate an off-season of minimum six months due to the extraordinary circumstances. So, I will work hard at the gym for three months and then recovery will follow. It would help me personally. I’ve made my schedule that way.”

He said one positive aspect of the postponement of Tokyo Games is that India’s chances of winning an elusive Olympic medal in archery will improve.

“But there’s a positive side to it (postponement). There will be competition and we will make a strong team for the Olympics and hopefully the women’s team will also qualify, giving us good hope for a medal next year,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rai-builds-muscles-to-retain-shape-for-his-third-oly.html
139,05-4-20,CONCACAF Nations League finals postponed,"The CONCACAF Nations League finals scheduled to be staged in Texas in June have been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic, the region’s governing body said.

CONCACAF, the ruling body for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, said the four-team finals would take place at a date to be determined.

The finals had been scheduled for June 4 and June 7 in Houston and Dallas.

“As we continue to assess our competitions scheduled to be played in the coming months, the welfare of everyone involved in football across our region remains our first priority,” CONCACAF said in a statement.

“Given the ongoing public health situation, and following consultation with FIFA regarding the international football calendar, we have made the decision to suspend the CONCACAF Nations League Finals.”

140,05-4-20,Stay indoors and fight battle for your country: Pujara,"Batting long comes naturally to Cheteshwar Pujara and now he wants his fellow Indians to do the same by staying at home as “the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic can only be won by being indoors”.

Pujara was one of the elite Indian sportspersons who attended the video call held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to discuss ways to fight the coronavirus.

“The Prime Minister wanted us to pass on the fighting spirit of a sportsperson to the general public. Sportspersons do inspire to fight,” Pujara said.

“Every single person is a soldier at the moment. If you stay indoors, you are fighting the battle for your own country. There has to be a collective effort else we can’t win this,” said India’s Test batting mainstay.

After helping Saurashtra win their maiden Ranji Trophy title last month, little did he know that he would be spending all his time at home. Pujara is enjoying the “forced” break and most of his time goes into entertaining his two-year-old daughter.

The closest he has got to a “hit in the nets” is by playing with a plastic bat.

But a gym at home means he is not compromising on his fitness.

“I usually take everything in a positive way. Sometimes you need to take a break as a sportsperosn and there can’t be a better time. We just won the Ranji and it is the right time to take three to four weeks off.

“Luckily I have a gym at home. With gym, I can still do my strength sessions, cycling and running. I also do yoga which helps a lot,” said Pujara.

He was supposed to play county cricket in the UK but that too has been postponed at least till May 28 and faces a cancellation.

Considering the current circumstances, Pujara might have to wait till the Australia tour starting November to play his first competitive game since the Ranji Trophy final. But he is prepared for any eventuality.

“I would still have some first-class games before the Australia tour. I am prepared for anything. This is the time when we can’t just be thinking about sporting events. First, we have to win this battle against coronavirus,” he said.

“We just need to make sure the virus is contained and things get back to normal. After that we can talk about the game.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stay-indoors-and-fight-battle-for-your-country--pujara.html
141,05-4-20,"Rohit, Warner world’s best T20 openers: Moody","Former all-rounder Tom Moody on Saturday picked India’s Rohit Sharma and fellow Australian David Warner as best opening batsmen in T20 cricket.

Moody is also a well-known coach and commentator.

In a question and answer session, the 54-year-old also picked Chennai Super Kings as his favourite IPL team and M S Dhoni favourite captain.

“Tough call, but I would be more than happy with @davidwarner31 And @ImRo45 (Rohit),” Moody wrote on his Twitter page when asked about the best opening batsmen in T20s.

There is abundance of cricketing talent in India but amongst the emerging ones, Moody feels Shubman Gill “stands out”. Gill has played two ODIs for India and has also made the Test team but is yet to get a game.

Moody, who has coached multiple IPL teams, believes New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson is blessed with the best cricketing brain and Ravindra Jadeja is his favourite Indian fielder.

142,05-4-20,PCB want to host ICC event to cover losses,"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) want the International Cricket Council (ICC) to award them the hosting rights of a major event in lieu of the financial losses suffered due to India’s refusal to play a bilateral series against them.

PCB Chief Executive Wasim Khan asserted that Pakistan is prepared to host a major ICC event sometime in 2023.

“I don’t think hosting international cricket is now such a big issue for Pakistan as the security situation has improved now,” Khan said.

“The fact that we have logistically hosted the entire Pakistan Super League in Pakistan and also teams like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for Test matches besides other smaller events and series shows we are capable of hosting a big ICC event.”

Khan said that if Pakistan gets a major ICC event it would make sense as it has suffered lot of financial losses due to India’s refusal to play matches in India or Pakistan for some years now and also because there appears to be no chance of any Indo-Pakistan series taking place in the near future.

“There appears to be little chance of India and Pakistan playing and we have already suffered losses in millions of dollars.”

He said that the chief executives of cricket Boards will have a video conference with the ICC to discuss World T20 Cup, Asia Cup and World Test Championship.

“There is no doubt that because of the coronavirus pandemic every board is facing a big challenge to reduce their financial losses as much as they can. We are all in the same boat. We have similar interests. When this conference is held we will be discussing future measures.”

Khan said the aim is to prepare an alternate plan whenever cricket resumes.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pcb-want-to-host-icc-event-to-cover-losses.html

A PCB official said that while the current situation is being monitored, there will be no pay cuts in the current financial year which runs till June 30 for the Pakistan board.

“Our financial year runs from July 1 to June 30. All player contracts (central and domestic) are till 30 June. There will be no salary cuts in the 2019-20 financial year.

144,05-4-20,Dhoni leads Jaffer’s all-time ODI XI,"Former India opener Wasim Jaffer has picked M.S. Dhoni as captain of his all-time ODI XI.

Jaffer had recently revealed that all Dhoni wanted when he started off was to make Rs 30 lakh and live peacefully in Ranchi. However, the veteran wicketkeeper-batsman went on to play 90 Tests, 350 ODIs, and 98 T20Is for India captaining the team to the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 50-over World Cup and is touted to be the most successful captain to lead the Men in Blue.

In his all-time ODI team, Jaffer picked four Indian batsmen — Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Dhoni who was also chosen as wicketkeeper. However, no Indian bowler could make a cut to Jaffer’s team.

Jaffer, who recently retired from all forms of cricket, also picked West Indies legend Sir Vivian Richards, South Africa’s AB de Villiers and 2019 World Cup hero Ben stokes in the batting line-up.

Jaffer picked Wasim Akram as the all-rounder, Shane Warne or Saqlain Mushtaq as his spinner, West Indies seamer Joel Garner and Australia legend Glenn McGrath as his pacers.

145,05-4-20,FIFA postpone U-17 Women’s WC in India,"The FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup to be held in India in November was on Saturday postponed by football’s governing body due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic across the globe.

The women’s age group showpiece was to be held at five venues in the country — Kolkata, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Ahmedabad and Navi Mumbai — from November 2-21.

The tournament was to be competed among 16 teams, with hosts India being automatic qualifiers. It was to be India’s maiden appearance in the U-17 Women’s World Cup.

The decision was taken by the FIFA-Confederations working group which was recently established by the Bureau of the FIFA Council to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The working group recommended the Bureau of FIFA Council to “postpone the FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup Panama/Costa Rica 2020 — originally scheduled for August/September 2020 — and the FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup India 2020 — originally scheduled for November 2020.”

“New dates will be identified,” FIFA said in a statement.

It was also decided “to create a sub-working group on the women’s international match calendar to consider potential changes to the calendar and dates of postponed FIFA final tournaments”.

The All India Football Federation said the postponement was on expected lines.

“Just like other sports events which were postponed due to this dreaded disease, it (postponement of U-17 World Cup) was to happen. We have to accept the decision,” AIFF General Secretary Kushal Das said. “The qualifying events in Europe and Africa and other confederations are yet to be held and so the decision was on expected lines.”

He said the tournament will most likely be held next year.

The working group of the world body which took the decision includes the FIFA administration and Secretary Generals and top executives from all confederations.

It unanimously approved a series of recommendations following its first meeting, which was organised via conference late on Friday.

While the tournament itself is five months away but only the qualifying event for Asia has been held so far from which from which Japan and North Korea have made the cut.

Five remaining qualifying events — that of Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and Central, North America and Caribbean — have not been held due to the global health crisis which has affected more than a million people.

The official schedule of the tournament was announced in February and Navi Mumbai was to host the final.

The Local Organising Committee (LOC) said it supported the decision though it was looking forward to host the tournament in November as scheduled.

“We agree that this has been made with the highest regard for public health, and the participating teams, host cities, staff and visiting fans, and keeps the best interests of everyone in mind,” the LOC said in a statement.

“For us at the moment, the primary concern is the health and well being of every stakeholder involved in the tournament. We don’t want to take any risk that is detrimental to our community before it is clear that there is no threat to people’s health due to this pandemic.”

The LOC said it will continue to provide full support to FIFA on all matters and look forward to hosting a successful tournament in the near future.

In other decisions, the working group recommended “to postpone all international matches due to be played during the upcoming June 2020 window; and to organise bilateral discussions with confederations concerning 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in order to finalise a revised match schedule pending health and safety developments”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fifa-postpone-u-17-women---s-wc-in-india-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/fifa-postpone-u-17-women---s-wc-in-india.html

147,05-4-20,"Thailand, Malaysia banned from weightlifting at Tokyo Olympics","Thailand and Malaysia have been banned from sending weightlifters to the Tokyo Olympics. The International Weightlifting Federation said in its statement on Saturday that the Thai Amateur Weightlifting Association (TAWA) has been suspended for three years, while the Malaysian Weightlifting Federation (MWF) has been given a one-year ban.

In its decision, the Independent Member Federation Sanctions Panel (IMFSP), which issued the bans to the two federations, said the bans would apply whenever the Games take place.

Additionally, the Thai federation has also been fined $200,000, half of which “shall be used by IWF to offset IWF costs already incurred in connection with the TAWA matter and for additional IWF testing of TAWA athletes”, the panel said.

The Thailand federation had already withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics voluntarily after nine of its weightlifters were caught for doping violations at the 2018 World Championships.

The IMFSP said that both the TAWA and MWF were informed of the bans on Wednesday and have 21 days to appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

Like almost the entire sporting schedule around the world, cricket has been halted by the pandemic, with no return date set in stone.

One of the options being mooted is to have the sport resume after restrictions have been lifted, but in empty stadiums.

“When you started off playing cricket, when you were under age, there’s no crowds there,” he told BBC Radio.

“You played it because you loved playing the game, you loved playing with your mates and you loved playing the game.

“For the love of the game, and for still being able to entertain people through TV sets or radio, then there’s value in (playing behind closed doors).

“The fact that three of the venues (Kolkata, Navi Mumbai, Guwahati) have already hosted a FIFA tournament in the past helps and the other venues seem on track. Everyone is committed to ensuring that this does not impact us much and we move ahead with our planning and deliver a memorable U-17 Women’s World Cup in India,” she said.

She added that the LOC will work with FIFA to chalk out alternate dates best suited to host the tournament in India which has previously hosted the U-17 Men’s World Cup which was won by England.

""We shall work with FIFA to look at alternate dates best suited to host the tournament in India. At present, in collaboration with FIFA, the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Hosting States, national and international health authorities, we are constantly monitoring the situation regarding COVID-19 in India.”

“We are in regular touch with FIFA and all the other concerned stakeholders. Three of the venues (Guwahati, Kolkata and Navi Mumbai) hosted the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2017 and already meet the majority of FIFA requirements. The two new venues, Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar, also have the basic infrastructure ready. We also already had one round of FIFA inspections in November at all five of these venues, which went really well.

“It is a tough decision but it is in the best interest of everyone especially the players.

150,05-4-20,Cummins glad being vice-captain under Paine,"Australia fast bowler Pat Cummins feels nice about skipper Tim Paine rating him as one of the contenders for future Test captaincy but says the topic is just a moot point as the wicket-keeper is still playing.

Discussions about who should lead Australia whenever the 35-year-old Paine retires are ongoing. Former captain Steve Smith’s leadership ban has also expired.

Earlier this week, Paine named Smith, Cummins, Travis Head, Alex Carey and Marnus Labuschagne among those who could take up the captaincy.

Former skipper Michael Clarke has long been pushing for Cummins — the current vice-captain — to lead the national side.

“It’s nice to hear, (I) don’t think it makes me want it more or less. I’m glad being a vice-captain underneath him that I get that nod. He’s brilliant,” Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.Com.Au.

“Like I’ve said a hundred times before, I kind of feel it’s not quite right talking about captaincy now when we’ve got someone like Painey and Finchy (limited-overs captain Aaron Finch) doing great jobs. We’ll see down the track, but at the moment it’s bit of a moot point.”

The 26-year-old Cummins, who has taken 143 wickets from 30 Tests since making his debut in 2011, is expected to top Cricket Australia’s contract list for 2020-21 whenever it is announced, underling his importance in Justin Langer’s team.

The 26-year-old has become the most resilient member of the attack after an injury-plagued start to his career. He was appointed one of Paine’s deputies last year, but currently has no captaincy experience at the domestic level. “In the perfect world, your first experience of being captain — say Australian captain, you’ve (already) had quite a bit of experience leading and you know exactly what it entails,” he said.

“But things don’t always work out as exactly as you planned.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cummins-glad-being-vice-captain-under-paine.html
151,05-4-20,KP proposes condensed IPL without fans,"The COVID-19 pandemic may have indefinitely stalled all sporting activities but former England captain Kevin Pietersen still “truly believes” the 13th edition of IPL should happen the moment there is a window of opportunity.

He proposed a “condensed” league behind closed doors for one of cricket’s biggest money-spinners, adding the fans shouldn’t be risked.

“Let’s say July/August is the earliest, I do truly believe the IPL should happen. I do believe it is the kick-start to the cricket season. I think every single player around the world is desperate to play the IPL,” Pietersen said.

The former star batsman expressed his thoughts on Star Sports’ show Cricket Connected.

The IPL is important not just for players and franchises, but also for the people working behind the scenes, and this was not lost on Pietersen.

“There could be a way in which to get some money into the franchises, into the economy by having a situation where you use maybe three venues which are completely closed to fans and the players can still go out and play the tournament in three weeks or in four weeks.

“So, it’s a more condensed tournament in three venues which we know are safe, which we know are secure,” he said.

Agreeing with Pietersen, former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar spoke on the importance of organising the IPL.

“The moment we get clearances from all the authorities that matter, the IPL should happen, only because it will kick start the economy because when you talk about the IPL it’s not just about the Mumbai Indians, or a Dhoni or a Virat Kohli, there are a lot of people who are making their livelihood through the IPL,” he said.

Recently, Rajasthan Royals’ executive chairman Manoj Badale had said that a “shortened” IPL couldn’t be ruled out, provided the BCCI and its other stakeholders are on the same page.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kp-proposes-condensed-ipl-without-fans.html

And a major player in this scenario is the foreign boards as an IPL without the foreign players wouldn’t be the carnival it is. So, even as the country fights the pandemic, BCCI has been keeping foreign boards in the loop with regards to developments.

Speaking about it, a BCCI official said that the foreign boards like Cricket Australia or the ECB and Cricket South Africa among others have all been constantly updated on the scenario and the directives of the government with regards to fighting COVID-19.

“While various options have been discussed like a closed-door tournament, or a curtailed one, it is almost clear that everyone wants foreign players to be a part of the IPL and that is one of the major highlights of the tournament. So, we have been constantly updating the boards of the situation here and the directives that are being issued by the health department as well as the government in the fight against coronavirus.

“In fact, it is a two-way process as international border lockdown is also an aspect that needs to be kept in mind because at the end of the day whenever the IPL does happen, the foreign players need to fly in,” the official pointed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bcci-in-constant-touch-with-foreign-boards.html

The cricketers’ gesture comes after the England and Wales Cricket Board had proposed a 20 percent cut in the players’ salaries. The ECB was waiting for a response from the representatives at the Professional Cricketers’ Association.

The donation of 500,000 pounds is equivalent to a 20 percent reduction in the salaries of men’s cricketers while the women volunteered for a pay cut in their April, May and June salaries.

“Following a meeting of all of the England men’s centrally contracted cricketers, the players have agreed to make an initial donation of £0.5m to the ECB and to selected good causes,” read a statement from the players.

The flamboyant India vice-captain made his ODI debut in June 2007 while his maiden T20 game came during the World Cup later that year against England, where unfortunately Rohit didn't get a chance to bat.

Asked about his first impression of Rohit, Yuvraj said the swashbuckling batsman seemed like somebody who had a lot of time to play his strokes.

""I think when he came into the Indian team, he looked like somebody who had a lot of time,"" Yuvraj Singh said during a YouTube chat show.

Holding discussion with Members of Parliament from the state through video-conferencing, the chief minister sought their suggestion for smooth movement of people and services after the lockdown period.

""Lockdown will be lifted on April 15. We have to ensure that crowding doesn't take place. Your help and cooperation is needed in this regard. The reason is that after the lockdown is lifted and if crowding takes place, then all of our efforts will go in vain,"" Adityanath told the MPs.

""So, I want that we evolve a mechanism, and for this, I would invite your suggestions,"" he said.

Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Mahendra Nath Pandey, who attended in the video conferencing, told PTI, ""We spoke with the UP chief minister and he told us about the work done and steps taken by the state government during the lockdown.

158,05-4-20,Lighting lamps alone won't help win war against COVID-19: Cong,"The Congress on Sunday said lighting lamps alone will not help win the war against coronavirus and demanded answers from the government on the safety of health workers in the “absence” of adequate protective gear.

The party also said lifting of lockdown should not be done in an unplanned manner as its implementation.

Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev posed nine questions to the government on how it intended to strengthen the fight against coronavirus and protect the frontline warriors.

""The prime minister made a request to people of the country to light a lamp or a torch at 9 pm for 9 minutes. Just like the lockdown alone cannot succeed in containing coronavirus, it should be backed by massive testing and economic package,"" she said at a press conference through video conferencing.

Dev cited examples of the US which has given 10 per cent of its GDP as economic package and the UK gave 15 per cent.

Highlighting the absence of enough protective gear for the medical workers dealing with COVID-19 cases, Dev said at least 50 doctors have been infected by the deadly virus.

She also sought to know when would the Centre provide compensation to those who have died due to coronavirus, as she said state governments were not financially equipped to provide the same.

""Around 100 people have died so far, will the central government give compensation to their families? These are some questions which we ask in national interest and not in criticism of the government,"" she said.

Asked if the Congress supported lifting the lockdown, Dev said it is for the government to decide.

""We only hope it is not done in an unplanned manner as the lockdown was imposed… the sacrifice of people and the hardship faced by them for the last 21 days should not go waste,"" she noted.

The Congress leader also alleged that against the demand of 62 lakh PPE kits, only 3.34 lakh kits are available for doctors and paramedical staff at present.

""If we cannot protect our doctors, nurses, technicians and other paramedical staff who are in the forefront of fighting this war against coronavirus, then this country is not prepared for this fight,” Dev said.

Accusing the government of delaying by five weeks issuing orders for allowing manufacture of PPEs locally in the absence of guidelines till March 24, she said the 50 doctors who contracted the disease could have been averted.

She also asked if the government has approved any agencies to test these PPEs manufactured locally.

Dev also questioned the government on increasing the number of ventilators required in the country, as only 40,000 of them are available, of which 20,000 are not working properly, according to reports.

She also called for large-scale testing to curb the spread of the disease.

""We cannot be successful in this war against coronavirus unless the government increases the scale of testing,"" the Congress leader said.

160,05-4-20,PM's 9-minute lights-out call goes well without disrupting electricity grid,"A nine-minute lights-out event on Sunday evening went off well without any disruption in the electricity grid after the government and utilities put in place elaborate plans to deal with the sudden drop and then a quick spurt in demand.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged people to switch off the lights at their homes and light up lamps, candles or mobile phone torches for nine minutes at 9 pm on Sunday to display the country's ""collective resolve"" to defeat coronavirus.

Power Minster R K Singh told PTI, ""The power supply ramp down and ramp up - they (officials) handled very smoothly, and I along with my senior officials -- power secretary, POSCO CMD -- were personally monitoring the situation from National Monitoring Centre in the ministry. I congratulate all the engineers of NLDC, RLDC and SLDCs for handling the situation very efficiently especially in huge response to the Prime Minister's call"".

The power consumption went down from 117GW to 85.30GW within the spin of around four minutes leading up to 9PM. That means this was much more than anticipated fall of 12GW, the minister said.

The ramp up was very smooth at around 110 GW after the dip in demand during light-out, he said, adding that no incident of any power failure reported.

He also lauded power gencos NTPC and NHPC for rising up to the occasion.

Also, there was good contribution from Hydro power sector, Singh added.

There were apprehensions about adverse affect on the electricity grid due to the blackout among the people which were dispelled by the Ministry of Power on Saturday saying these are misplaced.

The government on Saturday sought to assuage fears of electricity grid instability due to simultaneous switching on and off of most lights in the country, saying adequate protocols are in place to handle the variation in demand without causing any damage to appliances.

Several states shot off letters to power utilities to take steps to deal with the possibility of a sudden drop in electricity demand, which has already dipped 25.82 per cent to 125.11 GW on April 4 from 168.66 GW on the same day last year, mainly due to the lockdown, which shut down most businesses.

Power System Operation Corp Ltd, the agency responsible for managing electricity grid, had said the lighting load of household consumes may be no more than 12-13 GW.

""Unlike normal operation, this reduction in load of the order of 12-13 GW would happen in 2-4 minutes and recover nine minutes later.

""This sharp reduction in load and recovery, which is unprecedented, will need to be handled through hydro and gas resources,"" it had said.

Its game plan of managing the sudden change in demand was to reduce hydro power generation during 6:10 pm to 8:00 pm on Sunday and conserve it for providing flexibility during the 9:00 pm event.

Also, coal-based generators as well as gas fired power stations were to be scheduled in a manner so as to manage the peak demand.

The government on its part moved to assuage any concerns on this front, saying the call was only for voluntary switching off the lights, and appliances such as computers, TV, refrigerators and ACs are to function normally.

Also, lights in all essential services including hospitals, police stations and manufacturing facilities as well as street lights are not to be switched off.

""Some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm the electrical appliances. These apprehensions are misplaced,"" power ministry had said on Saturday.

""There is no call to switch off either street lights or appliances like computers, TVs, fans, refrigerators and ACs in the homes. Only lights should be switched off. The lights in hospitals and all other essential services like public utilities, municipal services, offices, police stations, manufacturing facilities, etc will remain on,"" the ministry further said.

Stating that the Prime Minister has appealed to the people to voluntarily switch off their lights between 9:00 p.M to 9:09 pm, the ministry had said that all local bodies were advised to keep the street lights on for public safety.

State load dispatch centres and other state utilities had also shot off advisories for the purpose.

This was not the first time the country went for a blackout, as earlier too such exercises have been conducted for initiatives like 'Earth Hour'.

161,05-4-20,30% corona cases linked to Tablighis,"Govt figures put number below 3K, but realtime data claims 3,500 +ve cases; 601 new cases; death toll at 68

As coronavirus cases continued to swell in the country, adding 400-500 patients a day since Wednesday, the Centre on Saturday again linked the rise to the Tablighi Jamaat members congregating in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz in mid-March, saying they alone contributed 30 per cent of the total cases.

The Ministry of Health said total number of cases as on Saturday morning stood below 3,000, including 68 death and 601 new cases reported over the last 24 hours.

“Till now there are 2,902 positive cases in India. 601 positive cases have been reported since Friday, 12 deaths also reported on Friday, taking the total to 68. One eighty three people have recovered/discharged,” said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry.

But according to the total of figures collected from States, the overall numbers of positive cases stood at 3,510 by 8.30 pm on Saturday. Maharashtra stood at the peak 537 positive cases, including 47 new. It was followed by Tamil Nadu with 485 positive cases, including 74 new. With 59 new cases, Delhi was on the third spot.

The national Capital has overall 445 positive cases. Kerala with 304 positive cases, 11 of them new was placed fourth. Telengana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had more than 200 cases each.

Meanwhile, Dharavi in Mumbai reported two more cases of coronavirus, taking the total number of positive cases in the area to five.

Agarwal said 1,023 coronavirus cases in 17 States were related to the Jamaat’s congregation. “Around 30 per cent of the total cases are related to the religious congregation so far. We need to understand that we are as strong as the weakest link,” he said.

Punya Salila Srivastava, Joint Secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry, said through a massive coordinated effort around 22,000 Tablighis and their contacts have been quarantined.

All issues related to the ongoing lockdown are being monitored by a 24x7 control room of the Ministry of Home Affairs here, she said, adding that about 200 personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Central Armed Police Forces are linked to it on the ground level.

The officer said all measures to implement the three-week nationwide lockdown, set to end on April 14, have been effective till now and the supply of essential goods and services has been “satisfactory”.

Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has written to States and Union Territories to ensure that the supply chain of essential items is not obstructed during the lockdown period, she said.

The first installment of Rs 11,092 crore under the State disaster response fund was released by the MHA on Friday. States can utilise this money for ensuring aid to migrant workers and other calamity-related work, she said.

States and UTs are running relief camps for migrant workers and other needy people in coordination with NGOs and other community groups, she added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/30--corona-cases-linked-to-tablighis-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/30--corona-cases-linked-to-tablighis.html
162,05-4-20,Longer than expected breaks bigger challenge for fast bowlers: Nehra,"A batsman can do with yoga and weight training but for the merchants of speed, former India pacer Ashish Nehra feels the absence of running for more than three months at a stretch could come in their way of fitness.

According to him, the fast bowlers will have to start running sooner or later.

India is in the second week of a three-week lockdown enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 70 lives while infecting over 3000 people.

With sporting activities coming to a standstill, the elite athletes are confined to their homes, trying to remain fit while hoping for action to begin once normalcy returns.

""Let's consider a few situations. Even if the lockdown ends on April 15, it will take a lot of time for social life to become normal.

""If you ask me, I am not expecting any cricketing activity before July. So this is a long break but once action starts fast bowlers have the biggest challenge to remain fit,"" Nehra told PTI during an interaction.

Just like former India team physio John Gloster, Nehra also feels that the paucity of space for most cricketers is a problem and more so for the fast bowlers.

""Lack of running time for fast bowlers is an issue. Now the situation is unavoidable. So whoever at least has a garden with say 15 metres or 20 metres space, they should do shuttle run thrice a week unless they are allowed to train at grounds,"" said Nehra.

Shuttle run comprises short strides between 20 to 40 metres where players run between points A and B.

""You can do as much of yoga or free weights, fast bowler's life is nothing without good running time. There is a lot of difference with batsmen,"" said Nehra, who has been a bowling coach with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Why does one need to run more than say cycling or swimming?

""It's not just about heart-rate but also about bowling muscles such as hamstring, glutes, groin and calf, they remain activated. Giving a choice between swimming, cycling and running, as a cricketer I would say running. Also a bit of shadow bowling can help in visualization,"" said Nehra, who has played 164 internationals for India (17 Tests, 120 ODIs and 27 T20Is).

He had a word of advice for those who have sprawling terraces with soil and grass cover.

""It's fine if you are doing Surya Namaskar on terrace but if you start running and doing shuttle run, you will end up damaging your knees and ankles because of hard surface.The very reason that professional players should avoid playing tennis on hard courts in five-star hotels. They are cement courts.""

Nehra said that he is confident whether it's the BCCI or ICC, even if there is a semblance of normalcy by June, they will give at least a month's time to the players to prepare, as one can't suddenly start playing.

""And injuries can happen to anyone. The fast bowler who has trained the least might be fitter than fast bowler who has trained the most. Nature of sport is such. But yes, I hope that if lockdown ends, they have access to grounds,"" said Nehra.

And he also had a word of caution for fast bowlers and professional players in general.

""Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, after this prolonged break, can afford to come back with a paunch. Not active players. So break ka matlab ye naahi ki biryani khaani hain (A break from sport doesn't mean you will have biryani).""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/longer-than-expected-breaks-bigger-challenge-for-fast-bowlers--nehra-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/longer-than-expected-breaks-bigger-challenge-for-fast-bowlers--nehra.html

""The BWF is aware of the need to reschedule the 2021 World Championships normally staged in August, with suitable alternatives being discussed with hosts Spain,"" the BWF said in a statement.

The postponement of the Olympic Games has caused widespread disruption to the sporting calendar in 2021. World Athletics has already confirmed it will push back its World Championships to 2022, while the World Aquatics Championships could also be delayed by a year.

Earlier in the week, the Badminton World Federation froze the world rankings, saying standings as on March 17 will be the basis for entry and seedings when it begins as the international calendar has been thrown in choppy waters due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

166,05-4-20,Trump requests Modi to release Hydroxychloroquine ordered by US,"President Donald Trump has said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the amount of Hydroxychloroquine ordered by the United States after India last month banned the drugs for exports.

Trump said that he spoke to Prime Minister Modi on Saturday morning and made a request to release Hydroxycholoroquine for the US.

""I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of Hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,"" Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.

India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 25 banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine but said that certain shipments on humanitarian grounds may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.

With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the worst sufferers of the deadly coronavirus diseases to which there has been no cure.

Scientists across the world in particular in the US are racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus that has so far killed more than 64,000 people and infected 1.2 million in more than 150 countries.

Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine, a decades old malaria drug, for the successful treatment of coronavirus.

Following a quick provisional approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Saturday, the malaria drug along with a combination of some other drug is being used in the treatment of about 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York.

According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.

In the next several weeks, health experts in the US has projected between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths due to coronavirus, which due to human-to-human transmission is spreading like a wildfire in the US.

In anticipation of it being a successful drug in the treatment of coronavirus, the US has already stockpiled some 29 million doses.

It is in this context Trump requested Modi to help US get millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that can be produced at mass scale in India.

Trump said he would appreciate if India releases the amount of Hydroxychloroquine that the US has ordered.

""And I said I would appreciate if they (India) would release the amounts that we ordered, he said, without mentioning that quantity of Hydroxychloroquine that has been ordered by US companies from India.

The Trump administration has made Hydroxychloroquine as part of its Strategic National Stockpile.

Trump said that people in malaria affected-countries take Hydroxychloroquine and not many people are infected by coronavirus.

Trump said that he would take Hydroxychloroquine, if needed.

""I think people should if it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it, Ok? I may take it. And, I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it, he said in response to a question.

168,05-4-20,Pak militant with ISI link held in Afghan for ISIS-claimed terror attack on Kabul gurdwara,"Afghanistan's intelligence has arrested an ISI-linked Pakistani ISIS militant who was the mastermind behind the attack on a Kabul gurdwara last month that left 27 people including an Indian citizen dead.

Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi, a key leader of ISIS' Khorasan branch, was arrested along with 19 of his associates during a ""complex operation"" by the National Directorate of Security (NDS) in the country's southern province of Kandahar on Saturday, TOLO News reported.

A native of Pakistan's restive northwestern Orakzai agency, he was ""enjoying close relations"" with Pakistan-based terror groups such as the Haqqani network and the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the NDS said in a statement.

Farooqi was appointed as ISIS' shadow governor in Afghanistan after the killing of Abu Saeed Bajawri, according to the statement.

He was operating as the commander of ISIS' military wing in Peshawar and was deployed in Abdul Khel valley of Achin district of the eastern province of Nangarhar, it said.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, an NDS official told AFP that Farooqi was the mastermind behind an ISIS-claimed attack on the gurdwara in Kabul last month.

The attack claimed the lives of 27 people including an Indian citizen.

The NDS further said that Farooqi has confessed to having links with ""regional intelligence agencies"", a reference to Pakistan's spy agency ISI which has been regularly blamed by Afghanistan of carrying out terror attacks in the country.

Nearly 150 people were inside the gurdwara when the attack took place.

Tian Singh, a resident of Greater Kailash Part-1 in New Delhi, was also killed in the attack whose responsibility was claimed by banned Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an offshoot of ISIS.

India's premier investigation agency the NIA on April 1 registered its first overseas case and will probe the terror strike on the gurdwara.

An NIA spokesman has said that according to the preliminary investigation, Mohammed Muhsin (28), a resident of Thrikaripur town in Kerala's Kasargod district, and others who had joined ISKP, are suspected to have been involved in the attack.

His parents had claimed that they received a message from the ISIS confirming his death during the attack, the official said.

169,05-4-20,"India bucks global trend, 42% cases from 21-40-yr group","Contrary to the global trend where elderly are said to be the most vulnerable to Covid-19, in India it is the young people who are bearing the brunt of the deadly disease. At least 42 per cent of the total positive cases reported so far are in the age group of 21-40. People above 60 years accounted for only 17 per cent of the cases.

“We have done the age profile analysis of Covid-19 cases in India. We found that 9 per cent of positive cases are in between 0- 20 years, 42 per cent cases are in the age group of 21-40, 33 per cent in 41-60 and 17 per cent in the people above 60 years of age,” said

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

However, in contrast, as situation prevails at present, most of the fatalities reported in India are from the higher age group.

Around 1.15 million people from across the world are infected with the virus which has claimed 60,428 lives since the first case of Covid-19 was reported in December last year from Wuhan in China. So far, 2,36,095 have recovered.

“As far as deaths are concerned, we have noticed that advanced age and co-morbidities such as diabetes, kidney and cardiac ailments played an important role in deaths,” said Agarwal.

“We are battling with this on a day-to-day basis. Still, the case doubling rate in India is lesser than others,” he added.

According to a paper published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, the Covid-19 kills an estimated 13.4 per cent of patients in the 80 plus age group , compared to 1.25 per cent of those in their 50s and 0.3 per cent of those in their 40s.

The sharpest divide came at age 70. Although 4 per cent of patients in their 60s died, more than twice that, or 8.6 per cent, of those in their 70s died, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and his colleagues estimated in the paper, based on the global data.

However, experts say that even if the young get infected, their survival rate is much higher in India, like in Italy and France where elders deaths were comparatively higher.

“As things stand, India has a very young population. Its median age is 28.4 years. The actual data runs somewhat like this: 44.7 per cent of the population is below 25 years of age and 41.24 per cent of the population is in the age group of 25-54 years. So altogether, more than 85 per cent of India’s population is below 54 years of age.

“Based on the data as analysed for France, Italy and Iran, India’s young are likely to act as a bulwark against the virus. It seems likely that this shall keep the death rates very, very, low indeed. India, with its young population coupled with the lockdown, shall come out of the crisis sooner and better than many European nations.

“This does not mean that the infection rates shall necessarily be low. We may get fairly high infection rates. I must also mention that there is no reliable data for infection rates at the global level. What seems clear is that the death rates for India shall be very low and to my mind that is the most important parameter that should be used to gauge the situation,” said Dinesh Singh, former Vice Chancellor, Delhi University and a mathematician.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-bucks-global-trend--42--cases-from-21-40-yr-group-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-bucks-global-trend--42--cases-from-21-40-yr-group.html
170,05-4-20,Timeless classics for lockdown,"To beat COVID-19 blues and give a feel of the good old days, several shows like Ramayan, Mahabharat and Shaktimaan are being re-telecast. MUSBA HASHMI tells you why they are still in demand

The silver lining in the grey clouds of the Coronavirus pandemic is that it has brought families closer. So much so that DD National found it the right time to go back in time and bring back all the family dramas or to be precise classics that had people glued to their sets. Back in the 80s and 90s, it was an era when people would eagerly wait for their favourite shows. It was nothing short of a festivity and puja for some when they would do aarti of the TV sets as soon as Ramayan was aired.

From mythological shows like Ramayan and Mahabharat to fantasy ones like Alif Laila, to dramas like Circus to superheroes series like Shaktimaan, there’s something for everyone to watch during this lockdown and keep them entertained.

Nitish Bhardwaj, who played Lord Krishna in Mahabharat, says that the reason why the millenials too are glued to their TV screens in the re-telecast of these shows is because of curiosity.

“The millennials are wondering why their parents were praising these serials so much, what is there that makes them stand out. This curiosity has attracted the attention of the younger generation towards the re-telecast,” he says.

Another reason is that the storyline is relevant even today and hence fresh. “The value systems and the drama of human relationships in these serials is relevant for all times. The human conflict and struggle has in fact increased over the last 30 years and this makes Mahabharat even more identifiable,” Bhardwaj tells you.

There is a difference, he says, in the shows that were made then and now. “People nowadays call their shows factory-line ‘soaps’ whereas our shows were and still are ‘designer products’ which cater to both classes and masses,” he adds.

Mukesh Khanna, who played Shaktimaan says that good work remains good even if you watch it after 30 years down the line. “Gold will always remain gold, no matter after how long you dig it. That was a period of creativity. You name any show from those days and it is still as good. Shows now have lost essence. One reason for this may be the daily telecast,” he says.

He tells you that the re-telecast of these shows was next to impossible but now that it has happened, it is time to cheer up. “Back then, when Mahabharat used to come on TV, everyone was hooked to their screens and it looked like a curfew situation on the roads. Then with the emergence of more and more channels, the variety of content increased manifold. It looked impossible that these shows will ever come back because of the varied taste of the audience. I could have never imagined that there will be a time when the whole country will sit and watch Mahabharat or for that matter Shaktimaan again. But it happened and whosoever cae up with this idea to relive the 90s should be appreciated.

This will not only beat the boredom of the 21-day lockdown but will also instill in people the value of relationships that was slowly being lost. Moreover, the younger generation will get a taste of their culture and tradition which is the need of the hour,” Khanna tells you.

Khanna hopes that the re-telecast of such shows will bring about a change in the TV industry and that makers would now start coming up with concept that will stay relevant even after three decades years.

“I hope that this change will come and the makers will realise that the audience wants something fresh but it will depend on how long the lockdown period stays. People have the tendency to forget what they learnt once they come out of that phase. People should stop repeating content and think of newer concepts. One track is copied by multiple shows and as a result, 80 per cent has low TRPs,” he says.

Apart from the fact that technology has evolved, Khanna hasn’t see any positive change in the TV industry. “All these years, I feel that TV has degraded a lot. Yes, not to mention there are a lot of people who are working extremely hard, the otherwise quality of things have degraded. People have started twisting history. They want to give a modern twist to everything which can’t and shouldn’t happen because then it doesn’t showcase our culture. The essence gets lost. Not everything can be modernised especially mythological shows. This is the reason why many such shows failed to leave a mark,” he says and gives a hint that the audience will get to see Shaktimaan Season 2, bigger and better soon.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/timeless-classics-for-lockdown-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/timeless-classics-for-lockdown.html
171,05-4-20,Want long term weight loss? Fitness is the mantra,"If you want a longer healthier life, read this carefully. The more fit you are when you start a weight-loss programme, the more weight you could lose, compared to those who are very out of shape, say researchers.

""This research could help us improve the design of our weight loss programs and suggests that adults with very poor fitness may benefit from additional exercise support during a weight loss program to achieve higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and improve long-term weight loss,"" said study lead researcher Adnin Zaman, from the University of Colorado in the US.

For the findings, published in the journal Journal of the Endocrine Society, researchers examined the relationship between a person's level of fitness at the beginning of the study and weight loss at the end of an 18-month behavioural weight loss programme.

The programme combined a calorie-restricted diet, group-based behavioural support, and six months of supervised exercise.

The study included 60 adults with obesity or overweight. Participants exercised under supervision for the first six months of the study.

The participants wore an armband that measured their activity levels over one week at the beginning of the study, and then for a week during months 6, 12 and 18.

Their cardiovascular fitness was measured during a graded exercise test on a motorised treadmill. Participants were divided into two groups: ""very poor fitness"" and ""poor or better fitness.""

Twenty (33 per cent) of the adults who completed the 18-month study were classified as having very poor fitness at the beginning of the study, while 40 (67 per cent) were categorised as having poor or better fitness, according to the study.

Body mass index--a measure of body fat based on height and weight--was higher in those with very poor fitness at the beginning of the study compared with those in the poor or better fitness group.

There were no significant differences between the two groups in weight change at six or 12 months.

At 18 months, however, those in the poor or better category lost nearly twice as much weight as those who had very poor fitness at the start of the study--an average of 18 pounds versus 9.5 pounds.

""Future studies are needed to evaluate whether providing additional exercise support or focusing specifically on improving fitness in adults with low levels of fitness would improve weight loss,"" Zaman said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/want-long-term-weight-loss--fitness-is-the-mantra-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/want-long-term-weight-loss--fitness-is-the-mantra.html
172,05-4-20,Anti-parasitic drug kills coronavirus in lab grown cells: Study,"Researchers have found that an anti-parasitic drug already available around the world can kill the novel coronavirus grown in cell cultures within 48 hours, an advance that may lead to the development and trial of a new clinical therapy for COVID-19.

According to the study, published in the journal Antiviral Research, the drug, Ivermectin, stopped the virus, SARS-CoV-2, from growing in cell culture within 48 hours.

""We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,"" said study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia.

The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus.

However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out in people.

""Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that's the next step,"" Wagstaff said.

""In times when we're having a global pandemic and there isn't an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,"" she said.

Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus 'dampening down' the host cells' ability to clear it.

""As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,"" said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia.

The scientists further cautioned that the use of Ivermectin to combat COVID-19 would depend on the results of future pre-clinical testing and ultimately clinical trials.

173,05-4-20,NY continues to record highest number of daily deaths from COVID-19,"New York State, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, continued to record the highest count of daily deaths from COVID-19 as a staggering number of 630 people died in a 24-hour period and Governor Andrew Cuomo said the outbreak in the state could peak in about seven days.

The state had recorded the highest single increase in the number of deaths from novel coronavirus in a single day between April 2 and 3 when 562 people had died, one person dying from the viral infection almost every two-and-a-half minutes.

In the 24 hours since April 4, the death toll grew to 630, ""all-time increase"" up to a total of 3,565, up from 2,935 on Friday morning, Cuomo said.

The daily death toll in New York continues to grow at record numbers as the state remains the most impacted in the US from coronavirus.

Coronavirus cases in New York State now stand at 113,704, out of the country's total number of 312,146. New Jersey, the second most impacted state in the US, has about 30,000 COVID-19 cases.

New York City alone has 63,306 coronavirus patients, up from 57,169 the previous 24 hours, and 2,624 deaths.

Cuomo said the apex in the state, the point where the number of infections on a daily basis hits the high point, is still about 4-8 days away.

""We have been talking about hitting that apex, the high point of the curve. I call it the battle of the mountaintop. That's going to be the number one point of engagement of the enemy,"" he said.

""But our reading of the projections is we're somewhere in the seven-day range, four, five, six seven, eight day range. Nobody can give you a specific number, which makes it very frustrating to plan when they can't give you a specific number or a specific date, but we're in that range,"" Cuomo said.

""We are not yet at the apex. Part of me would like to be at the apex and just let's do it. But there's part of me that says it's good that we're not at the apex because we're not yet ready for the apex either, still working on the capacity of the (healthcare) system,"" the governor said.

Cuomo has expressed anger over the short supply of essential medical equipment for healthcare professionals to help them deal with the surge in coronavirus cases across the state and the country.

He said personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gowns and face shields are in short supply in New York as they are across the country and there is need for companies to make these materials.

""It is unbelievable to me that in the New York State, in the United States of America, we can't make these materials and that we are all shopping China to try to get these materials and we're all competing against each other,"" he had said earlier.

Cuomo said on Saturday that the state has 85,000 volunteers, including 22,000 from outside the state, and he will also be signing an executive order to allow medical students who were slated to graduate to begin practising, supplementing the state's healthcare professional capacity.

On ventilators, he said the state had ordered 17,000 but there was not enough supply in the federal stockpile to meet this growing demand across the state.

""China is remarkably the repository for all of these orders - ventilators, PPE, it all goes back to China, which long term we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don't have the manufacturing capacity in this country,"" he said, adding, ""New York has been shopping in China.""

The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive at the JFK Airport in the city, he said, as he thanked the Chinese government, Alibaba head Jack Ma, the Jack Ma Foundation, Alibaba co-founder co-founder Joe Tsai and China's Consul General Huang Ping.

In addition, the state of Oregon would deliver 140 ventilators to New York.

Cuomo has signed an executive order allowing the state to redistribute ventilators and personal protective equipment from hospitals, private sector companies and institutions that don't currently need them and redeploy the equipment to other hospitals with the highest need.

Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator.

The 2,500-bed facility at the Javits Convention Centre, which was supposed to be used for non-COVID patients, will now be used as COVID-positive facility.

""The federal government will staff that and the federal government with equip that. That is a big deal because that 2,500-bed facility will relieve a lot of pressure on the downstate system as a significant number of beds and that facility has to make that transition quickly and that's what we're focused on,"" Cuomo said.

Cuomo emphasised that he wants the pandemic to end as soon as possible as it is taking an unprecedented strain on life.

""I want this to be all over. It's only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime. I think we all feel the same. This stresses this country, this state, in a way that nothing else has frankly, in my lifetime. It stresses us on every level. The economy is stressed, the social fabric is stressed, the social systems are stressed, transportation is stressed,"" he said.

174,05-4-20,"France reports 441 new coronavirus deaths, total now 7,560","France on Saturday reported 441 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, lower than the record number of 588 recorded the previous day.

This brought the total number of deaths to 7,560 since the epidemic began, top health official Jerome Salomon told reporters. Of these, 5,532 died in hospital and 2,028 in old age facilities.

Salomon said there were now 28,143 people with coronavirus in hospital in France -- up 711 from the day before, with 6,838 of them in intensive care -- a daily increase of 176 critical patients.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.

""The COVID-19 pandemic is completely unprecedented with thousands of serious cases and thousands of deaths,"" Salomon said.

There have been 68,605 confirmed coronavirus cases in France, but this is not the total as testing for the virus is not universal.

While there has been a slowing in the rate of new intensive care admissions, Salomon warned that ""now is not the time to relax the effort.

177,05-4-20,Grid failure fear during blackout solidarity misplaced: Minister,"Amid concerns raised by several Opposition leaders, including former Power Minister Jairam Ramesh, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a 9-minute blackout at 9 pm on April 5 could result in a grid collapse, the Ministry of Power on Saturday said the apprehensions that this may cause instability in grid and voltage fluctuation harming electrical appliances are misplaced.

Clearing the air over a possible power grid collapse, the Power Ministry said there is no call to switch off street lights or appliances in homes like TV, refrigerators, air conditioners and only lights should be switched off for 9 minutes.

The lights in hospitals and other essential services will remain on. The clarification came after several news reports claimed that the Prime Minister’s appeal for a 9-minute blackout would result in power grid collapse and would take time to restore power across the nation.

Ramesh, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, and Maharashtra Energy Minister Nitin Raut have expressed concern that the PM’s call could lead to a multi-State grid collapse and result in blackout in the entire country.

In a series of tweets, the Ministry said some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm the electrical appliances. “These apprehensions are misplaced. The Indian electricity grid is robust, stable and adequate arrangements and protocols are in place to handle the variation in demand,” it said.

In a letter to State Governments, the Ministry of Power said the appeal of the PM is to voluntarily switch off only the lights at 9:00 pm on April 5, 2020. “There is no call to switch off either streetlights or appliances like TVs, refrigerators and ACs in homes. The lights in hospitals and all other essential services like public utilities, municipal services, offices, police stations, manufacturing facilities, etc will remain on,” it said.

According to the Power Ministry data, the maximum power demand in the country stood at 1,25,817 megawatt (MW) on April 2, 2020, almost 20 per cent lower than April 2, 2019 of 1,68,326 MW.

Earlier in a tweet, Tharoor said, “An unprecedented drop in electricity demand at 9 pm on Sunday and an immediate surge at 9.09 pm could cause the electrical grid to crash. So electricity boards are contemplating load shedding from 8 pm and staggered return to normal after 9.09 pm. One more thing the PM did not think about!”

India’s peak power demand at best is about 170 gigawatt (GW). However, due to lockdown, the demand has fallen by more than 20 per cent and it currently hovers around 120-130 GW.

Of this, household barely comprises 10-12 per cent. Officials believe a sudden drop and rise after nine-minute shutdown won’t cause disruption as it’s already prepared to manage up to 15 GW fluctuation.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/grid-failure-fear-during-blackout-solidarity-misplaced--minister-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/grid-failure-fear-during-blackout-solidarity-misplaced--minister.html

179,05-4-20,U-turn on domicile order: Govt tries to win hearts & minds,"The Centre’s decision to reverse its Tuesday night order notifying a new domicile status for Jammu & Kashmir reflects a realisation that it needed to take political parties together for maintaining long-term normalcy in the Union Territory.

As per the latest order, all jobs in Jammu & Kashmir will be for those who stayed in the area for at least 15 years.

The Centre was forced to withdraw its order following angry response from Jammu & Kashmir-based political parties, including National Conference (NC), People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and newly formed Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party.

The State unit of the BJP too had briefed top brass of the party after receiving brick bats from common masses over ignoring their genuine concerns while drafting the rules defining the domicile status and granting reservation in jobs meant only for fourth class employees.

An official said that swift response from the Centre was meant to win hearts and minds of the people of Jammu & Kashmir especially at a time when the Centre has already initiated political process with the setting up of delimitation commission.

“Any person who fulfils the following conditions shall be a domicile of the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir for the purposes of appointment to any post under the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir,” said the revised notification titled as Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order-2020.

“....no person shall be eligible for appointment to any post unless he is a domicile of the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir,” the amended Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services (Decentralisation and Recruitment) Act, which is a part of the notification, said.

Government officials and BJP leaders are tightlipped on this fiasco, while many Hindu hardliners in the Jammu blamed the Centre and the BJP for the U-turn in just two days. Section of State BJP leaders had flagged the issue before the party high command in private and sighted numerous examples of unrest among large sections of society including unemployed youth awaiting filling up of 50,000 vacancies.

The NC in statement said that the reversal order is just “cosmetic” urging “Delhi must stop toying around with J&K.” The PDP accused the BJP of playing dangerous games in the Valley in its bid to change the demography.

“The way in which the Union Government proclaimed a new job and domicile policy for the erstwhile State now clearly indicates people at the helm of affairs in New Delhi are dealing with Jammu & Kashmir very casually and without application of mind,” said the PDP.

“It’s high time the people of J&K get to decide the laws that will govern them rather than being subjected to the whims and fancies of the Centre where orders are issued in the morning and changes to the same order issued in the evening. Restore statehood, conduct elections,” said Omar Abdullah.

Omar again tweeted: “Delhi made a mistake notifying the domicile rules during this time of crisis & I made a mistake getting sucked into this debate at a time when it’s wrong to let politics distract from the #COVID19 fight. I haven’t spoken my mind about 5/8/2019 yet but I will when this is over.”

In the April 1 notification, the jobs were reserved only up to group 4 in the Government, which is equivalent to the rank of constable in police parlance and multi-tasking staff in Government offices.

Under the domicile law, anyone who has resided for 15 years in Jammu & Kashmir or has studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 and Class 12 examinations in an educational institution located in the Union Territory is a domicile. Anyone who is registered as a migrant by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner (Migrants) will also be deemed to be a domicile. The children of all-India services personnel, who have served there for 10 years, also come under the category.

Others who can be deemed to be a domicile include the children of those Central Government officials, all-India services officers, officials of PSU and autonomous bodies of the Central Government, public sector banks, officials of statutory bodies, Central university officials and those of recognised research institutes of the Central Government, who have served in Jammu & Kashmir for 10 years.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/u-turn-on-domicile-order--govt-tries-to--win-hearts---minds.html
180,05-4-20,Seven Indian nationals among 75 new coronavirus cases reported in Singapore,"Seven Indian nationals are among the 75 new coronavirus cases confirmed in Singapore, taking the total infections to 1,189 since the deadly diseases broke out here.

Of the new cases, 69 are local infections. Six are imported with a travel history to Europe, North and South America and ASEAN, said the Ministry of health on Saturday.

Six Indian nationals, between the ages of 18 and 52, are on work passes.

The seventh is a 46-year old female Indian national on work pass at the Indian-origin mega store Mustafa Centre, which has been closed for two-weeks.

Four new cases, three being Singapore citizens, have been linked to Mustafa Centre, bringing the total to 19 cases.

Mustafa Centre has been closed for at least two weeks and will undergo disinfection, according to media reports.

Mustafa Centre on Syed Alwi Road of the Little India precinct will be professionally disinfected, the mall's managing director Mustaq Ahmad told Channel News Asia.

""The moment we were informed that our staff had tested positive, we immediately took steps to inform all staff who had close contact with the affected staff to take leave. We also disinfected the affected departments,"" Mustaq said.

Twenty-six of the 500 confirmed cases, who are still in hospital, are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Most of the others are stable or improving, said the ministry.

181,05-4-20,‘I have never regretted my decisions’,"DEBINA BONNERJEE who plays Mallika in Sony Sab’s Aladdin Naam Toh Suna Hoga speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about what made her take up the role, challenges and how it was hilarious to act with Gurmeet to begin with

What is your role in Aladdin Naam Toh Suna Hoga?

I play Mallika, who is the creator of djinn and the lamp. She is the one who has created all the djinns.

What attracted you to play the role?

The dimensions of the character ofcourse. It is a very larger than life and humongous character. Mallika is the lead antagonist, it is like the whole show is on one side and Mallika single-handedly on the other. She stands tall. Moreover, the show is also well-established so there were no reasons for me turn down the project.

From Mayavi to now Aladdin, how has the journey been?

It has been an excellent one. Throughout my journey, I followed God’s instinct more than mine. There was a time when I auditioned for a few projects and I took the ones that got finalised first instead of taking the chance of waiting for the other ones thinking that they might be better. There were times when I was a part of a couple of projects at the same time but I have never regretted my decisions that 'oh I should have waited for other things to happen'. And in return whatever project I took back then turned out well for me. I believed that it was God’s will, therefore I never questioned my decisions.

How easy or difficult was it for you to be a part of this industry?

I wouldn’t say it was easy or difficult. Acting just happened with me. No one in my family belong to the field and hence, I had no one who could have guided me for my better back then. I only had a dream, that of being an actor. I kept on believing in it so much so that I developed the etiquette of an actor —body language and others. And that didn't make sense to many people back then. I remember when I was in Class VIII, my teacher scolded for me behaving like a heroine. I had a mixed feeling then — bad because I felt it was humiliating and good because I thought that people have started to believe that I have the qualities of an actor and can become one, even though I had no clue of what the field used to be like.

Then after some time, I took part in certain competitions, looked for work in the newspaper and eventually it happened and I came into the industry. One change led to the other. I have always managed to be as hardworking as I was before, I never felt saturated and never took anything casually. Even when I was in the most comfortable of positions, I had tried to evolve and be where I am today. So it wasn’t easy at all. Now when I see people who are enamoured by our lifestyle and profession come into this industry but it is not the way how things work. They are not persistent enough, may be they are for the initial two years but then it gets lost. However, my husband (Gurmeet Choudhary) and I both have worked extremely hard all our lives. We have always motivated each other to improve our skills.

You and Gurmeet are one of the power couples of the industry. What keeps the relationship so fresh?

It is because we are best friends first. And one can never get bored of their friend. Also we have set our individualistic priorities right, it is not as if one of us have kept that aside. The other day someone was telling me that people should give space to their partners. That’s what made me think that do we give space to each other and the answer was instantly a yes. Take for example if I am out with my friends that includes only girls and if Gurmeet is free and is getting bored at home then I ask him to join us and he never says no and vice versa. We have that level of understanding and there is no hard core role that my time is my time. Also, we are each others’ first priority and everything else comes second. This is what keeps us going.

You both have worked together on various shows. How easy or difficult was that?

Initially, it was difficult to work. We got to work together on our first break — Ramayan and even Mayavi. We used to laugh a lot. I found it hilarious to act together. Then gradually we started having lot of expectations from each other, we advised each other too. Then after some time, we got to work together for a film on a digital space and we realised how both of us have evolved as actors as well as human beings by working together. We were matured and stopped expecting from each other, in terms of work. The equation had changed over the years for us as actors and that was great.

What is there in the pipeline?

Currently I am focusing solely on Aladdin... and there is a film — Shubho Bijoyo that I have done with Gurmeet. It will release soon.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-have-never-regretted-my-decisions----2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-have-never-regretted-my-decisions---.html

183,05-4-20,Tellytale,"Manit goes an extra mile

Ever since Kundali Bhagya was launched, the show has been the most loved Indian television show. The stellar cast including the likes of Dheeraj Dhoopar (Karan), Shaddha Arya (Preeta), Manit Joura (Rishab), Anjum Fakih (Shrishti), Sanjay Gagnani (Prithvi) and Abhishek Kapur (Sameer), are being appreciated by one and all. However, looks like everyone's love for Manit is going to grow by leaps and bounds after hearing about what he has been up to during this COVID-19 lockdown.

In such difficult times when the whole country is locked down courtesy COVID-19, the Kundali Bhagya actor is trying to give back to the world in his own little and humble way. Manit Joura has come out in support of man's best friend, dogs. He loves canines and hence, he is going the extra mile for them. In association with Animals Matter To Me (AMTM), the actor has been feeding the stray dogs and with immense safety as instructed by the Government. In fact, they have taken permission from the Mumbai police to be able to go around the city for the same. In crucial times like these, when the horror of getting affected by the virus haunts everyone and keeps them indoors, he has shown immense courage and selflessness for the ones in need, who cannot even speak, and are often neglected.

When asked about the initiative, Manit shared: “Animals are as much a part of our society as we are! Domesticated animals have lived around humans all their lives and are mostly fed by them. In fact, dogs have forever been a man's best friend. However, the nationwide lockdown has rendered them confused, unfed, and thus, hungry and in this hour of need, I believe, we must show up for them. I'm so grateful that AMTM understood the cruciality of the situation and supported the cause. I wish we could do this on a larger scale, only if we were not victim to such critical situations.”

The dog lover in Manit could not help but say: “It's our duty to look after these animals in the times of need. I would go bonkers if Bella (his dog) is subject to anything of this sort. Being the parent of my beautiful Irish Setter, Bella has taught me so much compassion and empathy. And I wish we all could have the same for the stray dogs who have always been around us. I do hope everybody is safe and staying indoors and is doing their bit to help the society in their own ways.”

184,05-4-20,China reports 30 new coronavirus cases; nine districts in Wuhan classified as low-risk'',"China has reported 30 new cases of the novel coronavirus, including five locally transmitted infections, even as nine of the 13 administrative districts of virus-hit Wuhan city were declared low-risk areas' signifying a gradual return to normalcy, officials said on Sunday.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) in its daily report said other than the 30 new confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the mainland on Saturday, 47 new asymptomatic cases were also reported.

The NHC said 1,024 asymptomatic cases were still under medical observation, including 244 from abroad.

Asymptomatic coronavirus cases are those who test positive for the virus but do not show any symptom and have the potential to cause sporadic infection clusters.

Three deaths were also reported on Saturday -- all from virus epicentre Hubei Province -- taking the coronavirus death toll in China to 3,329 people.

The overall confirmed cases in the mainland reached 81,669 on Saturday, including 1,376 patients undergoing treatment and 76,964 others discharged from hospitals after recovery.

With another administrative district being classified as low risk' for the infection, there are nine district in total in Wuhan marked as low risk'.

The other four districts of Wuhan are classified as medium-risk, state run Xinhua news agency reported.

On March 27, Wuhan's coronavirus risk evaluation was downgraded from high risk' to medium risk'. Now, Hubei Province has no cities or counties marked as high risk'.

Hubei province, which has a population of 56 million, was put under lockdown on January 23. Officials say the province is gradually being opened up as the virus has abated with fewer new infection cases in recent weeks.

According to the risk criteria defined by the Chinese government, counties and districts with no newly confirmed cases in the last 14 days are categorised as 'low-risk' areas, those with fewer than 50 cases or those with over 50 but without a concentrated outbreak are classified as 'mid-risk' areas, and those with over 50 cases as well as a concentrated outbreak are classified as 'high-risk' areas.

Signifying the slowdown of the virus in the country, China on Saturday held a nationwide memorial for martyrs and victims of the coronavirus in the country.

Chinese President Xi Jinping led the national mourning from Beijing. Three minutes' silence was observed all over the country and flags flew half-mast.

186,05-4-20,"It's life-changing, say 'Four More Shot Please!' stars on show's success","Sayani Gupta, Kirti Kulhari and Maanvi Gagroo, the three stars of Amazon Original series Four More Shots Please! , say the show has been a life-altering experience for them and they are glad to take it a notch above with its upcoming season two.

The show, created by Rangita Pritish Nandy, features Sayani, Kirti, Maanvi and VJ-turned-actor Bani J as a quartet of friends and follows their relationships, work-life conflicts, ambitions and anxieties in a male-dominated society.

The first season of the show premiered on Amazon Prime Video in 2019 to great reviews from both the audiences and critics.

Sayani, who plays Damini, a journalist and an entrepreneur, said it is overwhelming to see that the show has amassed a cult status among its fans.

This show did exceedingly well as it has a very loyal fan base. To experience that, for all of us, was quite new. It almost became like a cult and it's crazy the kind of love it has received from the people.

That is the biggest takeaway because otherwise, you are just doing your job. It's life-changing. It's the fun part to play and I enjoyed every minute of it. I enjoyed being Damini and wearing lovely clothes, Sayani told PTI.

The first season ended on a cliffhanger for Damini and the actor said in season two, she will continue to deal with professional challenges as well as her tumultuous love life.

In the second season, you will see her grappling with her career and really trying to figure things out because you know she's to start afresh. She's a very ambitious girl and very driven. So obviously she wants to do something worthwhile with her life and she tries to do certain things and that puts her in a lot of trouble.

On the personal front, there's a lot of drama as she is a complex human being. She has a penchant for drama So honestly there's a lot going on in her life, Sayani added.

Kirti, who portrays Anjana, a successful lawyer and a single mother, said the show is full of moments that will inspire a lot of women.

People haven't seen anything like this in terms of content. We haven't seen urban women being represented at all. I also believe that people also enjoyed the boldness of the show. When I say bold, I'm talking about the themes and issues we are dealing with.

You could experience the liberation of so many girls through the show. The things that we deal within the show are not made up. There is a certain kind of mindset that prevails in the society. So it was nice to see all of that being shown without a filter. It was right there, in your face, she told PTI.

In season two, which will premiere on April 17, Kirti said her character has matured a bit.

You will see her having matured a bit from all that happened in the first season, all the situations she was a part. You will see her a growing up a bit. Of course, there is also a spillover of what happened in season one but you will also see her moving on from certain things and people.

The bond between the girls will become stronger. You will also see new themes and new issues. So there is a fresh set of all of this.

Maanvi said the show will continue the unabashed and unapologetic celebration of female friendship.

There haven't been many stories about female bonding and friendship. There have been films where you have two female characters coming close to each other because of a shared experience. But this show celebrates that bond, that friendship.

Today, there are so many women who don't want to confine to social norms. They want to make their own path and might falter doing that, but they will own up those mistakes. Four More Shots' is an ode to these women, the actor, who essays the role of Siddhi, told PTI.

The sophomore season will see the character stepping out in the world and find her own footing.

In season one, Siddhi realises that she needs to get out of this world created by her parents. She was being groomed for the marriage market and she used to believe that. But then she realises that this is not her path and she wants other things in life. So we see her exploring that in season two, Maanvi said.

The season two of Four More Shots Please! has been directed by Nupur Asthana, taking over from Anu Menon. It will also feature Prateik Babbar, Lisa Ray, Milind Soman, Neil Bhooplalam, Simone Singh and Amrita Puri.

188,05-4-20,Taking Vicky Kaushal for 'Ashwatthama' was a no-brainer: Aditya Dhar,"Director Aditya Dhar says choosing Vicky Kaushal for his next, actioner ""The Immortal Ashwatthama"" was a split-second decision as the actor fit the bill perfectly.

Aditya, who broke out on the Bollywood scene with his 2019 blockbuster debut ""Uri: The Surgical Strike"" starring Vicky, is once again teaming up with the actor.

""Uri"" was an eventful film for the actor-director duo, who went on to win their first National Film Award -- best director for Aditya and best actor for Vicky.

The director, who has begun pre-production work on ""Ashwatthama"", said he scouts for actors who share the same passion and dedication like him.

""My criteria is simple, I require fantastic actors who are ready to give their best and are easy to work with. I don't like people with a lot of baggage and rather those who are simple and straightforward and their agenda is to make a brilliant film,"" Aditya told PTI in an interview here.

""If my priority is Ashwatthama', my actor's priority should also be Ashwatthama'. Vicky fits the character, it was a no-brainer for me because when he is doing a project then nothing else matters to me, he will give his blood and sweat for it, he did that with Uri..'. And he will remain my first choice for all my films,"" he added.

The film, billed as a superhero action film set in modern times, is being planned as a trilogy but Aditya said they will make the third one depending on the response to the first two.

Though the team has cracked the basic idea for all the three parts but they are concentrating on the first one at the moment, he added.

""The film requires a lot of planning because this is something that has never been done before, it is huge. The work is on in terms of writing,"" the director said, adding the team aims to start rolling by year end or early 2021.

Aditya believes spectacle films such as ""The Immortal Ashwatthama"" with a touch of Indian mythology must be served more to the audience.

As per the epic Mahabharata, Ashwatthama was the son of guru Dronacharya, who fought for the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra.

""It was high time we brought such stories to the audience, the kind of fantastic stories we have in our mythology. I wonder why nobody made those into films in so many years. My idea is to create something that is at par with everything that is around the world or Hollywood.""

The director said that Vicky is currently busy prepping for ""Takht"", which will in a way help the actor to work on ""Ashwatthama"".

""It will be unfair for me to tell him to do anything right now related to 'Ashwatthama'. I want him to give his 100 per cent for Takht'. There is a huge prep for our film but I don't want to distract him from Takht'. Once he gets done then he will have to concentrate on our film.""

Besides Vicky, Aditya said the team is looking for a female actor and a villain, who will have well-written arcs.

""It is one of the strongest female characters we have ever seen but we haven't finalised anyone yet, we also have a strong antagonist. We are looking across the spectrum for it, like from the south. Maybe a newcomer, we are keeping our options open,"" he added.

In a genre largely dominated by men, Aditya believes filmmakers must learn from Hollywood action films and create well-rounded characters for women actors.

""Unfortunately, the mistake lies within us, as filmmakers we don't write that many (strong) characters, we need to write it. It is not that they are not capable.

""We see Gal Gadot and we say she is so good at action or Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow' and we say wow', they train and become like that. It is not that difficult.

Produced by Ronnie Screwvala, 'The Immortal Ashwatthama"" will be shot in a start-to-finish schedule, spread across 80 to 90 days, in locations such as Greenland, Iceland, Tokyo, New Zealand and Namibia.

192,05-4-20,"Imran warns Pakistanis aren't immune to threat as COVID-19 cases reach 2,818; death toll at 41","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday warned Pakistanis that they are not immune to the threat posed by the coronavirus, but exuded confidence that Pakistan would emerge stronger from the challenge, as the number of cases in the country rose to 2,818.

Khan's remarks came as he visited Lahore to oversee the measures taken by the Punjab government as the number of coronavirus patients in the largest province of the country crossed 1,000.

Khan visited a 1,000-bed makeshift hospital set up by the provincial government at a short notice to accommodate the coronavirus patients.

Nobody should have the false notion that they will be safe from this (coronavirus)...Look at New York where most of the rich people live, he said.

As of Saturday, Pakistan has recorded 2,818 cases and 41 deaths.

Khan in a blunt warning said that nobody, himself included, knows when the pandemic will end and how much damage it will do.

It (virus) can remerge once settling down. So we don't know what will happen, he said.

He said the government was making all possible efforts to save the people, especially the most vulnerable, and reduce the losses due to epidemic.

When we emerge from this challenge, we will be a totally different nation...Those who take such times as a test and face it head on as a challenge, come out stronger, he said.

Punjab -- the hotspot of the viral infection in Pakistan -- reported a total of 1,131 cases, followed by Sindh at 839, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 383, Balochistan 185, Gilgit-Baltistan 193, Islamabad 75 and 12 cases in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

The data showed that the number of patients in Punjab, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of Pakistan's population, crossed 1,000.

Khan earlier in the day again rejected the possibility of a total lockdown.

Khan tweeted that the government locked down educational institutions, malls, marriage halls, restaurants and other places where public congregates.

But, to stop the devastation of the lockdown we have kept our agri sector open and now we are opening up our construction sector.

In the subcontinent, with a high rate of poverty, we are faced with the stark choice of having to balance between a lockdown necessary to slow down/prevent the spread of COVID19 and ensuring people don't die of hunger and our economy doesn't collapse. So we are walking a tightrope, he said in another tweet.

Khan on Friday mentioned the problems faced by India due to what he called unplanned lockdown.

India is facing dire consequences due to unplanned lockdown. As a sensible strategy is required, we are monitoring the situation daily, Khan said.

The Punjab government announced that it will reopen more industries including textile, sports good, surgical goods, auto parts, leather and leather garments, meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables and pharmaceuticals.

Meanwhile, the Pakistan government on Saturday informed the Supreme Court that the number of coronavirus patients in the country could reach up to 50,000 by the last week of this month.

It was stated in a report submitted by the government on its national action plan for combating the coronavirus epidemic in the country.

Geo News reported that in its report, the government detailed the situation in the wake of the pandemic and the severity of suspected cases.

""By April 25, the number of the coronavirus cases are feared to reach 50,000,"" the report stated.

According to the breakdown provided in the report, around 7,000 cases of the total are expected to be critical in nature while around 2,500 could be a cause of concern. The government estimates that a further 41,000 cases could be of a mild nature.

The report noted that confirmed cases are expected to be lower than that of countries in Europe, and assured that the government is trying to maximize its testing capacity.

The federal government said that it has put in place an emergency plan worth USD 366 million and guidelines have been prepared in consultation from the medical experts.

""All the airports have special counters to monitor coronavirus,"" it mentioned in the report, adding that around 222 suspected patients have been traced due to th entry and exit point checking at airports.

The areas adjacent to Iran and along the Balochistan border have declared an emergency to cope with the incoming infected individuals, it said.

""Preparations were made to place patients in 154 districts under quarantine,"" the government added in the report.

The ministry made slight adjustment in the data from the KP province. Yesterday the ministry had said that there were 383 coronavirus cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. However, it revised the number to 372 in the latest update.

The Pakistan government has taken several measures to curtail the spread of the viral infection, but without much success, officials said.

The National Coordination Committee headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan meets every day to evolve the response to the COVID-19 treat.

The government has also set up a National Command and Operation Centre to implement the decisions made by the committee.

Khan has said that the national policy aimed at slowing down the spread of the disease and opening the economy so that people should have jobs.

Health officials from New South Wales confirmed that there were 2,580 total infections now in the state and four people, including three passengers from Ruby Princess Cruise Ship, died on Saturday night.

During a virus update, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said, ""This is a very dangerous virus and it is still marching through our community. It has killed, at this stage in NSW, 16 people.''

The four men who died include a 91-year-old from Port Macquarie, an 80-year-old and a 76-year-old who were both being treated at Westmead Hospital and a 61-year-old being treated at Hornsby Hospital.

A total of 10 passengers of the Ruby Princess Ship that arrived last month at NSW have died due to COVID-19 and it has been linked to 600 infected cases.

The Ruby Princess Ship is still docked in the waters off Sydney and 250 crew members are awaiting test results.

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said a criminal or coronial investigation will be necessary to determine whether the operators of the Ruby Princess were transparent about ill passengers on board.

He said the 10 deaths linked to the cruise ship so far were a ""significant"" number for one incident.

From my perspective, there are many unanswered questions, and I certainly can't answer those for you today,"" Fuller said.

""There were thousands of witnesses out there who were passengers on the ship, who will have crucial information in relation to their health coming off of the ship, he said, noting records of the captain and doctors would also be investigated.

Fuller said he had received a letter from Carnival, which operates the Ruby Princess, ensuring him they would co-operate in anyway that is necessary.

196,05-4-20,Earth's crust is shaking less as people stay home,"The COVID-19 lockdowns globally have not only made air breathable or rivers clean but have also resulted in the way our Earth moves, as researchers now report a drop in seismic noise (the hum of vibrations in the planets crust) because transport networks, real estate and other human activities have been shut down.

According an article in the journal Nature, efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus mean that the planet itself is moving a little less, which could ""allow detectors to spot smaller earthquakes and boost efforts to monitor volcanic activity and other seismic events"".

Vibrations caused by moving vehicles and industrial machinery produce background noise, which reduces seismologists' ability to detect other signals occurring at the same frequency.

""A noise reduction of this magnitude is usually only experienced briefly around Christmas,"" said Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist with the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels which has observed the drop in seismic noise.

Data from a seismometer at the observatory show that measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Brussels caused human-induced seismic noise to fall by about one-third.

In Belgium, scientists report at least a 30 per cent reduction in that amount of ambient human noise since lockdown began there.

The current drop has boosted the sensitivity of the observatory's equipment, improving its ability to detect waves in the same high frequency range as the noise, said the Nature article.

However, not all seismic monitoring stations will see an effect as pronounced as the one observed in Brussels.

According to Emily Wolin, a geologist at the US Geological Survey in Albuquerque, New Mexico, many stations are purposefully located in remote areas to avoid human noise.

""These should see a smaller decrease, or no change at all, in the level of high-frequency noise they record,"" she was quoted as saying.

The fall in noise could also benefit seismologists who use naturally occurring background vibrations, such as those from crashing ocean waves, to probe Earth's crust.

A fall in human-induced noise could boost the sensitivity of detectors to natural waves at similar frequencies

""There's a big chance indeed it could lead to better measurements,"" said Lecocq.

The reduction in seismic activity, like reduction in air pollution, also show that people are adhering to social distancing guidelines.

""From the seismological point of view, we can motivate people to say, 'OK look, people. You feel like you're alone at home, but we can tell you that everyone is home. Everyone is doing the same. Everyone is respecting the rules,'"" Lecocq told CNN.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/earth-s-crust-is-shaking-less-as-people-stay-home-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/earth-s-crust-is-shaking-less-as-people-stay-home.html

198,05-4-20,"Now, Ministry releases DIY guide for masks","Advises face cover for those living in dense populated areas

Contrary to its earlier assertion that not everyone is required to wear masks as the primary focus is on social distancing, the Union Health Ministry on Saturday came out with a detailed advisory recommending home-made cloth mask for all and even laid out a pictorial “Do It Yourself (DIY)” guide.

It attributed the latest move of homemade face cover for the general public, excluding medical staff/health workers, to the benefits that certain countries have claimed due to its usage.

Wearing of face covers is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas or in crowded markets, as per the advisory which comes amid rising number of coronavirus cases as well as rush among people for masks, aggravating a shortage of the item among medical personnel who need them the most.

The Ministry said that people who are not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover.

“Certain countries have claimed benefits of homemade face cover for the general public. Such homemade face cover is a good method for maintaining personal hygiene. Such usage certainly will help in maintaining overall hygienic health conditions.

“Therefore, it is suggested that such people who are not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house. This will help in protecting the community at large,” it said.

“This face cover is not recommended for either health workers or those working with or in contact with COVID-19 patients or are patients themselves as these categories of people are required to wear specified protective gear”.

The advisory says the face covers could be made out of clean cloth available at home, which needs to be thoroughly cleaned and washed before a face cover is stitched.

“The face cover should be prepared in such a manner that it can cover the mouth and nose completely and can be tied over the face easily”. It is advised that two sets of such face covers be made so that one can be washed while the other is used.

“Hand washing would still remain essential criteria and hand should be washed before wearing the face cover. Such face covers should also not be thrown anywhere but kept safely, washed properly with soap and hot water and dried properly before they are used,” the guideline said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/now--ministry-releases-diy-guide-for-masks-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/now--ministry-releases-diy-guide-for-masks.html

Four of the latest cases were from a JJ cluster in Sector 5, one from Wazidpur village in Sector 135 and three from Sector 62 in Noida, they added.

The source of the infection for at least four patients was traced back to private firm Cease Fire, which is already under government scanner for triggering a chain of cases and has been booked for endangering people's lives, the officials said.

""A total of 804 samples have been sent for the COVID-19 test from Gautam Buddh Nagar so far, of which 58 have tested positive, 614 negative and the results of the remaining are awaited,"" the health department here stated in its daily statement.

Eight persons were cured and discharged from hospitals while the number of active cases stood at 52, the department said.

Currently, 1,129 people are under surveillance across Noida and Greater Noida, while another 331 have been quarantined -- 69 in a Gautam Buddh University hostel and the rest in special isolation facilities at hospitals in Noida and Greater Noida -- it added.

""District Magistrate Suhas L Y has directed administration officials to ensure a temporary sealing of the sector and village concerned in the wake of the COVID-19 detection as per protocol for a period of 48 hours,"" a statement from the administration said.

According to officials, the new case from Wazidpur in Sector 135 is a 32-year-old man, who works in Cease Fire.

Three more cases were detected in Sector 62 -- the wife (48) and two children (aged 10 and 13 years) of a man who also works for the now-sealed Cease Fire.

The man, however, has tested negative for the virus, officials said.

Details of the four new cases from the JJ cluster in Sector 5 are awaited.

200,05-4-20,"Masks, screening health status, social distancing: Railways prepares for post-lockdown services","From encouraging social-distancing on board to asking passengers to wear face masks and using the Arogya Setu app to check their health status before letting them in, the Railways is mulling over several proposals for its post-lockdown operations.

While no decision has yet been taken on when the passenger services, which were suspended in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown from March 25, will be resumed, officials said it is likely to be done in a phased manner after a green signal from the government.

A decision, officials said, is likely to be taken in the coming week on how to restore services.

They said the railways has discussed the option of resuming services only on specific approval of each train from the Railway Board. Suggestions on phase-wise resumption have to be provided by the zone to the board.

""These are sensitive times and we are not looking in terms of revenue generation for now. The focus is on passenger safety and to ensure that the disease does not spread. Trains will run in due course, once the government gives us the green signal. However as of now, we have not taken any decision,” said a senior officer.

In the zones, officials are also identifying trains and routes which can be resumed with the approval of the board. The focus, say officials, is to see if routes catering to migrant workers can be resumed initially and also those that are not travelling or has halts at COVID-19 hotspots.

Officials added that the railways will also have to factor in how the lockdown is eventually opened. If it is selective, then trains will only run in areas where lockdown is lifted, officials said.

The Railways is also unlikely to rescind a March 19 order suspending all concessions for passengers except those offered to patients, students and people with disabilities in a hurry, even after the lockdown period to discourage unnecessary travel.

The Railways, officials said, are also discussing protocols that need to be followed once services begin to ensure safety of passengers. They are mulling options like thermal screening and other methods to scan passengers boarding trains.

""Once the services are resumed, we are thinking of requesting passengers to wear masks as per the health ministry advisory. We are also thinking of using the Arogya app to check the health and wellness of patients and allow only healthy passengers to board trains,” an official said.

As part of its preparedness, the Railways has also asked zones to ensure the security of coaches parked in depots.

Officials said once the services resume full throttle, they expect overcrowding at stations and measures have to be chalked out on how to deal with them.

The focus now for Railways, the officials said, is to ensure that the rakes of passenger trains, which were suspended due to the lockdown, had returned to their respective bases, received proper maintenance like charging of batteries, cleaning of bio-toilets, and were ready to return on the tracks once the resumption is announced.

Officials also said Railway Minister Piyush Goyal is keen that the railways concentrate on ensuring that the different zones continue their efforts towards contributing in the larger fight against coronavirus.

Railway PSUs have already committed to converting around 5000 coaches as isolation wards initially which are likely to be sent in rural areas that do not have hospitals.

The Railways has also offered its hospitals for infected patients and are producing essential medical goods like masks, sanitisers, PPEs.

The minister has given instructions that proper planning should be done for cleaning of linens, sanitation and proper disposal of biomedical waste that is expected to be generated at hospitals and isolation coaches.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/masks--screening-health-status--social-distancing--railways-prepares-for-post-lockdown-services-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/masks--screening-health-status--social-distancing--railways-prepares-for-post-lockdown-services.html

202,05-4-20,Summer temperature won't help contain coronavirus: WHO,"Though many experts have expressed optimism towards the onset of summer in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Sunday said high temperature would not finish the virus.

The WHO, in a series of tweets, busted several myths about coronavirus, especially regarding rise in temperature.

""Exposing yourself to sun or to temperatures higher than 25 degree Celsius doesn't prevent Covid-19. You can catch Covid-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is,"" the WHO said.

Stating that countries having higher temperature didn't remain unaffected, it said the only way to be safe was to ensure hygiene. ""Countries with hot weather have also reported Covid-19 cases. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose,"" the WHO said.

The WHO said drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach wouldn't prevent or cure Covid-19 and could be extremely dangerous, as these were used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces. ""If consumed, they will not kill the virus in the body, but will harm internal organs,"" it said.

Also drinking alcohol was no protection against coronavirus, it said and added, frequent or excessive liquor consumption could increase risk of health problems.

On myth around holding breath for a few minutes to check coronavirus, the WHO said, ""Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort doesn't mean you are free from the coronavirus or any other lung disease.""

The best way to confirm about the disease was laboratory test. ""You can't confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous,"" said the WHO.

They said the government has limited resources and hence ICU wards, beds and other facilities of private hospitals can be used to deal with the increasing numbers of coronavirus cases.

""In government hospitals, medical treatment to other disease-related patients can not be stopped. In view of this, private hospitals can be engaged for the same,"" a source said.

Officials have been asked to prepare a list of private hospitals that can be taken over if needed.

""In a recent meeting, the LG directed officials to prepare a list of private hospitals which can be taken over by government in case a need arises and their infrastructure can be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The government will provide treatment to coronavirus patients admitted at these hospitals,"" a source said.

Of the 3,374 COVID-19 cases reported in the country till Sunday morning, Delhi accounted for the third-highest number of cases at 445, after Maharashtra (490) and Tamil Nadu (485).

210,05-4-20,Rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases 4.1 days; without Jamaat incident it would have been 7.4: Govt,"The rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases in India is 4.1 days presently but if the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation would not have happened, it would have been 7.4 days, the Health Ministry said on Sunday.

Joint Secretary in the ministry Lav Agarwal said there had been 472 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths since Saturday. The total coronavirus cases stand at 3,374 and the death toll now stands at 79.

He said 267 people have recovered.

However, a PTI tally of figures reported by states directly showed at least 106 deaths, while the number of confirmed cases had reached 3,624. Of the total, 284 have been cured and discharged.

There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the numbers announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

Asserting that there was no evidence that COVID-19 was airborne, an ICMR official said, ""We need to understand that in science whoever does experiments some will have a 'for opinion and some against' but we need to take a balanced, evidence-based approach.”

""For example, if it was an air-borne infection then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in hospital, other patient would have got exposure (if it was air borne) but that is not the case,” the official said.

Talking about the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, Agarwal said, ""If the Tablighi Jamaat incident had not taken place and we compare the rate of doubling — that is in how many days the cases have doubled, we will see that currently it is 4.1 days (including Jamaat cases) and if the incident had not taken place and additional cases had not come then the doubling rate would have been 7.4 days.""

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Sunday held a meeting on COVID-19 with district magistrates, superintendent of police, chief medical officers, state and district surveillance officers, state health secretaries and district health secretaries and chief secretaries, Agarwal said.

District officials shared the strategies adopted by them to combat the pandemic like how they delineated containment and buffer zone, how they carried out door-to-door survey through special teams, how through telemedicine and call centres the passengers who had come were monitored.

The districts from where many cases were reported like Agra, Bhilwada, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Pathan Mitha, East Delhi also shared their experiences and strategies adopted by them.

The main points that came from the experience shared by districts were proactive and ruthless containment implementation at field level and second is preparedness to the extent of being over prepared so that cases can be handled at any stage, Agarwal said.

All DMs were instructed pharma units making devices and medicines must run seamlessly, he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rate-of-doubling-of-covid-19-cases-4-1-days--without-jamaat-incident-it-would-have-been-7-4--govt-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/rate-of-doubling-of-covid-19-cases-4-1-days--without-jamaat-incident-it-would-have-been-7-4--govt.html
