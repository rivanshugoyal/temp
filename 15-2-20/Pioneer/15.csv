0,15-2-20,The price of politics,"Jammu has always guarded India with its blood. To imply that it can only be recognised at the cost of Kashmir is to further diminish the Dogra identity and nobility of yesteryears

Post-independence, public imagination, political passions and administrative prioritisation in the “Crown of India” were fronted by the Kashmir Valley, followed by the uber-strategic Ladakh (literally, the “land of the passes”) and thereafter by the Duggar Jammu region. This hierarchy of importance was recalibrated in the revised status of the Union Territory (UT) to retain “normalcy” in the Valley (the foremost concern), address the Kashmiri Pandit issue (a matter of urgency) and relegate the Jammu region (the last priority). This hierarchy sustains still. This continued diminishment of the erstwhile land of the Dogra Kingdom in the pre-independence era, which held sway in swathes of Jammu & Kashmir, including Ladakh and expansive reaches of Western Tibet, Hunza, Gilgit-Baltistan and Nagar, is an ironic turn of fate. The largest princely State in the British Raj to accede to the dominion of India is a forgotten and twisted footnote in history. As a corollary price paid for delayed accession, it was deliberately suppressed by new political forces and impulses, which were wholeheartedly endorsed by “New Delhi”, to decrement the Jammu region.

If Pakistan was externally vilified for its role in the first Kashmir War of 1947-48, internally, Maharaj Hari Singh was conveniently painted as the dilly-dallying monarch under whose rule a situation was allowed to develop. Allowing such a narrative facilitated independent India’s first public rejection of the abhorred two-nation theory when political forces from Kashmir were allowed to systematically dismantle the primacy of “Jammu” and thereby ride the moral high horse of a democratic and non-discriminating “India.” Unnecessary allusion of “plebiscite” was a further display of ostensible statesmanship that sought to demonstrate fair-play for Kashmir but at the cost of “Jammu” sensitivities as contextualised to the fate of former Dogra royals. The Maharaja was forced into abdication and died a broken man. Jammu had no voice in Delhi to argue for its rightful share in India’s immediate aspirations. The iron-fencing of Article 370 predicated Jammu’s fate within the overall pie of Jammu & Kashmir, whereas within the State itself, Kashmir emerged as the epicenter of all subsequent focus.

Two distinct dynamics dominated the State’s affairs. First, the political machinations surrounding Sheikh Abdullah’s ambitions and his oft-competing relations with “Delhi”, which led to a cat-and-mouse game of outwitting each other. Here, “Jammu” played an insignificant role of a supporting cast. Second, from the national perception of the Indian citizenry, the recurring wars (1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999) and the armed insurgency (early 1990s onwards) kept the lens firmly on Kashmir and at best on safeguarding Ladakh, which holds out proudly in the face of Pakistani-Chinese dimensions. Even though there’s a perennial strategic vulnerability in the “chicken’s neck” of the Sambha-Pathankot corridor of Jammu region, which hosted one of the fiercest tank battles in combat history, it remains solely a matter of military records. This is rarely appreciated in the same breath as the other “chicken’s neck” in the Siliguri corridor. Recognising this threat perception, the Jammu region is littered with garrison towns in virtual rows to safeguard the “integrity” and “sovereignty” of India. It has done so since time immemorial. It remains the first in line of defence against foreign invasions and marauders.

This institutionalised task of burying Jammu’s sense of purpose, relevance and sensitivities simmers in the region, though this remains consistently unaddressed. The socio-cultural debasement soon assumed political-religious undertones that got coined as the “Jammu-Srinagar divide.” While such simplistic “divides” served an invaluable purpose for peddling partisan politics, they do incalculable harm in further distorting the secular, multi-cultural and glorious traditions of the Dogra Kingdom.

The Jammu region itself is not a homogeneous composition. Reducing it to a “Hindu” identity militates against the profound reality of the Dogra rulers, whose progressive moorings, culturalised secularism, equality and various other societal freedoms got enshrined in the Constitution.

The 10 districts of Jammu region host a religio-ethnic-cultural diversity that epitomises the majesty and travesty of “India” in equal measure — the region hosts the Dogra Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims (distinct from Muslims in the Valley) with their own distinctions as also the nomadic Gujjar-Bakarwal tribes that were in the news for the horrific rape case of a little girl in Kathua. The reductive oversimplification of the “Jammu-Srinagar divide” afforded a factually wrong communal attribution on perceptions even though the Gujjar and the Bakarwals are ethnically distinct from the Kashmiri Muslims. Sadly, Jammu’s unheard frustrations morphed into assuming an unwarranted and communally binary reaction.

The societal, multi-cultural and martial traditions of the Jammu region and history are unmatched and unrecognised outside the realm of the Indian armed forces and the people of Jammu themselves. Tellingly, Dogra soldiers are known as “gentleman soldiers” owing to their finest soldiering instincts, ethos and bearing that behoves civilisational sophistication. Not only does the region populate regiments like the Dogras, Jammu & Kashmir Rifles, Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry, Punjab and many others — unbeknownst to a larger India — it also has the highest number of gallantry awardees in service of the nation. This would undoubtedly accrue to the composite Dogra identities. Jammu’s dignified silence and sacrifice — in allowing the more pressing fires in Kashmir to take the centrestage and the abandonment by unscrupulous politicians of all parties — has left it to be conveniently ignored and taken for granted.

The wholly political exercise of abrogating Article 370 and the looming delimitation exercise in the UT was received with latent and instinctive excitement in Jammu but that mirage has given way to despondency again. If anything, it has only strengthened the historically-irrelevant “Jammu-Srinagar divide” and carved out space for political harvest, nothing more.

Jammu needs historical acknowledgement and correction besides development. All of this needs national intent and not necessarily more legislative members (though that helps, too) as that is again a political minefield. Jammu has always guarded India with its blood and to imply that it can only be recognised at the cost of Kashmir is further diminishing of the Dogra identity and nobility of yesteryears and shortchanging it politically, yet again.

1,15-2-20,Total disclosure,"SC has asked parties to publicise details of criminal charges against candidates. But without a law, will the shaming work?

The Supreme Court has held the mirror to political parties many times in a bid to decriminalise our legislature but every election just compounds the problem with them showing no serious intent to comply. So the number of MPs with criminal cases pending against them has gone up from 24 per cent in 2004 to 43 per cent in 2019. This despite its ruling of September 2018, when a five-judge Constitution Bench had held that all candidates would have to declare their criminal antecedents to the Election Commission (EC) before contesting polls and had called for a wider publicity of their records, through print and electronic media. It had even asked Parliament to formulate a law to ensure that criminals are disbarred so that the “polluted stream of politics” is cleansed. Quite exasperatedly, therefore, this time, reacting to a contempt plea, the court has struck hard, involving the polity as a whole in objectively assessing a candidate’s worth. It has asked all political parties to publicise full details, not just winnability, of tainted candidates, during Central and State elections, on traditional and digital media. Parties, too, now have to list the nature of the charges against a tainted candidate and clarify why then they had chosen to give a ticket to him/her. They have to send a compliance report to the EC within a specified time period — 48 hours post-selection or two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever is earlier. Any violation would be considered contempt of court. In a sense, the court is also nudging the electorate, asking it to take a measured call. And by asking parties to list reasons why they have chosen a tainted name as their worthy bet, it is putting the onus on them to expose their hypocrisy and subject themselves to public scrutiny.

The State Assemblies are no better when it comes to legislators with criminal backgrounds. In the just-concluded Delhi polls, the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) found that more than half the candidates had a black book. In 2020, 43 MLAs declared criminal cases against them while in 2015, that figure was 24. The number of MLAs with serious criminal cases, including rape, attempt to murder and crimes against women, is 37. The last is the most heinous, considering most lawmakers use their political patronage, given their indispensability in managing local cadres and units, to get themselves off the hook. The recent examples of rape survivors being bullied into political submission are all too many. Both BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar and former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand have used their political clout to abuse women and stave off repercussions on their political careers for years. The ADR report says that 76 lawmakers across the country have declared cases related to crimes against women. In the last five years, 572 such candidates have contested Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Assembly elections. From 2009 to 2019, there has been a 231 per cent spike in the number of errant candidates contesting the Lok Sabha elections. For the same period, the number of offender MPs has increased by 850 per cent. This phenomenon cuts across party lines, each of which is guilty of ignoring crimes as a liability of its candidates. Worse, whenever they have won, they have been further rewarded or entrusted with a bigger political role. Even on the day of the verdict, Anand Singh, an accused in mining and forest crime cases, was appointed as the new environment minister in Karnataka. Will full disclosure, therefore, serve much of a purpose as most voters have developed the habit of choosing a known evil for the sake of their representative worth in their lives? Besides, given the heft of such leaders in matters local, most constituents are too intimidated to exercise their choice in an impartial manner. Till they are assured that such nominees are punished, nothing can change. What then is the way forward? Although the EC has been given additional powers to punish candidates who file false or misleading financial disclosures, nothing can be effective without disclosure of political contributions. It must insist on independently-audited party accounts. Experts have suggested linking political party registration and tax benefits to basic democratic and transparency standards and creating a new legal mechanism to adjudicate cases of accused MLAs and MPs. But in the end, it depends on the political will of the Legislature and the Executive to push for a binding law. Even now, Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, bans convicted politicians from contesting. However, those facing trial, no matter how serious the charges, can still contest. So beyond the court making a moral call, the parties hold the power to change themselves.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/total-disclosure-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/total-disclosure.html
2,15-2-20,Tough job on hot seat,"Two Indian-origin Ministers are holding two of the most powerful offices in the UK. Their tasks are not easy though

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson may have been mocked by the liberal British media but his huge victory in the last general election has put the implementation of Brexit front and centre of his to-do list. Two of the core agenda of Brexit and one reason why the British voted to leave the European Union (EU) are “immigration” and “financial policy.” This is why Johnson has tapped two Indian-origin members from his party to deliver on both fronts. Priti Patel has been the Home Secretary (Minister) for a while but in a stunning announcement this week, Johnson appointed Rishi Sunak as his Chancellor, or Finance Minister in Indian lingo. Most Indians feel Sunak’s claim to fame comes from the fact that he is Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy’s son-in-law but he has always been highly regarded inside the Conservative Party establishment. He was also former Chancellor Sajid Javid’s right hand man. At 39, he is the second-youngest man to take on the job in modern times, the youngest being George Osborne, who, with former British Prime Minister David Cameron, was the architect of the disastrous Brexit referendum that set in motion the political chaos that has engulfed the UK. Sunak has not been given unfettered powers as Johnson and his team will control the show. This is the reason why Javid resigned. However, Sunak has a hard task ahead given that he will have to draft Britain’s first Brexit Budget and present it within the next few weeks. This will not be easy with negotiations between London and Brussels taking longer than expected. The ongoing global economic contagion has been made worse by the actual contagion in China right now. Sunak may be a bright spark but his job ahead to convince companies to come and invest in Britain and not run away — as in the current state of affairs with financial institutions and manufacturers both looking at options on the continent — will be a tough one.

He should also be aware that Johnson, like several other charismatic leaders of nativist movements across the world, is not someone who takes the blame. While getting a big job, Sunak must not become the scapegoat tomorrow. That said, the rise into positions of prominence for Indian-origin Britons is a matter of pride. Indians are in prominent positions across the political spectrum in the UK and are a model immigrant community. The Indian Government should continue to engage with them and ensure that Indo-British ties improve even further.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tough-job-on-hot-seat-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/tough-job-on-hot-seat.html
3,15-2-20,He lit a billion lives,"Nobel laureate and an authority on sustainable development and climate change, RK Pachauri has set the template for our continuity in climate-challenged times. A long-time columnist of The Pioneer, here are extracts from some of his recommendations made in these pages. We will miss him

RK Pachauri, former Chairman of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), who passed away on February 13, was India’s pre-eminent expert on sustainable development, climate change and environment. He received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for raising awareness on the issue. During his eminent career, he also served as a member of the Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change that was constituted in 2007. India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change was finalised in 2008 under his advice and he was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the country’s third and second-highest civilian awards, respectively.

Pachauri assumed responsibilities as TERI’s Chief Executive in 1981 and led the institute for more than three decades. He had become synonymous with TERI before he demitted office as the Executive Vice-Chairman in March 2016. One of his flagship projects, Lighting a Billion Lives, that began with distributing solar-powered lamps to rural homes in remote parts of the country that did not have access to grid electricity, resulted in lighting homes in 12 countries. Pachauri was a regular contributor to The Pioneer and here are a few excerpts of his articles that we are publishing as a tribute to the environmental crusader:

Blowing in the wind: (Published January 8)

Wind energy can not only help achieve a sustainable future but also meet economic and social objectives. India must make the best use of this opportunity. Recent developments, with the US having targetted an Iranian General located in Baghdad, would lead to a hardening of global oil prices. There is a valid fear that any further escalation of conflict in the Middle-East could lead to further price increases, which would impact unfavourably on India’s already unsatisfactory rate of economic growth. Earlier concerns related to energy security and the objectives of bringing about energy independence appear to have been given low priority as a result of a glut in the global oil market in recent years. At the same time, the negative externalities of coal production and consumption remain understated, with an expansion of supply, essentially to maintain coal as the major fuel for power generation in this country. There is a need, therefore, to articulate a long-term renewable energy strategy, which would also meet the objectives of the Government’s “Make in India” initiative. Wind energy developments will be an excellent candidate not only for India to achieve a sustainable energy scenario in the future but also as a means to meet a large range of economic and social objectives. It is inevitable that the world would move away from fossil fuels largely for mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions, which are resulting in climate change world over. Hence, there would be a growing demand and a major market opportunity for nations, which innovate and produce equipment for harnessing renewable sources of energy. India has a growing opportunity to play a role in this market.

Preventable reality: (Published January 22)

The comprehensive listing of threats that can emerge this year, published by the Astana Club, is specific to Eurasian countries but has lessons for the entire world. With respect to climate change, we need to come up with scenarios on how we may be able to bring about a transition from fossil fuels to low carbon sources of energy. Far more immediate is the issue of impacts of climate change, which would pose increasing risks across the globe. Projections of extreme events, which the IPCC had clearly brought out 11 years ago, is the increase in intensity and frequency of disasters and extreme events. A typical but unfortunate example of this is provided by the raging forest fires, which recently affected several parts of Australia, followed immediately by extreme precipitation events which led to flooding and excessive damage. All in all, it is important that the Astana Club has come up with a comprehensive listing of threats, which can emerge during 2020 and, therefore, extending into this decade as a whole. Kazakhstan and several Eurasian countries may lie beyond the Himalayan range but in terms of proximity, they are in some cases very close to us in terms of geographical distance. India should, perhaps, engage far more closely with countries of the region and exercise its soft power, including the flow of knowledge, education and research on issues that have a bearing on the region. The threats for Eurasia apply equally to India as well.

Anatomy of a heat shield: (Published January 21, 2019)

The impact of climate change would leave a large part of the population vulnerable in India. It needs to develop its industrial strengths in a technology of the future. It is important to remember that for India as a society, the impacts of climate change would leave a large part of the population vulnerable. If global action is neglected, in which India has high stakes, then we cannot blame others as a nation, which many developed countries have been responsible for as a measure of neglect for much too long. In particular, quite apart from the economic merits of large-scale renewable energy production, which the Government of India has now committed itself to, what is perhaps of even greater priority is to electrify those villages which are as yet un-electrified, and which may have major constraints in supply of grid based power. The TERI launched a major programme in 2008 called “Lighting a Billion Lives,” which focussed on the provision of lighting in the homes of these villages, using renewable energy, mainly through supply of PV based power. India had a great opportunity to not only complete this task within its own borders, but perhaps make the experience available to homes in Africa and other parts of the developing world. There is, of course, a significant benefit in exploiting economies of scale both through an approach such as the programme on “Lighting a Billion Lives” as well as large-scale supply of grid-based power using renewables.

India can become a leader in mitigation of emissions of GHGs and set a path for growth with significantly low carbon emissions. It may thus develop its industrial strengths in a technology of the future, with significant commercial benefits and reach across other regions of the world. This, of course, would also have major implications for action at the global level for meeting the provisions of the Paris agreement and maintaining the limit of 1.5 °C.

In the worst of times: (Published April 3, 2019)

It is necessary for national governments to put in place safety measures so that vulnerable sections can be protected from the ill-effects of a downturn in economic activity. When Charles Dickens wrote the following lines for his epic creation, A Tale of Two Cities, he obviously gave expression to the state of society as it existed in that period: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity...”. If the same author were to write similar lines today, it is likely that he would drop the words “best of times”, given the extent of uncertainty and the lack of “feel good” that we see before us. Perhaps every generation feels some helplessness at what they perceive as the decline in standards, opportunities — and most importantly, hope — in comparison with yesteryear. Yet, today, the confusion that defines global affairs and the state of the world seems more compelling in mapping the human condition as, say, in comparison with what existed just a few years ago. The global economy has reached unprecedented levels, which should normally have resulted in the elimination of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, and a reduction in inequalities but the growing difference between the richest members of society and those at the bottom rung has never been sharper than it is today.

Leaders with hubris: (Published April 17, 2019)

A large number of leaders, both at the global and the national levels, today appear to be victims of self-pride when they should be more humble and modest personalities. The question is whether these leaders are seen by their followers as larger than life and measuring up to the dimensions of a superman, to be idealised and admired by them. It is hoped that distinguished leaders in the future would show a certain level of humility and shed the hubris that they appear to have acquired in recent years. It is relevant to recall that the brightest scientist in history Albert Einstein is reported to have said, “I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.” Could it, therefore, be that those leaders with hubris lack an intellectual understanding of their own being and most certainly that of nature, which takes the form of remoteness from reality and basic humility? We urgently need leaders in this mould before those with hubris can impose untold harm on society and distort the finest attributes of human nature. But in recent times, leaders with hubris have strutted the stage in the US, the UK, the Philippines, Indonesia and many other countries. Will they be succeeded by more humble and modest personalities?

The desecration of democracy: (Published January 21, 2019)

The gun control issue and opposition to restrictions on tobacco use are symptomatic of how democracy is being desecrated by abandoning our responsibilities towards the welfare of the people. As the world’s largest democracy, it is important for India to learn the lessons from the flaws and distortions of other countries, such as the US, or else we would also become major desecraters of democracy with devastating consequences. The one ray of light which appears now is the enormous effort being made by the youth of the school in Parkland, Florida, where a shooting spree took place. It is particularly important that they use their moral power to not only influence the state legislature and the Governor of Florida, but also create public opinion for action to introduce gun control. It is important that on all such issues, whether it is banning of tobacco consumption or action to deal with climate change, youth power should come to the fore. It is after all their future which is at serious risk, and clearly it is for them to take leadership, as indeed they are doing with the authorities in Florida. If the current tragedy leads to youth succeeding in imposition of gun control, then perhaps such carnage won’t happen.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/he-lit-a-billion-lives-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/he-lit-a-billion-lives.html
4,15-2-20,People still vote for rozi-roti,"The future would belong to anyone who can chart out welfare economics with lower taxes and improved living standards

In the just-concluded Delhi Assembly elections, the people voted for development and survival. The mandate is a reflection of their daily struggles and hardships. The welfare measures undertaken by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government have touched the middle class and the poor, particularly the unorganised working class, who cannot afford a ride on the Delhi Metro or the expensive power and hospital bills. The AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal touched a chord and presented a soft, people-friendly accessible face. “The poor and the middle class voted for him,” aver many BJP campaigners, though the party did see a vote surge as it largely cashed in on the Congress votes that split between it and the AAP. The Delhi BJP’s hope that a stronger Congress would help split AAP votes was belied as the grand old party preferred an AAP victory even at the cost of its own annihilation. Many see it as a strategy of the Congress for a future Opposition alliance. As per the Delhi BJP’s assessment, a small percentage of elite Congress voters opted for it and the poor and minorities went to the AAP.

It has the BJP poll managers in West Bengal worried as the State is scheduled to go to the polls in early 2021. While State party chief Dilip Ghosh wants to play hard on identity politics, the more moderate voices in the party want “ideological issues supplemented by a solid governance agenda and also a chief ministerial face.” The moderates have perhaps read the people’s minds as the common man in the country still votes for core issues of livelihood, health and education. This is what has given Kejriwal his victory. The Shaheen Bagh-type anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests also need to be read as an expression against the discomforting identity politics that has unnerved the people. Then there is the larger issue of the economy. The hike of Rs 145 in LPG prices possibly confirms their fears. Many BJP workers echo that sentiment. The BJP was voted to power with great expectations and was expected to chart out a new economics. Somehow, along the way, it compromised its basic pro-people manifesto.

Interestingly, despite that, the BJP’s key leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, still rules the hearts and minds of the people. This was evident even during the campaigning ahead of Delhi elections. The people want him but as many Delhi poor say, he needs to care more for them and ease taxes, rail fares, bank charges, toll rates, increase interest rates on deposits and give them a people-friendly Budget. For Delhiites, Kejriwal signifies that much-needed relief. Even though these issues were not verbalised during the poll but if one moved around the city — whether in the posh Connaught Place area, the nondescript Madangiri or vocal Shaheen Bagh — the people were not as afraid of the CAA as they were of the rising cost of living, food and shelter.

Yes, Delhiites discussed more about the Consumer Price Index inflation, which spiked to 7.59 per cent in January against 7.35 per cent in December. The latest LPG price rise has also led many within the BJP to rue the subsidies they willingly gave up to a national call. In times of a wobbling economy, even a few hundred rupees saved — like Kejriwal’s subsidies on electricity, water and education — matter. It has led to another discussion on whether the Government should have the right to raise commodity prices and rail fares or should it even control the public sector. Even shadow BJP organisations, not just the Left, discuss whether like the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, there should be a law binding all Governments to keep off public sector organisations, including the RBI, the LIC, Air India, BPCL and so on. There are even questions on why a private player like Reliance Petroleum should sell its stake to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco. It is a national issue and the private sector is also considered a national asset by the people who are discussing economic nationalism.

Political parties need to understand what shapes Indian politics. They praised the BJP for punishing Pakistan after the Pulwama terrorist attack but now they are more concerned about their own economic safety. Political parties need to articulate that. Kejriwal is tactfully smart. He skillfully avoided an identity trap and made the voter choose performance over animosity. The future of Indian politics does not make the BJP weaker. Its core ground remains intact and polarisation is sharp. It has to deliberate whether to ride that horse alone or also have core people-friendly economic decoratives. The Opposition, howsoever united, needs to worry more. It has not given any ideological or economic narrative. The future would belong to anyone who can chart out welfare economics with lower taxes/fares, a strong balance sheet and improved living standards, in short, happiness for all. Politicians need to understand that India is waiting for that beautiful day.

5,15-2-20,Who will seed organic India?,"Indian food exports to the EU and the USA are rejected due to toxic residues found even in certified organic produce. This can only be corrected once the whole organic supply chain, seed to produce, is developed and there are no gaps in between

The Union Budget 2020 on agriculture sends one very clear message: The Modi Government is committed to sustainable agriculture. Through poetry, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spelled out a plan to increase the area under organic farming to four lakh hectares by 2020-21. Under the Green revolution budget, the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (CSS) has been allotted Rs 500 crore for increased coverage of the area under organic certification and additionally has got 0.51 lakh hectares (Ha) for organic certification.

In total, the Government has given Rs 687.5 crore through three schemes to promote agro-ecological farming in the country. Not only would this increase the production of more organic food for local consumption and exports but it would also ensure that India strides towards sustainability and climate mitigation.

On the export front, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) approximated Indian organic exports at Rs 5,151 crore in 2018-19, a 49 per cent jump from 2017-19.

Other commendable steps announced by the Finance Minister to ensure that agro-ecological practices return to Indian farms were the creation of an online portal on jaivik kheti to bolster the organic market and the village storage scheme to empower Dhaanya Lakshmi. All these steps are consistent with Piyush Goyal’s Budget Speech of 2019, which made organic food production the eighth dimension of the Modi Government’s vision for 2030.

The current Budget is also in line with the BJP’s manifesto promise and comes as a relief to millions of sententious environmentally-conscious consumers and swadeshi supporters alike.

Meanwhile the APEDA projects organic export to increase to $50 billion by 2025. However, many veterans of the organic and grain sector wonder who will seed organic India? Do we even have enough certified organic seeds? Exports of this magnitude can’t rely on landraces or traditional varieties of grain alone. We need more efficient mechanisms for breeding organic seeds to support this growth. Indian farmers need superior quality even in organic grain to sustain this boom.

Four lakh hectares are a humongous area. To put things in perspective, one hectare is roughly the size of two football fields. So imagine about 7,50,000 football fields, spread across India. Many of these areas are in the remote parts of the country and inaccessible to the formal seed sector.

While most people in India, including farmers, confuse untreated seeds (pre-soaked in fungicide or chemicals) as organic, the fact remains that they are misinformed.

A seed can only be called organic if it is grown in organic soils with agro-ecological practices and an organic certificate. And truth be told, the options of buying high performing organic grain are very limited as the organic seed industry is still very primitive when compared to the competitive and research and development-based industry of the USA or Germany.

With the emergence of greater demand for organic food, regulations and standards will only become stricter. The consensus between all organic certification mechanisms is that all seeds used to grow organic foods need to be certified too.

The current level of the technology enables organic certifying agencies to trace residues in the seed. And further, this may be a critical point in the future of organic trade, especially to the EU and the US.

Even today Indian food exported to the EU and the USA are rejected at respective ports, due to toxic residues found even in certified organic produce. This can only be corrected once seed to the final produce, in fact the whole organic supply chain, is developed and there are no gaps anywhere in between.

As per reports, the global organic seed market will be worth $5.4 billion by 2024. Hence, India needs to swerve towards not just more organic food yields but also become an organic seed production hub.

The Government and plant breeders should create a policy for organic seed production in consultation with global certifying agencies and so on. This may be followed by a push to create organic seed production clusters in Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal and the North-eastern States. Sikkim, an organic State, can be most suitable for this endeavour. The Union Budget needs to have a special concession for tax breaks and easier land leasing terms in organic zones to have a discernible effect on the incomes of farmers and plant breeders.

India, especially in the biodiversity-rich zones, is a treasure trove for seed production. By harmoniously working with nature, farmers can produce greater yields and resistance in their seeds, while also conserving water and their habitats. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), through a novel programme and perhaps some funding from the Government, can encourage organic seed entrepreneurs in these zones.

Other organisations such as Biodiversity International, ICAR and State agricultural universities can strengthen this drive. New modules need to be created for advanced levels of evolutionary participatory breeding (EPB) that are available to plant breeders and farmers in regional languages. This programme should be implemented with the assistance of the Government. Food Production Organisations can play an important role, too, in this.

To sum up, the Modi Government must prepare to remove any impediments to make India the largest exporter of organic food. Organic seeds are not only vital for this vision but if pursued with determination, may fulfil the Government’s aim of increasing seed exports to 10 per cent and enrich Indian farmers four times over. The question only remains, will India make hay when the sun shines on Indian organic produce or nip the budding organic seed sector?

7,15-2-20,DCs directed to prioritize development,"Days after Delhi gave mandate in favour of Aam Aadmi Party Government for its “development works”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday asked all the Deputy Commissioners to prioritize the core sectors of education, health, power and water for ensuring quality of life of citizens across the State.

Capt Amarinder, chairing a meeting of all DCs, directed them to go for extensive monitoring of various development and welfare schemes related to these focus sectors to ensure strict implementation of such programmes.

The Chief Minister also asked the DCs to tighten their belts to push development and welfare projects to fulfill the people’s aspirations in line with the Government’s development agenda for the State.

At the same time, he made it clear that respect for elected representatives is a must in democracy, and asked them to be courteous in their dealings and give due respect to the legislators to ensure overall development.

To ensure smooth delivery of citizen-centric services, the Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioners to personally keep close tabs on the functioning of Sewa Kendras in order to curtail the pendency of applications for seeking various citizen services.

The Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Governance Reforms, Vini Mahajan informed the meeting that 515 sewa kendras were functioning in the State, with a pendency of 42,261 against 2,60,4975 applications received from all the districts. She also pointed out Sewa Kendras projects, under the current service delivery model, were self-sustainable and there was no burden on the Finance Department.

On the issue of drugs, the Chief Minister expressed satisfaction over the results so far, and the resultant perceptible decrease in the number of drug users and huge seizure of drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as the arrest of several drug peddlers and smugglers.

However, the Chief Minister further asked the DCs not to be complacent in this regard and work in tandem with the Special Task Force (STF), District Police, and the Health Department to achieve better results to eliminate the scourge of drugs, as well as to rehabilitate the drug addicts.

Taking serious note of electricity theft in the border areas, especially in Tarn Taran district (71.29 percent), the Chief Minister said that this led to huge losses to the State exchequer, and must be checked with a heavy hand. He asked the Deputy Commissioner Tarn Taran to work out a strategy with the police and PSPCL to stamp out this menace.

Reviewing the progress of his Government’s flagship ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ programme, the Chief Minister asked the DCs to tie up with leading employers, industrialists, business groups and job providers for sourcing of vacancies with a package of Rs three lakh per annum and above.

It was informed that under the Punjab Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission, the Government has planned high end job fairs during March 2020 at Amritsar, Phagwara, Bathinda, Mohali and SBS Nagar. Graduates from different fields like engineering, management, medicine, hospitality, tourism, agriculture, animal husbandry, banking, arts and science etc can participate in these job fairs, which aim to facilitate employment to over 2000 youth with high end jobs.

Reviewing the progress of social security and welfare schemes, the Chief Minister asked the DCs to intensify their efforts for recruitment of staff in Sakhi – One Stop Centres, besides identifying suitable land for establishment of Sakhi Centres and Child Care Institutions.

He also asked the DCs to expeditiously fill up the vacancies in District Child Protection Units to ensure safety and security of children. He also gave the DCs the target of issuing 100 percent Unique Disability Identity Cards, by June 30, 2020, to all the divyangs who had paper certificates.

Capt Amarinder also instructed the DCs to identify adequate panchayat lands to provide five marla plots to the landless and homeless poor families on priority. He also asked the Principal Secretary to include certain development works like upgradation of infrastructure in schools and street lights in rural areas under the smart village campaign.

Expressing grave concern over the growing menace of stray cattle and dogs, which had become a major nuisance and had claimed several precious lives in the past several years, Capt Amarinder asked the DCs to suggest ways and means to tackle the problem of stray cattle in a holistic manner.

The Chief Minister also reviewed flood preparedness with the DCs and asked the Chief Secretary to place sufficient funds on their disposal to execute various flood protection works, especially at vulnerable sites, well in advance of the onset of the monsoon season.

He also asked the DCs to complete the disbursement of compensation to flood victims on account of last year’s massive floods and get all requisite formalities done from the revenue officials.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dcs-directed-to-prioritize-development.html

10,15-2-20,BJP to list out religious leaders to promote CAA,"The saffron party is planning to convince people regarding the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) religiously. Combining religion with politics, the Punjab unit of the BJP has asked its leaders and workers to prepare a list of local prominent religious activists who could convince the people on the CAA, along with National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR).

Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma, in his meeting with various party wings on Friday, directed them to prepare a list of local prominent religious activist to seek their support to make the people aware about the CAA, NRC and NPR.

Besides, the party workers have also been asked to organize camps in their respective areas to make the people aware about the CAA, NRC and NPR.

The state party chief has also asked the participants to mobilize the masses in favour of the CAA, by asking them to give a miss call on ‘88662-88662’ to support the CAA. The move comes at a time when the Delhi election results are being seen as a vote against the controversial act.

In fact, BJP’s ally in Punjab, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), has also taken a different stand on the citizenship act, and in protest decided against contesting the Delhi polls citing “ideological differences” between the two over the CAA-NRC. After voting in favour of CAA in the Parliament, the SAD has now been demanding to include the Muslims also in the new citizenship Act.

The BJP-led central Government decision to implement CAA along with NRC and NPR has evoked countrywide protests. The new law seeks to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from Buddhist, Hindu, Sikhs, Jain, Parsi and Christian faiths, who have come to India from the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, on or before December 31, 2014.

Protests against the CAA and NRC began from the North East, and expanding to new cities and towns every day. The police crackdowns on protests, especially in Delhi, have only served to escalate the anti-CAA movement further bringing more and more people out onto the streets.

Other than the leaders from opposition parties, several prominent personalities from different fields, rallied behind the anti-CAA movement, with several non-BJP ruled states declaring that they will not implement the new Citizenship Act or the NRC, with Punjab along with Kerala also passing Assembly resolutions against the Act.

However, the Central Government is adamant, with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah repeatedly making it clear that the decision would not be revoked.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-list-out-religious-leaders-to-promote-caa.html

A new Speaker needs to be elected after Rajeev Bindal resigned from the post to become the president of the BJP state unit. The expansion of the cabinet will be done to fill two ministerial berths, which have been lying vacant for several months.

14,15-2-20,Govt orders probe into illegal mining in Saharanpur,"The Uttar Pradesh government ordered a probe into illegal mining in Saharanpur but maintained that revenue collection from mining had gone up as the Bharatiya Janata Party government had ensured transparency in allotment of mines.

The issue was raised during Question Hour in the Assembly, which witnessed sharp exchange of words between opposition leaders and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna, leading to a walkout by Samajwadi Party and Congress members on Friday.

Replying to a question raised by Mohammed Aslam Raini of Bahujan Samaj Party and Sanjay Garg of Samajwadi Party on illegal mining in Saharanpur, Khanna admitted that prices of sand and coarse sand (maurang) had gone up by 10-15 per cent but revenue from mining had increased many times in the last couple of years.

“Revenue collection in 2011-12 was Rs 593 crore, in 2012-13 it was Rs 722 crore, in 2015-16 it rose to Rs 1,222 crore and further to Rs 1547 crore in 2016-17. But during the BJP regime in 2017-18, revenue collection was Rs 3,247 crore and in 2018-19 it clocked Rs 3,164 crore. In the 2019-20 fiscal it is Rs 1,700 crore till date and can go up to Rs 2,500 crore by March-end,” Khanna said.

The minister said that this fiscal the revenue would dip because of NGT (National Green Tribunal) directives under which 54 mines had been closed.

Contesting the claims, leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary sought to know about the prices of sand and coarse sand between 2011-12 and 2016-2017, claiming that the prices had gone up by 200 per cent.

The parliamentary affairs minister admitted that the prices of sand and coarse sand had gone up but it was only by 10-15 per cent.

“The Yogi Adityanath government has brought a new Act in January 27, 2020 which facilitates mining in a transparent manner,” he said.

Not satisfied with the answer, the SP and Congress staged a walkout.



Expressway: Transport Minister Ashok Kateria claimed that the number of accidents on expressway had come down due to steps taken by the government.

Replying to a question of Haji Irfan Solanki (SP) and Umashankar Singh (BSP), the minister said that 42 police patrol vans were stationed on Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Yamuna Expressway while 16 ambulances were in place in these expressways to provide relief to people in case of emergency.

“To monitor the speed of vehicles, speed radars have been installed on expressways. If a car crosses Agra-Lucknow Expressway within less than three hours, it is penalised for overspeeding and e-challans are being sent to the homes of the vehicle owners,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-orders-probe-into-illegal-mining-in-saharanpur.html
15,15-2-20,NSA slapped on Kafeel for anti-CAA speech at AMU,"The Uttar Pradesh Police slapped the stringent National Security Act on Dr Kafeel Khan, the suspended paediatrician of BRD Medical College who came to limelight after the death of children due to lack of oxygen cylinders at the medical college hospital in Gorakhpur last year.

The NSA has been slapped on Dr Khan for his alleged inflammatory speech at Aligarh Muslim University during protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 12, 2019.

The suspended paediatrician was arrested as he deplaned in Mumbai to visit Mumbai Bagh protests on January 29, where women protesters started an indefinite stir against the CAA.

A case was registered against him for promoting enmity between different religions.

After his arrest in Mumbai, Dr Khan was brought to Aligarh, from where he was immediately shifted to District Jail in Mathura.

However, he was granted bail on Monday after furnishing a bail bond of Rs 60,000 on the condition of not repeating the crime again but even after four days of an Aligarh court order, he continued to be lodged in Mathura jail.

“We got to know on Thursday morning that NSA has been slapped on Dr Khan and now he will not be coming out of jail soon. This is simply unacceptable. He is being targeted at the behest of the state government,” Khan’s brother Adil Khan alleged in Lucknow on Friday.

A special messenger was sent by Chief Judicial Magistrate of Aligarh to the jail to expedite the release process on February 13, after Khan’s family approached the CJM Court over the delay in his release but was told about NSA being slapped on him..

Adil Khan said, “The government is trying to silence my brother. A few days ago, during a programme on a TV news channel, he had revealed that at BRD Medical College (Gorakhpur), many children are dying daily but the government is hiding the facts and data.”

“The (Mathura) jail was about to release him on Friday at 6 am. My brother Kashif along with the lawyer reached the jail but by 9 am police presence at the jail was increased and we were told verbally by jail authorities that the NSA has been invoked against him,” Adil Khan said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nsa-slapped-on-kafeel-for-anti-caa-speech-at-amu.html

18,15-2-20,"Day after arrest, Anup Sai sent to jail","Three-time former Brajarajnagar MLA Anup Kumar Sai was sent to jail at Raighar in Chhattisgarh on Friday as his bail plea was rejected in a case pertaining to the double murder case in which he is allegedly involved.

The Raighar District and Sessions Judge Court rejected his bail application, following which he was sent to District Jail.

Sai was arrested late in Thursday evening after intense grilling for nearly 18 hours over the nearly four-year-old double murder case in Chhattisgarh.

Meanwhile, Bilaspur Range IG Deepanshu Kabra announced a cash award of Rs 20,000 each to the police personnel involved in the investigation of the case.

Notably, on May 7, 2016, police had recovered two bodies of a woman and her daughter. The bodies of Kalpana Dash (40) and her 14-year-old daughter Babli were run over by a four-wheeler before being bludgeoned to death. This was done apparently to disfigure the bodies so that their identities could not be ascertained. This turned out to be a challenge for the police as they couldn’t trace the details of the deceased persons.

Investigation teams were formed and personnel were sent to six States to get leads on the case. Unexpectedly, a constable from Odisha identified the deceased from the photographs circulated by the Chakradhar Nagar police in Chhattisgarh. The constable Saroj Dash happens to be a relative of the deceased.

Saroj informed the in-laws of Kalpana who approached the Chhattisgarh police. The DNA test corroborated the fact that he was the father of the minor girl. This was the turning point in the investigation.

Kalpana’s estranged husband Sunil Srivastava told police that his ex-wife had links with Anup Sai. Following this, police zeroed in on the former MLA. The police kept a close watch on Sai’s movements since last six months. The call records and other evidence pointed towards his involvement in the case. Though Raigarh police had got enough clues to arrest Sai, they were waiting for an opportune time to nab him.

During interrogation, Sai told police that he was fed up with the woman as she was blackmailing him besides pressurising him to get married.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/day-after-arrest--anup-sai-sent-to-jail.html

21,15-2-20,Make Census 2021 data credible: Chief secy,"Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy on Friday asked the concerned officials to make the Census-2021 data bona fide and credible.

He was speaking to the officers engaged in census operation at a State-level conference at the Lokseva Bhawan here. Tripathy said, “Census data become the basis of planning and reference for ten long years. Since it is done in every ten years, some officers may not be quite conversant with the process. As such, the Collectors, ADMs, Tehsildars, Municipal Commissioners, Block Development Officers and Executive Officers must read and understand the Act and Rules in detail.”

Tripathy directed them to also go through the census compendiums and organise trainings properly at all levels.

He pointed out that the Census-2021 is first of its kind as it is mostly being dome on digital mode.

Development Commissioner Suresh Chandra Mohapatra said, “Since census is a time-bound operation, it should be undertaken with all seriousness at all levels.”

Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue & Disaster Management Pradipta Mohapatra said, “Census is the principal source of primary data at the grassroots level like village, ward and towns on pan-Indian basis and it is widely used by national and international agencies. As such, the enumerators play an important and scared role for Governance, planning and research.”

Census Operations Director Premananda Khuntia said this time, a mobile app would be used in house and population enumeration. The app could be used both in online and offline modes. A mixed method of data collection with mobile app, paper schedule and self-enumeration would be adopted. The enumerators would use their own android mobile or i-phones. An additional incentive of Rs 7,500 would be provided for use of own mobile in enumeration work. The management and monitoring works would be done through census web portal. This would help in faster data finalisation with greater accuracy.

The Revenue & Disaster Management Department would be the State Nodal Department for Census Operations. The entire operation would be carried on in two phases. The Phase-I would be a period of 45 days from April to September 2020, during which house listing would be done. The Phase-II would be from February 9 to 28, 2021, during which population enumeration would be undertaken. The revision round would be conducted from March 1 to 5, 2021.

The district Collectors and the Commissioners of Corporations would serve as Principal Census Officers. Additional District Magistrates, Sub-Collectors and Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Revenue Divisional Officers would operate as Census Officers. Tehsidars, Additional Tehsildars, BDOs and Executive Officers would operate as Charge Officers. Field-level officers of the State Government and the Urban Local Bodies along with teachers would work as enumerators. Officers, generally of a rank higher than enumerators, would work as Supervisors.

23,15-2-20,CM reviews developmental schemes,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday directed all the Deputy Commissioners of the State to complete the work for the registration of eligible families under the “Mukhyamantri Parivar Samridhi Yojna” by March 15 so that the final installment of Rs 2000 could also be deposited into the bank accounts of beneficiaries by March 31.

The process for the payment of the first two installments of Rs 2000 each (Rs 4000) under the scheme has already been started from February 7 this year.

Presiding over the meeting with all the Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and Municipal Commissioners of the State to review the progress of various schemes here, Khattar directed that besides monitoring the registration of data in the concerned Common Service Centres (CSCs) on regular basis, the DCs should also organize special camps in villages as well in wards in towns so as to enable maximum number of beneficiaries to register themselves.

Under this scheme, annual financial assistance of Rs 6000 would be provided to those families in the State whose annual income is upto Rs 1.80 lakh and land holding is less than 5 acres so that premium of various welfare schemes of the Central Government, pension scheme and crop insurance could be paid automatically from the bank accounts of the needy families. It was also informed that data of three lakh families have so far been registered under the Parviar Pehchaan Patra.

Reviewing the “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” scheme, the Chief Minister said that as this year, payment for the wheat crop is to be made with the same module as done in the case of mustard and bajra, the farmers should be encouraged to make registration on the Meri Fasal Mera Byora Portal so that they don’t face any difficulty in selling their produce in the mandis of the State.

He stated that the Government is committed to procure all crops at MSP and directed the DCs to put their acts together to achieve 75 per cent target for the registration of farmers at the portal under wheat crop by February 28, 2020.

Reviewing the Implementation of Survey of India Project: “Ending Lal Dora”, he directed the DCs to ensure that the survey work of 75 villages of 15 districts (five villages in each district) be completed by March 5. He said that village Sirsi of district Karnal has already been declared free from Lal Dora thus ending the age-old system continued since the British days.

He said that besides the villages, it has also been decided to the conduct survey of Karnal, Jind and Sonipat cities. He directed that survey work of district as well State boundaries should also be conducted simultaneously by using additional drones. It was informed that 8 villages could be surveyed in a day by using a single drone.

He said that the state Government has decided to observe the year 2020 as Sushashan Sankalp Varsh under which various new initiatives would be taken to bring revolutionary changes in the system of service delivery. He said that our aim is to ensure that people need not to make frequent round of Government offices, instead the Government reaches to their door step for the delivery of citizen centric services.

Khattar said that the State Government has constituted Inter District Coucil (IDC) to ensure active participation of PRIs in the development process of the State through devolution of funds. He said that in the meeting of IDC held recently at Panchkula; Zila Parishads have been asked to send their budget estimates to the State for approval so that they could carry out development works at their own level.

He said that to further strengthen the Zila Parishads, independent CEOs have been appointed.

The Chief Minister said that separate Commissioner Urban Local Bodies would be appointed on the pattern of CEO Zila Parishads. He said that it has also been decided that XEN Panchayati Raj would now act under the Zila Parishads.

24,15-2-20,RTI activist death: NHRC seeks report from DGP,"The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued notice to the Odisha DGP over the alleged murder of RTI activist Ranjan Kumar Das at Beruan village in Kendrapada district recently.

Acting on a petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer and rights activist Radhakanta Tripathy, the NHRC passed the order and sought the reply within two weeks.

In his petition, Tripathy stated that Das had filed a series of applications seeking information about different Government schemes in the district.

Das was regularly receiving death threats for seeking information including on the numerous brick kilns that had sprung up illegally. In January 2020 his parents received death threats asking them to keep Das’ activism under check.

Recently, Das had lodged a case before the Odisha Lokayukta alleging encroachment of 1,100 acres of Government land by a resident of Mahakalpada for shrimp farming, the family members of Das said.

The delay in arresting the culprits pose serious question of human rights as it involves role of police, intelligence and law and order of the State, Tripathy contended.

The failure of the State police to save the RTI activists, journalists and human rights defenders from such attacks and extending appropriate safety, security to them pose serious question of violation of human rights. Failure of the State in implementing the provisions of Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2013 in the State amounts to serious human rights violation, Tripathy alleged.

He requested the NHRC to take immediate legal action against the wrongdoers and pay compensation of Rs 50 lakh and provide protection to the family members of the slain RTI activist.

Tripathy also requested the commission to direct the State authorities and the State Lokayukta to ensure the implementation of Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2013 in letter and spirit at the earliest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rti-activist-death--nhrc-seeks-report-from-dgp.html
25,15-2-20,Punjab CM honours families of 34 martyrs,"In recognition of the gallantry and courage of the sons of the soil, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday honoured the families of 34 martyrs, who laid down their lives to uphold the country’s unity and integrity. The occasion coincided with the first anniversary of the Pulwama attack.

The Chief Minister gave away ‘Certificate of Honour’ to those who had been given jobs in the State Government under its ‘Honour and Gratitude’ policy during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Capt Amarinder, interacting with the martyrs’ families, reiterated his Government’s firm commitment to accord top priority to the welfare of families of the martyrs who made supreme sacrifice while guarding the country’s borders in line of their duty and fighting the terrorism in various parts of the country.

“The State Government has made a humble effort to show its gratitude to the families of the martyrs though the loss of their beloved ones could never be compensated in monetary terms. The people of Punjab would always remain indebted to martyrs for their exemplary valour and heroic deeds,” he asserted.

Responding to the issue raised by some of the martyr’s families, the Chief Minister asked the Department of Defence Services Welfare to come up with a revised policy to provide better jobs in case the eligible family members improve his or her educational qualification to lead a life with self respect and dignity.

Meanwhile, Defence Services Welfare director Brig (retired) Satinder Singh announced that one family member each of the defence forces personnel, who had laid down their lives recently, would also be provided jobs at the earliest.

“Nine such cases are under active consideration of the State Government, of which jobs would be provided to the eligible next of kin shortly in four cases. The other five cases will be processed in due course of time after getting Battle Causality Certificates from the Army authorities, which are mandatory for providing jobs to the next of kin,” he said.

The Director further revealed that various schemes had been recently introduced for the welfare of martyrs’ families out of Flag Day Fund which is financial assistance for medical treatment, family of personnel dying while on duty, Sustenance Allowance to widows till their regular pension starts, higher education for the children of widows, coaching classes for professional courses and tool kit for self employment ventures besides several other welfare schemes including financial assistance for marriage of daughters of ex-servicemen.

Notably, under the Punjab Government’s ‘Honour and Gratitude’ policy, a Government job to the eligible next of kin (NoK), along with financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakhs, is also provided for single and married martyrs respectively in the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cm-honours-families-of-34-martyrs.html

27,15-2-20,SAD-BJP for withdrawal of Govt’s affidavit,"Accusing the Capt Amarinder Singh led Congress Government of “conspiring” to weaken Sikh institutions including the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) by supporting the idea of a separate Gurdwara body for Haryana with the sole of fulfilling anti-Sikh agenda of the Gandhi family, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Friday demanded immediate withdrawal of State Government’s additional affidavit filed in the Apex Court in this regard.

Sukhbir, who led the SAD-BJP delegation to Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore for the same, said that during the Bhupinder Singh Hooda Government in Haryana, an attempt was made to interfere in Sikh affairs by proposing the idea of the separate Sikh body in the State.

“But the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh assured us that no such attempt would be entertained as he understood the sensitivity of this matter because his ancestors had also made great sacrifices for establishment of the SGPC — a Sikh body for the management of Sikh shrines,” he said.

He said that later, however, Dr Singh showed his helplessness as Sonia Gandhi decided to constitute a separate Sikh body for Haryana.

A joint delegation of the SAD and BJP leaders requested the Governor to direct the State Government to “immediately withdraw” the additional affidavit filed by it in the Supreme Court which supports the Haryana Government by saying that the state assembly of Haryana is competent to enact a law after the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925.

It also demanded a high-level judicial inquiry to expose the conspiracy of the Congress Government to jeopardize the interest of the Sikh community and the apex body for the management of Sikh shrines.

Terming the State Government’s stance on the issue of a separate Gurdwara management body for Haryana as the “biggest betrayal with interests of the Punjab and Sikh community”, Sukhbir said that at the behest of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, Capt Amarinder had changed Punjab’s stance on this very sensitive issue while filing a fresh affidavit in the Supreme Court.

“This is akin to the second attack orchestrated by the Gandhi family on the Sikh community after it attacked our holiest shrine-Sri Harmandir sahib with tanks and mortars in 1984,” he added.

BEHBAL KALAN WITNESS DEATH: REMOVE AND REGISTER CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST KANGAR, KIKKI DHILLON

SAD-BJP joint delegation also urged the Governor to direct the State Government to immediately register a criminal case against the Cabinet Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Advisor to the Chief Minister Kushaldeep Singh Kikki Dhillon and Congress leader Manjinder Singh Dhillon for causing death to former Sarpanch Surjit Singh, who was a prime witness in the Behbal Kalan firing incident.

The combine also demanded Kangar and Kushaldeep Dhillon’s removal from the Cabinet and the post of Advisor to Chief Minister, respectively.

“The prime witness of Behbal Kalan firing incident was mentally tortured and humiliated at the behest of the Congress leaders who wanted to stop him from disposing as a witness in the case in order to save accused police persons,” alleged Sukhbir.

He added that Kangar and Dhillon used one way or another to deter Surjit Singh from giving testimony against the culprits by mentally harassing him through the PSPCL officials by imposing heavy penalties as well as insulting his family members including ladies.

SAD chief said that it was shocking that despite all efforts, including a meeting with the Chief Minister, made by Surjit Singh’s widow to expose conspiracy behind his husband’s death, the State Government had not initiated any high-level independent inquiry into the incident.

The SAD-BJP delegation also demanded full proof security to Surjit Singh’s family as well as all the witnesses of the sacrilege cases. It also demanded strict action against all the officers who did not take proper and timely action on the applications of Surjit

Singh.

BJP’s senior leader Madan Mohan Mittal said that not providing protection to a prime witness of a very important case proved the malafide intent of the present Congress government. “Instead of protecting the witness, Congress Ministers harassed and humiliated the witness with the sole aim of protecting the culprits. This is unwarranted,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-bjp-for-withdrawal-of-govt---s-affidavit.html

32,15-2-20,Decriminalisation of politics: What SC has said,"The victory of AAP in the Delhi polls is by and large viewed as a genre of almost different kind of politics, in a sharp departure from caste, regional, religious and ethnic considerations. It was fought on development agenda. But it is no different from the other elections on the major count of criminal elements in politics.

If the report of Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) is to be believed, then more than half the candidates had criminal cases against them. As per a report, ""There has been a sharp jump in the number of MLAs with registered criminal cases. In 2020, 43 MLAs declared criminal cases against them while in 2015, 24 MLAs had criminal cases. The number of MLAs with serious criminal cases, which included rape, attempt to murder and crimes against women, is 37"".

In the meantime, the Supreme Court had adjudicated on the contempt petitions pertaining to the criminalisation of politics in India and the non-compliance of the directions of a Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in Public Interest Foundation and Ors. v. Union of India and Anr. (2019) with respect to decriminalisation of politics. The directions were passed by a bench comprising of Justices R F Nariman and Ravindra Bhat. Mainly the contempt petitions were filed before the Supreme Court on the grounds that its directions were not implemented in the subsequent Assembly elections and the general elections since the Election Commission of India did not amend the Election Symbols Order and the Model Code of Conduct.

In this case, the court took note of the fact that over the last four general elections, there has been a disturbing influence of criminals in politics. While 24 per cent of the Members of Parliament had pending criminal cases in 2004; that went up to 30 per cent in 2009, 34 per cent in 2014 and 43 per cent in 2019. Further, the court was intrigued by the issue as to why the persons with criminal antecedents are being selected by political parties as candidates.

On this a point very interesting set of directions were issued by the court in exercise of Articles 129 and 142 of the Constitution of India. As per the directions it is now mandatory for political parties to upload on their website about detailed information of the candidates which shall include pending criminal cases (including the nature of the offences, and relevant particulars such as whether charges have been framed, the concerned court, the case number etc.), along with the reasons for such selection and as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates.

Now, for following such directions, the parties shall also make public about the qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned, and not merely ""winnability"" at the polls. And such information shall also be published across print, electronic and social media platforms. And again this is not a toothless direction of the court but of consequences, as it was directed therein that if a political party fails to submit such compliance report with the Election Commission, the Election Commission shall bring such non-compliance by the political party concerned to the notice of the Supreme Court as being in contempt of court's orders/directions.

While passing such directions the court has most significantly remarked that, “the candidates must be selected on the basis of merit and achievement. The reasons for selecting a candidate must be published by the party."" It further remarked, ""Winnability cannot be the only reason for selecting a candidate with criminal antecedents.”

A study by ADR showed that, from 2009 to 2019, there has been an increase of 231 per cent in the number of candidates with declared cases of crime against women contesting in Lok Sabha elections. For the same period, there has been an increase of 850 per cent in the number of MPs with declared cases of crime against women in the Lok Sabha.

As per the same study, 76 lawmakers across the country have declared cases related to crimes against women. A total of 572 candidates with such cases registered against them have contested Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Assembly elections in the last five years. And as many as nine lawmakers have declared cases related to rape, out of them three lawmakers are MPs and six are MLAs.

According to experts, such disclosures might not achieve intended consequence, as the electorate is well aware about the criminal antecedents of the candidates contesting elections. The reason behind such behaviour of the electorate is best put by Milan Vaishnav author of ‘When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics’, ""Voters are voting for criminal candidates ... despite their criminal involvement. Voters are aware of the background of the people they are voting for. They are not ignorant. But they are making a calculation that these are the people who can best represent our interest"".

But the underlining truth is, what the electorate fails to understand is that, criminal elements in politics may well represent some petty causes concerning them, but this has adversely affected the quality of policy making, and has enhanced nepotism, cronyism and corruption which has a tremendous regressive effect on national growth and development. And at times, it creates an atmosphere of intimidation that most undemocratically muzzles voices of dissent.

Kruttibash said this after he was granted interim bail by the District and Sessions Judge Court at Brahmapur on Thursday. He was arrested by the Baidyanathpur police over his involvement in a parking brawl on January 28.

Meenakshi had attempted self-immolation protesting the arrest of her son.

Krutibash said that the allegations against him are false. He alleged that though his hometown is Brahamapur , the cops are asking him to stay outside the city. “Why should I live somewhere else? My mother self-immolated her, I too will immolate myself in front of DG office if I do not get justice within 15 days,” he threatened.

Notably, Raja had a fight with a youth Sunil in front of a Kalyan Mandap at Panda colony under the Baidyanathpur PS over parking . Following which Sunil and his friends assaulted Krutibash with a cricket bat, the video of which was captured in a CCTV camera installed near the spot and later went viral on social media.

When Meenakshi intervened to save her son, she was also attacked by the miscreants. Later, a complaint was lodged by Meenakshi following which three attackers were arrested by police. Later, Krutibash was also arrested on the basis of a counter FIR. But Meenakshi alleged that her son was falsely implicated and had no role in the attack. She had also written to Brahmapur SP Pinak Mishra demanding arrest of the attackers and release of her son.

35,15-2-20,"Don’t allow NPR, Yechury urges Naveen","CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has termed the National Population Register (NPR) exercise as a precursor of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and urged Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik not to allow it in Odisha.

Addressing a CPI(M) rally here on Thursday, he said as Governments of 13 States, including Odisha, have already announced not to allow NRC and six Chief Ministers have opposed the NPR, it can be said that half of India is against these two moves.

“So, the NPR and the NRC cannot be completed across the country because of their adverse impact on the nation’s unity,” observed Yechury.

He said he wanted to meet Patnaik but could not due to the Chief Minister’s prior engagements. “However, I spoke to him over phone and apprised him that NPR, 2020 is not the same as it had been earlier. Now, the Centre has added some questions in the NPR format to get the information required for the NRC,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have said that no discussion was held on implementing the NRC, but the Central Government told Parliament nine times that it would be taken up across the country, Yechury asserted.

People who would not be able to provide all information during the NPR exercise may be tagged as doubtful citizens and their names would not appear in the NRC list, he claimed. Tribals, Dalits, poor and destitute people and widows may not be able to arrange the requisite documents to satisfy the official requirement, he said.

He claimed that there would be no separate survey for the NRC as the Centre plans to collect the required information during the NPR exercise.

“Everybody should understand that the NRC will cause more harm than good. Because of the Centre’s design, the NPR exercise will also suffer,” he said and demanded withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and stopping the NPR and NRC processes.

Yechury said the CPI(M) activists would undertake a door-to-door campaign across the country this month and in March to make people aware of the adverse impact of the CAA, NRC and NPR.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/don---t-allow-npr--yechury-urges-naveen.html

As part of the agitation, the activists staged road blockades and picketing at different places of the town disrupting vehicular movements. Besides, shops and other business establishments remained closed due to the stir.

Leaders of several organisations, including the District Bar Association, Chamber of Commerce, Chemist and Druggist Association, Journalist Association, Congress and BJP extended their support to the bandh call.

Notably, the 85-year-old Dhenkanal Headquarters Hospital has been shifted to a seven storied building near the Dakhinakali road. But the hospital is functioning with manpower shortage and inadequate specialist doctors and staff. For diagnosis of diseases, even the facilities for Ultrasound, MRI, Endoscopy, CT scan, ECG and Echo are not available. On the contrary, the deserted old hospital building at Baji Chowk has turned a haven for anti- socials. The Government has not executed any project so far to use the old hospital building situated over three acres of land. The agitators also demanded that the new hospital be upgraded to a medical college and hospital.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/12-hr-bandh-hits-life-in-dhenkanal.html

Addressing the State Assembly on the first day of its Budget Session, the Governor lauded the efforts of the Government to serve people through Mo Sarkar and 5T initiatives.

43,15-2-20,Of puppet-masters and useful idiots,"Among other things, the protests and expression of opinions against the Citizenship Amendment Act, planned National Population Register and National Register of Citizens have blatantly exposed strong biases, the proclivity for selective outrage, intolerant attitude of the ‘liberals’ and the tendency to propagate outright lies by many of those claiming to be concerned about protecting the constitution and the ‘secular’ fabric of the nation.

It is not only the right but also the duty of a citizen to protest against what is undemocratic and wrong but to do so mainly to push forward a political agenda by exploiting latent insecurities through misinformation is undemocratic and also unethical to say the least. Every citizen of a democratic nation has the right to like or dislike a politician or even an elected public representative but the protests have seen devious presentation of personal likes and dislikes as facts in many cases.

When considering the means of protests, one will recall people making a big show of reading the preamble of the constitution while ignoring or being unaware of the fact that “sovereign, democratic republic” was changed to “sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic” in the preamble at a time when democracy itself was challenged by imposition of emergency in the nation.

Here in Dehradun too, some protests were held in the beginning before a demonstration on the lines of Shaheen Bagh was started near the Parade Ground. Of course, one has the democratic right to protest.

But, one was disappointed to see that a banner demanding the Bharat Ratna for a cricketer was also displayed at the protest site on one of the days even as one of the lady protesters was seen wearing the national flag as a cape- probably unaware that wearing the national flag as a piece of apparel amounts to disrespecting it. There are many who have considerable free time and resources to participate in protests regularly and look for every possible opportunity to use the social media to criticise and question the government. Criticising the questioning the government is not bad at all, but it is different when such actions are politically motivated for concealed purposes.

Many are also claiming that the citizens, especially the youth of the nation are now awake and will not tolerate injustice anymore. One would be very happy if this was actually the case. Can one comprehend how much better things would be if the citizens were actually aware? For example, the scourge of corruption, lack of sanitation, environmental damage, pollution, crime and various other problems afflicting our society would be considerably lessened if only the citizens became actually aware.

This is where the puppet-masters and useful idiots come in the picture. The term ‘useful idiots’ is attributed at times to Lenin though it is said to have been coined by economist and historian Ludwig von Mises. Lenin is said to have innovated by creating a corps of ‘useful idiots’- foot soldiers who would push his ‘revolution’ in various nations, subverting the democratic process, stirring up strikes and carry out propaganda according to Moscow’s orders. So while the puppet-masters project a picture of impending doom facing the nation and their followers carry forward this idea by protesting against non-existent threats, the activities that are actually damaging the nation and society are continuing unabated.

Take the example of Uttarakhand, the Himalayan State where the Ganga and Yamuna originate. The state is important not only from the spiritual and cultural points of view but also vital from the environmental and strategic points of view. The effects of serious damage to the environment in Uttarakhand will be felt in a considerable portion of India and even beyond.

Both the Central and the State governments are taking some steps but these are quite inadequate to tackle the challenges faced by the environment here. For example, one does not know of any town or city in the state where waste management is as it should be. The provisional state capital Dehradun generates about 300 metric tonnes of solid waste per day and despite there being a waste management plant, it doesn’t take a scientist to understand that proper waste management is still lacking in the city. Another degenerative trend continuing here is unplanned urbanisation. While a portion of the city is being developed into a ‘smart city’, unplanned constructions are being facilitated in the remaining areas, especially the suburban areas where there are still some farms, orchards and open spaces left.

The irony is that there are a number of intelligent and capable bureaucrats, scientists and other professionals living and working in Dehradun but the city is degenerating due to unplanned constructions and short-sighted ‘developments’. At this rate, by the time, a few parks and gardens are developed in some areas under the smart city project, the remaining open and green spaces in the city would be occupied by ugly brick and cement constructions.

Why aren’t the ‘aware’ citizens concerned about the nation questioning such degenerative aspects? Because, the focus has been shifted to hollow protests against imagined threats to keep the minds occupied while actual dangers are nurtured by skewed governance.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/of-puppet-masters-and-useful-idiots.html
44,15-2-20,Be on alert: DGP to officers,"Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Friday asked the field officers to be more proactive in view of the latest internal security inputs received by the Department.

He directed a small team of SSPs (Amritsar Rural, Fazilka, Sangrur) to devise and share a computerized proforma for entering the details of Police Station activities in a seamless manner which can be updated at the field level and reviewed by senior officers.

Action taken against drugs was reviewed with discussions on recovery of drugs, commercial quantity cases registered and persons arrested, property forfeited, and the backward-forward linkages found. He also directed all SSPs and CPs to give complete attention to turn Punjab into a drug free State.

‘ONE POLICE OFFICER FOR ONE VILLAGE’ SCHEME TO BE LAUNCHED

After extensive deliberations with IG Ranges, Commissioners of Police and SSPs at the brainstorming session, the Police Department has decided to earmark a designated Police Officer, in the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector, Head Constable, or Constable, for each of the 12,700 villages of the State. The designated police officer would provide a ready Point of Contact (PPOC) for the people living in the villages of the State.

The DGP said that the names and phone numbers of the Police Officers would be shared with the people by displaying them on the Punjab Police website.

48,15-2-20,‘Exempt ex-Govt employees from I-T’,"If the AAP Government in Delhi could afford to provide free water, electricity, transport, health and education to all the denizens of Delhi irrespective of their age and income, why can’t the Union Government exempt the pension of retired employees out of the Income Tax purview, said founding president of Gandhinagar Senior Citizens’ Forum Dr KC Panda here.

He urged the Union and State Governments either to bring an administrative order or to amend the existing provisions of Income Tax Act for exempting all the retired employees of the country from paying IT.

A superannuated employee during service for 30 to 36 years paid IT throughout. But there is no justification to pay tax again on his/her pension and hard earned savings, Panda said. After retirement, the employee is paid pension as a superannuation fund for his/her livelihood by recognising his/her valuable services rendered to the institution or the country for so many years and the pension which the retired employee receives is technically not an income for any service or work, but considered only a deferred wage, told Panda.

If the pension received by the elected representatives like, MPs and MLAs are not taxable, why the pension of retired employees come under taxable income, he questioned.

Citing examples, he said that several countries in the world much smaller than India namely, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bermuda, Monaco, Andorra and Cayman Islands have zero income tax system. There are a number of countries without the burden of income tax and many of them are very pleasant and tax-friendly countries, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---exempt-ex-govt-employees-from-i-t---.html

50,15-2-20,Bajwa appeals AT chief for free Gurbani telecast,"Quoting the very universalism of Gurbani, Punjab Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Friday personally appealed the Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to seek his intervention in ending monopoly on the live telecast of Gurbani from the Golden Temple and facilitate the availability of signal to all channels within the framework of the guidelines.

Bajwa, after the meeting, asserted that the Jathedar said that he was looking into the matter.

The state Panchayats and Rural Development Minister, Bajwa led a delegation of the Sikh leaders and based the case on the logic that Gurbani was not a commodity and thus could not be traded as was the case now.

The message of the Gurus articulated in Gurbani must be taken to every corner of the world free rather than making it a business, the delegation stated.

The delegation pointed out that the monopoly rights given by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee for this purpose to a single TV channel PTC, that is owned by the family of Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal, violates the basic tenets and teachings of Gurbani that is for the entire humanity.

“The signal should be made available free of cost to every channel interested in spreading Gurbani after getting the undertaking on observing the laid down norms. The SGPC should make its own arrangements for distribution of the signal,” said the delegation.

Bajwa pointed out that the proposal to set up a channel by the SGPC was more than two decades old but nothing had been done to take the same to the logical conclusion for the obvious reasons.

He referred to the appeal made to the SGPC in this regard through a unanimous resolution adopted by the Punjab Assembly on November 6, 2019. This was followed up by him with the submission made to the Akal Takht Jathedar on November 18, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bajwa-appeals-at-chief-for-free-gurbani-telecast.html

The transport department has banned the entry of e-rickshaws on the main roads of the city between 8 AM to 8 PM but e-rickshaw drivers of Devbhoomi E-Rickshaw Welfare Society started protesting against it 24 days ago.

However, according to the members of VASSM, if any amendments are made in the current gazette notification favouring the e-rickshaw drivers, they too will commence a strike against the department. Regarding the support of Congress party to the e-rickshaw drivers, they said that Congress party should not just think about the protesting e-rickshaw drivers but also about the members of the other unions who are operating their vehicles in the city for a much longer time than e-rickshaw drivers.

If the members of Congress will keep supporting protesting drivers, the VASSM will be bound to run a campaign against them. On the other hand, the protesting e-rickshaw drivers have alleged that the police department is working under the influence of the unions of buses, autorickshaws and Vikrams. According to one of the protesting drivers Satyaveer Arya, “We were given the date of February 8 to meet Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Traffic, Kewal Khurana but nobody from the department has talked about the meeting since that day.

We were given many dates to meet the officials of the department but the meeting never happened.

52,15-2-20,Villagers stage dharna at Indrani Patnaik Mines,"Villagers sat on a dhrana in front of the gate of the Indrani Patnaik Iron Mines at Joda in Keonjhar distsrict on Thursday, demanding blacklisting of the ‘Baba Dhabaleswar Transporting Committee’, a transport agency that has allegedly cheated its members.

Sources said former MLA Sanatan Mahakud had formed a cooperative transporting committee named “Maa Kuaanri” to lift iron ore from the Indrani Patnaik Iron Mines as the lone transporter. Mahakud was also reportedly distributing some parts of the profit to villagers of Unchbali, who were affected by the mining operation.

But being envious of his influence in the politics , the Indrani Patnaik Mines with the help of some political leaders allegedly adopted a “divide and rule” policy to curtail the influence of Sanatan and picked up one Sanjay Barik to serve the purpose.

Supported by the party in power, Sanjay, who was once said to be a close confidant of Mahakud, held continuous strike in the mines and became able to cease the transporting work with the help of affected villagers. It is alleged that Sanjay had promised the villagers to give a share out of profit more than what Mahakud was giving.

Accordingly, “Baba Dhabaleswar Transporting Committee” with Sanjay Barik as its head and villagers, who broke away from Mahakud, as its members was formed. Then, an agreement was signed between the newly formed committee and the Indrani Patnaik Mines on February 1, 2019 to hand over some parts of Mahakud-led agency’s transporting work to Sanjay-led agency. But dispute started in the committee when Sanjay didn't give a share of profit to the members.

Villagers held discussions with Sanjay many times in this regard, but in vain. Finally, they sat on a dharna and threatened to cease the transporting work if Baba Dhabaleswar Committee is allowed to transport materials further and is not blacklisted soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/villagers-stage-dharna-at-indrani-patnaik-mines.html

Those farmers who do not have a KCC will be needed to be covered through the special drive, said a senior official in Union Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation.

This will help all such farmers to get short term loan for crop and animal/fish rearing at a maximum interest of 4 per cent on timely repayment.

Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued to all the State Governments and Managing Directors of all the banks and the Chairman, NABARD, detailing the procedure to be followed for coverage of the PM-KISAN beneficiaries under KCC.

The farmers will be approached through line departments of the State Government, including Departments of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj.

Bank Sakhis under the NRLM scheme would also be used for motivating PM KISAN beneficiaries to visit the concerned bank branches for the purpose.

As the KCC along with benefit of interest subvention has now been extended to animal husbandry and fisheries farmers also, the State Governments have also been requested to focus on such farmers and facilitate sanction of additional credit limit/issue fresh KCC to them.

All banks have been advised to have separate counters for handling such applications and ensure issue of fresh KCC or enhancement of the existing KCC limit or activation of inoperative KCC account within the shortest possible time not exceeding 14 days from date of submission of application.

Progress of the drive will be monitored on a daily basis by the State/UT Governments. Activities under saturation drive in a district would be led by the district Collector with full support of the Lead District Manager and DDM, NABARD.

In addition to the KCC, with a view to provide social security to the PM KISAN beneficiaries, eligible farmers will also be enrolled for the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY) and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti BeemaYojana (PMJJBY), after obtaining their consent.

57,15-2-20,Legislative awareness poor in U’khand,"Lack of legislative awareness and apathy of successive Governments has ensured that the number of sittings of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha in a year have never fulfilled the minimum mandatory requirement.

The House functioning rules of the Assembly mandate that at least 60 sittings of the legislature should be held in a year. But in Uttarakhand only 15 to 20 sittings usually take place in a year which is less than one third of the minimum required sittings. The rules however give overriding power to the assembly speaker on functioning of the house that has diluted the 60 day mandate.

The data of the Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha show that maximum number of sittings so far has occurred in the year 2003 when 23 sittings were held during three sessions of the assembly.

Last year only 17 sittings of the assembly were organised. With the budget session of the assembly slated for only five days from March 3 to 7 this year, the numbers of sittings this year too are expected to be on the lower side. Usually the budget session of any assembly is of maximum duration and in states like Uttar Pradesh this session extends almost to a month.

In Uttarakhand the budget session is usually of eight days and this year with assembly slated to have only five sittings, the budget session of 2019 would be the shortest budget session in the history of Uttarakhand. It is worth mentioning here that the business of the house is decided by the government and in Uttarakhand the successive governments have failed to ensure enough business for the house during all these years. In an example of the apathy of law makers of the state one finds that very few original bills have been drafted and presented in Vidhan Sabha. Most of the bills which are tabled are amendments in the prevailing acts.

After the creation of the separate state of Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh, UP modifications and adaptations act, 2000 was passed along with state reorganisation act which gave powers to the new legislature to adopt existing acts of UP as such by replacing the name of UP with Uttarakhand.

After it the successive governments have focussed on bringing amendments in these adopted acts and brought very few original acts which would have elicited debates in the house.

The secretary of Uttarakhand Vidhan Sabha, Jagdish Chandra told The Pioneer that the issue of less sittings of assemblies was discussed during the recently held ‘ All India conference of presiding officers of legislatures’ in Dehradun and the unanimous view was that the prevailing law that there should not be a gap of more than six months between two sessions of assembly should be amended to reduce this gap to three months.

If this amendment is passed by the parliament then in place of existing three sessions, four sessions in a year would be organised which would result in increasing the number of sittings.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/legislative-awareness-poor-in-u---khand.html

Based on the CCTV footages, police refuted the ‘traffic jam’ allegation. Taking to Twitter, the police said that the ambulance had reached the private hospital from the Capital Hospital in just 22 minutes and the vehicle had not travelled through the busy junction like AG Square.

But the fact contradicts the allegations made by the deceased’s family. As per the complaint, the ambulance carrying the patient from the hospital moved through AG Square. Due to traffic jam, the vehicle took over one hour to reach the KIMS Hospital for which the kid succumbed.

66,15-2-20,Don’t make J’khand Railway’s dumping yard: CM,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today asked railway officials not make Jharkhand a dumping yard of railways. Holding a meeting with South Eastern Railway General Manager SK Mohanty, the CM said that Jharkhand gives most benefits to the Railways through its natural resources, but Railways does not respond in the same manner.

“The number of trains is not as per the convenience of the people of Jharkhand. Most of the trains are very poor in quality. In AC coaches, a number of Air Conditioners do not have good quality. AC First & AC Two Composite coaches should be installed in Dumka Ranchi Train and Vananchal Express. Such facility should be provided in all trains of Jharkhand so that passengers traveling in every category can travel with convenience,” said CM.

Soren said that Railway over bridge (ROB) should be made in single entity, which means only railway or only State government should make it. He said that it is seen that the bridge over the railway line is made by railway and the approach road is built by the State government. Due to this the alignment of bridge and approach road is also not very accessible. He said that the people, who use them are troubled with the same.

The CM told the GM of South Eastern Railway that wherever the railways are working in Jharkhand and there is a need for permission to cut the trees for making double-lined railway there, in those cases, they should send consolidated proposals so that the Forest Department Clearance can be obtained. Sending in different pieces makes the work more likely to be pending, he added.

Soren said that the Railways should make their plans in such a way that wild animals are not disturbed. Underpass or any other method, which can be done better, should be used. He said that development should never harm forests and wildlife and biodiversity.

In the meeting, the Railways laid various matters regarding its projects, on which the Chief Secretary gave information about the action being taken by the State government in all the cases.

Chief Secretary Dr DK Tiwari, Revenue and Land Reforms Secretary KK Soan, PCCF Shashi Nandkeolyar, Transport Secretary K Ravikumar, SER GM SK Mohanty, DRM, Ranchi, Neeraj Ambastha, including senior Railway officers Jaya Verma Sinha, Saumitra Majumdar, Kamal Baitha, Amit Kanchan, Neeraj Kumar, Devraj Bannerjee alongwith other officers were present in the meeting.

75,15-2-20,ADG CID suspended over 2016 ‘horse-trading’ case,"The State Government suspended Additional Director General (ADG) of Crime Investigation Department (CID) Anurag Gupta on Friday in connection with horse-trading accusations during the 2016 Rajya Sabha elections. The 1990 batch IPS officer was accused of misusing his position to influence the elections by attempting to convince former Minister Yogendra Sao to vote in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Gupta, who then served the position of ADG Special Branch, has found himself in the crosshairs of several political leaders and parties from the UPA fold for his attempts to influence the elections for the upper house of the Parliament in 2016. A First Information Report was also lodged against him with the Jagganathpur Police Station in connection with the horse trading case.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren, during his days as the Leader of Opposition in the house, had been one of the staunchest critics of Gupta. He had on several instances demanded actions against the IPS officer and also accused the former Govt of providing impunity to the officials who were reportedly close to ex-CM Raghubar Das. Since the new Government came to power here, speculations were rife that stern actions will be taken against Gupta. “The decision of his suspension has been taken as per the set rules and procedure,” Soren said on Friday.

Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon on Friday accused the former Government of disobeying the orders of the ECI and delaying actions against Gupta. The IPS officer, he said, was prima facie found guilty, but the former Government did not take stringent actions against him. “Prima facie, he was found involved in the horse-trading case. The ECI too asked them Government to initiate a probe into the matter. We are following the directives of the ECI and taking necessary actions,” said Oraon.

Gupta faced the heat even last year during the General Elections. On April 4, 2019, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had directed transfer of Gupta from his position. The ECI order also specified that the IPS officer should not be given any responsibility in Jharkhand during the General Elections and should not even visit the State.

In 2016, BJP candidates Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Mahesh Poddar bagged the two Rajya Sabha seats from Jharkhand. As many as 79 MLAs in the 81-member house cast their votes during the elections.

However, soon after the results, former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi accused the BJP of using Gupta and then Chief Minister Raghubar Das’ political advisor Ajay Kumar in influencing the elections. Marandi also sent a Compact Disc containing recordings of telephonic conversations between Gupta, Kumar and former Congress Minister Yogendra Sao to the ECI as evidence.

Finding the allegations prima facie true, the ECI had issued a letter to then Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma on June 13, 2017, asking her to immediately initiate criminal proceedings and departmental disciplinary action against the accused persons for misuse of official position, interference in elections, breach of service rules and other relevant offences.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/adg-cid-suspended-over-2016----horse-trading----case.html

77,15-2-20,Ramlila Maidan readies,"Ahead of swearing-in ceremony of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi Chief Minister on Sunday, preparations have started in full swing at the historic Ramlila Maidan which once was the battleground for the AAP convener during the Anna Hazare-led 'India Against Corruption' movement.

Officials of Delhi Government, North Corporation, and Public Works Department are working in tandem to make the venue ready for the occasion. ""We had levelled the ground during the PM's event that took place recently but other ground work needs to be done. We have handed over the charge to the Delhi Government and its PWD is making other necessary arrangements,"" a senior NMC official said.

The official said that other arrangement like providing drinking water and other sanitation facilities are also being done. ""Toilet blocks already are in place in and around the Maidan. CCTV cameras are being installed besides other facilities,"" he added. The sprawling ground, where socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan had addressed a massive gathering during the 'Total Revolution' movement in 1970s, has a capacity of about 1.25 lakh people.

Kejriwal and senior party leader Manish Sisodia has extended an invite to Delhiites to attend his swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan on February 16.

Referring himself as ""son of Delhi"", Kejriwal urged people of Delhi to attend the ceremony. ""Delhiites, your son is going to take oath of Delhi Chief Minister for the third time. You must come to bless your son. Sunday, February 16, 10 am, Ramlila Maidan,"" Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi. Sisodia on Wednesday had urged people to turn out in large numbers to witness the ceremony. ""Everyone in Delhi is invited to come and bless their son, their brother, Arvind Kejriwal and take an oath for a better Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

78,15-2-20,BJP brainstorms reasons for poll loss,"Days after the announcement of Delhi Assembly poll results, the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) Delhi unit leaders were asked to come out with convincing reasons that led to the humiliating loss. All the Delhi BJP leaders, mayors and councillors were present in the brainstorming session held on Thursday eveing.

Winning Delhi Assembly polls has remained a mirage for the BJP ever since it lost to Sheila Dikshit-led Congress in 1998. The BJP has launched an all out campaign to wrest power from the Aadmi Aadmi Party (AAP) but the results exposed ‘the hollowness of the campaign as AAP ran away with 62 seats out 70. BJP's only solace was its number that rose to eight from three MLAs and its share of votes increased from 32 to 38 per cent.

According to sources in BJP, the factor that played crucial role in downfall of the party was the hate speeches. Delhi unit leaders failed in countering Kejriwal's freebies narrative.

""The party failed in handling the issues such as the AAP Government's freebies and the anti-citizenship law protest at Shaheen Bagh,"" said a BJP insider.

In a series of meetings with its party workers, seniors leaders also questioned about the membership drive that had taken place in Delhi prior to the assembly polls. As per BJP records - 18 lakh new members were said to have joined the BJP but that did not translate into votes.

The review meetings were attended by Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari, national general secretaries Arun Singh and Anil Jain and Delhi unit organisation secretary Siddharthan where councilors, workers and local leaders also present while it is pertinent to mention here that Central Election Committee (CEC), this time gave four tickets to four councilors while not even one of them managed to win the seat.

A party insider also said that councilors present in the meeting were asked to submit their reports and assessment also. If sources are to be believed, BJP leaders ruling the municipal corporations failed to make any impression with MCD workers . Voting patterns reflected that AAP got support from all the quarters while BJP failed to do so and that led to its demoralizing loss in the just concluded Delhi polls.

Adding further, BJP workers were also dismayed with the participation of the senior leaders from other states and the ground level workers spent more time in greeting and serving the leaders and it impacted their door to door campaigning.

Party workers also said that the presences of local Members of Parliament (MPs) were also missed on ground. Naming few Hans Raj Hans, Dr Harshvardhan and Gautam Gambhir, workers asserted poor coordination with leadership also one factor in losing battle against AAP whereas AAP workers got plenty of time to convey to the people about the welfare measures of the Arvind Kejriwal government during their intense door to door campaign.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-brainstorms-reasons-for-poll-loss.html

94,15-2-20,Transport Dept to focus on revenue generation,"Transport Minister Champai Soren on Friday asked officials to work on expansion of rural bus services and stressed on the need for revenue generation in a bid to fill the Government’s “empty” coffers. Chairing his first review meeting since taking charge as the Minister for the Transport Department, Soren directed officials to increase the number of applications for driving licences and vehicle registrations, which he said would contribute to the revenue collected by the department.

“The main focus of the Department is to provide better transport facilities and find ways to increase the revenue generated by the transport department,” said Soren, adding that the department, under his leadership, will strive to make necessary changes for betterment of the public.

Transport Secretary K Ravi Kumar said that one of the main agenda for the meeting was to improve transportation facilities in rural Jharkhand and generate more revenue.

“We will come up with ways to expand the rural bus services. The connectivity of Gramin Bus Seva will increase and it will touch new areas,” he said.

“We will also encourage new applications for driving licences and registration of vehicles,” he added.

The Former Raghubar Das-led Government launched the Gramin Bus Seva – a State-run service to connect villages with cities and towns – in 2016 with an aim to make transportation easier in the far flung villages of the tribal State. The Government had marked 23 routes on which it planned to run the bus service. However, the services could not sustain the lack of takers for running the buses, sources said.

While the Government counted the project as an achievement, it failed to find dedicated agencies that were interested in running the buses.

Soon after taking charge as minister, Champai Soren had said that he will add 500 new buses in the project to facilitate traveling from villages to cities. He, however, is yet to comment on how the current Government plans to rope in agencies for running the buses. A few months after the launch of the project in 2016, a few officials had said that finding drivers for the buses was a major challenge in rural areas.

Many buses owned by the Government have also been rotting in different garages due to the former Government’s failure in finding agencies to run the buses.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/transport-dept-to-focus-on-revenue-generation.html

106,15-2-20,Documents shared for research study,"At a ceremony here on Friday, Dr Avanish Kumar Srivastava, Director, CSIR, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research—Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI), Bhopal & Prof Dr Nisanth Nambison, Nodal officer for Research at Govt Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital exchanged documents to undertake a collaborative research study to unravel the mysteries of highly diluted homeopathic medicines.

Highly diluted Homeopathic medicines have been a mystery for the scientific circles. But, studies conducted by Luc Montagnier who won Nobel prize for discovering HIV-AIDS opened up new avenues and a new physical property of highly diluted DNA samples of viruses and bacteria. His study reveals that these highly diluted solutions emit Electro Magnetic Signals (EMS).

Dr Nambison has taken up the task to replicate and find novel physical properties of capturing electromagnetic signals from magnetic photons in homeopathy medicines and other test samples by collaborating with Dr HN Bhargav (Senior Principal Scientist) along with his team Dr Meraj Ahmed, Senior Scientist, Dr Sanjay Panthi, Dr SAR Hashmi, Dr AK Singh of the Highest scientific body for material research in the country CSIR, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI), Bhopal.

The study is one of its kind and holds importance in the present day scenario of attacks and questions being raised on the high dilutions and its effects.

Analysis of the presence of magnetic photons in diluted homeopathic medicine or similar biological samples has been inspiring research for a few decades. Lenger in 2006 reported the presence of magnetic photons in homeopathic potencies using a magnetic resonance method in which two Tesla coils that generate longitudinal waves at distinct resonance frequencies at low micro voltages and the magnetic properties of potencies is determined.

Montagnier in 2007 discovered that a few bacterial and viral DNA arrangements produce low-frequency EM waves in rich aqueous dilutions.

This described phenomenon favors the development of highly precise detection systems for bacterial and viral infections.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/documents-shared-for-research-study.html

Several political leaders led by BJP National General Secretary, Ram Madhav, also visited the ground zero of the attack near Lethpora on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway and offered floral tributes to the martyred CRPF jawans.

On the occasion, a memorial built in the memory of martyred CRPF personnel, was inaugurated at the Lethpora camp.

118,15-2-20,Didi jibe at Shah over disapproval of ‘goli maro’,"In an apparent reference to Home Minister Amit Shah’s admission that the BJP’s’ ‘goli maro’ rhetoric might have worked against the party’s interest in Delhi elections, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said the saffron leadership should have kept this in mind while they were spreading hate campaign before the elections.

“Where senior leaders gave hate speech and induce the youth to take up arms it is but natural that they will resort to taking up guns in their hands. They (BJP) should have thought about it before the elections,” she said asking “what will the workers do if you induce them to shoot at your opponents.” She made the statement while giving speech inside the State Assembly.

Referring to the incidents of attack on the Opposition in the BJP-ruled States Banerjee said, “it is time to change their rhetoric.” Alleging that the Bengal BJP leaders were still making violent speeches Banerjee said “a few leaders that you (BJP) have sent in Bengal are still not prepared to mend their ways. They are still spreading hatred … But I warn them this will not help them in Bengal.”

Alleging that the BJP and RSS were actively converting the Aadi Vasis (tribal people) into Hinduism Banerjee said “such practices were never seen in Bengal earlier.

The BJP and RSS are converting the Aadi Vasis in the garb of organising mass marriages. They should refrain from doing so,” warning once again that National Register for Citizens will not be invoked in Bengal.

“There will be no NRC in Bengal,” Banerjee said adding she would write to the Chief Ministers of all the non-BJP states to unite against NRC.

While Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had on Thursday attacked the State Government for refusing to implement the central schemes so as to benefit the common people Banerjee targeted her Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath’s government alleging it had failed to give protection to the women.

“In Bengal, we have laws to protect women. Police act immediately when there is crime against women but look at UP where victims are burnt alive and their families are attacked,” she said.

Banerjee also rued that she was not invited to the inaugural ceremony of the Kolkata East-West Metro corridor though she had worked very hard as the Railway Minister to bring the project to Kolkata.

Meanwhile, the Bengal BJP line seemed to be divided over the use of hate speeches during the elections.

The debate over the future strategy came up after the BJP suffered a humiliating defeat in Delhi at the hands of the Aam Aadmi Party which won the polls for the third consecutive time on the plank of good governance.

The saffron party won only 8 seats while the AAP bagged 62 in the 70-member House.

While a section of the leaders including Chandra Bose the grand nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose said that “the party should contest elections on the issue of good governance” rather than strong rhetoric based on hatred those backing state president Dilip Ghosh opposed the view.

Supporting party MP Swapan Dasgupta’s views he tweeted “Agree with Swapan Dasgupta that Bengal (BJP) must have a CM face who could match up to the stature of Mamata Banerjee. In public life-nothing is private! The BJP must have a Bengal Centric strategy for WB.”

Dasgupta had earlier said that ideological issues must be supplemented by governance agenda. He also spoke in favour of a Chief Ministerial face to counter the stature of Mamata Banerjee.

However State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the BJP had its own way of functioning. “That is not the way the BJP works” he said while another state level leader said “the strategy that had given us 18 out of 42 seats should be pursued because Bengal is different from Delhi. You will have to counter TMC’s aggressive strategy by a matching aggression.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/didi-jibe-at-shah-over-disapproval-of----goli-maro---.html

120,15-2-20,Navy told to promote victimised officer,"Taking a serious view of a submarine officer resigning after allegedly victimised by a senior Vice Admiral, who wanted to promote his son-in-law, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) here has ordered the Navy to promote the officer to the rank of the Captain. The victimised officer, Commander SS Luthra, had retired some years back after he was denied promotion.

Luthra was one of the handpicked officers trained in Russia, to handle the nuclear reactors of India's nuclear submarines INS Arihant and INS Chakra. He had to quit the Navy allegedly due to discrimination, according to his counsel Ankur Chhibber.

Directing the Navy to promote Luthra, the order said, ""The officer is entitled to promotion and will be promoted notionally and granted the substantive rank of Captain from the original date of his batch. He will be entitled to pay accordingly till the date of retirement and thereafter, pension and terminal benefits for his enhanced rank of Captain.""

This is the second time that the AFT has given a judgment in favour of Luthra as in 2017 it had asked the Navy to hold a fresh promotion board for him after it was found that a senior Vice Admiral in-charge of officers working on nuclear submarines allegedly manipulated the system in a way that only his son-in-law got promoted while others were overlooked.

The tribunal had also expunged the marks given to Luthra by the senior Vice Admiral. However, the review promotion board held in 2018 also did not promote him as the tribunal found that the officer was given low-value judgment marks by the members of the board.

Taking a strong view against the review promotion board, the Armed Forces Tribunal bench headed by Chairman Justice Rajendra Menon said, ""Clearly, arbitrariness, contrary to the policy and against the principles of natural justice, is writ large in the Special Review Board and therefore, it is liable to be set aside.""

The court also did not show faith in the Navy to carry out a fresh promotion board for the officer saying, ""In these circumstances, sending back the case to the respondents to reverse the apparent injustice is most likely to be an exercise in futility and will result only in further delay in justice being delivered to the officer,"" Menon said in his order.

The court stated that it was satisfied that the Navy's special promotion board did not conduct its exercise in the manner it was supposed to do. ""The Tribunal is duty-bound not only to protect a person from being subjected to violation of law but to advance justice and not to thwart it,"" it said.

Luthra, in his original plea, had alleged that the Vice Admiral was the senior reviewing officer (SRO) for officers serving in both INS Chakra and INS Arihant from 2010-12 as the inspector-general, nuclear safety-officer in-charge, for securing nuclear submarines and secret projects of the force. It was alleged that the Vice Admiral manipulated the naval system in such a way that he has been either the reviewing officer or senior reviewing officer for his own son-in-law on various occasions.

Due to this, other officers who were being considered in the same promotion board as his son-in-law stood at a disadvantage, the petition had claimed.

The Navy and the Vice-Admiral had gone to the court against the Tribunal order in 2017 but it was rejected and the senior officer was asked to pay a reduced fine of Rs 1 lakh from Rs 5 lakh to Luthra.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/navy-told-to-promote-victimised-officer.html

Officials said Wani was summoned to the NIA headquarters here on Thursday and questioned about providing funds to Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmed, alias Naveed Babu, and others.

After ascertaining his suspected role in terror funding, the sleuths arrested him and he was taken to Jammu, to be produced before the designated NIA court.

Wani's arrest is the sixth in the case being probed under various sections of Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Explosives Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Besides Wani, the agency had earlier arrested the the Deputy SP, Naveed, Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Rafi Ahmed Rather and Irfan Shafi Mir, who claims to be an advocate.

Naveed's brother, Syed Irfan Ahmed, was also arrested after he was brought from Punjab. Irfan was in constant touch with his brother Naveed who had asked him to look for an accommodation in Chandigarh where they could go to escape the harsh winter of Kashmir.

The case came to light after Singh, who was accompanying Naveed, Mir and Rather, was intercepted by police near Qazigund on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway last month and arrested. Singh's arrest came following a tip-off from the Intelligence Bureau.

Naveed and his associates Mir and Rather were suspected to be traveling to the national capital before being apprehended by the police. Naveed carried a reward of Rs 20 lakh on his head and was on the hit-list of the Army.

Singh is suspected to have been facilitating a host of terrorists in lieu of money for providing them hideouts as also official vehicles for transporting them within the Valley and beyond.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-arrests-loc-trade-organisation-president-tanveer-ahmed-wani.html
122,15-2-20,SC notice to J&K on plea against Omar's detention,"The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Jammu & Kashmir administration on a plea filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot challenging the detention of her brother and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act.

A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee issued notice to the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir on Pilot's plea and posted the matter for further hearing on March 2.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Pilot, told the apex court that it is a habeas corpus petition and Omar has been kept in detention since August 4 last year.

Habeas corpus is a writ seeking production of person, who has allegedly been in illegal detention, before a court.

""He was in detention under section 107 of the CrPC. Now, he has been detained under the PSA,"" Sibal said.

To this, the bench asked him, ""What are the grounds of detention? Let us see.""

Sibal referred to the dossier handed over to Omar by the Superintendent of Police and said the grounds of detention are already mentioned there.

He said the dossier claimed that Omar has been detained under the PSA to avoid statements by the political leader, prevent violence and maintenance of law and order.

""Has any petition been filed in the Jammu & Kashmir high court by anybody on your behalf? Verify whether anything is pending there,"" the bench told Sibal and asked him to file an affidavit in this regard. The senior advocate told the court that nobody has filed anything in the high court on their behalf and the bench can record his statement on this. ""No counter affidavit is required in the matter as grounds of detention are already there,"" he said.After issuing notice, the bench said the matter will be heard after three weeks. Sibal urged the court that the matter be heard next week as it is a habeas corpus petition concerning liberty of an individual.

When Sibal said that it would delay the matter, the bench said, ""You have waited for so long. Wait for 15 more days.

Sibal said there was no delay on their part as Omar was in detention since August last year.

""She (Sara) has not waited for one year. He was in detention. He is now in preventive detention under the PSA. Kindly have it next week. It is a fresh detention order,"" he said. To this, the bench said, ""It can't be heard overnight.

127,15-2-20,"All ultras killed, case was hard nut to crack for NIA","The probe into last year's Pulwama terror strike that left 40 CRPF personnel dead has virtually reached a dead end with five persons, who were either conspirators or executers of the ghastly attack, being eliminated by security forces in various encounters.

However, the case threw unique challenges for the NIA, the anti-terror probe agency formed in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror strikes in 2008, as it there is no solid information about the perpetrators or the mastermind behind the attack.

“It was a blind case for us. There were lot of murmurs but everything needs to be established beyond doubt in the court of law,” a senior official, who is part of the probe, said here.

The first challenge was to establish the owner of the car used by suicide bomber Adil Ahmed Dar. There was nothing available from the vehicle which carried a cocktail of explosives like Ammonium Nitrate, Nitro Glycerine and RDX, the official said.

But with the help of forensic methods and painstaking investigations, the serial number of the car that was blown into pieces beyond recognition was extracted and within no time the ownership of the vehicle was established — from the first to the last owner.

However, the last owner of the car, Sajjad Bhat of Bijbehara in Anantnag district, had disappeared hours before the February 14 attack and joined Jaish-e-Mohammed terror outfit. He was subsequently killed in an encounter in June last year.

“While it was clear that the suicide attacker was Adil Ahmed Dar but the same had to be established with evidence. After picking up human remains from various spots, it was sent for DNA profiling.

“The suicide attacker was identified and confirmed by matching the DNA extracted from the meagre car fragments with that of the DNA of his father,” the official, who requested anonymity, said.

The role of other conspirators which included Mudasir Ahmed Khan, Qari Mufti Yasser and Kamran came to light but all of them were killed in different encounters with security forces.

Khan was killed on March 10, Kamran on March 29, Sajjad Bhat on June 18 of last year while Qari yasser was shot in an encounter on January 25, this year.

After JeM spokesperson Mohd Hassan in a video claimed that his group was responsible for the attack, it was sent for forensic examination and the Internet Protocol address was traced to a computer based in Pakistan.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/all-ultras-killed--case-was-hard-nut-to-crack-for-nia.html

The information was conveyed by Director General of Police (DGP), Jammu & Kashmir, Dilbagh Singh who called on Union Minister Jitendra Singh here.

During the meeting, Singh briefed the Minister about the current security scenario in the Union Territory.

The DGP informed the minister that terror-related violence in Jammu & Kashmir had come down by 60 per cent in less than one and a half months in 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, the Government officials said.

At the same time, there has been no major law and order or stone pelting incident at encounter sites or during burials of neutralised terrorists, the Minister was informed.

Officials said a detailed presentation was made before the minister highlighting that up to February 13 in the current year, 24 militants have been neutralised, which includes 20 killed and four arrested.

This is in addition to the arrest of 12 terror operatives involved in grenade attacks in Srinagar and other areas, and the arrest of 43 over ground workers (OGWs) who were providing all kind of assistance and logistical support to various cadres of different terror outfits.

Of the 24 militants neutralised so far in 2020, the DGP's report indicated that 10 militants were affiliated with the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), three militants had recently infiltrated the UT and were neutralised at Ban Toll Plaza, Jammu and 11 were from Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) outfit.

The minister appreciated the performance of the security forces and close coordination between Jammu & Kashmir Police (JKP) and the paramilitary forces, saying it had become much more cohesive and effective after the imposition of Governor's rule and creation of the Union Territory, officials said.

He also expressed satisfaction that in the last one and a half months, there has been no major law and order problem in the UT.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/terror-violence-in-j-k-down-by-60--since-jan--dgp-tells-minister.html
129,15-2-20,"Wall being built to hide slum area, says Cong","Ahead of US President DonaldTrump's visit to Ahmedabad on February 24, the opposition Congress has alleged the BJP-ruled civic body here is building a 500-metre long wall near the airport to block view of a slum colony.The Congress said the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is constructing the wall to keep the slum colony, where people live in poverty, out of sight of the US President.

Refuting the allegations, AMC officials on Friday said the construction of the wall, around four feet in height, was approved much before Trump's Gujarat visit was finalised.

The wall is being built on an AMC-owned plot in Sardarnagar, which has several slum structures, and is situated along a road that leads to the Indira bridge on the outskirts of the city from the Ahmedabad International Airport.

Deputy Municipal Commissioner K B Thakkar said it was not clear if the route, on which the wall is being built, will be used by the US president's motorcade.

“This wall, around 500-meter-long and four feet high, has nothing to do with Trump's visit. A wall was already there since many years. After it got dilapidated, we decided to build a new one. An online tender was also issued over a month back, much before Trump's visit was announced. This is compound wall is surrounding our plot,” said Thakkar.

Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi alleged the wall was being built to hide the stark reality of people living in penury in the area.

“The BJP government and the AMC are trying their best to hide reality from Trump. Instead of alleviating poverty, the ruling dispensation is hiding the poor by building a wall. It proves that poverty has increased manifold during the BJP's 25-year rule in Gujarat.

“Such tactics of hiding poor people were also used when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the city in 2014. This is very unfortunate,” said Doshi.

According to another AMC official, this slum locality, along the road from the airport to Indira bridge, is part of Sardarnagar township and the civic body has been trying to make the lives of residents there better.

“This wall was planned over a month back and it has nothing to do with Trump's visit. Senior officials had visited the slum area to understand their problems.

“We have even constructed pay-and-use toilets for them. This wall is necessary to protect a nearby green patch from garbage dumping by slum-dwellers,” the second official said.

Earlier this week, it was announced that Trump will start his two-day India visit from Ahmedabad, where he will take part in a grand roadshow, visit the Sabarmati Ashram and inaugurate a newly-built cricket stadium with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 24.

During his visit to Modi's home state Gujarat, Trump, along with the Indian prime minister, would participate in a grand roadshow, planned along a 7-km stretch from the Ahmedabad airport to the Sabarmati Ashram, sources had said.

If this route is used for the road show, the slum locality near Indira bridge, which is on the opposite direction, will not come into the picture, said officials.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wall-being-built-to-hide-slum-area--says-cong.html

Khan was arrested by the UP Special Task Force from Mumbai on January 29 for allegedly promoting enmity between different religions through the speech he had delivered during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at AMU on December 12.

“NSA has been slapped on Dr Kafeel. He will remain in jail,” Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Akash Kulhari to PTI over phone.

In Aligarh, District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh told reporters that Kafeel Khan's speech at AMU was instrumental in triggering violent incidents at the university on December 13 and 15.

“We had apprehensions that after his release on bail, Dr Kafeel Khan would have caused more law and order issues in the state,” the district magistrate said.

Criticising his detention under the stringent law, Khan's brother Adil Khan said the government wanted him to “remain quiet”.

The NSA allows preventive detention for several months if the authorities believe the person is a threat to national security or law and order.

Kafeel Khan is currently lodged in Mathura jail depsite bail granted to him by a court in the case, registered against him at the Civil Lines police station in Aligarh for promoting enmity between different religions.

Adil Khan said, “The government is trying to silence my brother. A few days ago, during a programme on a TV news channel, he had revealed that at BRD Medical College (Gorakhpur), many children are dying daily but the government is hiding the facts and data.”

“The (Mathura) jail was about to release him on Friday at 6 am.

“This court wants to express that such persons cannot be called as traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law. It will be act of protest and only against the government for the reason of CAA,” the court said in its order.

The bench noted the orders passed by the magistrate and police were only because the petitioner and his companions wanted to agitate against CAA.

It said, presently, such agitations were going on everywhere and there was no whisper of agitations of other nature in this region.

“We must keep in mind we are a democratic republic country and our Constitution has given us rule of law and not rule of majority. When such act (CAA) is made, some people may be of a particular religion like Muslims may feel that it is against their interest and such act needs to be opposed,” the bench said in its order.

It noted that it is the duty of the government to approach such persons, have talks with them and try to convince them.

“India got freedom due to agitations which were non- violent and this path of non-violence is followed by the people of this country till date.

A day after State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP said that he had been “overruled” his stand by withdrawing objections to the NIA taking over the investigations into the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case, Pawar voiced his unhappiness over Uddhav agreeing to hand over the case to the central investigating agency.

Talking to media persons at Kolhapur in western Maharashtra, Pawar said: “Under the Constitution, maintaining law & order is a State subject. In the first place, it was improper on the Centre to encroach upon the rights of the state and take over the case from the Pune police. It was much more improper on the state government’s part to support the Centre’s move (to ask the NIA to take over the case).

Alluding to the Chief Minister’s decision to withdraw the State Government’s objections to NIA taking over the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case, Pawar said: “The Chief Minister has powers to decide on whether or not to hand over the case to the NIA. But, our stand on the issue has that in the Bhima-Koregaon case, the conduct of state home department officials was objectionable. …Meetings took place between 9 am and 11 am (in Mumbai) and the Centre took the decision (to hand over the case to the NIA) at 3 pm (on January 25)”.

On his part, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had said on Thursday: “The Bhima-Koregaon case earlier being investigated by the Maharashtra police After the Centre handed over the case to the NIA, as the Home Minister of the state I had taken a stand that if the Union Government wanted to hand over the probe to the NIA, it should have taken the State Government into confidence. We had taken the same stand, while fighting the case in Pune court. All I can say is that the chief minister has the power to overrule my stand”.

It may be recalled that on January 25 —a day after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) handed over the investigations in the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case to the NIA, a miffed Pawar had charged that the ruling BJP – with an acute fear of being exposed in the case – had hurriedly handed over the investigations to the NIA. He had demanded that an independent panel to set up to hold comprehensive probe into the manner in which the Pune police had investigated the case. “Only an independent probe will bring out truth in the case,” he said.

“The re-investigations are necessary in the case, because the Centre’s move has aroused suspicions. The Centre’s decision to hand over the case to the NIA within hours after the State’s deputy chief minister and Home Minister reviewed the case with the state’s police officials. Under the Constitution, powers of dealing with law and order have been vested with the States. The Centre might have apprehended that if a re-investigation is ordered into the case, the previous BJP gove3rnment and its hand-picked officials might be exposed,” Pawar had said.

“Prima facie it appears that the Pune police misused their powers during the investigations. The Centre may have handed over the case to the NIA, but there is a need for the state government to investigate if the Pune police misused their powers to frame the activists in the case,” Pawar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pawar-slams-uddhav-govt-allowing-nia-takeover.html
137,15-2-20,Pune court orders to shift case records to NIA court in Mumbai,"A day after the Maharashtra government agreed in principle to let the NIA take over investigations into the the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case, a Pune Sessions Court on Friday ordered that all the records relating to the case be transferred to the Special NIA (National Investigation Agency) court in Mumbai.

Pune Sessions Court’s Special judge SR Navandar ruled that though the Maharashtra Government had not made a formal submission that it had no objection to the NIA taking over the case, his court did not have powers to continue with the case.

The Judge directed all accused to be present before the NIA court in Mumbai on February 28.

The investigations handed over to the NIA relate to the cases registered against 23 activists in connection with the violence that erupted on January 1, 2018 at a gathering of thousands of Dalits at Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district who were celebrating 200th anniversary of

January 1, 1818 victory of British troops over Peshwa Bajirao at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, and the provocative speeches delivered by the activists at an Elgaar Parishad held in Pune on December 31, 2017, a day before the celebrations at Bhima Koregaon.

Nine of the accused hare been booked for their alleged links with the CPI-Maoist links.

It may be recalled that the police had arrested ten CPI (Maoist) activists in two batches in connection with the Elgar Parishad-cum- Bhima-Koregaon riots case. They were among the 15 activists against whom the police had registered cases. The five are still absconding.

The activists against whom charge-sheets have been filed for serious offences are: Sudhir P. Dhawale, Rona J. Wilson, Surendra P. Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh S. Raut, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Pereira, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha.

They have been booked for their association with the Elgaar Parishad held in Pune a day ahead of the January 1, 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots and their alleged links with the Maoists.

All of them have been booked for serious offences under unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 117 ( abetting commission of offence), 120-b ( conspiracy) read with 34 (common intention), 121, 121 (A) (Waging or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India) 124A (sedition), 153 –A (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot..) and 505-1b (statements conducing public mischief) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

138,15-2-20,"HC denies anticipatory bail to Navlakha, Teltumbde","The Bombay High Court on Friday declined to grant anticipatory bail to civic rights Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde in the Elgar Parishad case.

However, Justice Prakash D Naik of the High Court extended interim protection from arrest granted to both of them for four weeks so they could approach the Supreme Court in appeal.

While Navlakha had moved the high court after a special Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) court in Pune rejected his anticipatory bail plea on November 12, 2019, Teltumbde had approached the court for anticipatory bail in February 2019.

The special court in Pune had earlier rejected Navalkha’s anticipatory bail plea after observing that the Prosecution had sufficient material to show that Navlakha was “not only a member of the banned organisation but an active leader”.

Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde were among the activists booked in connection with an FIR registered on January 8,2018 at the Pune’s Vishram Baug Police Station in connection with the Elgaar Parishad organised at Shaniwar Wada on December 31, 2017 by the leftist outfit Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) and Republican Panthers Party ahead of the January 1, 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots.

The Vishrambaug police had registered the FIR on the basis of a complaint lodged a local builder Tushar Damgude, who had alleged the members CPT (Maoist) and Kabir Kala Manch had spread hatred through provocative songs, plays and speeches delivered at Elgaar Parishad held on December 31, 2017, which led to violence following the incident at Bhima-Koregaon.

The FIR, originally registered u/s 153(A), 505 (1)(b), 117 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), had made out a conspiracy case in March 2018 and relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) were added to the case latter.

The investigators have been claiming right from day one that the evidence gathered by them had shown that the CPI (Maoist) had hatched conspiracy to form an all India united front “to overthrow the government established by the law” and that the Elgar Parishad had been organised in Pune on December 31, 2017 as part of this conspiracy.

They had also said that the plot hatched Maoist to carry out “Rajiv Gandhi-type” assassination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was part of their conspiracy.

In 2018, the Pune police had arrested ten activists with alleged Maoist links made police in two batches --- five on June 6 and another five on August 28 -- as part of their investigations into the FIR registered on January 8,2018 at the Pune’s Vishrambaug Police Station in connection with the Elgaar Parishad organised on December 31, 2017 by the leftist outfit Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) and Republican Panthers Party ahead of the January 1, 2018 Bhima-Koregaon riots.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hc-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-navlakha--teltumbde.html

PWD Minister and PCC president A Namassivayam said in a press release on Friday that the Centre has been “zealously going ahead to deprive the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the Backward Classes” of the fruit of reservation in education and employment.

The recent trend to ensure that the benefit of reservation was not “available” to the depressed sections is highly “condemnable.”

The architect of Constitution Dr B R Ambedkar had framed the necessary blueprint for reservation to promote the wellbeing of the downtrodden and to procure social justice to them, he said and added that the first Indian Prime Minister and also the Congress regimes at the Centre nurtured the policy of reservation in the past.

But, the present BJP-led NDA had been trampling upon the reservation policy ever since it came to power at the Centre.

Namassivayam said the ruling Congress would hold a demonstration at the head post office here on February 16 to condemn the Centre’s “anti-poor” policies.

The Centre is also trying to use the recent verdict of Supreme Court that “reservation is not a fundamental right” to dilute the reservation principles as envisaged by the stalwarts of the downtrodden people.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/congress-demo-to-condemn-centre---s----anti-people----policies-on-feb-16.html

The state of the art facility equipped with CCTV cameras, jammers and webcast networks, the project will ensure proper transport connectivity including that by metro for the convenience of examinees, examiners, guardians and other related staff. A police contingent barrack will also be built in the complex to ensure round the clock vigil.

The examination hall is the brainchild of Bihar State Examination Board (BSEB) Chairman Anand Kishore and will be developed in the State capital Patna. Besides BSEB’s mandate of conducting secondary and higher school examinations the mega hall will be monetized to use it for academic purposes like holding of entrance and examinations by big establishments like UPSC, BPSC, SSC, Banking Services etc. “This project is very close to my heart due to encouragement received from the Chief Minister (Nitish Kumar). The examination complex will have all international standards technology to ensure a fair examination,” Kishore told The Pioneer.

Credited with changing the secondary examination system in Bihar which was earlier marred by rampant cheatings and unfair means, Kishore was here to inaugurate BSEB’s first Regional Centre in Delhi.

Millions of students who come to Delhi-NCR to pursue higher education every year will be benefited as the facility of collecting migration, duplicate mark sheet, alteration in certificates and certificate verification can be done at the regional office.

Not only this, millions of people working in Delhi-NCR will not have to go to Bihar for the above mentioned works.

Talking about the Bihar Examination complex, a senior BSEB official present at the Delhi RO said it will have 40 halls with an equated seating capacity of 21000 examinees and an another set of 20 halls with a seating capacity of about 4000 candidates for taking online examinations like GMAT, GRE, SAT.

The complex will have facilities for examiners and invigilators like guest rooms, canteens etc. A presentation to this effect has been made by the BSEB Chairman to Chief Minister last week.

Inaugurating the Delhi office, Kishore said the Regional office will help in better coordination with Delhi-based educational institutions including Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

Kishore was brought as Chairman BSEB three years ago after an image of people helping their wards in cheating went viral and at a time when there were reports that students passed their class 10th and 12th examinations even visiting the examination centre and obtain their pass certificates.

Recently Nepal Education Board and Chhattisgarh School Board sought tips and mechanism by BSES in conducting fair examinations.

Ever since the 1996 batch Bihar cadre IAS, took over as BSES Chairman he has enforced strictness by making use technology in the conduct of entire examination process and simultaneously mass suspensions of corrupt officials and action against people involved in corrupt practices.

141,15-2-20,Markets fall for 2nd day as SC ruling triggers selling in bank stocks,"Markets spiralled lower for the second straight day on Friday as banking shares slumped after the Supreme Court took a strong note of telcos not complying with its order to pay Rs 1.47 lakh crore in statutory dues.

The 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 202.05 points or 0.49 per cent to end at 41,257.74, with 22 of its constituents closing with losses. The broader NSE Nifty shed 61.20 points or 0.50 per cent to settle at 12,113.50 as banking, auto, FMCG and energy counters retreated.

The Supreme Court on Friday directed the top echelons of telecom firms to explain why contempt action should not be taken against them for non-compliance of its order to pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the telecom department.

The order raised concerns over banks’ exposure to AGR-hit telcos, mainly Vodafone Idea which reported more than Rs 6,000 crore loss for the October-December quarter.

IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 4.38 per cent, followed by PowerGrid, SBI, Hero MotoCorp and NTPC.

On the other hand, Bharti Airtel was the top gainer, spurting 4.69 per cent, with analysts saying the Indian telecom sector could turn into a duopoly.

Vodafone Idea, which is staring at statutory dues worth Rs 53,000 crore, plummeted 23.21 per cent.

“Supreme Court ruling on telecom players instructing them to pay dues by March 17th will impact the asset quality of banks having decent exposure in the sector.

Banks stocks will be under pressure given high inflation and RBI being unlikely to cut rates in the near-term. Indian market is impacted due to fall in global market due to increase in coronavirus cases,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

Rate-sensitive auto stocks dropped as official data showed wholesale inflation rising to 3.1 per cent in January, further reducing prospects of a rate cut by RBI.

Hero MotoCorp dropped by 2.24 per cent, Mahindra & Mahindra by 1.91 per cent and Maruti by 1.24 per cent.

FMCG major ITC fell 1.98 per cent and HUL by 1.20 per cent following concerns over rising costs due to pick up in inflation.

HCL Tech rose 1.42 per cent, ICICI Bank 0.9 per cent, RIL 0.86 per cent and Tech Mahindra by 0.72 per cent, limiting the fall in the Sensex.

On a weekly basis, the Sensex climbed 115.89 points or 0.28 per cent, while the Nifty gained 15.15 points or 0.12 per cent.

Globally, Asian markets reeled under the coronavirus threat after a dramatic spurt in the number of deaths and new cases fuelled suspicion that China might be concealing the true scale of the epidemic.

Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index closed 0.59 per cent lower, but Shanghai recovered from early losses to end up 0.38 per cent.

London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.42 per cent in opening trade while the Paris CAC 40 index shed 0.19 per cent.

On the currency front, the Indian rupee on Friday fell by 6 paise to close at 71.37 (provisional) against the US dollar tracking heavy selling in domestic equities and strengthening of the American currency in the overseas market.

Forex traders said the rupee consolidated in a narrow range as strengthening of the US dollar, rise in crude oil prices and heavy selling in domestic equities weighed on the local unit.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened on a positive note at 71.29. During the day, it lost ground and touched a low of 71.41 and finally settled 6 paise lower at 71.37 against the US currency. The domestic unit had settled at 71.31 against US dollar on Thursday.

“Today, as we sign the concession agreements for Mangaluru, Lucknow & A’bad with the AAI, its the beginning of another historic journey catering to India’s exponential airport infra demands,” Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said in a tweet.

Three subsidiaries of the group — Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Ltd, Adani Lucknow International Airport Ltd and Adani Mangaluru International Airport Ltd — have signed concession agreements with AAI.

In 2018, the government decided to privatise airports at Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvanantha-puram, and Guwahati. It was for operation, management and development of these aerodromes through public-private partnership model.

Adani Enterprises had won the rights to run these six airports after competitive bidding process. In a tweet, the AAI said the concession fee would be utilised for the maintenance and development of brownfield airports along with RCS-UDAN and other greenfield airports.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/adani-group--aai-sign-pacts-for-managing-3-airports.html

155,15-2-20,"Wholesale inflation accelerates to 3.1% in Jan on costlier onion, potato","Wholesale prices-based inflation accelerated to a 10-month high of 3.10 per cent in January mainly due to costlier food articles, particulary onion and potato, official data showed on Friday.

The wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.59 per cent in December 2019, and 2.76 per cent in January 2019, as per the data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

The earlier high was recorded in April 2019, when the WPI inflation stood at 3.18 per cent. During January this year, the rate of price rise for food articles stood at 11.51 per cent as against 13.24 per cent a month earlier.

Inflation in the vegetable category stood at 52.72 per cent, while onion prices spurted by a whopping 293 per cent, followed by potato at 87.84 per cent. In the manufactured food category, wholesale inflation was recorded at 0.34 per cent against a negative print of 0.25 per cent in December. Likewise for fuel and power category, it was at 3.42 per cent against (-) 1.46 per cent.

Meanwhile, ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the WPI inflation could go up further in the coming months mainly because of higher import duties.

“Higher customs duties would push up the inflation related to imports to some extent going forward.

However, the impact of the spread of the coronavirus on risk sentiment and commodity prices, including crude oil, is expected to exert a substantial moderation on the wholesale inflation in February 2020,” she said.

Nayar attributed the uptick in inflation for manufactured food items to a spike in various edible oils as well as dairy products, which she said is expected to sustain in the coming months.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/wholesale-inflation-accelerates-to-3-1--in-jan-on-costlier-onion--potato.html
156,15-2-20,Need India-Portugal joint expertise in various areas of economy: Portuguese President,"Terming India as an ""economic and social"" global power, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on Saturday said the country's priority is to have joint expertise in various areas of the economy.

A forum, organised by industry bodies, CII, ASSOCHAM and Ficci, was also attended by Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva, Secretary of State of Internationalisation of Portuguese Republic, Eurico Brilhante Dias, and Union Minister for Railways and Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, besides industry leaders from the two countries.

""India is a global power. It's an economic global power, it is social global power. It is the largest democracy in the world. It is a trustable partner,"" Sousa said in his keynote address at the India-Portugal Business Forum here.

""We are trustable. The evolution about the economy shows it,"" the President said.

Stating that both India and Portugal know each other for a long time, Sousa said both Portugal and India are not just the European or Asian countries or cultures but they are ""universal"".

""We like building bridges. We are very good at it,"" he said adding that be it in the area of culture, education, scientific or economic, the nations are good at buildings bridges.

""For very long, we converged multilaterally, I mean established diplomatic relations,"" Sousa said.

The President said the two countries work with the world, for the world be it for the peace, freedom, sustainable development or climate change.

""The priority for us to have your expertise, our expertise, joint expertise as quickly. And this is the right time. First of all, India is a global power. It is an economic global power and is a social global power, it is the largest democracy in the world. He said the business community has a role to play in the economic bilateral because politicians create the framework. They open the way, they paved the way but they do not act in economics, in business every day.""

Such forums are helpful in finding out in which field India can benefit from Portuguese expertise or vice versa.

He cited some of the industries and sectors such as tourism, renewable energies, ICT, environment, infrastructures, water, sanitation, public works, electrical mobility, construction and maritime transport, among others, as the some of the industries and sectors which had the potential for investment.

""The priority for us (is) to have your expertise, our expertise, joint expertise as quickly,"" Sousa said.

Addressing the forum, Goyal said both India and Portugal are focused on economic growth, investment, industry and innovation.

The minister said that during his meeting with the Portuguese business delegation on Friday, he did discuss various sectors such as real estate and infrastructure development.

In Goa, he suggested a government-to-government partnership to promote tourism and create the entire ecosystem around tourism.

""I believe if we were to work together to create a mini-Portugal in Goa, we could truly make it a preferred destination for visitors from around the world,"" Goyal said.

""I believe that it is an area which I hope during the your (President Sousa) visit to Goa, we can discuss with the government there,"" he said.

He said the Indian government is keen to expand its relationship with Portugal, he said.

""Also, as we look forward to expanding our relations with the European Union and as you assume the presidency of the EU in 2021, we do hope to see a great impetus in the EU-India ties under your presidency,"" Goyal said.

India has a number of opportunities to work together in several areas, he said adding that ""the automobile sector is flourishing both in your country and in India. And, I am sure we can partner to look at electric mobility going forward to contribute to sustainability and the environment. There is a good potential for infrastructure and the construction industry"".

He also said it has been decided to hold the next session of the India-Portugal Joint Economic Committee in India soon to review the gamut of the bilateral trade and economic relations.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/need-india-portugal-joint-expertise-in-various-areas-of-economy--portuguese-president-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/need-india-portugal-joint-expertise-in-various-areas-of-economy--portuguese-president.html
157,15-2-20,China rejects US charge of lack of transparency in virus info,"China on Friday rejected US allegations that it is not transparent enough in sharing the details about the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was working with the international community in an “open and highly responsible manner” to contain the global crisis.

China’s comments came after Larry Kudlow, the director of President Donald Trump’s Economic Council, said that the US is little disappointed over not being invited in the medical operations and the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese over coronavirus outbreak.

Stressing that unanswered questions were mounting and there was no sign of the promised cooperation, Kudlow said: “We’re more than willing to work with the WHO on this(coronavirus) and they won’t let us”.

“I don’t know what their motives are. I do know that apparently, more and more people are suffering over there,” Kudlow said in Washington.

The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus outbreak has spiked to nearly 1,500 with 121 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to nearly 65,000, health officials said on Friday.

State-run CGTN reported that 505 cases of the virus were abroad, including 15 cases of the virus in the US. Ever since the coronavirus outbreak that shook China and the world, Beijing has not acceded to requests by the US to permit American specialists to visit the country to take part in the medical operations to counter the virus. Instead, China has permitted a team of the World Health Organisation (WHO) specialists to visit the country and assist it to contain the virus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-rejects-us-charge-of-lack-of-transparency-in-virus-info.html
158,15-2-20,Dems step up attacks to blunt Bloomberg’s rise,"Democratic presidential candidates hoping to revive their flagging campaigns increasingly took aim at Mike Bloomber, blasting their billionaire rival for trying to buy his way into the White House and raising questions about his commitment to racial equality.

Struggling to recover from poor showings in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden took the lead in attacking Bloomberg.

Biden, the former vice president, said on ABC’s “The View” that “I don’t think you can buy an election,” while Warren took Bloomberg to task for his 2008 comments that ending redlining, a discriminatory housing practice, helped trigger the economic meltdown.

Biden and billionaire Tom Steyer also joined forces in slamming Bernie Sanders after the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist won New Hampshire and essentially tied for the lead in Iowa with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

Biden said Sanders hadn’t done enough to explain how he’d pay for his “Medicare for All” proposal to replace private insurance with a government-run program.

Steyer said that “refusal to tell us how he will pay for his plan adds unnecessary financial risk to achieving health care as a right for every person.”

Voters, Steyer said, “should have all the facts.”

The sniping reflects the remarkably fluid state of the Democratic race even after two states that typically winnow presidential fields have already voted.

The White House hopefuls are trying to blunt Bloomberg, who gained attention by flooding the national airwaves with hundreds of millions of dollars in advertisements and is on the verge of being admitted into next week’s presidential debate.

And the lagging candidates are trying to prove that they still have the mettle to stay in the race, even if their path is becoming increasingly difficult.

Warren told The Associated Press on Thursday that she has raised USD 6 million since the February 3 Iowa caucuses, a haul that could silence questions about whether she will soon leave the campaign because of her disappointing showings so far.

She called the race “wide open.” “There’s a lot of froth,” she said. “It’s going to be a long process.” That’s especially true as moderates are struggling to coalesce around a candidate.

Biden has long argued that he’s the most electable, in part because his centrist approach has broad appeal and could make it easier for Democrats to defeat President Donald Trump in the fall. That’s at risk of being undermined by his middling finish in Iowa and New Hampshire.

He’s now staking his campaign on success in the February 29 South Carolina primary, which is the first race in a state with a significant black population.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/dems-step-up-attacks-to-blunt-bloomberg---s-rise.html
159,15-2-20,Two wheels and a route map,"Whether you wish to explore the waterfalls, take in breathtaking sunrises or explore the forests around Ranchi, a bicycle is your best bet, says Kanishka Poddar

Exploring the hinterlands of Ranchi is best done on a bicycle as it takes just 10-15 minutes to get out of the chaotic city and land in middle of unexplored and untouched nature. Each one of these trails are special and will take you through wild forests, beautiful valleys, waterfalls, narrow village roads, archeological sites while at the same time allowing you to indulge in some really delicious local food. Here are some of my favourite trails in and around the capital of Jharkhand.

The Snake Charmer (Ride to the Patratu Valley) — This trail is a dream for every cyclist in the city. It is once in a lifetime where you ride through the steep loops. Certainly not for those whose fitness levels have dipped as the road is at a six-10 per cent incline over three-four km. But the spectacular view as you push forward every mile more than makes up for all the hard work and sweat. Do stop at the beginning of the second set of loops to sip into coconut water being sold by local villagers selling.

Pro Tip: Go slow and stay hydrated. The sun always takes a toll on your body while climbing back.

Distance: 75 km from city centre and back. Difficulty Level: High

Horap forest

Who would believe that there is a beautiful dense forest merely five-eight km away from the city’s centre? Horap used to be home to some wild animals back in days but now it is a green lung for the city. The tree-lined roads are beautiful while the view of the valley from the top of the Horap hill is best described as magical. It is a great place to catch the sun rise as the early morning light touches the stretch of green cover. In the distance, one can see a train looping its way through the hills every hour. There is hardly any motorised traffic which makes the stretch a much sought after by cylcists. For those who love to take things to the extreme, there are plenty of trails for offroading in the forest.

Pro Tip: Once you cross the Hanuman Mandir Chowk, take a right turn and follow the course of road for some 200 mt and then take a U turn. Few metres ahead you will see a Banyan tree which appears to be magical as it keeps on becoming larger with time.

Distance:- 50 km from city centre and back. Difficulty Level: Moderate

Rock formations in Pithoria

This is one of the most popular routes for cyclists in Ranchi. The terrain is almost flat with wide roads and minimal traffic. The shops and small restaurants on the highway are friendly. There are two routes to Pithoria — one, a straight line on Kanke Road which is great for those looking at maxing speed and endurance. The other is via Tagore Hill Road which is way more scenic, has less traffic and has some rock formations on the route with archaeological importance. Puthoria, the end point of the circuit is the starting point to Patratu Valley.

Distance: 40-45 km from city centre and back. Difficulty Level: Easy

Sunset/Sunrise ride to Dhurwa Dam

Dhurwa Dam is a beautiful location on the outskirts of city and is popular with cyclists. Chase sunsets or sunrises at the place. You won’s forget the experience. The view is mesmerising and there is a sense of calmness all around.

Pro Tip: This is place good for stargazing. We once saw 34 shooting stars in one night.

Distance: 35 km from city centre and back. Difficulty Level: Easy

Sunset on Ring Road

If big wide roads and distance is what matters to you? Ring road is your place. The stretch of Ring Road starts at Rampur on Tata Road and ends at Ormanjhi on NH 33, covering a distance of more than 100 kms in what is almost a straight line. The road is wide and has almost no pot holes which makes it conducive to cycling. The ring road also offers the option of detours leading to waterfalls, parks and other routes around the city.

Pro Tip: Keep your self hydrated as there is no shade on this road and the heat will instantly take a toll on your body.

Distance: More than 100 km from the city centre and back.

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Sunset at Dasam Fall

One of my all-time favourite routes around Ranchi is the ride to Dasam. Take the road to Dasam from Khuti Road via Taurian World School and believe me you won’t be disappointed. The road takes you through the green valley of Ranchi, crossing beautiful lakes and bridges, and ends at the mighty Dasam Fall. You will have to carry water and some food as there are limited options available on the route. Make sure to carry a camera as the view is extremely scenic. While the route to Dasam is mostly downhill but while returning, there are steady climbs.

Pro Tip: Make sure you leave Dasam by 4 pm as the route becomes very dark post sunset. I prefer going to the top of the waterfall as there are trails which would take you to some unknown lagoons.

Distance: More than 100 km from city centre and back.

Difficulty Level: High

Hundru Fall

The direct route to Hundru is via NH 33 but I prefer to avoid the highway and take the smaller and less crowded Boriya Road to reach Ormanjhi and then enter the Hundru Fall Road. The road from Morabadi to Ormanjhi takes you through some really beautiful scenic stretches and the famous Orange Forest which is best experienced during spring.

The orange forest

The ride from Ormanjhi to Hundru Fall is beautiful, the roads are covered with trees throughout and have some really good dhabhas. There are two ways to reach Hundru Falls — one from the top and another from bottom. I have always preferred the one leading to the bottom of the fall as the trail is much more beautiful and we don’t have to climb the 500 stairs.

Pro tip: Do make sure you take the bamboo boat and go right under the waterfall. The experience is magical.

Distance: More than 100 km from city centre and back.

Difficulty level: High

Getalsud Dam Ride

Not one of my favourite routes but it is still very scenic and beautiful. The best route to go is via Tatisilwai and then take left from Angara and later exit from Ormanjhi to head back to city. The dam in itself is huge and gorgeous.

Distance: More than 100 km from city centre and back.

Difficulty level: Moderate

Bunglows in the Ganj

McCluskey Ganj is a famous Anglo Indian settlement 60 km from the city. Anglo Indians do not live here any more but they have left behind some beautiful bungalows, bakeries and homestays for us to experience. Unlike the other undulating routes, this one is pretty flat.

Distance: 120 km from city centre and back. Difficulty level: High",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/two-wheels-and-a-route-map-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/two-wheels-and-a-route-map.html

161,15-2-20,Love in the time of war,"Theatre and film director Feroz Abbas Khan’s latest production, Raunaq & Jassi, with its vast emotional canvas, is relevant to our times, says Saimi Sattar

It could not have been more relevant than in the times we live in. This is a very strong indictment of hate while being a powerful message and celebration of love. The latter has to try harder in the times of hatred. And this is a trying time,” says theatre and film director Feroz Abbas Khan about his latest offering, Raunaq & Jassi. The play is about youngsters from feuding families falling in love, a theme that has been explored since time immemorial and made famous in the Bard’s Romeo & Juliet.

Mention the comparison with William Shakespeare’s play and Feroz points out, “There are basically only seven stories just the way there are only some tunes around which composers make music. What makes a difference is the telling, how it relates to the times we live in and how it is woven together. In that sense, it is not a translation or an adaptation but rather a reimagined version of the original. Here, we have extended the imagination in telling it.” Plus, it is a musical as the entire play is in verse.

So how much time does a reimagining of an existing classic take? Feroz tells us that the journey started from writing. “I am fortunate to have had a wonderful collaboration in creating this original work with Iqbal Raj. He started writing an year ago during which it evolved. The actual production took about a little over three months. The actors had to learn to speak in verse without making it sound that it has been written so. Yet it is colloquial and accessible thus affecting you by its ideas and emotional intensity. This work will be celebrated for a long time to come,” says the director who had enrolled in college to become a Chartered Accountant or a management guy before an encounter with iconic director Peter Brook in Bhopal changed his life.

To execute this play perfectly, there were certain qualities that Feroz had to sift for in his actors. “Besides being good actors, I also needed good singers. They also had to have a personality. Interestingly, I had more options in women than I had in men. Then, I needed a commitment for six months,” says Feroz who became a director by chance when someone who was supposed to direct a play did not turn up and he helmed the project.

He has taken Punjab as the backdrop for telling this tale as it is the place where all the traditional tales of love, like Heer Ranjha, Soni Mahiwal are set. There is something about the land which lends itself to these stories, he feels. Moreover, it is set in the 1950s which Feroz says, “have a certain charm and innocence.”

However, one wonders if the story and the setting would resonate with the millennials, given as they are to making their own choices whether it be careers or life partners? But Feroz avers, “When we talk about millennials, we become very narrow in our thinking and believe that all of them have the choice. How many millennials can marry out of their caste, religion or social set? Freedom to love exists within certain boundaries. And these are more pronounced for women than men. This play has a strong woman who says, ‘why can’t I love the person that I want to love? Why do I have to be in love with the person that you decide? This can’t be anybody else’s decision.’” To Feroz, Jassi, the woman protagonist’s strong voice was very important. “I wouldn’t want to take up anything that doesn’t hold any meaning for me or the audience,” he insists.

Since his last play was Mughal-e-Azam, a Broadway-style musical based on the 1960 eponymous Bollywood film, directed by K Asif, where the canvas was huge, the director has set the bar very high. “There is a visual canvas and an emotional one. The latter is as huge as can be in Raunaq & Jassi. The visual canvas might not be as huge as Mughal-e-Azam but this too is not a small production,” says Feroz who cut his theatrical teeth at Prithvi Theatre with Jennifer Kapoor.

However, this change in tack was more by design than chance as he didn’t want to repeat himself. “I am challenging myself. Repeating is a dead end and stunts growth. I haven’t taken a comfortable path but preferred the difficult and challenging one. This is what makes the journey of Raunaq & Jassi the most beautiful one that I’ve had in theatre,” he says as his voice ebbs and flows with emotion over the phone.

However, one can’t help but go back to the magnum opus. “People asked what will he do with Mughal-e-Azam that isn’t there already? Everyone thought it would be a disaster. They felt that I was being audacious and they believed that in saying so, they were being polite. I was engrossed in trying to save my reputation and protecting the reputation and legacy of K Asif so I completely switched off and concentrated on my work. I was thrown into the deep end and I had only two and a half months to put up the production. The Full Circle on Amazon Prime Video shows how people reacted before and after it was staged. The result was heartwarming,” he recalls.

Another of his popular production was Mahatma Vs Gandhi which was later made as a film Gandhi, My Father. While talking about the Mahatma in the less than favourable light can often be seen now, portraying him as a human being with flaws in popular culture was unheard of in 1998 when the play was staged. “What I had written was within the realm of facts. Gandhi was his own strongest critic, which comes through in his letters, articles and autobiography. But this didn’t stop two play sponsors from backing out because there was an article which said that it was anti-Gandhi. I had the Mahatma’s entire family on board for it as were humanising him and Harilal, his son,” he says and adds, “Neither the film nor the play takes sides. The family knew I was speaking the truth and at the same time ensuring the idea of Gandhi was never damaged.”

However, he points out that popular culture today is going in a different direction. “To destroy the idea of Gandhi or to damage it are wrong. When you are going to celebrate (Nathuram) Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, then we understand where the discourse is going,” he says about a line that many of the sections of the right-wing organisations in the country have taken.

When one laments that Feroz didn’t direct more films after Gandhi, My Father, he suggests that one should watch Dekh Tamasha Dekh, which, “despite being a terrific piece of social and political satire got lost. It is relevant today,” he says but does acquiesce that he should make more films even though theatre is the place where he actually belongs.

Having dabbled in both the media, he points out that cinema is realistic where abstraction is difficult to capture. “Theatre has the power of suggestion. In cinema, the camera can take you wherever the imagination goes or wherever I can, physically. In theatre, stage is a restriction but there is none on imagination. The great advantage of cinema is its reach. Gandhi, My Father has been screened as an accompaniment to Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi in the US, for instance. The other advantage is that films remain the same forever. Madhubalaji (in Mughal-e-Azam) looks the same even now,” he says wistfully and prefers to close the argument with, “Not all subjects can be made in cinema and not all can be adapted to theatre. The subject, language and grammar of both are different. Each has to be treated in a completely different way.”

Feroz hit big time in 1992 with Tumhari Amrita, a story of unrequitted love which had actors Shabana Azmi and Farooq Sheikh take to the stage. With the latter having passed away in 2013, Feroz has now come to terms with reviving it. “It will be completely new as Shabana has said she cannot do it without Farooq. She prodded me to do this as it is a great piece of work and the audience cannot be deprived of its power, beauty and grace,” says the director who started his career as an actor.

Salesman Ramlal, one of the first plays that he adapted from the English Death of a Salesman is his favourite work. “It affects me deeply and I would never have done it if I couldn’t adapt it to the Indian context. Theatre needs it as it is immediate and present. It is the most alive and powerful experience. I need to contextualise the place where I am living, the air that I breathe, the social and political conditions. If I can’t relate to it, how will the audience?” he questions.

Another of his works, Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hun, a show on family planning, gender and women empowerment on Doordarshan has become a global study on how effectively you can use entertainment to propagate a message. It has been dubbed in 12 languages.

With the advent of digital, entertainment is increasingly becoming insular. How would that affect theatre? “You can put a film in your pocket and carry it around but to see a play you have to take that walk from your house to the theatre seat. People want to see live human beings. How much can you see on a TV or laptop? That is why world over, live performances are getting more audience as footfall is increasing.”

So, yes, as the director pointed out at the start, there is a context and time for everything.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/love-in-the-time-of-war-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/love-in-the-time-of-war.html

The concept is to create beautiful homes while respecting our tradition and keeping it alive with our philosophy of “all that we were and more.” The goal is to formalise our interiors and architectural division. It is very gratifying to watch a concept turn into a finish product. The brand Tarun Tahiliani, since its inception, has set out to create the ultimate “India Modern.” Tahiliani Homes strive to be a brand that is much steeped in the Indian traditions and techniques that millions of craftsmen imbibe with love. You can see traditional Goan homes, ultra modern glass and wooden ones, too, that transcend you in to the 21st century in our body of work. Our sole objective is to recreate a serene feeling inside homes with nature-inspired decor.

The works are a fusion of contemporary and local architecture. What inspired the blend?

Our design approach is in a continuous state of progression that has been channelled through many media and refined by experimentation. Just like Tarun’s acumen for couture, penchant for tonalist oil on canvas and fluency as a classical pianist, the need for creating spaces and designing interiors emerged from an insatiable curiosity. These expressive avenues are a bridge to his outlook for exquisite interiors.

The designs look unusual. They are not very common in India...

Tarun was his own client first. This foundation ensures design is functional and each decision has a purpose. The aim is to cultivate an aesthetic charm — one that is shaped by utility and by those who use it. Given our clime and how extreme it can be, comfort is key. Therefore, design is not just for newness or statement. Exuberance comes from activity and action.

A secondary layer of this approach comes from actually living in the homes that one designs, which allows you to understand how a home evolves with the balance between an individual and his shared identity. It maintains a balance between private and communal spaces, one that is particular to each Indian family structure.

Goa is certainly a favourite. Why did you choose this location?

There are so many beautiful locations in India. However, I personally find Goa wonderful. I have stayed at a remote outpost in Coonoor. It was just pristine for the views and the serenity of the environment, in addition to the long views. Goa has amazing restaurants, beaches and places to explore and have fun. Also, it is a sanctuary for city dwellers who want a break from the routine to get back into nature and re-connect with themselves. We believe the micro-markets may shift but the overall location will continue to do well for decades to come.

Design seems to be flowing into the minutest aspect of our everyday life, from dressing to the household utility. Would you say that we are now conscious consumers of everyday art? Or have we finally been able to incorporate luxury in our lives?

I think there is a fine line between luxury and every day art. People are quite brand-conscious in today’s time. I think the crossover hasn’t happened entirely and neither do I believe it should. Individuals should be comfortable in their space. If it’s luxury for some and just beautiful every day art for others — to each his own. To stay true to oneself is important.

How important it is to incorporate sustainability into such designs?

Our aim is to create a home which brings together the elements of the natural outdoors into the premise of the indoors via a water body in the central courtyard, multiple layerings on the floor using different materials and column-designing. Enormous space, high ceilings, wall to wall glazing and textured walls with the use of moldings accentuate the overall natural, organic and luxurious essence of the house. Inspiration for the design has come from Goa, courtyards, Geoffrey Bawa and our own experience.

What would you say about the design trends of this year?

Strong lobby for green and eco-friendly brands will continue to rule. The conversation among builders and buyers both has gravitated towards this. People are becoming more conscious of their decisions and the larger implications it has on the community. This is a good trend and I hope we continue it.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/to-each-his-own-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/to-each-his-own.html
163,15-2-20,Ronaldo’s penalty robs Milan,"Cristiano Ronaldo’s injury-time penalty grabbed Juventus a 1-1 draw at AC Milan in their Italian Cup semi-final, first leg on Thursday as his incredible scoring run continued.

The 35-year-old has now scored 12 goals in his last eight games in all competitions after the Portuguese ultimately got the better of old rival Zlatan Ibrahimovic despite being largely anonymous for much of the match.

Milan paid for Theo Hernandez’s 71st-minute red card as they failed to close out a game they had dominated for long periods and led through Ante Rebic.

Juve will now be favourites to finish the job in the second leg at the Allianz Stadium next month, with a final against either Inter Milan or Napoli up for grabs.

The hosts started strongly, with Ibrahimovic heading over the crossbar inside the first minute.

He continued to be a threat to his former club early on, but could only direct an ambitious backheel flick beyond the far post, before picking up a booking which will see him miss the second leg through suspension.

Juventus finally produced their first shot in anger nine minutes before half-time, as Juan Cuadrado saw his low strike well saved by Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.

Milan started the second half as they did the first, on the front foot, but Rebic was denied an opening goal by Gianluigi Buffon.

Samu Castillejo also called Buffon into action seven minutes after the break, with the 42-year-old goalkeeper able to make a comfortable save.

Stefano Pioli’s side finally made the breakthrough in the 61st minute, though, as Castillejo’s clipped cross was volleyed home at the back post by Rebic.

Juventus were gifted a way back into the game with 18 minutes remaining as Hernandez was handed a second yellow card for a late challenge on Paulo Dybala.

That prompted the 13-time winners to belatedly pile some pressure on the home goal, and Donnarumma had to be alert to keep out Matthijs de Ligt’s header.

Dybala curled wide with five minutes remaining, but Juve were awarded a spot-kick in the final minute of normal time as VAR spotted a handball by Davide Calabria.

Ronaldo stepped up and slammed the ball down the middle to score his 24th goal of the season.

Six minutes of injury-time gave the visitors hope of clinching an unlikely victory, but Milan at least held on for a draw to keep their bid for a first Cup crown since 2003 alive.

On Wednesday, Napoli struck first blood in their semi-final as Gennaro Gattuso’s men downed Serie A leaders Inter Milan 1-0 at the San Siro, with Fabian Ruiz scoring the winner.

The last-four second legs will take place on March 4 and 5, with the final on May 13 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ronaldo---s-penalty-robs-milan.html
164,15-2-20,48 Rohingya arrested off Myanmar coast,"Nearly 50 Rohingya Muslims have been detained at sea by Myanmar’s navy, a local official said Friday, the latest from the persecuted minority to be caught trying to flee camps in Bangladesh and Myanmar’s restive Rakhine state.

It was not immediately clear where the group started their boat journey but they were likely aiming for Malaysia or Indonesia, predominantly Muslim countries with large Rohingya diasporas.

Thousands of Rohingya have taken to the sea over the years in high-risk attempts to escape sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh and oppressive conditions in Rakhine.

Village administrator Myint Thein told AFP by phone the navy had picked up 48 Rohingya men, women and children, as well as five “traffickers”, at sea on Wednesday evening.

An AFP reporter saw the group arrive Friday morning at Pathein township police station.

“We don’t know how authorities in Pathein town will proceed,” Myint Thein said.

171,15-2-20,India beat Thailand 3-2,"The Indian men’s team assured itself of a medal after progressing to the semifinals with a thrilling 3-2 win over Thailand at the Badminton Asia Team Championships here on Friday.

After star shuttlers Kidambi Srikanth and B Sai Praneeth faced reversals in the first two singles ties, India fought back to win the next three ties, which included a single and two doubles rubbers, to prevail over Thailand in the quarterfinals and set up a last four meeting with two-time defending champion Indonesia.

Indonesia boast of Asian Games champion and world number seven Jonathan Christie and world number five Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. They also have the world number one pair of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, apart from the formidable Hendra Setiawan and Mohammad Ahsan.

The men’s team had last won a Bronze after losing 1-3 to Indonesia in the semifinals of the 2016 Hyderabad edition.

World Championships Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth started the proceedings, but his gallant effort ended in a 14-21, 21-14, 12-21 loss to world No 12 Kantaphon Wangcharoen, as India lagged 0-1.

In the second singles, former world No 1 Srikanth went down 20-22, 14-21 to Kunlavut Vitidsarn, a three-time world junior champion, as India slipped to 0-2.

The pairing of MR Arjun and Dhruv Kapila kept India in the hunt with a 21-18, 22-20 win over Kittinupong Kedren and Tanupat Viriyangkura in the first doubles.

Young Lakshya Sen, who had a stellar run in 2019 with five titles, then registered a 21-19, 21-18 win over world No 45 Suppanyu Avihingsanon to bring India back on level terms.

173,15-2-20,"Warner, Smith brace for ‘very hostile’ SA crowds","Australia opener David Warner is braced for a hostile reception but hopes fans will show “respect” as he and Steve Smith return to South Africa for the first time since the Sandpapergate ball-tampering scandal that rocked world cricket.

The last time the pair played in South Africa, almost two years ago, they were sent home in disgrace for attempting to alter the ball with sandpaper during a Cape Town Test. It cost them 12-month suspensions and for Warner, a lifetime leadership ban.

They have since resurrected their careers and are all but forgiven at home, with Warner this week winning a vote by players, officials and media to claim Australian cricket’s highest honour, the Allan Border Medal — with Smith placed second.

But both players were constantly booed and jeered during last year’s one-day World Cup and Ashes series in England, and they are expected to receive similar treatment in South Africa.

The batsmen are both in the Australian squad for three Twenty20s and three ODIs beginning February 21. Their T20 on February 26 will mark the tourists’ first match at Newlands since the 2018 scandal.

“For me personally, it won’t be hard at all,” Warner told Sydney radio station 2GB this week. “I just go there and I’ve got a job to do and that’s to score runs and win games for Australia and put us in a good position.”

But he added that “obviously, it’s going to be very hostile”.

“I copped it in England; I actually enjoyed that and played along with it.

174,15-2-20,"No one has perfect career, you make mistakes and grow: Taylor on 100 Tests","Senior New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor has learnt to live with his imperfections as he stands on the cusp of a coveted 100th Test of his career.

Only Stephen Fleming, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori has played more Tests than Taylor who will only enter an elite club by playing his 100th Test in the series opener, beginning in Wellington on February 21.

“No one has a perfect career and you fail at some stage especially as a batter. Mistakes and scenarios make you grow as a person,” Taylor told reporters on Friday.

Asked what does 100 Tests mean to him, he cheekily replied: “Probably getting older! But no, I think I have been happy with what I have achieved to date.”

“Test cricket and cricket in general as a batter, you go through a lot of ups and downs and that’s definitely what I have been through, and as a team as well.

“But Wellington holds a special place in my heart and I am sure having a lot of family and friends there will be something that I will be proud of and look back on at the end of my career with fond memories,” said the 35-year-old Taylor.

On emotions playing a distracting role in the first Test, Taylor downplayed that factor.

“I guess at the end of the day, it is another game of cricket and you try and contribute in any way that’s possible. But at the same time, you got to enjoy it for what it is.

“But I am sure once you get into the game, you can enjoy it and just play cricket like you want to. Wellington can do a little bit early on, so I am sure batting or bowling, it is going to be an interesting contest,”he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-one-has-perfect-career--you-make-mistakes-and-grow--taylor-on-100-tests.html
175,15-2-20,Hanuma ready to open if needed,"Hanuma Vihari on Friday said he won’t mind taking up the opener’s role if the team management asks after India’s inexperienced opening options were technically exposed by a second-string New Zealand attack on the opening day of the warm-up game.

Coming in at No 6, Vihari scored a hundred but Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill were dismissed early, undone by the extra bounce and seam movement.

The trio’s performance raised doubts about its ability to face the likes of Neil Wagner, Trent Boult and Matt Henry.

“As a player, I am prepared to bat anywhere. As of now, I’ve not been informed anything. As I said before as well, if the team requires me to bat wherever, I am ready to bat,” said Vihari, who retired after scoring 101.

The Andhra player has delivered whenever given a chance and he was surprised by the extra bounce on offer on Friday but is happy to have countered the challenge in the warm-up game which provided him with an opportunity to prepare well.

“Initially, I thought the extra bounce surprised us. (In) the couple of matches I played against New Zealand A, the pitch didn’t do as much as what it did in the morning today.

“Once we adjusted, me and Puji (Pujara’s nickname), we got our eye in, then we knew we had to bat long and that’s exactly what we did,” Vihari said after the end of day’s play.

If the Seddon Park track is any indicator, New Zealand, with a pace-heavy line-up, will be offering seamer friendly tracks at both Wellington and Christchurch.

“Maybe we will get pitches like these because New Zealand’s strength is their fast bowling. They have a very experienced bowling attack but it’s good that we got some time in the middle and we experienced these conditions.

“They were tough and it’s good to experience tough conditions before the series and we’re happy with the way the day went,” he said.

For the Test series, Neil Wagner’s short ball is something that the top order needs to be cautious of, feels Vihari.

“When the wicket flattens out, they (New Zealand bowlers) try to experiment with the short balls and I am sure even Neil Wagner will come up with the same ploy. We are prepared for it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hanuma-ready-to-open-if-needed.html
176,15-2-20,3 openers fail seam & bounce test,"Hanuma Vihari’s gutsy hundred and the seasoned Cheteshwar Pujara’s 92 were the bright spots in an otherwise dreadful batting performance by India on the first day of their warm-up game against New Zealand XI at Seddon Park.

All the three designated openers — Mayank Agarwal (1), Prithvi Shaw (0) and Shubman Gill (0) — failed the seam and bounce test, falling cheaply.

With skipper Virat Kohli opting for an intense net session over the warm-up game, India managed only 263 with none apart from Vihari (101 retired) and Pujara able to score even 93 runs on a track that had liberal grass covering.

What would worry the Indian team management was failure of all the three openers.

Shaw and Gill were undone by the extra bounce while Agarwal failed to counter to seam movement.

New Zealand pacer Scott Kuggeleijn (3/40) got the ball to rear up awkwardly from length during his first spell and Shaw’s dismissal was the ugliest one.

Kuggeleijn, who was hitting the deck hard, got one into Shaw’s rib-cage leaving the batsman in no position to duck. The eyes were not on the ball with the bat face closed. The awkward hit ballooned up and was taken by Rachin Ravindra at short leg.

Agarwal, who has been in horrible form of late, then edged an away going delivery to keeper Dane Cleaver behind the stumps.

Another classic Test match dismissal was Gill, who was given the No 4 slot in absence of skipper Kohli.

The snorter from Kuggeleijn grew big on Gill, who tried defending but the thick edge flew to gully making it 5 for 3 in no time.

Ajinkya Rahane (18) was out by the end of the first hour, edging one to the slips, before Vihari and Pujara stemmed the rot and got a 195-run stand.

Once they saw of Kuggeleijn’s first spell and the skiddy Blair Tickner, batting became easy in the second and third session.

Once the spinners were in operation, Pujara pulled Ish Sodhi over long leg for a six while Vihari also hit three down the ground off left-arm spinner Ravindra.

Pujara was finally out in the final session trying to hook Gibson even as Vihari got to the three-figure mark.

India lost the last six wickets for 30 runs but what stuck out like a sore thumb was another shot selection by Rishabh Pant when he tried an ugly hoick off Ish Sodhi’s bowling only to be caught by the man at extra cover.

Not getting a single match in the limited-overs series must have dented Pant’s confidence as he threw away his wicket when he could have scored a good 35 to 40 runs without any pressure.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/3-openers-fail-seam---bounce-test-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/3-openers-fail-seam---bounce-test.html
177,15-2-20,"Warm-Up Day 2: Bumrah, Shami make the ball talk; openers put up better show","Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami gave an exhibition of high quality fast bowling on day two of India's warm-up encounter against New Zealand XI, sending a warning signal for the home team ahead of first Test in Wellington.

For the record, New Zealand were bowled out for 235 in 74.2 overs but Bumrah (2/18 in 11 overs) and Shami (3/17 in 10 overs) used the conditions well and in the process added miles to their legs ahead of the two World Test Championship games.

Umesh Yadav (2/49 in 13 overs) and Navdeep Saini (2/58 in 15 overs) bowled more overs but weren't half as good as the two premier pacers who troubled the batsmen in all their spells.

With the pitch easing out, Prithvi Shaw (29 batting off 19 balls) unleashed a series of cover drives including a six off a ramp shot while Mayank Agarwal (23 batting off 17 balls) got a maximum with a Nataraja Shot to finish the day at 53 for no loss.

For head coach Ravi Shastri, the basic idea was to check out how his pacers got into the groove and Bumrah and Shami hit the straps straightaway in overcast conditions.

While Umesh and Saini in their first spells bowled too full, Bumrah pitched deliveries on back of length generating disconcerting bounce. He bowled in three short spells while Shami bowled two spells.

The crafty Shami, after getting a hang that ball wasn't jagging around too much despite cloud cover, concentrated on getting the ball to seam both ways.

Bumrah got Will Young (2) with an angular delivery that straightened after pitching to get a nick that landed in Rishabh Pant's gloves.

The delivery that got right-hander Finn Allen (20) was one that pitched on back of length and the batsman played for the bounce, deciding to shoulder arms. However the ball nipped back and clipped the off-bail much to his dismay.

The second spell that Shami bowled post lunch was the one that troubled the New Zealand batsmen including senior international Jimmy Neesham, who was unable to counter the seam movement and extra bounce.

Before that he removed the set Henry Cooper (40 off 68 balls) with a fullish delivery that the batsman wanted to drive.

Once the they had bowled enough overs, the duo didn't come out in the final session as they had done their job for the day.

The final half an hour was entertaining as Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner got some serious pasting from both Shaw and Agarwal, who used the pace to get some easy runs.

It did help that the Seddon Park track had eased out considerably making stroke-play easier than expected.

With India sticking to the Shaw-Agarwal opening combination for the second successive day, Shubman Gill may just have to wait for his Test debut.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/warm-up-day-2--bumrah--shami-make-the-ball-talk--openers-put-up-better-show-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/warm-up-day-2--bumrah--shami-make-the-ball-talk--openers-put-up-better-show.html
178,15-2-20,"India's middle-order can definitely improve, says Mandhana","In-form opener Smriti Mandhana believes India's top four need to bat long to protect the inconsistent middle-order during the ICC Women's T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.

India's middle-order has been unpredictable and its repeated failures have hurt them.

In the 2017 World Cup final, India had lost seven wickets for 28 runs to go down to England by nine runs, while in the recent tri-series final against Australia, they collapsed to 144 all out after being 115 for three at one stage while chasing 155.

""The middle order could definitely improve,"" said Mandhana, who became the third Indian to reach 1,000 T20I runs at the 2018 Women's T20 World Cup and was also the leading run-scorer in the recent tri-series in Australia.

""There are some things we still have to figure out with our batting and we are trying hard to do that. The best way to support the middle order is for the top order to bat 20 overs. I think we need to try and bat long as a top four.

""We must try not to get out in the 16th or 17th over and the problem will be sorted if we can stay until the 20th over,"" added the 23-year-old, who rose to number four in the ICC rankings on Friday.

India will begin their T20 World Cup campaign with a clash against four-time champions Australia on February 21.

While India lost to the Australia in the tri-series final, they had also defeated the hosts in a crucial league game, in which Mandhana scored 55 and young Shafali Verma blasted 49 from 28 balls to help the team chase down 177 losing just three wickets.

Australia head coach Matthew Mott believes India have the most feared batting line-up at the T20 World Cup and Mandhana agrees that they have a balanced batting order.

""We can be very unpredictable on our day, but I'd like to agree (with Mott),"" she said.

179,15-2-20,Liverpool ‘like a shark that smells blood’: Alisson,"Liverpool’s string of victories has made them hungry for more, “like a shark that smells blood,” says Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker, whose recent form is partly responsible for the club’s exploits.

Alisson, recognized as the world’s best goalkeeper, told Brazilian newspaper Folha that winning the Champions League last year had fueled Liverpool’s appetite.

“We got a taste of victory winning the Champions League, and now we want more. It’s like a shark that smells the scent of blood in the water, goes blind and attacks,” he said in an interview.

After bouncing back from a calf injury that sidelined him for two months, Alisson, 27, has saved 26 of the last 27 shots he has faced.

In that time, Liverpool, who have racked up 16 consecutive wins to take a gaping 22-point lead in the English Premier League, scoring 23 goals and conceding just one.

“We’ve developed a killer instinct within our team. We sense we can get what we want. We’ve still got a long way to go, but we’re going to keep it up,” said Alisson, who was named world’s best goalkeeper by FIFA last year and won the inaugural Lev Yachine trophy for top keeper at the Ballon d’Or awards in December.

Alisson credited manager Jurgen Klopp with getting the best out of the team “thanks to his simplicity.”

“He’s straightforward and honest. He believes in his method,” he said.

“He’s a very fair guy who treats everyone well.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool----like-a-shark-that-smells-blood-----alisson.html
180,15-2-20,Break brings welcome respite for Reds,"The first ever Premier League mid-season break pleased Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp as it allowed the runaway leaders to rest their aches and pains following the hectic festive period.

The 52-year-old German takes his players to bottom-placed Norwich today holding a 22 point lead over two-time defending champions Man City.

Klopp said the break will have done his squad the world of good as he knew from his own playing experience.

“I was a player myself. When I look back it feels like I played through 80% of the time with pain,” he said at his eve of match press conference.

“Nobody appreciated that because I played bad so it didn’t help. Nobody asked then. It is completely normal for a professional football player to play through pain.

“After that long period in December-January, there was no player in the squad who had no pain. Everybody had something.”

Klopp — whose Champions League holders travel to Atletico Madrid next week in their last 16 first leg clash — has also been boosted by the return to fitness from hamstring injuries of Senegal attacker Sadio Mane and veteran James Milner.

Sane has missed the last four matches while Milner has been out since January 5.

“Millie (Milner) and Sadio are back. When they are back you consider them immediately,” said Klopp.

“Apart from (Xherdan) Shaqiri, (Nathaniel) Clyne and (Paul) Glatzel, all the players are in training.

“We have some good options. Hopefully it stays like this for the rest of the season.”

Klopp says Norwich may be struggling at the bottom — they are seven points adrift of safety — but he is full of respect for their adventurous style of play.

“I really admire that Norwich stick to their principles. It’s really good football, super coaching,” Klopp said.

“They’ve lost a lot of these games, that’s why they’re in the situation they are, but for me, on the outside, it looks like a club that really sticks together.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/break-brings-welcome-respite-for-reds.html
181,15-2-20,Tsitsipas dumped out in Rotterdam,"Stefanos Tsitsipas’ slow start to the year continued as the Greek star suffered a second-round defeat by Slovenia’s Aljaz Bedene in Rotterdam on Thursday.

The world number six, who was knocked out of the Australian Open last month by Milos Raonic in the third round, slumped to a 7-5, 6-4 loss in the Netherlands.

Bedene saved five break points before snatching the opening set courtesy of a break in the 11th game, before easing through the second to set up a quarter-final against Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime.

“He was probably the better player in most of the first set, he was serving really well,” Bedene, the world number 52, told atptour.com after beating second-seeded Tsitsipas.

“I stayed focused and it was good towards the end.”

Tsitsipas, who won the season-ending ATP Finals last year, now has a 3-4 losing record in 2020.

In-form Russian Andrey Rublev and Gael Monfils, who plays fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon later on Thursday, are the only top-eight seeds remaining in the draw.

Top seed Daniil Medvedev lost to Vasek Pospisil in the opening round, while Italian teenager Jannik Sinner saw off Belgian fourth seed David Goffin 7-6 (9/7), 7-5.

Sinner, who won last year’s NextGen Finals in Milan, claimed his first victory over a player ranked in the world’s top 10.

“I feel great, especially now in this moment,” said Sinner.

The 18-year-old will take on Spain’s Pablo Carreno-Busta for a place in the semi-finals.

182,15-2-20,SA call off Pak tour,"South Africa have ruled out participation in a proposed T20 series in Pakistan following their India tour next month, citing players’ workload.

The tour will be rescheduled at a later date suitable to both the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket South Africa (CSA).

PCB Chief Executive Wasim Khan said he respected the decision made by its South African counterpart.

“While we were keenly looking forward to hosting South Africa next month, we respect Cricket South Africa’s reason for not sending their side next month. Managing player workload is a top priority for any cricket board, and from that perspective, their decision is understandable.

“We are pleased that the CSA remains committed to rescheduling this short series as soon as practically possible. As there is a strong willingness and commitment, both the boards are now exploring their FTPs to find gaps so that we can agree on the dates,” Khan said in a PCB statement.

South Africa play three ODIs in India from March 12 to 18 and the tour of Pakistan for three T20s in Rawalpindi was planned after that.

South Africa are currently playing T20s against England after competing in four Tests and three ODIs.

After the three T20s against England, the Proteas will host Australia for three ODIs and as many T20s with the last match ending on March 7, leaving less than a week in between for the series-opener in India at Dharamsala. The IPL also starts in the last week of March.

The proposed three-match T20 series was over and above two-Test and three-T20 series in January, next year, which is part of the Future Tours Programme.

“The CSA conveyed their decision to the PCB this afternoon after taking into account player workload,” the PCB statement added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sa-call-off-pak-tour.html

184,15-2-20,"Bengal, K’taka make Ranji quarters; Delhi out","Bengal and Karnataka scripted contrasting wins over Punjab and Baroda respectively to qualify for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals on Friday.

The results on day three of the final round of Ranji Trophy also knocked Delhi out of the tournament.

Punjab, needing 190 runs for victory, fluffed their run chase to be bowled out for 141, handing Bengal a 48-run victory.

Spinners dominated the game with Bengal left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed picking up four wickets in the second innings to take his match-haul to 11.

Resuming day three at 199 for nine, Bengal scored only three runs to set Punjab a 190-run target.

It turned out to be enough in a low-scoring game with Punjab getting bowled out in 47. 3 overs. Ramandeep Singh (69 not out off 104) ran out of partners in the end. Bengal gained six points from the win, pushing them on the top of the standings.

In Bengaluru, Karnataka advanced to the quarterfinals with an eight-wicket win over Baroda.

It was an improved batting effort from Baroda in the second innings after being shot out for 85 on day one. They ended their second innings at 296 all out, setting Karnataka a 149-run target, which the hosts reached in 44.4 overs with the loss of just two wickets.

Karnataka skipper Karun Nair took the team over the line with an unbeaten 71 off 126 balls.

At the Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi made Rajasthan follow-on after bowling them out for 299 in the first innings in response to their mammoth 623.

Rajasthan captain Ashok Menaria scored a gritty 119 but he did not get support from the other batsmen.

Following-on, Rajasthan were 128 for two in their second innings, trailing Delhi by 196 runs.

Saurashtra fightback

Rajkot: Senior pro Arpit Vasavada came up with a gritty unbeaten 126 to lead Saurashtra’s fightback on the third day of their Elite Group B match against Tamil Nadu.

The result of this match would not affect Saurashtra’s fortunes as they have already qualified for the knock-outs.

With Karnataka and Bengal winning their respective final league matches, Tamil Nadu are out of the reckoning.

As a result of Vasavada’s resolute century, Saurashtra ended the third day at 346/6, adrift by 76 runs.

Wicket-keeper Avi Barot (82) and Vasavada (126 not out) stitched together a 108-run stand for the fourth wicket as they tried to rebuild the innings after top-order collapse on the second day.

Barot missed his hundred by 18 runs as he edged to wicket-keeper Jagadeesan off right-arm medium pacer K Vignesh.

The 31-year old Vasavada notched up his sixth first- class hundred and then found an able allay in number eight Chirag Jani (47 not out) as the two forged an unbroken 104-run stand for the seventh wicket.

Vasavada hammered 13 fours and one six so far and his first target would be to secure the first-innings lead for the home team as an outright result looks difficult.

Meanwhile in Mumbai, the hosts who are already out of the tournament, took the first-innings lead against Madhya Pradesh.

Opener Hardik Tamore slammed his maiden first-class hundred as Mumbai set an imposing 408-run target for MP, who ended the third day at 44/2.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bengal--k---taka-make-ranji-quarters--delhi-out.html
185,15-2-20,Turner expects Indian pacers to perform better,"Former New Zealand skipper Glenn Turner is quite surprised that his country has its “nose ahead” in the ongoing bilateral series against India and the reason, according to him, is the underwhelming performance of the Jasprit Bumrah-led visiting pacers.

However, Turner expects Bumrah and Mohammed Shami to lift their game in the upcoming two-Test series, which begins on February 21.

“I have no time at all for T20 cricket. It’s a blot on the game. 50-over cricket, you can have a game. Technically, I felt bowling from both sides have been way below than what I had expected at international levels in both formats,” Turner said.

Turner believes Bumrah and Shami’s ability to swing the ball will work to India’s advantage during the Test series.

“At the moment, New Zealand have their nose ahead but I have been rather surprised, that has been the case. India have shown in three-match series they have several whats and I am surprised that they have not performed better than they have,” he said.

He feels India’s problem in Tests could be the excessive white ball cricket they have played.

“Shami has shown he is a talent and has great stamina. It’s almost in my mind, once Test matches start, theory of how you should bowl under certain circumstances in limited overs cricket tends to be sidelined. That being the case, I would expect the Indian bowling to be better than what we have seen,” opined the former New Zealand skipper.

Bumrah is coming back from an injury and Turner hoped that the spearhead will have the capacity to bowl 25 overs in a red-ball game.

“....He has got natural talent despite being unorthodox in his bowling action. He tends to come off the pitch quicker than you would expect and has accuracy.

“He has had a good warm-up bowling 10 overs in ODIs but then limited overs doesn’t help in building stamina for bowling 25 overs a day,” he explained.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/turner-expects-indian-pacers-to-perform-better.html

191,15-2-20,Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of democracy: Justice Chandrachud,"Calling dissent a ""safety valve"" of democracy, Supreme Court judge Justice DY Chandrachud on Saturday said ""blanket labelling"" of dissent as anti-national or anti-democratic strikes at the ""heart"" of the country's commitment to protect Constitutional values and promote deliberative democracy.

Delivering a lecture here in Gujarat, Justice Chandrachud also said that use of state machinery to curb dissent instillsfear, which violates the rule of law.

""The blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national or anti-democratic strikes at the heart of our commitment to protect constitutional values and the promotion of deliberative democracy,"" he said.

Protecting dissent is but a reminder that while a democraticelected government offers us a legitimate tool for development and social coordination, they can never claim a monopoly over the values andidentities that define our plural society, Justice Chandrachud said.

He was speaking on the topic,""The Hues That Make India: From Plurality to Pluralism,"" as part of the 15th Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture organised here.

""Employment of state machinery to curb dissent instillsfear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free peace which violates the rule of law and distracts from the constitutional vision of pluralist society,"" he added.

Justice Chandrachud's comments came at a time when the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) has triggered massive protests in many parts of the country.

""The destruction of spaces for questioning and dissent destroys the basis of all growth--political, economic, cultural and social. In this sense, dissent is a safety valve of democracy,"" he said.

Justice Chandrachud also stated that silencing of dissent and the generation of fear in the minds of people go beyond the violation of personal liberties and a commitment to constitutional value.

Notably, Justice Chandrachud was part of a bench that had in January sought response of the Uttar Pradesh government on a plea seeking quashing of notices sent to alleged protesters by the district administration for recovering losses caused by damage to public properties during anti-CAA agitations in the state.

""The attack on dissent strikes at the heart of a dialogue-based democratic society and hence, a state is required to ensure that it deploys its machinery to protect the freedom of speech and expression within the bounds of law, and dismantle any attempt to instill fear or curb free speech,"" he opined.

Commitment to the protection of deliberative dialogue is an essential aspect of every democracy, particularly a successful one, Justice Chandrachud said.

He added, ""A democracy welded to the ideal of reason and deliberation ensures that minority opinions are not strangulated and ensures that every outcome is not a result merely of numbers but of a shared consensus"".

Justice Chandrachud said the ""true test"" of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution.

""Inherent in the liberal promise of the Constitution is a commitment to a plurality of opinion. A legitimate government committed to deliberate dialogue does not seek to restrict political contestation but welcomes it,"" he further said.

Justice Chandrachud also underlined the importance of mutual respect and protection of space for divergent opinions.

""Taking democracy seriously requires us to respond respectfully to the intelligence of others and to participate vigorously, but as an equal in determining how we should live together,"" the supreme court judge said.

Democracy is judged not just by the institutionsthat formally exist but by the extent to which different voices from diverse sections of the people can actually be heard, respected and accounted for, he said.

According to Justice Chandrachud, the ""great threat to pluralism"" is the suppression of differences and silencing of popular and unpopular voices offering alternative or opposing views.

""Suppressionof intellect is the suppression of the conscience or the nation,"" he said.

The supreme court judge further said the country was conceptualised""as incorporating its vast diversity and not eliminating it"".

""National unity denotes a shared cultural values and a commitment to the fundamentalidealof Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteednot just fundamental rights but alsothe conditionsfor theirfree and safe exercise,"" he said.

He said the country'spluralism underlines a commitment to protect ""the very idea of India as a refuge to people of various states, races, languages and beliefs"".

""In providing spaces to a multitude of culture and free space to diversity and dissent, we reaffirm to our commitment to the idea that the making of our nation is a continuous process of deliberation and belongs to every individual,"" he said.

No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India, he said.

Justice Chandrachud also referred to a ""positive obligation"" for protecting a plural identity.

""The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India,"" he said.

Justice Chandrachud also said the framers put trust on the futuregenerations to create a common bond of what it means to be an Indian, which ""shunned homogeneityand celebrated diversity in what is meant tobe an Indian"".

Hecompared the ""layered Indian identity"" to Matryoshka dolls, and said this is what makes us Indian ""and must be central to our understanding of pluralism and efforts to foster it.

""Homogeneityis not the defining feature of Indianness. Our differences are not our weakness. Our ability to transcend these difference in our recognition of our shared humanity is a source of our strength.

""India is a sub continent of diversity in itself. Pluralism has already achieved its greatest triumph -- the existence of India. The nation's continued survival shows us that our desire for a shared pursuit of happiness outweighs the difference in the colour of our skin, the languages we speak, or the name we give the almighty,"" he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-anti-national-hurts-ethos-of-democracy--justice-chandrachud-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-anti-national-hurts-ethos-of-democracy--justice-chandrachud.html
192,15-2-20,"Day after spat on NIA taking over Elgar case, Pawar-Maha CM share stage","NCP president Sharad Pawar shared a stage with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray a day after criticising him for allowing the transfer of the Elgar Parishad case probe to the National Investigation Agency.

Pawar and Thackeray came together on Saturday for a function in Jalgaon to give out agricultural awards named after Appasaheb Pawar, the NCP chief's elder brother.

On Friday, Pawar had told reporters in Kolhapur that it was not right on part of the Centre to hand over the Elgar Parishad case probe to the NIA from Pune police.

In a swipe at the state government, of which the NCP is a part, Pawar had said, ""It was not right for the Centre to hand over the investigation into the case to the NIA. But it was even more wrong for the state government to support the transfer of the case.""

At Saturday's function, however, all appeared well between the two politicians with Pawar asking that the Maharashtra CM be felicitated first while Thackeray asked that the former Union agriculture minister be honoured before him.

The organisers honoured Pawar and Thackeray jointly.

Speaking on the occasion, Thackeray said the farmer is the binding force of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

""Farmers have brought us together. Our not sitting together does not mean there is any problem in the Maha Vikas Aghadi,"" Thackeray assured the gathering.

""Farmers need not worry now. This is their government. I am aware that farmers want water, electricity and good price for their produce. Loan waiver is the first aid to take them out of their problems permanently,"" the CM added.

Addressing the function, Pawar said, ""Today in the world, India has a standing in the field of agriculture. We have attained sufficiency in agriculture despite constraints like burgeoning population. For this, we must give credit to our farmers and scientists.""

He said farmers need to look for new technologies, adopt and apply them in the field, adding that ""water remains an important issue and the state and Centre need to work together"".

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked about the beneficiary of the terror strike and the CPI(M) questioned the need for a memorial to “remind of our incompetence”. The BJP came out with a stinging attack terming Rahul’s remarks “shameful” and recalling he has been a “known sympathiser of LeT and JeM” even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country will never forget the sacrifice of the martyrs.

Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani and Hardeep Puri and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who remembered the martyrs of the February 14 terror attack on a convoy carrying CRPF personnel.

Modi said the slain security personnel were “exceptional individuals” who devoted their lives to serving and protecting the nation. “Tributes to the brave martyrs who lost their lives in the gruesome Pulwama attack last year. They were exceptional individuals who devoted their lives to serving and protecting our nation. India will never forget their martyrdom,” Modi tweeted.

The trigger for the BJP attack on Rahul came as he asked, “Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack, let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?” he posted on Twitter.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the entire nation paid homage to the martyrs of Pulwama and many questions remain. “Why is the report of Pulwama attack not being made public? Who is accountable? Who brought the 350 kgs IED? Why were intelligence reports of attack ignored? Did Devinder Singh have any role,” he tweeted, referring to the Jammu & Kashmir police officer arrested along with two Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists.

Paying his “heartfelt homage” to the martyrs of the “ghastly terror attack”, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury wanted to know what had been done for the survivors and the families of those who had laid their lives down for the nation. His party colleague Mohammed Salim demanded justice and asked how 80 kg of RDX crossed the international border. He even questioned the need for a memorial as it would “remind of our incompetence”.

The BJP described Rahul as a “known sympathiser” of terror groups LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed and alleged that the Congress leader chose to target not just the Government but even the security forces at a time when the nation was paying tributes to those killed in last year’s Pulwama attack.

“When nation is paying homage to martyrs of dastardly Pulwama attack, @RahulGandhi, a known sympathiser of LeT & Jaish-e-Mohammad, chooses to target not just the Government but security forces as well. Rahul will never question real culprit, Pakistan. Shame on you Rahul!,” tweeted BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao.

Another BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the latter is making a “dastardly comment” on the first anniversary of the terror attack. “That (Pulwama) was a dastardly attack. And this is a dastardly comment. Who Benefitted the most? Mr (Rahul) Gandhi can you think beyond benefits? Of course not. This so-called ‘Gandhi’ family can never think beyond benefits. Not just materialistically corrupt, their souls are also corrupt (sic),” Patra said in a tweet.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opp-raps-govt-as-nation-remembers-pulwama-martyrs-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-raps-govt-as-nation-remembers-pulwama-martyrs.html

Chairing a meeting of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Society here on Friday, Modi emphasised on the importance of developing virtual labs so that science can further be taken to all students in each and every corner of the country.

According to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office, he spoke on the need to attract young students toward science and further strengthen scientific acumen in the next generation.

The prime minister also suggested measures to enhance collaboration in research and development projects among Indians working in different parts of the world.

Asking scientists to work on the aspirational needs of India, he said there is a need for CSIR to focus on ""real-time social issues that India is facing such as malnutrition"" through value addition in agriculture products, and water conservation.

PM Modi listed 5G wireless technology, artificial intelligence and affordable and long-lasting batteries for renewable energy storage as some of the emerging challenges which the scientists need to focus on.

He highlighted the need to combine traditional knowledge with modern science to develop world-class products. The prime minister also spoke about the importance of commercialisation of innovations, the release said.

196,15-2-20,4 cops hurt as anti-CAA protest by Muslims turns violent in Chennai,"An anti-CAA protest by Muslims turned violent when a group of protesters clashed with police here, leaving four personnel injured.

The incident on Friday led to sporadic protests across Tamil Nadu, including at Washermanpet in the city, where the violence erupted, but protesters subsequently called off the agitation, following talks with City Police Commissioner AK Viswanathan.

Four police personnel -- a woman joint commissioner, two women constables and a sub-inspector -- were injured in stonepelting, the police said, even as reports emerged that some protesters were also hurt.

Joint Commissioner P Vijayakumari sustained injuries on her head, the police said, adding that those wounded were admitted to a hospital.

Earlier, some agitators were reportedly removed from the protest site forcibly, leading to a commotion between them and the police.

The protesters accused the police of resorting to a lathicharge.

Some of the protesters were detained. Subsequently, more people gathered there demanding their release. As a result, security was beefed up in the area.

Viswanathan held discussions with community elders and representatives of Muslim organisations, following which all those detained were released, the police said.

""An amicable decision was arrived at in the meeting with Muslim organisations and they have announced that the agitation will be withdrawn,"" a police officer said, adding that normalcy had returned to the area.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/4-cops-hurt-as-anti-caa-protest-by-muslims-turns-violent-in-chennai-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/4-cops-hurt-as-anti-caa-protest-by-muslims-turns-violent-in-chennai.html

200,15-2-20,Supreme Court order on AGR dues: Das says will discuss internally if any issues arise out of it,"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday said it will have internal discussions in case there are any issues arising out of the Supreme Court order regarding AGR dues.

On Friday, the Supreme Court threatened contempt proceedings against top executives of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom firms for failing to comply with its directive to pay an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues.

Das did not offer any specific comments about the order, which might have ramifications on banks in terms of their exposure to the financially-stressed telecom companies.

When asked about the order, Das said it would be internally deliberated upon, if at all there are issues arising out of it.

On Friday, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar said it was incumbent on telecom companies to find money and that it would be safe to presume that they would have made some arrangements for it by now.

His remarks came hours after the apex court order on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues matter.

Meanwhile, addressing the media after the RBI's board meeting here, Das said that credit growth is expected to pick up in the coming months.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who also addressed the board, said the finance ministry was monitoring banks on credit flow to the agriculture sector.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/supreme-court-order-on-agr-dues--das-says-will-discuss-internally-if-any-issues-arise-out-of-it-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/supreme-court-order-on-agr-dues--das-says-will-discuss-internally-if-any-issues-arise-out-of-it.html
201,15-2-20,Telcos asked to pay dues by midnight,"Govt issues demands after anguished SC warns DoT officer, telcos of contempt action

Taking strong note of the non-compliance of its order, the Supreme Court expressed displeasure over an order passed by the Department of Telecom’s desk officer staying the effect of its verdict in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) matter.

Is there no law left in the country, an “anguished” SC asked on Friday while directing the top echelons of telecom firms to explain why contempt action should not be taken against them for non-compliance of its order to pay adjusted gross revenue of Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the telecom department.

Soon after the SC rap, the telecom department began issuing orders, directing companies such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to clear dues before Friday (February 14) midnight. The order issued on Friday by the UP (West) Telecom Circle asked “all telecom service providers” to clear dues by 11.59 pm Friday. “With reference to subject cited above, you are hereby directed to make the payment of outstanding dues of licence fee and spectrum usage charges by 14.02.2020, 11:59 PM positively,” it said.

One of the telecom operators, who did not wish to be named, confirmed the receipt of the said order from the circle. While in all, 15 entities owe the Government Rs 1.47 lakh crore — Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges, it is not immediately clear just how much of that has been sought by the Government by February 14 midnight.

The order issued the circle-based Controller of Communication Accounts came after the telecom department earlier on Friday withdrew its order that asked for no coercive action against telecom companies defaulting on statutory dues payment.

Hearing pleas filed by Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel, and Tata Teleservices seeking more time for payment of AGR related dues, the SC expressed serious displeasure as to how a desk officer can pass such an order which stays the effect of the apex court’s judgment.

“How can a desk officer do this to the SC’s order. Is this the law of the country. Is this the way you treat the courts,” a three-member SC bench said.

Justice Arun Mishra, who was heading the bench, said, “We don’t know who is creating this nonsense. Who is generating all this? Is there no law left in the country? I am literally anguished. I feel I should not work in this court and in this system. I am very anguished. I am saying this with full sense of responsibility. I don’t get angry like this, but I am totally lost how to work in this system and this country.”

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta tendered an apology before the bench also comprising Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice MR Shah, and said the desk officer cannot do this.

“As the solicitor general of the country, have you asked him (desk officer) to withdraw this? This cannot be tolerated. We cannot function in this fashion. Let us wind up the Supreme Court if your desk officer has this audacity. News reports are being published. Who is sponsoring all this?” the Bench asked.

“I never bother about myself. You don’t understand me, not even an inch. Your desk officer is staying the Supreme Court order. Is he sitting over the Supreme Court? How?,” Justice Mishra said, adding it was “better not to live in this country, rather leave it”.

“We have to draw contempt against this man (desk officer) and also against these companies. How are they behaving? We had dismissed the review plea and not even a single penny has been deposited yet. The desk officer is staying our order. We are concerned with the health of judiciary, of this country and of this system,” the bench said.

The circular was withdrawn by the telecom department immediately after the Supreme Court took a strong view of non-compliance in payment of dues by telecom companies.

The DoT order issued to its field offices subsequently had asked for “immediate necessary action” in compliance with the October judgment of the Supreme Court. The direction by the DoT had said its previous order dated January 23, 2020 “stands withdrawn with immediate effect”.

“It is directed to take immediate necessary action in compliance with the judgement dated October 24, 2019 of the Supreme Court,” said the fresh order issued by the DoT.

The Supreme Court on Friday directed the managing directors and directors of telcos and other firms to explain why contempt action be not taken against them for non-compliance of its order to pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the Department of Telecommunications.

Taking strong note of the non-compliance of its order, a bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice MR Shah expressed anguish over the order passed by DoT’s desk officer, staying the effect of its verdict in AGR matter.

Of the three private players operating in the Indian telecom market, Vodafone Idea is considered to be in the most vulnerable position.

Vodafone Idea is staring at dues worth Rs 53,000 crore that includes up to Rs 24,729 crore of spectrum dues and another Rs 28,309 crore in licence fee, and the company had earlier warned of shutdown if no relief was given.

Vodafone Idea in its earnings statement on Thursday had also sounded out warnings on “material uncertainty” casting “significant doubt” on its ability to continue as a going concern.

VIL had said on Thursday that the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is essentially dependent on a positive outcome of its modification application in the Supreme Court on the AGR matter and any relief from the telecom department on payments.

Last week, Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Nick Read had said the situation in India is critical, following the AGR ruling of the Supreme Court. The British telecom major holds 45.39 per cent stake in VIL. VIL had suffered staggering Rs 50,922 crore loss in the September quarter (highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate), when it had made provisions for statutory dues following the Supreme Court’s order in the adjusted gross revenue matter, although its losses in December quarter narrowed to Rs 6,439 crore.

Rival Bharti Airtel’s liabilities added up to nearly Rs 35,586 crore, including licence fee and spectrum usage charge dues. But, Airtel had already said that the previously-mentioned material uncertainty on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern “no longer exists” after the recent Rs 21,502 crore fund raising by it.

Most of the remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL/MTNL and some of the shut/bankrupt telecom companies.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/telcos-asked-to-pay-dues-by-midnight.html
202,15-2-20,"Trump's India visit will be delightful spectacle, utterly successful: Experts","President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to India will be a ""delightful spectacle"" and ""utterly successful"" by many measures, eminent American experts on South Asia issues have said.

Trump along with the First Lady are scheduled to visit Ahmedabad and New Delhi on February 24 and 25, according to a White House announcement early this week.

This would be president's first bilateral visit in the third decade of 21st century and also the first after his acquittal by the Senate in the impeachment trial.

""I think the Trump visit will be a delightful spectacle and utterly successful by many measures,"" Ashley Tellis, who is Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told PTI.

Trump is expected to get a roaring welcome by lakhs of people when he arrives in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

He along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to deliver a historic speech in front of hundreds and thousands of people at the newly build Motera stadium, the largest cricket stadium of the world.

One of the most prominent experts on India, Tellis, however, noted that at the moment, he was unsure whether the trade disputes between the two countries will be resolved.

Senior government officials are tight lipped on this issue, except for making comments in recent past that the two countries are on the verge of a trade package or a mini trade deal.

""Although the GOI (Government of India) has claimed that both sides are close to a deal, I don't think there has been real progress — certainly none that will satisfy USTR (US Trade Representatives). We might get some progress on defense sales, but that's uncertain too,"" Tellis noted.

""Still, both the countries have done well where defense cooperation is concerned under the Trump administration, which is more than can be said for many other US relationships with its allies. I expect this will further deepen in the years ahead,"" he said in response to a question.

""Even if the visit then produces only good optics, I'll take it all the same if it strengthens Trump's perceptions of India as a friend. Given his mercurial personality and policies, that is not a small achievement — and I think PM Modi understands that well,"" Tellis said.

Rick Rossow, Wadhwani Chair in US India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, hoped that the two leaders can finalise an agreement to remove some of the recent trade irritants.

""My own view is that India keeps digging a deeper hole in triggering trade tensions--notably through steep customs hikes in its February 1 Union Budget. So, a short-term deal may simply be a reprieve in our trade fight,"" Rossow told PTI.

Observing that Trump will be the fourth consecutive president to travel to India, and the second consecutive president to visit India in his first term in office, Rossow was of the view that a visit to India is no longer a significant event.

""India is a large and growing market for exports and an emerging security partner for the United States... Particularly important as we consider options to further draw down our forces in Afghanistan and seek a network of burden-sharing in areas where China's rise poses a threat. India will be important on both counts,"" Rossow told PTI.

According to Anish Goel, Senior Fellow at New America and former senior White House official, Trump's upcoming visit is consistent with long-standing policy in both countries to continue strengthening and cementing the bilateral relationship.

""The visit will be a political boon for both the President (Trump) and the Prime Minister (Modi). India is one of the few countries where the President is quite popular. So he can expect a massive turnout for his rally in Ahmedabad. Similarly, the Prime Minister will most certainly get a boost in support from hosting the President,” Goel told PTI.

At the very least, Trump will provide Modi with a welcome distraction from his recent domestic difficulties, he said.

""It is an important and positive step in bringing the two countries closer together. The timing is also significant as this is the first visit by a US President during a year in which he is facing re-election. That itself is a signal of the importance of this relationship for the United States,"" he added.

""The deliverables for the visit will surely focus on defense and trade. India has already announced USD 3.5 billion in new defense purchases to be signed during the visit. And everyone is hopeful that a deal normalising the trade relationship will be announced,"" he said.

The trade deal was expected last September when Modi visited New York and met Trump but the differences could not be worked out in time.

The White House would not have agreed to this visit to India unless the trade deal was nearing completion in earnest. Outside of trade and defense, the deliverables will likely be modest, Goel said.

""It is important for the President and the Prime Minister to have a comprehensive bilateral meeting in which all critical issues, including Pakistan, are discussed. The strategic partnership between India and the US depends on more than trade and defense sales so it is imperative that they address other strategic issues as well,"" Goel said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-s-india-visit-will-be-delightful-spectacle--utterly-successful--experts-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-s-india-visit-will-be-delightful-spectacle--utterly-successful--experts.html
203,15-2-20,How can people start questioning Bumrah's ability after just 2-4 games? Asks Shami,"""How can people forget Jasprit Bumrah's numerous match-winning performances just after a couple of indifferent ODI games?"" asked a miffed Mohammed Shami on Saturday to counter the criticism levelled at his new ball partner.

Bumrah went wicketless in all three of India's defeats against New Zealand with questions being raised over his performance.

""I can understand we are discussing on a topic (after a certain length of time) not just after 2-4 games. Just because he hasn't performed in two games, you can't just ignore his ability to win matches,"" said Shami after the second day's play in the warm-up game against New Zealand XI.

""What Bumrah has achieved for India, how can you even forget that or for that matter ignore it? So if you think positively, then it's good for the player and his confidence also,"" Bumrah's senior partner said after taking an impressive 3 for 18 against New Zealand XI.

The veteran pacer didn't forget to take a dig at critics who he feels have a job to comment, forgetting that Bumrah is coming back from a stress fracture on his lower back.

""As a sportsman, it's very different. From outside, it is very easy to nitpick as some have a job to comment and earn money. Every sportsman can get injured and one should try and look at the positives rather than harp on negatives. I also got injured in 2015 (knee surgery) but then bounced back,"" Shami said

What baffles Shami is how people's perception changes if a player goes through a sudden slump in form.

""People tend to think very differently and when you do not do well for a few games, their view point about you changes. So on our part, we shouldn't over-think.""

Easily the most versatile bowler in the current line-up, Shami enjoys the mantle of an elder statesman who is ready to mentor the likes of Navdeep Saini.

Asked about what kind of role experience plays, the Bengal speedster replied: ""Experience matters as you then don't panic easily. You have faced different situations and know what to do. That is valuable.

""So when an experienced player is around and you bring a youngster, he matures quickly. So in our team, we guide our youngsters, joke and laugh with them, make them feel comfortable so that they don't feel that there is a distance between seniors and juniors.""

He was all praise for Saini, who has been a find for India in white-ball cricket.

""He is young, he has got talent, pace and height. So there are benefits. But yes, someone has to guide him and take him along the way. He needs support. He is bowling well but no one possesses experience straightaway. It comes with passage of time.

""Hopefully, it will come soon and we seniors are there to help him.""

Having been the best Indian bowler on view during the second day of the warm-up game, Shami seemed happy with kind of track that was on offer.

""It was a bit green and the wicket was damp on the first day compared to the second day. Yesterday (First Day) morning, it was challenging and we wanted to take up that challenge. Today it was drier compared to yesterday, with cloud cover, the conditions became helpful.

""There was good bounce and carry, so felt good bowling on a track. These kind of tracks are a rarity and since we have pacers of that calibre, we reaped its benefits.""

For someone with an enviable quality of hitting the seam with ease, Shami said that it was an art that he learnt through sheer hardwork and passion.

""When you start working on something, you develop a passion that you have to achieve. I never thought that I will start developing a great seam position but when I realised that a good seam position can help, I just worked on it.

""By God's grace, now I can do whatever I want with the seam. If you want to achieve something, passion is pre-requisite. You have to chase that,"" he added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-can-people-start-questioning-bumrah-s-ability-after-just-2-4-games--asks-shami-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/how-can-people-start-questioning-bumrah-s-ability-after-just-2-4-games--asks-shami.html
204,15-2-20,China's Xi urges more policing as virus toll rises,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for tightened control over online discussion and increased policing to ensure ""positive energy"" and social stability, state media said Saturday, as the country struggles to contain the deadly new coronavirus.

Xi's remarks were made public as the authorities have faced rare bouts of public anger over the handling of an epidemic that has killed more than 1,500 people and infected some 66,000 across the country.

Censors had allowed some online criticism of local officials in central Hubei -- the epicentre and origin of the crisis -- but calls for freedom of speech and political reform were scrubbed after the death of a whistleblowing doctor from the virus.

The government must ""strengthen the management and control of online media,"" and ""crack down on those who seize the opportunity to create rumours"" on the internet, Xi said in the February 3 speech published by state media.

Simultaneously, ""it is necessary to increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police,"" Xi said, calling for a crackdown on behaviour that ""disrupts social order"" including hoarding medical supplies.

Xi urged party members to ""dare to criticise"" those who had failed to carry out the Communist Party central committee's instructions, and warned ""those who fail to perform their duties shall be punished according to discipline and law.""

Local officials in Hubei have already begun to feel the force of Xi's orders.

On Thursday, the political chiefs of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, were sacked and replaced by Xi loyalists with security backgrounds.

The province's top two health officials have also been fired.

Xi also called for the government to emphasize effective actions it has taken and ""vividly describe touching deeds"" from the frontlines of the fight against the virus.

""Let positive energy fill the cyberspace from start to end,"" Xi said in the speech, given earlier this month at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's ruling council.

Xi initially kept a low profile in the early weeks of the crisis but has stepped up his public rhetoric in recent days on what he has called a ""people's war"" against the virus.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-s-xi-urges-more-policing-as-virus-toll-rises-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-s-xi-urges-more-policing-as-virus-toll-rises.html
205,15-2-20,"Besides aam aadmi, CM invites PM for oath event","Political circles were abuzz after AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan on February 16.

AAP leader Gopal Rai said a letter was sent to the Prime Minister on Friday morning. However, it is not clear whether the PM would attend the oath taking ceremony of Kejriwal as he is scheduled to visit his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi on the same day.

The AAP has not invited any other leader or CMs of even non-BJP ruled States as the party feels that it is a Delhi specific ceremony hence only leaders from Delhi have been invited. The list of invitees also includes all the seven Lok Sabha members from Delhi — all from BJP — and the eight newly elected MLAs of the BJP.

With only one day to go for the swearing-in ceremony, preparations at the historic Ramlila Maidan — the battleground for the AAP convener during the Anna Hazare-led “India Against Corruption” movement — is in full swing.

Kejriwal on Thursday had extended invitation to Delhiites to attend his oath-taking ceremony. “Delhiites, your son is going to take oath as Delhi CM for the third time. You must come to bless your son.”

Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai will visit the Ramlila Maindan on Saturday to assess the preparations for the event, officials said.

In 2015 too, Kejriwal’s oath-taking ceremony had taken place at Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with the Valentine’s Day. In 2013 after his party’s first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was again held at the same venue.

Over a lakh people had attended the 2013 swearing-in ceremony on December 29.

206,15-2-20,"'Parasite' a copy of Vijay starrer, we'll sue: Producer","Tamil producer PL Thenappan, who holds the rights of the 1999 Vijay-starrer ""Minsara Kanna"", has declared he will sue the makers of ""Parasite"", the Korean film that won big at the recent Oscars on grounds of plagiarism.

""On Monday or Tuesday, I will be filing a case with help from an international lawyer. They have taken the plot from my film. When they find out that some of our films have been inspired by their films, they file cases. Similarly, it is only fair for us to do the same,"" Thenappan told thenewsminute.com, adding that he would seek compensation from the producers of ""Parasite"" for copying the idea of his film.

On Sunday evening in Los Angeles, Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" created history by becoming the first foreign language film to win the Best Film award at the Oscars, besides trophies for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Film.

Soon, Vijay fans were claiming the story of ""Parasite"" is the same of as ""Minsara Kanna"", a film directed by KS Ravikumar starring Vijay.

Although social media has refused to take the plagiarism claims seriously, Thenappan insisted he means business.

Director Ravikumar on his part is happy that the controversy will bring international limelight to his film. ""I'm happy that the story has received an Oscar, even if it (Minsara Kanna) served as an inspiration. However, filing a case is up to the producer,"" Ravikumar said, according to the website.

""Minsara Kanna"", also featuring Rambha, Monica Castelino and Khushboo, is about Kaasi (Vijay) entering the household of a rich woman as a driver and soon, one by one, gets his family members employed in her household, with a motive. All through the film, they must keep their identities a secret and work as strangers.

""Parasite"", is a black comedy that talks of class divide and how societal discrimination makes the affluent set insensitive about the less privileged. The film traces a fascinating tale of survival through the story of a lower-class family that infiltrates the household of a super-rich family one by one as employees.

Although the plot point would seem to bear remote resemblance, ""Parasite"" is actually a very different piece of work, and also far more enriched in terms of cinematic idiom and aesthetics.

207,15-2-20,I'm still discovering myself as an actor: Aditya Roy Kapur,"His first hit as a solo hero was ""Aashiqui 2"", and since then Aditya Roy Kapur has appeared in a series of romantic dramas but the actor says he is trying not to be genre specific with his choices.

The 34-year-old actor, whose last release was romantic thriller ""Malang"", said he was still exploring himself as an artiste and would love to play varied characters.

""I still don't know what comes naturally to me as an actor. But I like trying everything. It's too early for me to decide my zone. I don't think like that. I'm still discovering myself as an actor,"" Aditya told PTI on the sidelines of Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2020.

The actor, who will next be seen in Anurag Basu's anthology ""Ludo"", opposite Sanya Malhotra, said the project gave him an opportunity to showcase his comic side.

""My next is 'Ludo' and I'm really excited for the film. It was a lovely process to work with Basu sir. It is going to be a different space for me. There are some elements of comedy and it's a genre I wanted to get into and try,"" he added.

The film, also starring Abhishek Bachchan, Rajkummar Rao, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Pankaj Tripathi, will hit the theatres on April 24.

At the fashion gala, Aditya walked for designer Sohaya Misra's label Chola. The show also marked the launch of Reebok's new style of shoes, Zig Kinetica.

Aditya, who is regular at the LFW runway, said being fashionable doesn't come naturally to him and it was during the promotions of ""Aashiqui 2"" he realised that as an actor he is obligated to dress in a certain way.

""I realised that I need to be a bit fashion conscious when my friends started telling me that I look hideous in what I was wearing during 'Aashiqui 2' promotions. I was promoting the film and few of my friends said 'your solo movie is coming and you are walking around like a vagabond'.

""I feel when I make a public appearance I'm obligated to look good otherwise I don't mind looking just alright. But it's too tiring to be fashionable all the time,"" he said.

To showcase her latest range, Sohaya curated a high-energy presentation with India's popular dance troop Omaggio.

The designer said her collection was ""dedicated to the people who fight life battles every day and the survivors who come out stronger.""

The garments had a signature Chola cut and were adorned by playful tribal prints.

""India My Valentine"", organised by Swara, producer Aditi Anand, activist Fahad Ahmad and Mitali Bhasin, began on February 14 in Delhi and will culminate in Mumbai on February 16.

In an interview with PTI, Swara says it is time to include those who don't subscribe to the ""ideology of hate"" but aren't into aggressive protests either.

""Everything has become an echo chamber, everyone's talking to people who are already convinced. It's time to come out of that. The atmosphere is so polarised, there are people who are going for the protests, they are already there, but there is a population that may not subscribe to the ideology of hate but aren't interested in hard-core aggressive politics, protests.

""Those are the people we should also reach out to. We live in the same country. How long can we keep having this terrible polarised high pitched fighting?""

The initiative, which also travels to Kolkata, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, will see a host of artistes performing, including actors Naseeruddin Shah, Ratna Pathak Shah, Vishal Bhardwaj, Rekha Bhardwaj, Swanand Kirkire, Aamir Aziz, Sumukhi Suresh among others.

""People may not come for protest but they'll come for celebration. They'll not come for a political speech but they'll come for stand-up, music. The idea is to go for softer packaging. To remember what divides and unites us.

""As children, apart from loving our family, the first thing that we learnt to love is our country. We thought of it like how India is our first Valentine,"" Swara says.

The actor says ""India My Valentine"" is not a protest, but a celebration and one, where there is no room for hate.

""Ultimately we do have to reach a place of some kind of consensus about the country we want to see. This isn't a protest, it's a celebration. We believe in the constitution, we don't subscribe to an ideology of hate, we believe in the unity, integrity and territorial sanctity of India. Everyone is welcome, but just don't bring any hate,"" she adds.

211,15-2-20,Making efforts to disembark Indians from cruise ship after quarantine period ends: Indian Embassy,"The Indian Embassy in Japan on Saturday said it is making efforts to disembark all the Indians on board the cruise ship moored off the Japanese coast after the end of the quarantine period as authorities confirmed that 218 people, including three Indians, have been infected with the deadly disease on the ship.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the quarantined ship that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month.

It was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

The Indian Embassy is in contact with Japanese authorities, the ship management company and Indian nationals on board the ship.

""We have continued our efforts with all of them for early disembarkation of our nationals after the end of the quarantine period and subject to favourable results of their tests for COVID - 19,"" an embassy official told PTI on Saturday.

A third Indian crew on board a cruise ship off the Japanese coast tested positive for the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of Indians infected with COVID-19 to three.

The embassy has contacted all three Indian nationals who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently receiving treatment at medical facilities.

""Their health conditions have been confirmed to be stable and improving. Embassy is also in constant contact with the relevant Japanese authorities to ensure the well-being of all Indian nationals on-board the ship,"" it said.

The embassy also sent an email to all Indian nationals on board the ship, assuring them of all help and assistance.

They are also requested to follow the Japanese government's health and quarantine protocols, the embassy said on its Facebook page.

The Japanese government on Thursday announced that passengers aged 80 or older will be given the option to disembark the ship if they test negative for COVID-19. Those who meet the age requirement and have pre-existing conditions or are staying in rooms without balcony will be prioritised for disembarkation.

No Indian national falls under this category, eligible for early disembarkation, the statement said on Friday.

The death toll in China's novel coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,523 with 143 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province, while the confirmed cases jumped to over 66,000, health officials said on Saturday.

More than 580 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China and three deaths, one each in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.

212,15-2-20,Eating fast food can make kids fat,"If you want your children to stay in shape, do not allow them to indulge in burgers and pizzas. Researchers

have found that fast food intake can independently contribute to excess weight gain among children.

Being overweight and obese increases the risk of numerous physical and psychosocial problems during childhood, including fatty liver

disease, Type-2 diabetes and depression.

""We now know from our studies and others, that kids who start on the path of extra weight gain during this really important time

frame tend to carry it forward into adolescence and adulthood, and this sets them up for major health consequences as they get

older,"" said first author Jennifer Emond, Assistant Professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, US.

""To our knowledge, ours is the first study to follow a cohort over time and to show that fast food, by itself, uniquely contributes

to weight gain,"" explained Emond.

Previous research has shown that fast food intake is common among children and has suggested that there is an association between

fast food consumption and children becoming overweight or obese.

But it has not been clear whether eating fast food independently contributes to excess weight gain at such a young age.

In an effort to make this determination, the investigators followed a cohort of more than 500 pre-school age children (ages 3 to 5)

and their families in southern New Hampshire for one year.

The height and weight of the children were measured at the beginning and end of the study published in the journal Pediatric Obesity.

Parents reported their children's fast food intake frequency weekly - from 11 chain fast food restaurants - in six online surveys

that were completed at two-month intervals.

The researchers found that at the beginning of the study, about 18 per cent of the children were overweight and nearly 10 per cent

were obese.

Importantly, about 8 per cent of the children transitioned to a greater weight status over the one-year period.

""Unlike with past research, we were able to adjust for other factors - such as exercise and screen time - that could possibly explain

away this relationship,"" Emond said.

""Findings from this research should be used to inform guidelines and policies that can reduce fast food marketing exposure to

children and help support parents who may be struggling to adopt healthier eating behavio",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eating-fast-food-can-make-kids-fat-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/eating-fast-food-can-make-kids-fat.html

Bryant, an 18-time NBA All-Star in his first year of eligibility, is considered a certainty to join the ranks of the sport's immortals by being enshrined at the honor shrine in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The announcement of Hall of Fame inductees will be April 4 in Atlanta at the US college ""Final Four"" with 18 of 24 votes from the Honors Committee needed to join the select list.

Enshrinement will take place at ceremonies in Springfield from August 28-30.

Prior finalists with another chance include US college coaches Kim Mulkey, Barbara Stevens, Eddie Sutton and two-time NBA champion coach Rudy Tomjanovich. Bryant's tragic death at age 41, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, has had an impact on the Hall of Fame selections.

214,15-2-20,40 killed in attacks in restive central Mali,"Forty people, including nine soldiers, have been killed in a spate of attacks in central Mali, authorities said Friday, with most of the deaths caused by inter-ethnic violence in the deeply troubled region.

Thirty-one people were killed in an attack overnight in Ogossagou, a village mainly inhabited by Fulani people where 160 died last March in a massacre blamed on Dogon militiamen, the government said, raising the death toll.

About 30 gunmen carried out the new attack, village chief Aly Ousmane Barry told AFP.

""Huts and crops were set alight, livestock was burned or taken away,"" he added, vowing that the government would find the perpetrators.

A local government official, who requested anonymity, had earlier said that 28 people were missing.

He blamed the attack on a Dogon hunters' group -- an assertion that could be not be verified independently.

The official and village chief Aly Ousmane Barry both said the attackers moved in several hours after government troops had pulled out of the area.

Later Friday eight Mali soldiers were killed and four others injured in an ambush in the central Gao region, the army said.

The Malian force also suffered ""material damage,"" the military said on social media sites, without indicating who had carried out the attack in the village of Bentia.

Also on Friday a soldier was killed in an attack on a military camp in Mondoro, also in central Mali, security officials said.

The camp had already been hit before -- as part of a joint raid by militants that also targeted the military camp of Boulkessy near the border with Burkina Faso, killing at least 25 soldiers.

Central Mali became gripped by ethnic violence after a jihadist revolt broke out in the north of the country in 2012.

The insurgency has claimed thousands of lives and spread to neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso.

Tit-for-tat attacks in central Mali flared after Fulani people, also called Peul, became associated with jihadists.

Led by a firebrand Islamic preacher Amadou Koufa, a militia called the Katiba Macina recruited members from among the Fulani and has been accused of ethnically-motivated attacks.

Other ethnic groups such as the Bambara or the Dogon began to form self-defence groups that have been accused of reprisal massacres.

In addition to the latest attack at Ogossagou, 14 Fulani were killed in central Mali in January.

Around 75 Dogons were killed in the villages of Sobane Da, Gangafani and Yoro in June last year, in an attack blamed on Fulani militants.

Human Rights Watch this month pointed to the ethnic patchwork of central Mali as the country's ""epicentre"" of violence.

It said over 450 civilians had been killed in the region in 2019, ""the deadliest year for civilians"" since the jihadist insurgency began.

Reflecting the chronic instability, Malian soldiers are themselves frequently targeted.

On January 26, Al-Qaeda-linked militants attacked a military camp in Sokolo, central Mali, killing 20 gendarmes and wounding five more.

The violence in central Mali coincides with renewed hopes that the fragile government can reassert control over the largely lawless north.

Troops returned on Thursday to Kidal, a northern town that had been a bastion of Tuareg rebels, after a six-year absence.

Regular forces returned to the town accompanied by former rebels who have been integrated into the army under a regional peace agreement.

The deal, reached in Algiers in 2015, is considered one of the few avenues Mali has for escaping the cycle of violence.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/40-killed-in-attacks-in-restive-central-mali-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/40-killed-in-attacks-in-restive-central-mali.html

220,15-2-20,Google removes ToTok app from Play Store again,"Google has removed the popular messaging app ToTok amid claims that it is being used for spying by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government for mass surveillance for a second time.

The app was previously pulled from Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store in December.

ToTok was allegedly used by the country to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound, and image of those who install it on their phones, 9to5Google reported on Friday.

According to the US officials familiar with the classified intelligence assessment, the app that works like Signal or Telegram has been downloaded millions of times on Android and iOS devices in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.

ToTok surged to become one of the most downloaded social apps in the US last week, according to app rankings and research firm App Annie.

An investigation by NYT found that the firm behind ToTok is known as Breej Holding which is a front firm affiliated with DarkMatter, an Abu Dhabi-based cyberintelligence and hacking firm.

DarkMatter is already under an FBI investigation for possible cybercrimes.

Earlier, the probe also linked ToTok to Pax AI, an Abu Dhabi-based data mining firm that appears to be tied to DarkMatter.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/google-removes-totok-app-from-play-store-again-2020-02-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/google-removes-totok-app-from-play-store-again.html
