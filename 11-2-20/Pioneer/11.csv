0,11-2-20,Strength of an institution,"The peaceful resolution of the Ayodhya conflict within the Constitutional framework is a sterling example of our pristine democratic traditions and our evolution as a democracy

Finally, after many centuries, the decks have been cleared for the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya with the Union Government setting up the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra trust to oversee the construction of the temple and to manage its affairs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Parliament that the constitution of the trust — which was a historic step — was in line with the Supreme Court’s verdict.

While handing over the disputed land to the Hindus, the apex court directed the Government to formulate a scheme within a period of three months from the date of its judgment. It said the scheme should envisage the setting up of a trust with a board of trustees or any other appropriate body. Further, the scheme should make necessary provisions with regard to the functioning of the trust, including management, power of trustees and the construction of the temple.

The possession of the inner and outer courtyards should be handed over to the trust and the Union Government would be at liberty to make suitable provisions with respect to the rest of the acquired land. Further, the court directed that a suitable piece of land measuring five acres be handed over to the Sunni Central Waqf Board. This land could be allotted “at a suitable, prominent place in Ayodhya.” It said the Union Government and the State Government should act in consultation with each other to effectuate the above allotment within the stipulated period. The Government announced all these measures last week, as was directed by the top court.

The creation of the trust for the construction of the Ram temple is also in a sense the fulfilment of the solemn promise given by the then Government in September 1994 when PV Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister, that if it was found that a Hindu temple existed under the Babri Masjid, the Government would return the acquired land to the Hindus.

The Union Government’s commitment before the court at that time said: “If the question referred to is answered in the affirmative, namely, that a Hindu temple/structure did exist prior to the construction of the demolished structure, Government action will be in support of the wishes of the Hindu community. If on the other hand, the question is answered in the negative, namely, that no such Hindu temple/structure existed at the relevant time, then Government action will be in support of the wishes of the Muslim community.”

Subsequently, almost a decade later, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which was given the task of excavation to ascertain the veracity of the claims and counter claims, came up with evidence of pillars and other artefacts associated with a Hindu temple below the demolished masjid.

The assurance given by the Union Government in this regard was unambiguous and completely devoid of any “ifs and buts.” Given the sensitivity of the issue and the fact that this was a matter of faith for the Hindus — who believe that the disputed piece of land is the birth place of Ram — the Government’s affidavit was a big risk. It meant that the Hindus would need to produce proof or hope that it existed below the demolished structure, which would lend credence to their belief regarding the janmasthan of Lord Ram.

On the face of it, this was wholly unreasonable because the Hindu faith would be tested on the anvil of scientific evidence and if they failed the test, they would lose their claim to the birthplace of Ram. Was the Union Government right in binding the Hindus to such a scenario? It also seemed as if the Government was giving the commitment on behalf of the almost one-billion strong Hindu community.

Yet the Hindus went along with this proposition and it is difficult to find a parallel to this in any part of the world. Although the outcome was a toss-up and could have hurt the belief of the Hindus regarding Lord Ram’s birthplace, which had prevailed over the millennia, the Hindu majority took this in its stride. It also waited patiently for the higher judiciary to give its verdict on whether their faith regarding the janmasthan was justified. If ever one wanted proof of the secular, democratic credentials of the Hindu community, this was it. Its silence over the Narasimha Rao Government’s affidavit and the patient wait for the judicial verdict on a matter of faith showed that for the majority, the Constitution was above everything else.

Eventually, the Hindu-majority found that neither of the faiths — in Lord Ram’s birthplace and in the fairness of the Supreme Court — were misplaced. The court held that “the faith and belief of Hindus since prior to the construction of the mosque and subsequent thereto has always been that janmasthan of Lord Ram is the place where Babri Mosque has been constructed.” It said that this faith and belief had been proved “by documentary and oral evidence.”

Similarly, the quiet acceptance of the Supreme Court judgment by Muslims is also a pointer to the resilience of our democratic system and the general sentiment across communities and across the land regarding the court’s supremacy when it comes to interpreting the Constitution and the laws and

in settling such vexatious disputes.

This is indicative of the robustness of our Constitutional way of life. The peaceful resolution of this centuries-old conflict within the framework of our Constitution is a sterling example of our pristine democratic traditions and of how evolved we are as a democracy. This needs to be celebrated.

The Prime Minister alluded to this when he said recently that following the Ram Janmabhoomi judgment, the people of India had displayed remarkable faith in democratic processes and procedures. The grand temple, when built, will symbolise not only India’s civilisational glory but also its commitment to democracy and harmony.

Let there be no confusion. One may not find another example of this kind elsewhere. It is, therefore, pathetic to listen to some malcontents, whose political ambitions have been thwarted by the people of India in the Lok Sabha election held last year, who are constantly trying to run down our democracy because the people have rejected them. It is even more disgusting to hear lectures on democracy in the Western media, which has never shown the spine to talk about the plight of religious minorities in 60 Islamic nations.

1,11-2-20,Enemy of the people,"If Omar Abdullah’s ability to convince people to shun militants and vote in elections is treason, what is nationalism?

This has got to be a first — Democratically elected leaders, who have been Chief Ministers and Union Ministers, labelled as traitors and, therefore, shaming the political wisdom and popular will that have gone into strengthening the Constitutional definition of our democracy as a “union of States.” The Narendra Modi Government may have abrogated Article 370, demoted the status of Jammu and Kashmir to a Union Territory and promised to usher in development and peace long denied to it but cannot justify why it still relies on laws of the old regime to run it. Instead of using its mandated Central authority to set new legacies, it is still stuck in a tit-for-tat demonisation of the people and defanging the old political leadership, their presence an excuse for its continuing stasis. Either it has selective amnesia about Kashmir’s status, past and present, or it is looking for a convenient tool to control the political narrative in the Valley on its terms. Or drive it to further ruination as just another manifestation of its otherisation politics, its only justification for being a “party with a difference.” And in that effort, it doesn’t matter if it looks hypocritical, inconsistent or one might say, even bizarrely blunderous. What else can explain its use of the Public Safety Act (PSA) to book three former Chief Ministers, National Conference (NC) leaders Farooq and Omar Abdullah, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti? The law was passed in 1978 to crack down on timber smugglers, by the state government led by Sheikh Abdullah, who founded the NC. Over the years, it has been interpreted indiscriminately to curb dissent and separatist leaders. And now Omar and Mufti have been booked, bracketed as separatist threats, and await trial indefinitely. One can understand the dynastic hatred involved in arresting Omar under a law passed by his grandfather. But beyond the theatrics of a “great fall,” it is the dossier of charges that defies reason and borders on the ridiculous. Omar’s crime is the capacity to influence people and his ability “to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycotts.” If this swaying ability, something that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime prized to build a bridge over the conflict, is not nationalism, then one wonders what is. If his persistent calls to resolve the conflict through democratic processes and political empowerment are not Centrist, then one wonders what separatism is. For these abilities, which the current regime could have used to transition into a new narrative in Kashmir, are now seen as a liability than an asset. If he has such great mobilisation powers, then wouldn’t the Government have been better advised to use them for its gains in the absence of an alternative leadership to hold off terrorists? The dossier also mentions his comments on social media against the decisions on Articles 370 and 35-A, which had the potential of disturbing public order. Truth is such criticism and dissent have been voiced by all Kashmiris, political pundits and analysts across the country and Omar hasn’t said anything original or incendiary. If anything, his last tweet before detention was an appeal to Kashmiris to “keep calm.” Now this blanket assumption of his criticism as nothing short of terror portends a clampdown on even routine dissent as an unacceptable sin. By this logic, any criticism of Kashmir policies may disqualify any one of us as a citizen and subject us to the assessment, like in Mumbai, of a taxi driver, who may report us to the police. Mehbooba, with whom the Modi 1.0 had an alliance, has been punished for her stand against Article 370, 35A and cow lynchings.

Frankly, Mehbooba’s views, too, have been no different from the general observations made by everybody who has exercised the democratic right to disagree. Besides, by levelling such a woolly chargesheet, the Government is itself subjecting itself to a flurry of questions. How can it explain why in its earlier avatars, it had coopted both Omar and Mehbooba as valued allies without assessing their threat potential to national security? Was it opportunist then and a realist now or is it the other way around? With this in-your-face victimisation, the Government is only foisting some kind of martyrdom on both Omar and Mehbooba, whom Kashmiris have distrusted as New Delhi’s puppets throughout their political careers. Particularly Omar, who has endeared himself as a genial and engaging fighter, is becoming the face of quiet resistance in the vacuum that is the Valley. Either the Government wants that secessionist undercurrent to continue as it does its political economy, or it simply wants to create another enemy of the people as an excuse for non-performance. The BJP’s one-time acolytes may cost it dear.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/enemy-of-the-people-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/enemy-of-the-people.html
2,11-2-20,Quota wars again,"The SC has stirred up a hornet’s nest by ruling quotas in jobs and promotions are not mandatory

In a ruling that will have widespread ramifications in a country that has always been emotive about the quota issue, the Supreme Court has said that reservation in jobs and promotions is not a fundamental right and that the Government is not bound to provide diversity logic for appointments and promotions to public posts. It also said courts cannot give directions compelling States to reserve jobs or positions for Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/STs). In fact, States willing to provide quotas will have to get relevant data on under-representation of SC/STs in public jobs and ensure the creamy layer is not unduly benefitted at the expense of the most deserving. Understandably this has stirred up a hornet’s nest with the issue being raised in the Parliament and the Opposition Congress demanding that the Union Government either file a review petition in the apex court or amend the Constitution to make reservation a fundamental right.

While the quotas have been politicised over the years, the apex court has merely tried to make them practical, choosing to separate educational quotas from jobs, where efficiencies depend on merit and performance. It has also tried to pass on the agency to the Executive to decide which of the SC/STs really need protection and encouragement. It is true that except for the “creamy layer”, where generation after generation of those who have benefitted from the quota system have left poverty and deprivation far behind, the plight of the majority of the SC/STs has remained the same even over seven decades after Independence. Problem is by passing the decision-making to States, the quota clauses can be tweaked for political rather than social gains and further fragment the backward castes. That’s why our founding fathers, keenly aware of the inequities prevalent over centuries, made provisions for their uplift. In fact, even prior to India’s independence and the inclusion of reservations in the Constitution, several princely states provided benefits to the lower castes in some form or the other, which are present even today. Plus, this is a constitutional matter that should have been heard by the full Constitution Bench and not just a two-judge Bench of the apex court. In a matter that will have an impact in the entire country, the SC/STs should be represented properly, else it will be injustice against them all over again.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/quota-wars-again-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/quota-wars-again.html
3,11-2-20,Not so strategic disinvestment,"Unless there is an economic turnaround and the bureaucratic machinery moves with alacrity to make preparations for conducting PSU sales, the Govt will not reach the Rs 2,10,000 crore target

Buoyed by the success of disinvestment in Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) during 2017-18 and 2018-19 (when the Centre garnered over Rs 100,000 crore and Rs 85,000 crore respectively), for the current year, the Modi Government had set an ambitious target of getting Rs 1,05,000 crore. A major slice of these proceeds was to come from “strategic disinvestment” or transfer of a sizeable portion of ownership (this could go up to 51 per cent, implying privatisation) and management control to a private entity.

The crucial “strategic disinvestment” proposals included divestment of all of the Government’s shareholding in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) 53.29 per cent; Containers Corporation of India (ConCor) 30 per cent; Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) 63.75 per cent; North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) 100 per cent and THDC India Limited 75 per cent. However, the results are disappointing. As per the revised estimates (RE) given in the Union Budget for 2020-21 on February 1, proceeds from disinvestment are Rs 65,000 crore-Rs 40,000 crore short of the Budgetary Estimates (BE). However, till date, the Government has garnered only Rs 18,000 crore. One wonders where it will get the balance Rs 47,000 crore even as the sale of BPCL, CONCOR and SCI (these three undertakings alone were projected to account for over 75 per cent of the target) is unlikely to get consummated before March 31.

For 2020-21, Sitharaman has set an over-ambitious target of Rs 2,10,000 crore which is double the BE for 2019-20 and more than three times the RE for 2019-20. Apart from the strategic sale of the above-mentioned three PSUs, the Union Government has also taken a major decision to list and sell shares of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which is 100 per cent owned by it and accounts for nearly three-fourths of the life insurance business. Besides, it has also resurrected its plan for sale of Air India which was abandoned during 2018-19 due to lack of interest among potential investors. The Government seems to be betting big on LIC and BPCL. Considering the likely valuation of about Rs 900,000 crore (at 30 per cent of its assets estimated at Rs 30,00,000 crore), the sale of 10 per cent shares in LIC could yield about Rs 90,000 crore. Further, divestment of 53.29 per cent shareholding in BPCL is estimated to yield about Rs 60,000 crore (at current market capitalisation of over Rs 110,000 crore). These two add up to Rs 150,000 crore. For the balance, it could bank on sale of 100 per cent Air India (plus Air India Express and 50 per cent of Air India’s stake in ground-handling company AI Singapore Terminal Services Limited (AISATS), CONCOR and SCI et al. The task is daunting.

Prima facie, the sale of a small percentage of shareholding in LIC may sound easy to push as the Government can argue that majority ownership and control will continue to be with it even after this divestment. But, this is easier said than done. The proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the LIC will have to be preceded by amendments to the LIC Act, particularly three sections — Section 24: It deals with the way the corporation handles its corpus (own fund in which all of its receipts are credited thereto and all payments made therefrom); Section 28: It lays down the policy on dividend distribution (how the surplus is to be distributed) and Section 37: It provides Government guarantee on all its policies. The policy on dividend distribution could be a bone of contention.

At present the LIC pays five per cent of the surplus to the shareholder (Government), while the remaining 95 per cent gets distributed among policyholders. In case of private insurance companies however, the shareholder gets 10 per cent of the surplus even as the rest 90 per cent goes to policyholders. The external investor could insist on bringing LIC on par with other insurance companies by modifying the dividend distribution norms. The former may insist on increasing the share of shareholder in surplus from existing five per cent.

According to existing rules under Section 37 of the Act, “Sums assured by all policies issued by the corporation including any bonuses declared in respect thereof...shall be guaranteed as to payment in cash by the Central Government”. One wonders whether post-dilution of the Government’s shareholding, the sovereign guarantee to the policyholders would be retained.

As per the LIC Act, “The paid-up equity capital of the corporation shall be Rs 100 crore provided by the Central Government after due appropriation made by Parliament by law for the purpose”. This needs to be increased appropriately in order to prepare it for the proposed IPO and sell even a 10 per cent stake. The preparations in this regard are bound to be time-consuming and may stretch till the end of fiscal 2020-21. That apart, considering that most of the parties across the political spectrum have opposed stake sale in the LIC, it is doubtful whether the Government will be able to get the amendment Bill passed, more so when it is in the minority in the Upper House (the chances of this being taken up as Money Bill in which case, it doesn’t have to go to the Rajya Sabha are dim). As regards BPCL, while divestment of majority stake in it won’t face any legal hurdle (necessary amendment to the relevant law was made in 2016), the potential buyer will look for exercising its due role even in undertakings where BPCL holds significant stake. For instance, it holds 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet LNG India along with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and Gas Authority of India (GAIL) holding 12.5 per cent each. Though branded as a private company, its Chairman is Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MPNG). The acquirer of BPCL will insist on changing this arrangement.

Likewise, in a city gas distribution firm, Indraprastha Gas (IGL), BPCL has 22.5 per cent along with GAIL which also holds 22.5 per cent. However, the chairmanship of IGL is decided by GAIL (which will continue to be majority-owned by the Union Government even as BPCL is divested). As in the case of Petronet LNG India, the new owner of BPCL will insist on having a role in deciding the management of IGL.

If, the Government is unwilling to bring about these changes, this will lower valuation or lead to dissipation of interest. Late last year, the political brass was contemplating to sell BPCL stake to IOCL on lines similar to the so-called strategic sale of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) during 2017-18 (then, the Union Government sold 51.11 per cent of its shareholding in HPCL to ONGC which is majority owned by itself).

But, the idea was dropped. It may be revived (in a desperate bid to achieve the target) if during 2020-21 also investors don’t evince interest. As regards, Air India, the Government has removed some major bottlenecks which led to the failed move in 2018-19. Now, it is offering 100 per cent of its shareholding, hived off over 60 per cent of total debt from its balance sheet and dispensed with other riders such as three years’ lock-in period on disposition of shares by the acquirer and so on. However, there still remain many irritants, the most serious being a condition relating to retention of employees.

Besides, the PSU-specific factors, the Government’s ability to achieve the target is constrained by “lack of appetite” in an overall subdued economic environment characterised by plunging growth, demand compression, deceleration in investment and above all a not-so-buoyant perception about opportunities ahead.

The appetite was missing even during periods of high growth; for instance in 2017-18 when GDP growth was over seven per cent yet, the Government was forced to sell all of its stake in HPCL to ONGC (this alone yielded Rs 37,000 crore out of a total of Rs 100,000 crore). Now, with growth plummeting to less than five per cent during 2019-20 and muted recovery projected for 2020-21, the appetite would be even lower.

Unless there is dramatic turnaround in the economy, the bureaucratic machinery moves with alacrity to make the required preparations for conducting the sale and Opposition parties extend cooperation in getting necessary laws/amendments passed, it is unlikely that the Government will reach anywhere near the Rs 2,10,000 crore target. The shortfall on this score alone could cause at least 0.5 per cent slippage in fiscal deficit (target for 2020-21 is 3.5 per cent) which anyway will be under threat due to unrealistic projections for tax collections during the year.

4,11-2-20,Not another Corbyn please,"Jeremy, the English Sanders, put Johnson, Britain’s mini-Trump, back in office. That’s not the outcome the Democrats want in US polls

Psephology — the statistical study of elections and trends in voting — is the darkest of the dark arts and you can lose your soul if you delve into it too deeply. But sometimes you have to do it a bit and this is one of those times. Recently, the US Senate acquitted President Donald Trump of both charges in his impeachment trial on a straight partisan vote, with only two members of the 53-strong Republican majority even voting to hear more evidence. But this doesn’t mean that the other 51 really think Trump is innocent. They may be cowards but they’re not stupid.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander acknowledged that Trump’s attempt to blackmail Ukraine’s President into launching a fake investigation that would smear Joe Biden, then the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, was “inappropriate.” In fact, he had only voted to shut the trial down because “there is no need for more evidence to prove what has already been proven.” It just wasn’t a grave enough offence to justify impeachment, Alexander said, and besides, there is an election next November. “I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday,” he concluded. Alexander was only brave enough to say even that much because he will retire from the Senate this year. But he is right in saying that the upcoming presidential election is the only way that Trump can now be brought to book. That would require the Democrats to nominate a candidate who can actually beat Trump. Does such an animal actually exist?

The shambles of last Monday’s Democratic “caucuses” in Iowa, the first step in the process of choosing the party’s presidential candidate, leaves much unclear but it is becoming obvious that Joe Biden, the early front-runner and alleged “safe pair of hands”, is not the right man. If you think a middle-of-the-road candidate is the best bet to beat Trump, Pete Buttigieg is your man. He came first overall in the Iowa caucuses with 27 per cent of the votes, Biden trailed far behind with 16 per cent.

If you think that only a radical break with the Democrats’ traditional MOR stance can beat Trump, then you also have two choices: Left-wing Bernie Sanders (who actually says the word “socialism” in public), or Centre-Left Elizabeth Warren (who at least doesn’t flinch when Bernie says the S-word).

Again, however, there was a gulf in Iowa between the two more radical candidates: Sanders got 25 per cent of the vote, Warren only 15 per cent. These numbers may change slightly when Iowa finally sorts out the mess in the vote-counting but probably not by much. They may change a lot more when the primary elections move to states that are not, like Iowa, 90 per cent white and relatively prosperous (meaning slightly below the US median household income but with much less inequality than in most States).

However, it would require a minor miracle for the leaders and the trailers to change places in either case. So let us assume that the real choice, after a few more primaries, is starting to look like it’s between Sanders and Buttigieg. Which of these men is likelier to beat Trump?

Money is a big factor in any US election and Sanders can certainly raise money, as he showed in his 2016 run for the nomination. Maybe Buttigieg will turn out to have the same knack now that he’s a front-runner but that remains to be seen. There are a couple of problems with Bernie Sanders. He would be 79 if he took office next January (and he had a heart attack last October). More importantly, he may frighten as many voters as he excites. Think: Who in politics does he most resemble?

What other Left-wing politician in an English-speaking country spent decades in the political wilderness, trying to sell hot-gospel socialism to a largely inattentive audience? Who then suddenly caught the attention of the nation’s despairing youth, trapped in a stagnant, low-wage economy and built a national following that suddenly delivered him onto the main stage? And who led his party into a national election on a radical Left-wing programme — and went down to the worst electoral defeat it had suffered in half a century?

Jeremy Corbyn, the English Bernie Sanders, that’s who. It was Corbyn who put Boris Johnson, Britain’s mini-Trump, back in office for another five years with a huge majority in Parliament. That’s not the sort of outcome the Democrats want.

So what will the elders of the Democratic Party do if they find that Sanders, not Buttigieg, is the popular favourite going into Democratic Convention in July. They will probably throw their support behind Michael Bloomberg, the ultimate MOR candidate.

It could work. He’s far richer than Trump.

5,11-2-20,Where to invest in an economic slowdown?,"It’s time to go out there, keep your asset allocation in mind and go ahead with your investments to make a handsome gain in the next four to five years

Over the last couple of months, we have all constantly heard that the economy of the country is witnessing a slowdown. About two to three years ago, our GDP figures were anywhere between six to seven per cent whereas now suddenly we are below five per cent. All these statistics and numbers are suggestive that we might be heading towards an early recession or an economic downturn. To put this in context, we have to first understand the key factors that brought about ground-level bottom-up changes in the country’s economy.

The first grand move happened towards the end of 2016 when demonetisation was announced, followed by implementation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). These three major announcements and shift in policies have been the primary reasons for these unusual times in our economy.

In addition to these three reasons, multiple global scares like China-US trade wars, oil spikes, tensions with neighbouring countries, geopolitical risks and uncertainty of elections during the early part of 2019 can be looked as additional factors for weak demand.When we analyse these data points beyond just the numbers, it indicates that all this is leading to a tectonic shift in the way our economy was structured in the first place. Our economy has a large segment that is still unorganised, fragmented and localised. Many of our businesses were not under the tax ambit and sectors like real estate didn’t have a regulatory framework. When RERA and demonetisation were introduced, it curtailed the cash economy or what we call the parallel economy. When GST was introduced, many small and medium businesses which were not under the tax ambit could no longer get away with not paying taxes. All these changes have led to a level playing field for other players who were following the rules of the land and taxation policies removing any unfair advantage for those who were not paying them. This led to consolidation, formalisation and the industry became a lot more organised. There are some industries that benefitted from the GST whereas some of them had to make initial readjustment of a slightly higher input cost. Overall it will be right to say that this was a very positive move for a developing economy like India as it gives a level playing field for businesses across sizes to benefit from a unified policy. How does one invest in the backdrop of this formalisation, organisation, consolidation and slowdown? I believe that in a couple of quarters from now, this downturn could turn around. With the revival of the GDP and consumption growth back on track, the key driver that led to the deceleration in the GDP will be back to take it forward, gradually before we significantly uptick. The demand recovery will bring in the GDP growth along with inflation. This should take us back to a nominal GDP of 11 to 12 per cent. We have all the initial signs of green shoots that are emerging. The Government is aware of the challenges being faced by industries and several steps have been taken to address the issues. Similarly, active and dynamic policies by Central bankers, the Government and policymakers also indicate that the right steps are being taken towards clearing the challenges. All this presents attractive opportunities for a serious investor looking for the long-term. A downtrend is also a great reminder for people to not get carried away during the good times. We need to understand that ups and downs are a cyclical part of the economy. If one had to take a three to five-year horizon and more, India is in a great spot domestically and globally. There is a lot of foreign interest that’s coming into the country and domestic demand is sure to come back. Many medium and small businesses that are nimble and agile have the ability to disrupt and offer great products because we have access to domestic and international markets. Technology is a key enabler for businesses to tap new markets and introduce new offerings. One can look at investing in equities or even quality debt funds to participate in this move.

We are all hoping that within a few years, India will be the next superpower economically. The growth rate that it has is significantly better than many other emerging markets. If people should align their investments with the key sectors that will contribute to the growth of the economy, one can benefit significantly. Here are some options where people can invest:

Equities: Equities offer great growth for a disciplined investor. As opposed to popular misconception that putting money in equity is risky, done right this asset class can generate tremendous value in the long-term. There are multiple options available for people to invest in equities. Buying shares from the stock market, investing in Mutual Funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are some. Investment can be done in lumpsum or in a staggered manner via systematic investment plan (SIPs). Equity investment has the potential to beat inflation and deliver superior risk and tax adjusted returns in the long term. Dividends, bonus, splits all add further value.

Fixed Income: Like equities, Fixed Income comes with a variety of options. These are popular and hugely-accepted. Depending on the choice, one can opt from a combination of PPF, FD, Tax-free Bonds, Company Deposits and Government securities. Fixed income offerings of mutual funds have all the above options in very convenient schemes and it makes sense to take the mutual fund route for simplicity and efficiency. The hallmark of this asset class is stability and while some of these are backed by the Government too. So there’s plenty to choose from.

Real estate: This may offer good opportunities in certain pockets because a growing economy means that there will be a lot more demand for housing and commercial real estate. With listing of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) gaining popularity and more to come, many well-known real estate players are listed on the markets. One could invest in physical real estate, invest in share of these companies or even participate in their REITs

It’s time to go out there, keep your asset allocation in mind and go ahead with your investments to make a handsome gain in the next four to five years.

The posters have appeared in district collectorate and other localities of the Azamgarh town, which is also the divisional headquarters. They were pasted by a leader of UP Congress minority cell.

The Samajwadi Party has already constituted a committee to inquire into the police lathicharge on anti-CAA protesters this month..

Committee member and former minister Ram Murti Verma, while condemning the posters against his party chief, said, “It is an act of anti-social elements. If Congress is being the vilification campaign, they must have done it for cheap publicity. He added that Akhilesh Yadav had close bonds with the people of Azamgarh.

15,11-2-20,UP govt to set up devpt board for Ayodhya,"Taking a cue from the Central government, which has constituted Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust for construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh will set up a board for development of Ayodhya.

The proposed ‘Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Development Board’ will be responsible for development of international standard infrastructure in Ayodhya for making it a big tourist and pilgrim centre of the world.

A senior official said that the proposed development board would have five members with the chief minister himself as its chairperson.

“In the first phase, the board will prepare a draft for development of Ayodhya with a fund of Rs 250 crore within a time period of two years,” the official said.

Sources further disclosed that the proposal for setting up the board is likely to be placed before the state Cabinet, which is slated to meet in the state capital on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, which is scheduled to hold its first meeting in New Delhi on February 19, is expected to announce the date of start of construction of the Ram temple.

The possible dates are Ram Navami (April 2) and Akshay Tritiya (April 26).

The sources confirmed that the meeting would be attended by seven office-bearers along with some other nominated members.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced in Parliament last week the formation of the trust with 15 members (seven members, three trustees and five nominated members). This was in line with the Supreme Court verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.

On the other hand, the saints of Ayodhya are in discussion on where to shift the idol of Ram Lalla in Ram Janmabhoomi when the temple is constructed. There is no consensus over it and a final decision will be taken by the Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust in its meeting.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Monday visited Ayodhya where she worshipped at the Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi temples.

The governor, during her day-long programme, first went to offer prays to Ram Lalla at the Ram Janmabhoomi and thereafter to Hanumangarhi.

16,11-2-20,Yogi’s concern over education quality,"Expressing concern over the quality of education in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the need of the hour was to improve the quality because in the recent selection of teachers for Basic Education Council, around 70 per cent of the applicants failed to pass the test.

“The recent process of selection of teachers of Basic Education Council is a big eye opener for us as it revealed the condition of education in Uttar Pradesh. Recently, the result of the examination of trained graduates was announced in which 70 per cent of the candidates failed,” the chief minister said at a seminar in Gorakhpur on Monday.

He said that this showed which way the quality of education was going. “So the need of the hour is to pay special attention to our education quality,” Yogi said.

In the same vein, however, he said that the demand for Indian teachers was the highest in the world and to make it more effective, the government would teach foreign languages to teachers and send them abroad by upgrading their qualifications.

“Uttar Pradesh has the largest population of youth in India. Whenever these youngsters get the opportunity, they prove their talent. We have never tried to understand the potential of the youth in right earnest. All the educational institutions in Uttar Pradesh should identify such countries where teachers are needed and the languages spoken there so that these language could be linked to the regular curriculum and teachers could be sent outside the country,” he said while addressing the seminar on ‘Bharatiya sanskriti ke sanskritik mulya Mahant Avaidyanath’ at Digvijaynath LT Training College in Gorakhpur on Monday.

Talking about the contribution of Mahant Avaidyanathji in the education sector, the chief minister said that Mahantji removed the differences of faith and religion.

“A living example of this can be seen in the langar in the Gorakhnath temple where people of every faith and religion receive prasad,” he said.

The chief minister said that Mahant Avaidyanath never hesitated in removing malpractices and evils prevalent in society and that is why saints from all over the country invited him as the president for the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

“He understood human sentiments well and gave up his whole life for social welfare,” the chief minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi---s-concern-over--education-quality.html
17,11-2-20,BJP notice to Raghuraj over his ‘burqa’ comment,"Bharatiya Janata Party has served a showcause notice on party leader and state minister Raghuraj Singh for his controversial statement seeking ban on burqa and terming women wearing it of being “from the family of demons”.

Singh has been served notice on the directive of BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh for indiscipline and making controversial statement, said a BJP statement issued here on Monday.

The leader has been given a week’s time to reply to the showcause notice why he should not be expelled from the party.

The BJP state president said that the party would not tolerate any such comment against women, whether they were Hindu or Muslim.

“BJP always respects women and every party worker and leader will have to respect them. The party will take stern action against the violators,” he said.

Raghuraj Singh kicked off another controversy by demanding a ban on burqas worn by Muslim women. He said burqas were being used by terrorists to conceal their identities, apparently in reference to women protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Shahjamal area of Agra.

Earlier in January, Singh had created a stir by claiming that people raising slogans against Prime Minster Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath would be buried alive. He warned the “handful” of people against saying ‘murdabad’ to the prime minister and the UP chief minister

The BJP leader explained that the tradition of wearing burqa started in Arabian countries and it was not an Indian custom. He added that India should ban the use of burqa, adding that even Sri Lanka had put a curb on it after a series of bomb blasts ripped the country last year, leaving many dead and scores injured.

Reacting to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remark that “youth will hit him (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) with sticks”, Raghuraj Singh said Modi and Yogi Adityanath were icons of the nation and no one would tolerate such talk.

This is not the first time when the BJP leader has made a controversial statement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-notice-to-raghuraj--over-his----burqa----comment.html
18,11-2-20,‘Binjharpuri’ breed cattle born through AI,"A milestone in the field of conservation and improvement of native bovine breed ‘Binjharpuri’ has been achieved with the birth of first artificial insemination (AI) Binjharpuri female calf on February 7.

Way back in 2015, the State Government had decided to induct the Binjharpuri breed, which is very much adaptable to local environment to the frozen semen bank for collection of semen to be used for artificial insemination in cattle.

The then Secretary, FARD, Bishnupada Sethi had initiated the move and nine Binjharpuri bull calves were procured from the native tract and were reared as donor bulls at FSB, Cuttack for semen collection.

The semen was supplied to AI Centres of Jajpur and BBR and BM Farm, Khapuria, Cuttack, for selective breeding roughly one-and-a-half years ago.

The female calf has the credit of being the first ever Binjharpuri calf born through AI. More number of AI calves are expected in near future.

It is really a proud moment for all as we have marched a step forward for successful conservation and development of the breed, said a senior officer.

Such initiative was the first of its kind in the State, which could be possible due to constant guidance and support extended by Sethi.

This initiative was taken by Odisha Livestock Resources Development Society to take up bull procurement for genetic up-gradation of local cattle. Binjharpuri cow has already been registered as 33rd cattle breed in India.

The breed is a potential dual purpose indigenous cattle breed of Odisha, which has brought a lot of hope to the rearers, policy makers and scientists.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---binjharpuri----breed-cattle-born-through-ai.html

The NSA is a stringent law that allows preventive detention for months, if authorities are satisfied that a person is a threat to national security or law and order.

The person detained under the Act is not charged by the Police. And, the goal is to prevent the individual from committing a crime.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the National Security Act, 1980, the Administrator, Union Territory, Chandigarh hereby directs, the District Magistrate, Chandigarh to make orders, directing any person to be detained under the said Act, with a view to preventing him/her from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the state or from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or from acting in any manner prejudicial to maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community,” the order issued on February 7 stated.“The notification shall remain in force for a period of three months, with effect from February 26, 2020,” the order added.

The joint capital of Punjab and Haryana—Chandigarh—being a union territory is primarily governed by the Centre and comes directly under the administrative control of the Union Home Ministry.

When contacted, UT Adviser Manoj Parida said that this is a routine order and is issued after every three months.

Notably, the National Security Act had become a major taking point last month when Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had granted power of detaining authority to the Delhi Police Commissioner under the NSA.

The NSA has repeatedly come under severe criticism for the way it is used by the police.

Under the NSA, an individual can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months. The individual also need not be informed of the charges for 10 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/national-security-act-for-3-months-in-chandigarh.html

25,11-2-20,"Manimajra named Sector 13, new names of eight areas notified","Amid controversy over renaming of Manimajra, Chandigarh Administration has notified new names for eight places in the union territory.

Manimajra will be now seen as Sector 13 (Manimajra) on Chandigarh’s map.

Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had last month approved the proposal of renaming of eight areas, which are not covered under the sectoral grid here.

While earlier it was proposed to name Manimajra as Sector 13 only, the Administration decided to retain the old name as well while issuing the notification.

Notably, many residents had expressed apprehensions that rechristening of Manimajra will harm its historical importance. The proposal was also challenged in the local Court.

Manimajra is a small historical town situated in the foothill of the Shivalik range, established 600 years ago. It has old historical temples and forts.

The town has now been renamed as Sector 13 (Manimajra), stated the UT notification.

Chandigarh, which came into existence in 1966 has remained without Sector 13 for more than a half century. It is said that when Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier was designing Chandigarh, he never included Sector 13 in the layout of the city.

While many believe that number 13 is considered unlucky in France and this superstition led to the omission of Sector 13 from Chandigarh, the official documents stated that Sector 12 and 13 were demarcated initially as a cultural zone in the lower halves of Sector 10 and 11 but later removed to avoid confusion. While number 12 was later assigned to residential area at the edge of Sector 11, the number 13 was left out in absence of an appropriate area for its location.

Meanwhile, other areas which have got new names in Chandigarh include Industrial Area Phase I renamed as Business & Industrial Park I. The new name of Industrial Area Phase II and Industrial Area Phase III is Business & Industrial Park II and Business & Industrial Park III respectively.

Sarangpur Institutional area is renamed as Sector 12 (west), Dhanas including Milk Colony, Rehabilitation colony etc as Sector 14 (west), Maloya and Dadu Majra as Sector 39 (west), Pocket number 8 below Vikas Marg as Sector 56 (west).

29,11-2-20,CM advocates crop diversification,"The focus of Himachal Government is to empower farmers organisations and SHGs at cluster, district and apex levels, implement crop diversification plans (CDPs), post-harvest, value addition etc so that the farm income of the farmers of the State could be double by 2022, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Monday.

Presiding over the inaugural session of international workshop on “impact of crop diversification on farmers income and food security” at Dharamshala, Thakur said the majority of farmers of the State were marginal and small and about 80 percent of the cropped area was rainfed. He said the Department of Agriculture proposed a loan project for JICA funding covering five most potential districts of the State for crop diversification. The loan agreement of the project was signed in February, 2011 with a total project cost of Rs . 321 crore out of which Rs 266 crore was a loan

amount.

Thakur said the main objectives of the project was to increase area and production of vegetables through crop diversification, raise income of small and marginal farmers, create infrastructure for irrigation, farm access roads, marketing as well as formation of Krishak Vikas Associations to take over operations and management of irrigation systems besides capacity building of farmers and extension officers of Department of Agriculture.

He said that the project was being implemented in close coordination of JICA Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) as a comprehensive program. He said that the farmers income has increased substantially after providing irrigation facility and taking up vegetables cultivation by them.

The Chief Minister said that there was vast potential for off season vegetable cultivation in the state. The state Government has created 59 market yards to ensure remunerative price to the farmers, but we require many more such markets in the state so that the farmers have easy access to them the market yards need to be linked with the national agriculture market for better price realization to the farmers for which the process has already started.

He said the Crop Diversification Plan (CDP) implementation was in progress in these sub-projects and other activities like construction of collection centers, farm access roads, solar pumping system, micro irrigation systems, poly-houses, vermi-compost units have also been completed in most of the sites and remaining works would be completed in the near future.

The Chief Minister said that community participation during planning, execution as well as operation & maintenance of irrigation systems was vital for the success of the project.

He said irrigation efficiency has been increased by 40-60 percent through micro irrigation system in lift and Tube-well irrigation systems although only about 20 per cent farmland of the State has been brought under irrigation facilities.

Thakur said the most important reform done in this project is transferring the ownership and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation systems to the farming communities through Krishak Vikas Association (KVA). Linking most of the projects with Farm Access Roads and solar pumping is another milestone, the project has achieved.

He said that the second Phase of the JICA project worth Rs 1104 crore has been proposed for funding which would be approved soon and would be implemented in all the twelve districts of the State. He said that the state government has started solar fencing project to save the crop of the farmers from wild and stay animals.

The Chief Minister released various publications and souvenir on the occasion.

Chief Representative of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Matsumoto Katsuo, who was also the guest of honour said that JICA was committed to provide all possible help to the State Government to make the JICA project a success in the State.

He said that the Technical Project of JICA also was operating and supporting the loan project to introduce and standardise innovations in increasing efficiency and farm income.

He said that a new mushroom strain ‘Shitake’ has been introduced in the state which has high nutritional and medicinal value.

Principal Secretary Agriculture Onkar Sharma said that to know the exact potential for crop diversification, a two year study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 which was supported by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) as granted under bi-lateral cooperation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-advocates-crop-diversification.html

32,11-2-20,35 new among 310 species spotted in Haryana Bird Count 2020,"A total of 310 species were spotted during the Haryana Bird Count 2020, a state-wide avian census that took place between January 12 and January 19 in the State, the statistics compiled now said.

Out of 310, around 35 species were reported for the first time in the State. The highest numbers of species 213 were spotted in Gurugram, said additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) Vinod Kumar while talking to The Pioneer.The Additional PCCF said the census brought to the fore encouraging figures and revealed the presence of many rare species. “The department has endorsed the survey findings and will use the same for avian conservation initiatives,” he said.

Kumar said that over 30 teams of 130 bird watchers carried out the count from January 12 to 19 across the State. The Forest and Wildlife Department supported the birders with logistic and access to forest areas, he said, adding that species spotted include Baillon's Crake, small Pratincole, Gull-billed Tern, small Buttonquail, common House-Martin, Pale Sand Martin, Bank Swallow, European Roller, Himalayan Flameback, Brown-fronted Woodpecker, Speckled Piculet ,Indian Golden Oriole, Chestnut-tailed Starling,Tricolored Munia, Rufous-vented Grass Babbler, Black-chinned Babbler, Rufous-tailed Lark, Water Pipit, Striolated Bunting, Common Iora, Thick-billed Flowerpecker, White-crowned Penduline-Tit, White-naped Tit,Blue-capped Redstart, Plumbeous Redstart, Asian Brown Flycatcher, Little Pied Flycatcher, Fire-fronted Serin, Fire-tailed Sunbird, Himalayan Swiftlet among others.

Kumar said that the State's 22 districts boast of more than hundred birding hotspots as documented by Ebird, India. Ebird is a database available on public domain that collate and analysis the Bird watching.

Haryana has recorded 505 species of birds which were observed based on observers reporting in the last 10 years. Based on observation of 4 years and during 3 winter months of December, January and February, the reported numbers of species are 421 and 361 in the month of January in the two past years.

Against this back ground, Haryana Bird Count 2020 on two dates of January 12 and January 19 recorded 310 species in which 17 districts of the 22 were covered. These numbers are consistent with previous record of 361 for January for all districts, the official said, adding that more interesting part of Haryana Bird Count 2020 has some 35 species reported were not the one reported earlier in the Ebird

The additional PCCF said that the field staff of Forest Department Haryana supported the participating teams with all required logistics during the survey. While average size of the team was four, there are instances of lone birder covering hotspot and also team comprising of nine members. Instances of teams travelling more than 100 kms to carry out bird count in a particular district were also seen.

Highlighting the outcome of the census, he said that while Bird count in most of the districts confirmed the prevailing trends of last 10 years, some of the districts showed marked improvement in the species count, such as Yamunanagar which had an average of 83 over the past years and record of 90 species in the current year.

Similarly Palwal, (plus 30 per cent), Rewari (plus 500 per cent), Sirsa, Panipat and Bhiwani registered remarkable improvement from the past records available on Ebird.

Kumar said that based on the findings of Haryana Bird Count 2020 and existing reporting of species in the Ebird, a combined list of 331 Species has been arrived at as baseline species to consider as benchmark to for the month of January in Haryana. Results also indicate that there is potential to improve the tally of known 506-507 species of Haryana as there are at least 4 district that were not covered namely Ambala, Nuh, Hissar, Kaithal.

There are districts like Charkhi Dadri and Fatehabad either not covered previously or covered scarcely. The major districts traditionally covered are 4 and they are Gurgaon, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Panchkula. Thus balance 18 districts hold ample opportunity to improve the species count of the state.

After Gurugram, the highest number of species were spotted in Jhajjar (187), followed by Rewari (161), Faridabad (150) and Sonepat and Yamunanagar (120 each), Mahendragarh (105), Fatehabad (83), Charkhi Dadri (94), Rohtak (74), Kurukshetra (88), Panchkula (102), Palwal (131), Bhiwani (101), among others. The data also highlighted noticeable increase in number of species in districts such as Palwal, Yamunanagar, Panipat, Bhiwani and Sirsa. Yamunanagar, which had so far recorded 83 species in the month of January, reported 120 species.

Sunder Lal Sambhariya, DFO Rewari, said that the census was conducted by teams of bird watchers with the Forest and Wildlife Department’s support. Such census is being conducted during January each year. During monsoon season also migratory birds were being spotted in various parts of Haryana and department conducts such census during monsoon season each year. ”It is interesting that the first bird count recorded 310 species but since teams were of different sizes in different districts, this could be the reason more species were spotted in districts such as Gurugram and Faridabad.” Another wildlife officer said that during this season, over 15,000 migratory birds of more than 100 species from Siberia, Russia, Europe, Afghanistan, China and other countries were seen swimming and chirping in the water bodies at Mandothi and Rohad villages.

While bird watchers and lovers from Delhi, Chandigarh and different districts of the State visited these villages, local residents are also enjoying the presence of these winged guests in their area. Wildlife inspectors have been roped in at these villages to ensure the safety of these birds, an official said, adding that this year, the number of migratory birds is much higher than previous ones. Not only at Mandothi and Rohad, but also at Aashoda, Dighal, Baland, Ritauli, Kabulpur, Dhaud and Jharli villages, migratory birds were using water bodies on private lands as stopovers.

The wildlife officer said that the objective of the bird count was to know the exact number of various species of avi-fauna in the State as well as to find out the well-being of the birds and the habitat in which they were living, he said, adding the counting have been focus on bird species as the highest numbers of migratory birds were being used to be at the wetland areas during this season.

He further said, “The bird is quite common in the surrounding areas of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Sometimes, birders miss the bird as it looks like some common species. Also, it is difficult to click a photo since it keeps on flying. Interestingly, the bird resembles a crescent or a boomerang.

The wildlife officer said that study reveals that migratory birds from China, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tibet, Siberia and Iraq start thronging the wetland in October-mid. The winged visitors return to their native countries in March with the onset of the spring season. January is the best time for its counting and recording..”

The Wildlife official said distribution, numbers and behaviour of birds are changing over a period of time because of various reasons. The population of the black partridge (kala teetar), Haryan state bird, sparrow among others has been decreasing over the past few years. As of now, there are no exact figures of the population of many bird species in the state, he said, adding this data will help the department to take more effective measures to conserve wildlife in State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/35-new-among-310-species-spotted-in-haryana-bird-count-2020.html

35,11-2-20,"Make Santali compulsory in schools, colleges","Tribal Mayurbhanj needs rail links for tourism growth

Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you,” says the Bible. Here is one, who adhered to the words faithfully and was bestowed with the courage and conviction to strive, to seek and not to yield while serving his fellowmen in the Udala Assembly constituency in Mayurbhanj district. He started his career from an humble beginning as a Ward Member of a remote village and became a PS Member. Climbing the hierarchical ladder, he became a Zilla Parishad Member and subsequently was given a BJD ticket in 2009 to contest from Udala. He emerged triumphant defeating his nearest rival by a margin of 12,800 votes and became instrumental in opening floodgates of development in the neglected constituency. During his five year term from 2009 to 2014 he has ushered in an era of tremendous development by toning up of the connectivity of the area in constructing bridges and in changing the economic plight of his people for the better. However he tested his cup of defeat missing his membership to the Assembly by a whisker as he lagged behind by 700 votes in the 2019 general elections. Srinath Soren today has no remorse and exuded an air of confidence as he works for his people round the clock with redoubled energy and vitality. He advocates that if Olchiki could be made compulsory as lingua franca, the rich cultural heritage of the Santali language could be preserved for generations. In an interview to The Pioneer, Soren spoke to Sugyan Choudhury.

What are the developmental works you have undertaken in your constituency during your tenure as its MLA?

My constituency is Udala. I was given BJD ticket by the blessings of my beloved leader Naveen Patnaik in 2009 and I won the electoral fray. You know our constituency consists of three blocks, which are surrounded by rivers, Road connectivity was a farfetched dream that added to the miseries of the people of the area. People were deprived of marketing their commodities. Students were handicapped for their movements. Economy of the area was at an all-time low. With the blessings of Naveen Patnaik, I have been able to provide as many as twenty bridges over the inaccessible rivers and toned up communication in the area. Today, my constituency has marched ahead and the economic backwardness of the people has been addressed considerably. Our Chief Minister constituted a high-power railway committee and selected me as a member of it. The committee was headed by the then Speaker Pradeep Amat. I pleaded with the Chief Minister that since our area comes under the Similipal biosphere, there was no railway system no factories. Our people have not seen trains. I begged before him to connect the area with a railway system and he readily agreed to my proposal and advised me to probe how to arrive at a solution. I consulted various people and railway authorities and informed the CM that Udala could be connected through the Jajpur railway station. The CM took steps and we met the PM at New Delhi in a committee. Now, there is a proposal approved to run trains from Kharagpur to Bhadarachalam via Anandpur, Soro, Kaptipada, Udala and Baripada. The dreams of our people will soon be a reality by the decisive intervention and of Naveen Patnaik.

What steps have you taken for development of agriculture in your area?

Our Gopabandhu Nagar block is a dry area and farmers are deprived of irrigation facilities since there is no barrage, no project. Naveenbabu patiently heard my prayers and the petitions,You will be happy to know that an irrigation project of about Rs 230 crore is going to be tendered very shortly. Eight out of thirteen GPs will have irrigation facility.

Which are the river-bridges constructed in the area during your tenure?

There are many bridges constructed during my tenure. They are over the rivers Sono, Kala, Thakthaki, Kusabhadra, Duimuhani, Deo and Nalu.

What are your plans for the economic amelioration of your people?

You know my constituency is under the Similipal biosphere adjacent to the Similipal National Park. If the Government of India or the State Government has declared it as a national park then how the name ‘national park’ is justified if national or international tourists can never visit the sanctuary. I think the Similipal National Park is robbed of its true meaning. If Mayurbhanj is connected by the proposed and already-surveyed railway line then tourist will flow in. If one tourist spends one hundred rupees per head, there shall be one crore rupees transaction in this zone per every one lakh tourists in a year. The adivasi people shall also get a chance to sell their traditional artistic commodities and certainly benefit under the scheme. A magnificent, unique Siva Linga here at Koliolam is probably going to become the eighth wonder of the world as historians and scholars opine. All that is needed is to connect the outer world to this aesthetic wonder place bristling with the beauty and bounty of pristine nature.

What’s is your vision for uplift of your own tribe, Santhals?

People of Santhal tribe thickly inhabit Mayurbhanj district. They have a culture of their own. Pandit Raghunath Murmu is the inventor of “Olchiki”, the Santali language script. During my MLA tenure, I have built a Pandit Raghunath Murmu Sadan, where hundreds of Santhal children are getting free education in the Santali script. They are taught in their mother language up to MA standard. The Santhal songs music and dance are also very rich culturally. This time, Dr Damayanti Bisra has received Padma Shri award for her contribution to Santali literature. Now, Santali language is taught from primary school. Legendary leader Biju Patnaik looked upon the tribal people as his sons and daughters. He was as much proud of the heroic exploits Samrat Kharavela as he was of the sublime sacrifice of tribal leaders like Birsa Munda in the history of our freedom struggle. If our present CM can follow the footprints of his illustrious father and make Santali language compulsory in schools and colleges along with English, Hindi and Sanskrit, the Santali language very much akin to a sapling may grow into a huge banyan under Naveenbabu’s patronage.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/make-santali-compulsory-in-schools--colleges.html

We were asked to meet them on Monday, but later they said that Circle Officer (CO), Traffic is on leave and the meeting will be held on Thursday.

The department is consistently making excuses to deceive us which is making the poor drivers annoyed and aggravated due to which any driver can resort to burning his e-rickshaw or himself any day on any intersection of the city.”Several meetings of e-rickshaw drivers have been reportedly deferred by the traffic police department which were initially slated by the department itself.

According to Bishan Thapa, a member of Devbhumi E-Rickshaw Owner and Driver Welfare Society, “No one is taking us seriously. We are even ready to drive our e-rickshaws for a fixed number of working hours but no initiation is being taken by the government. If the government cannot lift the ban of no entry on main roads of the city then it should get us loan waiver. Government waives the loan of businessmen and industrialists from time to time then waiving off our loan should not be an issue.

It would hardly be more than Rs two crore in total. Forget about the meals, but at least we and our families will not be humiliated by the bank employees every day.” Ramu Lal, another protesting driver said, “I bought this rickshaw nine months back with a loan. Now I do not know how to deposit instalments in the bank, or feed my family or treat my ailing son.

I am already living like a dead man, so if I have to burn myself or this e-rickshaw tomorrow or any other day, it would not be a big deal for me because whether I live or die, in both ways I will be unable to support my family.”

“We saw how the Anganwadi workers protested for two months and then they were heard by the government but we cannot afford to wait for two more months. We have families to take care of and we cannot survive without any earnings.

Probably we are poor people, and therefore we are being neglected by the government. I hope that after we immolate ourselves, government will at least listen to our fellow brothers.” Meanwhile, Tyagi said that if government does not take any decision soon then they will begin to protest in every programme of the state’s ministers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/will-burn-our-vehicles-or-ourselves--warn--e-rickshaw-drivers.html

41,11-2-20,Sheeshambada locals warn of stir outside CM house,"Locals of Sheeshambada warned to start an indefinite period protest outside the chief minister’s residence if the government does not take any decision soon regarding the dumping of the garbage by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) without No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB).

According to one of the locals Satpal Dhaniya, “We are protesting for about three months now but there is no response from the administration. If the government does not take any decision soon then we’ll shift our indefinite period protest to outside the chief minister’s residence.”

He also added that in addition to the indefinite period protest, locals will also start a public awareness campaign through which the public will be made aware about the harassment of the locals of Sheeshambada in the name of garbage dumping in the solid waste management and recycling plant and how government is operating the plant without any NOC from Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB).

About the operation of plant without NOC, deputy municipal commissioner Rohitash Sharma said, “We have applied to UEPPCB and whatever queries the board had concerning the waste management plant, we have responded to the same. Hopefully we’ll get the NOC in a few days.”

According to the project manager of Sheeshambada solid waste management and recycling plant MA Saify, the Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP) is fully functional and proper water filtration is being done through it.

Concerning the foul smell and germs due to garbage dumping, Saify said that organic enzymes are sprayed everyday in every part of the plant and there is nothing like foul smell in the area.

He added that the locals have made their mind to get rid of the plant in spite of having no issue in the area caused by the waste management plant.However, the locals are consistently alleging the occurrence of foul smell and improper treatment of leachate by the management of the plant. According to one of the protesting locals Prem Singh Negi, “What is the purpose of setting up LTP when the leachate is getting mixed with ground water? The leachate has spread in the whole area which has converted the area into a marshy land.

How are they going to treat it with the help of LTP?” Talking about the foul smell he said that the stench of the garbage is everywhere in the area and even Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) assured the locals last month that there would be no unpleasant smell after January 31 but the situation is still same.

It is pertinent to mention here that Sheeshambada residents have been alleging for past few months that the plant is causing several health problems in addition to noise pollution and foul smell in the area concerning which they have met Dehradun mayor, municipal commissioner and chief environment officer of UEPPCB but no decision has been taken yet in their favour.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sheeshambada-locals-warn-of-stir-outside-cm-house.html

53,11-2-20,BJP opposes alleged closure of MMKAY,"The State BJP will strongly oppose the State Government alleged attempt to close down the Mukhyamantri Krishi Aashirwad Yojana (MMKAY). State BJP spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo said, “The State Government is shutting down various welfare schemes initiated by previous government to hide its failures.” He said the JMM Congress Government came to power by promising 150 per cent profit on the cost price of the produce and loan waiver of farmers, but we have reports that State Government is planning to close down Krishi Ashirvad Yojana, a welfare scheme that would make farmers debt-free and self-reliant.

It seems that by closing such welfare schemes Government has made up its mind to sacrifice the farmers. He further said that 35 lakh farmers were getting direct benefit from Krishi Aashirwad Yojana and they were becoming self-reliant instead of debtors. The BJP government aimed to make them fully self-reliant in the next five years through this scheme. The closure of this scheme will force the farmers to once again fall under the grip of the Mahajans, if something like this happens in the future, the BJP will take the road for the rights of the farmers.

Talking to journalists, Shahdeo said that while the Raghubar government had spent most of the budget on public welfare schemes, on the other hand Hemant Soren continued to appear in Delhi Durbar during the most important months of revenue collection, so that the revenue collection target has lagged behind.

He said that the Hemant Government, which came to power by making big promises and announcements, is now ready to make excuses and the Hemant government does not have the ability to make its promise reality and misleading the people that treasury is empty.

Addressing the press persons, Shahdeo said that Hemant government is canceling the tenders of the previous government and is examining the tenders held in the last five years. The BJP has no objection to this inquiry as the BJP has zero tolerance on corruption. But the Hemant government should also add its last 14 months tenure to this investigation to prove its earlier tenure fair.

Expressing concern over the huge increase in Naxalite attacks, Shahdeo said that the state is again in the grip of extremism once the Hemant government is formed. In the last one and a half months, there have been dozens of Naxalite incidents in the state.

56,11-2-20,"Satipati followers, villagers’ altercation led to violence: Report","A team of activists, writers and journalists have indicated that the friction between Gurjarat based Satipati cult now active in several villages across the State and the villagers led to the killing of Burugulikera village in West Singhbhum few weeks ago.

In an attempt to understand the role of Pathalgadi movement in the Chaibasa massacre, a fact-finding team comprising activists, writers and journalists visited Burugulikera village as most of local media reported that the beheading of seven people in Burugulikera village of Gudri block in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand on January 22 and January, was due to Pathalgadi movement.

The team had representatives of Adivasi Adhikar Manch, National Alliance of People’s Movement (NAPM), Marxist Coordination Committee, Ulgulan Sena and Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabhha.

Addressing a press meet on Monday in the State Capital one of the team member, Aloka Kujur said that initial media reports indicated that the pro-pathalgadi faction of the village had murdered members of the anti-pathalgadi faction for opposing their movement. Speaking on reason of the killing, Kujur said that the fact-finding team found that more than half of the total number of families of the village was followers of the AC (ante-Christ) known as Satipati cult.

“The cult was led by Ranasi Budh and a few others, accused of killing James Budh and six others of the village. The cult, active since the past year in the village, asked people to submit their Government’s Identity Cards,” she added.

“More than half of the families submitted the documents, while James and others did not.

The documents were not forcefully taken but people were sometimes told that they would not be considered Adivasis or be expelled from the village if they did not submit. People were asked to submit their khatiyan (land documents) too which many did not. James Budh, upmukhiya of the Gram Panchayat, used to get benefits of Government schemes and objected to the call for giving up schemes. Ranasi Budh’s wife Mukta Horo was the ex-Mukhiya and they also used to get benefits of schemes.

The Satipati cult supporters also asked others not to go to Church or celebrate Sarna (Adivasi) festivals. These were causes of friction between the two factions,” said Kujur.

Elaborating about findings of the team Kujur said, “On 16 January, a day after local Maghe Parv (an Adivasi festival), James Budh and his friends attacked the houses of Ranasi Budh and four others. “ On 19 January, Ranasi Budh and other Satipati cult supporters brought the attackers from their homes to a meeting, to allegedly discuss the attack on their houses. From the testimonies of Satipati supporters and family members of the victims, it emerged that the seven people were beaten to death in the meeting and then beheaded.”

As exposed in the Pathalgadi movement and the recent indication of people’s support for the Satipati cult, the movement and cult are primarily driven by the continuing alienation of Adivasis, attack on their natural resources and lack of development based the Adivasis’ needs and worldview.

We had our back against the wall, but these are the conditions which inspire a person to function at his best. Now the same company with the same set of employees has reached a record production of 68.74 MT and we are one of the largest contributors to the Jharkhand State exchequer.

The transition did not happen overnight but was possible because of Kayakalp model of governance which lays emphasis on transparent, bold, ethical and philanthropic approach. It has led to large scale organizational transformations.We have settled long pending complex issues and have received environmental as well as forestry clearances, we have also taken physical possession of land and have opened greenfield projects.

All these accomplishments would have been negated if we didn’t fulfill our debt to society. Our priority is inclusive growth and the objective is- Overall development of villagers, poor and labourers.

CCL has implemented many schemes in skill development, education, sports, health and drinking water for the well-being of people of Jharkhand.

One person who has inspired me is Swami Vivekanand and I often remember a quote of him” If the poor boy cannot come to education, education must go to him”.

In a country like India quality education is a privilege which is available to a few and I consider myself fortunate that I got an opportunity for decent education. I wanted CCL to provide the same opportunity to every child in the country.One of the initiatives which is close to my heart is Kayakalp Public School. The school is for the oppressed, destitute and the children of beggars who don’t have access to education.

These children come from different slums of the city like Jaganathpur, Hatma. The intention was that we should leave no stone unturned in providing the students with the best infrastructure and amenities. With this understanding the school was set up in an area of 3.5 acres in Bukru Village in Ranchi-Patratu Highway in 2018. We recognized the hardships that these children encounter in their day-to-day lives. Hence the aim was to make education a gratifying experience. Keeping this in mind bus facilities are available which pick and drop the students from their homes.

Atthe time of admission, we provide four pairs of uniforms to the students. The students are given mid-day meal and routine health checkups are carried by a team of specialised doctors from CCL Gandhi Nagar Hospital. In the world that we live today communication is an integral ingredient of career development, hence the medium of teaching is English.

The desire is toturn Ranchiinto a city with no child beggars in it. We have informed the authorities and requested the public that if they notice any child beggar in any part of the city kindly inform our representative and we will arrange for their education in this school. The aim is to transform the lives of these kids so they play an effective part in nation building.

Transparency is paramount and to assure that a three-member committee has been constituted to evaluate the students before acceptance. This is perhaps the only school in the city where the criteria for entrance is that the student should belong to downtrodden section of society.We started with thirty students and today there are fifty-five students in the school from classes nursery to two. We are hopeful to raise this number manifold.

There is a sense of contentment when we notice the transformation in these kids. The children who could not speak a line in Hindi are now competent to take pledges and recite poems in English.One student states he aspires to become a doctor.

Before admission in the school he used to beg and the future for him meant a day of survival with the meagre alms.There are many such stories in this school which compels a person to believe in the capability of education in transforming society.

When these students will reach seventh grade, they can try to qualify for Sports academy run by CCL.The teachers in this school are the family members of CCL employees. They don’t accept any remuneration for their work.

We are a country that discovered zero. Strangely zero has no relevance of its own, but when we add a prefix to it, the value increases manifolds. Same is the situation with these children, perhaps if they were not admitted to this school of their dreams and story would have been different but now, they have a mission in mind to accomplish.

There are apprehensions in the minds of people that being a coal mining company why is this focus on education.

I believe that we produce coal to illuminate the future of our children.

Company is committed to fulfilling the vision of our Honorable Prime Minister i.e.” Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”.

The Ministry of Coal, GoI is constantly supporting Coal India and its subsidiaries in fulfilling the energy aspirations of the country.

One school will not eradicate the plague of child begging entirely, but we believe that this is a modest step in the right direction. Opening of this school was a memorable achievement for the company but the proudest occasion will be when there will be no child beggar left in the city to educate.

95,11-2-20,Cong criticism of Govt mischievous: CM Rawat,"Reacting sharply to the criticism levelled by the opposition Congress party on the issue of reservation in promotion, the Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat reminded that it was the Congress government which proposed in the cabinet meeting held on May 9, 2012 for removing the benefit of reservation in promotion.

Talking to the media persons at new building of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) on Monday, he said that the Congress party has got a habit of defaming government. He added that a similar charge was leveled by the party against the government on setting up liquor factories though the licences were given by the Congress government. On the recent Supreme Court (SC) order on reservation in promotions, the CM said that the Uttarakhand government is examining the order of the SC and would take appropriate action.

Rawat said that it is also a fact that thousands of employees have retired in recent months without availing the benefit of reservation. He said that ensuring timely promotion to its employees is also one of the responsibilities of the government.

It is pertinent of mention here that in a landmark judgement the SC on February 7 had ruled that reservation in promotion in not a fundamental right and states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions. It opined that seniority and merit should be the criteria of promotion. With this decision, the SC quashed the decision of Uttarakhand HC in Gyanchand case which allowed benefit of reservation in promotions.

The Uttarakhand government had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the SC against the HC order. The state government also issued a moratorium on promotions of its employees in September last year.

After the order of the SC, lakhs are state government employees are awaiting the government order (GO) on revoking this ban.

In the meantime thousands of employees have retired without promotion resulting in resentment among the government employees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-criticism-of-govt-mischievous--cm-rawat.html

97,11-2-20,Lithium batteries perilous for environment: Minister,"MP Mahesh Poddar today said that the safe recycling of lithium batteries can play an important role in terms of protecting the environment and generating new employment opportunities. In response to a question asked by Poddar in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Babul Supriyo admitted that lithium batteries can pose a serious threat to the environment if not disposed of safely. He also informed that there is a technology in India for safe recycling of lithium batteries and through this, the precious metals in these batteries are reusable.

Supriyo stated that at present, lithium batteries used in electric and electronic equipment are being regulated through e-waste management manual 2016. But, there is no authored recycling facility for the use of lithium batteries emitted from electric mobility i.e. battery powered vehicles and other modes of transport. In other words, the recycling of lithium batteries used in electric vehicles is a new opportunity for entrepreneurs. Due to the current policy of the government, the number of electric vehicles is continuously increasing and its number is expected to increase further.

Poddar said that if there is no provision for safe disposal of waste lithium batteries after use in electric vehicles, then they will pose a serious threat to the environment. On the other hand, if it is regulated, it will create a new field of employment and self-employment. He has requested the government to regulate the recycling of lithium batteries from electric vehicles, just like electric and electronic equipment.

Guidelines for safe and formal recycling of lithium ion batteries have not yet been prepared. However, technology and facilities exist for such recycling facilities in the country.

Recycling technology of cobalt, nickel, lithium, copper, aluminum, etc present in lithium ion batteries in the country is available by any proponent.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lithium-batteries-perilous-for-environment--minister.html

""We have not sent any team to represent the state or the nation in any championship in Pakistan,"" Punjab Sports Minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi told the media.

""If the PKA is confirming that it has sent the players, they should identify them,"" Sodhi added.

The Punjab Kabaddi Association (PKA) has sent a 60-member Indian contingent to Pakistan for the ""World Cup"". It entered Pakistan via the Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar.

PKA vice-president Tejinder Singh Middukhera said the Pakistan Kabaddi Federation has organised the tournament to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and had invited the PKA.

The team's coach is Harprit Singh Baba and its captain is Gurlal Ghanaur.

The schemes that are useful will continue, but the schemes that are useless and causes unwanted burden on state exchequer will be stopped.”

The Agriculture Minister said that no decision has be taken to stop the Mukhyamantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojana , but the dept is going through details of the schemes such as objective of the scheme and the beneficiaries of the scheme.

The Agriculture minister’s refusal to close down the MMKAY scheme assumes importance as Opposition parties are skeptical that Hemant government will close down MMKAY scheme.

On August 11 last year, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu along with Chief Minister Raghubar Das launched Mukhya Mantri Krishi Ashirwad Yojana (MMKAY).

The Vice President by pressing a button credited Rs 442, 24,64,758 in the account of 13,60,380 farmers. Under the MMKAY scheme of Raghubar Das Government, the beneficiaries (farmers) will get Rs 5,000 per acre for purchasing seeds, fertilizers and other agriculture tools.

Farmers having agricultural land upto 5 acres have to get Rs 5,000 for each acre with maximum amount upto Rs 25,000. The MMKAY scheme is additional to PM Kishan scheme under which farmers has to get Rs 6,000 per acre in three installments.

Badal said, “We will hold two or three more such review meeting of agriculture department and then decide whether to close down MMKAY.” CM and agriculture minister also reviewed the functioning of crop insurance scheme in state. Badal said, “We have come to know that there are many beneficiaries of crop insurance in a family, while on other hand many families have been left out.”

On the issue of waiving farmers’ loan as announced by three parties Grand Alliance, Badal said, “The Grand Alliance is committed to waive farmers loan, but at present no decision has been taken as the state exchequer is empty.”

The Grand Alliance (JMM, Congress) in election had announced to waive farmers’ loan on the lines of Congress ruled Chhattisgarh government. During election campaign, apart from waiving farmers’ loan it was also announced that JMM/Congress government will hike the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of paddy upto Rs 2500 on the lines of Bhupesh Bhagel government in Chhattisgarh.

132,11-2-20,"Economy in ICU, perilously close to collapse: PC","nProjecting a dismal picture, former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday said the ""economy is in ICU"" and ""perilously close to a collapse"" attended to by ""incompetent doctors"". He also said the economy is facing twin problems of rising unemployment and declining consumption terming them as ""two elephants"" in the room but the Government continues to live in denial.

Making these remarks while initiating a debate in the Rajya Sabha on Budget for 2020-21, he offered Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman the same advice that Narendra Modi as BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate had offered him in November 2013.

On November 2, 2013, a very distinguished political leader said and I quote: ""Economy is in trouble. The youth wants jobs. Devote more time to the economy, not on petty politics. Please focus on the job at hand. Very wise advice. I can't do anything better than reading this piece of advice to the Finance Minister,"" Chidambaram quipped.

He said the need of the hour was to revive demand and incentivize investment. Moreover, more money has to be put in the hands of the masses rather than classes and do away with 'tax terrorism,"" Chidambaram said.

According to him, the economy was facing structural problems but the Government continues to believe they were cyclical in nature. Modi government's chief economic adviser for four years, Arvind Subramanian, has stated that the economy is in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). But ""I would say the patient has been kept out of the ICU and incompetent doctors are looking at the patient,"" Chidambaram said. Tearing into the Budget, the former finance minister said the BJP government lives in denial, refuses to acknowledge its mistakes and has an ""outdated"" predisposition towards protectionism and a strong rupee, and is against bilateral as well as multilateral trade agreements.

Chidambaram called demonetisation of old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes as well as the hurried implementation of a ""flawed"" Goods and Services Tax (GST) with wrong design, rates, structure and procedure and an unprepared system as ""monumental blunders"" that ruined the economy.

He urged the Government to realize its mistakes and have an open mind to debate it. While GDP has fallen to an 11-year low of 4.5 per cent in 2019 July-September quarter, agriculture is growing by just 2 per cent, while consumer price inflation has risen from 1.9 per cent in January 2019 to 7.4 per cent in a matter of 11 months.

Also, food inflation is at 12.2 per cent. Bank credit is growing 8 per cent with non-food credit rising by 7-8 per cent and credit to the industry by just 2.7 per cent.

Credit to agriculture has declined from 18.3 per cent to 5.3 per cent and that for MSMEs from 6.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent, he said.

He quipped that every competent doctor that the Modi government could ever find has left the country and listed out former Reserve Bank of India(RBI) governors Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel, former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian and former NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya as persons who quit during the BJP rule.

Taking a dig at Sitharaman, Chidambaram said she read out a 160-minute speech but he could not make out what she was trying to say.

Manas Ranjan Bhunia(TMC)echoed more or less same apprehensions about the economy and said the economy is drowning. He remarked while China is battling with corona virus, India is hit by financial corona virus triggered by North Block (Finance Ministry office) and said people of the country will save economy.

The Samajwadi Party demanded augmenting of health budget and cautioned that improper allocation to the sector could crumble the economy. Stating this party MP Ravi Prakash Verma said health allocation should be enhanced from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent.

However, Ram Chandra Prasad Singh (JD-U) termed the budget as ""growth

Oriented,"" saying it took care of the masses with good policies for agriculture, ST, SC and the poor. BJP leader Arun Singh and AIADMK chief in the house A Navaneethakrishnan also lauded the budget.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/economy-in-icu--perilously-close-to-collapse--pc.html

To build capacity within these communities, staff from each host institution will be trained in installing and handling the equipment, as well as collection and compilation and analysis of all generated data, the statement said.

At quarterly intervals, the data will be presented and discussed with local residents, helping spread awareness about the role of air quality monitoring, the importance of keeping the air clean, and the prevention of illnesses associated with air pollution, it said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/us-embassy-teams-up-with-ngo-to-address-air-pollution.html

DIG Anil Maheshwari and SP Tilak Singh have been posted in Bhopal. Both were instrumental in arrest of an SDM who had plotted attack on himself in Chhatarpur to benefit a private university.

143,11-2-20,"Omar's sister moves SC, challenges his detention","Former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's sister on Monday approached the Supreme Court, challenging his detention under the J&K Public Safety Act(PSA), 1978 saying the order of detention is “manifestly illegal” and there is no question of him being a “threat to the maintenance of public order”.

In her plea, Sara Abdullah Pilot has said that exercise of powers by authorities under the CrPC to detain individuals, including political leaders, was “clearly mala fide to ensure that the opposition to the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution is silenced”.

It said the intent of exercise of power was to “incarcerate not just him (Omar Abdullah) but the entire leadership of the National Conference, as well as the leadership of other political parties, who were similarly dealt with including Farooq Abdullah, who has served the State and the Union over several years... Stood by India whenever the situation so demanded.”

The plea has sought quashing of February 5 order detaining Omar Abdullah under the PSA and also sought his production before the court.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Pilot, mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench headed by Justice NV Ramana.

Sibal told the bench that they have filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the detention of Omar Abdullah under the PSA and the matter should be heard this week.

The bench agreed for listing of the matter.

In her plea, Pilot has said that on the intervening night of August 4-5, 2019, Omar Abdullah was put under house arrest and it was later learnt that section 107 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 was invoked to justify such arrest.

“There has been a grave violation of Articles 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution,” the plea said, adding, “similar orders of detention have been issued by the Respondents (authorities of union territory of Jammu & Kashmir) over the last seven months in a wholly mechanical manner to other detenues, which suggest that there has been a consistent and concerted effort to muzzle all political rivals”.

It said there could be no material available to detain a person who has already been detained for previous six months and the “grounds for the detention order are wholly lacking any material facts or particulars which are imperative for an order of detention”.

Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's considerable influence over people, including the ability to attract voters to polling booths despite poll boycott calls and the potential for channelling energies of public for any cause, has been cited in support of his detention under the stringent PSA.

His political opponent and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti has been accused of making anti-national statements and extending support to organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islamia of the state, which has been banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

Tarigami, in a statement here, said, “The PSA dossier of Mehbooba states that the 'green colour of party (PDP) flag' reflects radical origin. Was not the colour of PDP flag same when the BJP entered into an alliance with it to share the power in Jammu & Kashmir in March 2015?”

He also said that Omar Abdullah's PSA dossier states his ability to convince the electorate to vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycott calls by separatists and militants.

“Is it a crime to have influence over voters and convince them to vote despite threats by militants and separatists?” Tarigami asked and asserted that in a democratic setup every leader has influence over people and voters which is not considered as crime in any part of the country or the world.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/reason-for-psa-shows-bjp-s-intellectual--moral-bankruptcy--tarigami.html

The MPs were speaking at the second day of debate on Budget and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will reply on Tuesday afternoon in Lok Sabha and evening in Rajya Sabha, the last working day of the first part of Budget Session.

Participating in the debate on the Union Budget 2020-21 in Lok Sabha, BJD member B Mahtab called for financial sector reforms to revive rapidly declining investment. ""We are measuring GDP growth. More the investment, the growth would be faster and quicker,"" he said, adding that adequate corrective measures were necessary to boost growth which is estimated to slip to five per cent in 2019-20. Banks were not in a position to lend to infrastructure, Mahtab said and asked the government not to lose sight of wider reforms in the public sector.

""There is a need to bring competition within the banking sector,"" he said.

NCP's Supriya Sule termed the budget as ""long and tiresome"" and said it has exposed the failure ""of this Govt when it comes to fiscal health"".

She said the Government talks about achieving USD 5 trillion economy but ""we are not even barely crossing five per cent (growth)"".

Former Union Minister Preneet Kaur (Cong) said the presumption of 10 per cent nominal GDP growth and 12 per cent rise in tax collection seems unrealistic given the low economic growth and falling exports.

However, BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi said there is a balance between intent and content, and vision and provision in the Budget. ""We have moved from policy paralysis to policy action under the Narendra Modi government,"" she said adding the focus is on growth and the Budget will strengthen the foundation of Indian economy in the new decade.

The Budget promotes six major sectors against the backdrop of current economic scenario, she said. It will help facilitate investment, spur consumption while giving a push to infrastructure and fillip to agriculture sector, she added.

Gajanan Kirtikar (Shiv Sena), Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), AM Ariff (CPI-M), ET Mohammad Basheer (Muslim League), Sunita Duggal (BJP), Brijbhusan Sharan Singh (BJP), Krishna Lauv (YSRCP), Nama Nageshwar Rao (TRS) and Benny Behanan (Cong) also participated on the debate.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mps-urge-govt-to-take-steps-to-stem-slump--generate-jobs.html

The fresh batch of foreign envoys will visit Jammu & Kashmir later this week and those who will be part of the delegation include envoys from European Union and the Gulf countries, official sources said without any further elaboration on the specific date of the visit or the composition of the visiting team.

The first batch of 15 envoys, including the US Ambassador to India, Kenneth I Justerhad, had visited Jammu and Kashmir last month on a two-day visit. .

The first batch of the envoys included those from the US, Latin America and Africa. But diplomats from Australia and several Gulf nations as also the European Union could not make the cut but were desirous of visiting the Valley at a later date.

Parliamentarians from the European Union had visited Jammu and Kashmir in October in order to assess the ground situation. The Parliamentarians, on a private visit, were briefed by the security forces on the situation there.

The Parliament had on August 5 abrogated the special status to J&K under Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir into union territories, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

Following India's move, Pakistan had launched a vitiated campaign against the move across major capitals as the repeal of the special provision paved the way for full integration of the terror-hit territory with the Indian Union.

In the wake of continued propaganda and the telecom restrictions, a number of countries had voiced concern over Internet shutdown and detention of political leaders. However, Pakistan could not get much traction despite a pitched campaign against India due to lack of

credibility in Islamabad's arguments.

153,11-2-20,SC upholds constitutional validity of SC,"The Supreme Court Monday upheld the constitutional validity of SC/ST Amendment Act, 2018 saying a court can grant anticipatory bail only in cases where a prima facie case is not made out.

A preliminary inquiry is not essential before lodging an FIR under the act nor is the approval of senior police officials, said a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra. Justice Ravindra Bhat, the other member of the bench, said in a concurring verdict that every citizen needs to treat fellow citizens equally and foster the concept of fraternity.

Justice Bhat said a court can quash the FIR if a prima facie case is not made out under the SC/ST Act and the liberal use of anticipatory bail will defeat the intention of Parliament. The top court's verdict came on a batch of PILs challenging the validity of the SC/ST Amendment Act of 2018, which was brought to nullify the effect of the apex court's 2018 ruling, which had diluted the provisions of the stringent Act.

The apex court had in January last year refused to stay the 2018 amendments to the SC/ST Act, which restored the provision that no anticipatory bail be granted to the accused in offence lodged under this law.In its 2018 verdict, the apex court had taken note of the rampant misuse of the stringent SC/ST Act against government servants and private individuals and said that there would be no immediate arrest on any complaint filed under the law.

Violent protests had taken place across the country after the apex court's verdict in which several persons lost their lives and many were injured.

Parliament on August 9, 2018 had passed the bill to overturn the apex court March 20, 2018 judgement concerning certain safeguards against arrest under the SC/ST law.

Later, the Centre had filed a petition in the top court seeking review of its March 2018 judgement.

Addressing students of the Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) here, the former CJI also said that everybody has the right to express views on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but “the resolution of the issue must be through Constitutional means”.

Referring to the protests over the CAA in his home State Assam, the former CJI said there were elements who wanted to harm the integrity of the country, but the student community there called off the violent protests within days, which improved law and order situation overnight.

“Perhaps the most important fundamental duty is the respect of the unity and integrity of the country. There are issues in this, and why hype them. The Citizenship Amendment Act...It is an issue. You may have a view about it, I may have a view about it, and our views may not match. I have the right to express my view, you have the right to express your view. Fine.

156,11-2-20,Lecturer set afire by stalker dies,"Tension prevailed in Daroda village of Hinganghat taluka of Maharashtra’s Wardha district on Monday, as a 24-year-old lecturer succumbed to burns at Orange City Hospital & Research Institute (OCHRI) in Nagpur, a week after she was set ablaze by her spurned suitor near her college in the nearby taluka town.

The news of the victim woman’s death sparked unrest in her village, where the people took to street to condemn her death and stopped the ambulance carrying her body from the Nagpur-based hospital to her native village. Some villagers resorted to stone pelting.

However, a 300 member-strong police force deployed specially in the village brought the situation under the control.

An intense drama unfolded in Daroda village after the parents of the victim woman had refused to take her body till they got a written assurance from the State Government that the accused Vicki Nagrale (27) — who had doused the victim woman with petrol and set her on fire on February 3 in broad day light— would be dealt with sternly. Some irate villagers were demanding that the accused be burnt alive. However, the parents agreed to accept the body after State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh assured them that the accused would be punished.

Hundreds of people turned out for the victim woman’s funeral held in the village later in the evening, amid gloom and emotional scenes.

Earlier at 6.55 am, the victim woman — who had been battling with life for a week —-succumbed to burns at OCHRI. “At around 6.30 am; patient again had bradycardia and in spite of prolonged Cardiopulmonary resuscitation as per ACLS guidelines; patient could not be revived and was declared dead at 6.55am today,” Dr. Anup Marar, Director of OCHRI.

“Probable cause of death kept was Septicemic shock in patient of 35% Grade III Deep Dermal burns with Inhalational Injury. MLC was duly conveyed and body was handed over to police authorities for post mortem and allied formalities,” Dr Marar said in a statement issued later in the day.

Dr Marar said that the victim woman, who was on ventilator since February 7, remained critical all through as she had respiratory distress and fluctuations in Blood Pressure. Her condition deteriorated further in the early hours of Monday, after oxygen levels in her blood dipped alarmingly low.

In his reaction to the death of victim woman and subsequent developments at her native village, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said: “We will not show any mercy to the accused. Many a time, the trial in this kind of cases takes time. We will not allow such a delay to take place in this case. We will prove the guilt of the accused in a quickest possible time and execute him”.

“It is rather unfortunate we could not save the victim woman from being set ablaze in such a savage manner. Nor could we save from succumbing to burns. This incident is a big blot on Maharashtra,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said in his condolence message.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased woman and a job to one of the members of the bereaved family.

Making an announcement to this effect, Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare Bachhu Kadu said: “We will prosecute the accused through a speedy trial and hand him out a stern punishment”

It may be recalled that the victim woman suffered nearly 40 per cent burns after the accused Vicki Nagrale — who was laying in wait for her near college at Hinganghat— took out petrol from his two-wheeler and poured it on her and set heron fire, at around 7.30 am on February 3. After she shrieked for her, the bystanders doused the burning victim woman with water and extinguished the fire. By then, she had been badly burnt.

The police investigations have revealed that the victim woman — who was a Botany lecturer in a Hinganghat-based college — and the accused used to travel to taluka town in Wardha district by the same bus. The accused had some month ago expressed his love for the victim woman, who spurned him.

Nagrale, who landed a job in the Railways, is married with a six-month-old daughter. He used to harass her for the past three months. The victim woman’s father had taken the accused to task, after her fixed marriage peroposal fell through.

Nagarle, who would normally travel to Hinganghat with the victim woman by bus, had arrived earlier than her near college on Monday morning.

The police suspect that the accused had hatched a conspiracy to burn the victim woman alive.

“Burqa should be banned in the country as has been done in several other countries,” Raghuraj Singh, who holds a rank equivalent to a minister of state in the Uttar Pradesh government, told reporters.

Singh claimed burqa is not worn in countries like Sri Lanka, China, the US and Canada and said it should be banned in India as terrorists can take advantage of it.

The BJP leader said people are sporting burqas in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest against the new citizenship law, and added, “The burqa helps terrorists, thieves and anti-socials elements to hide behind it.”

“Burqa is a threat to national security and has to be banned to crush terrorism,” Singh said.

Without citing his source, Singh linked burqa to Surpanakha, the demon who has her face disfigured in Ramayana. According to Singh's version, Surpanakha fled to hide in the Arab desert.

“As her nose and ears were chopped, she used a burqa to hide her face,” he said, adding it is not necessary for humans.

“In Mecca, a shivalinga was set up by Guru Shukracharya, who was the guru of devils, and from there the burqa tradition started,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/up-bjp-leader-seeks-ban-on-burqa--links-it-to-ravana-s-sister.html

The samples of these 37 people were sent for testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.

In a release issued on Monday, the state health department said currently two people were in an isolation ward in Pune's Naidu Hospital and one in Sangli district hospital.

It said 23,350 people have been screened at the Mumbai International Airport since January 18, including 166 who arrived in the state from areas affected by the new strain of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has wreaked havoc in China. “Of the 37 persons admitted in isolation facilities in the state on suspicion of coronavirus infection, 34 have been discharged.

171,11-2-20,Bad loans of PSBs shrinking: Sitharaman,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said public sector banks’ (PSBs) bad loans came down to Rs 7.27 lakh crore at the end of September 2019, on host of measures taken by the government to improve financial health of the banks in the country.

“The government has instituted comprehensive reforms in PSBs to improve, governance, underwriting, monitoring and recovery, and has leveraged technology in all aspects of banking, resulting in reduction in their NPAs,” Sitharaman said in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.

She said bad loans of PSBs stood at Rs 7.27 lakh crore at the end of September 2019, down from Rs 8.96 lakh crore at the end of March 2018.

“Record recovery of Rs 2.03 lakh crore over the one-and-half year period ending September 2019, 12 out of 18 PSBs reporting profit in the first half of the current financial year, and the highest provision coverage ratio in seven-and-half years,” she said.

She said the Banking Trend Report published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in December observed that the health of the banking sector hinges on a turnaround in macroeconomic conditions.

“The government has taken significant steps towards speeding up the insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and easing of credit, particularly for the stressed real estate and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) sectors, and that the impact of critical measures taken to boost investment present green shoots for growth in the second half of 2019-20 and 2020-21.”

Further, the RBI’s Financial Stability Report stated that the capital adequacy ratio of scheduled commercial banks has improved significantly from 14.3 per cent in March 2019 to 15.1 per cent in September 2019 following recapitalisation of state-owned banks.

PSBs’ provision coverage ratio has risen to 61.5 per cent from 60.5 per cent over the same period implying increased resilience of the banking sector, and their net non-performing assets ratio has declined reflecting increased provisioning, she said.

When asked about the bank’s confidence in extending loans, she said sporadic credit default events and incidents of frauds have contributed to reluctance in lending by banks. She, however, added that a number of steps have been taken to address these and other matters concerning lending by banks.

She said the measures initiated include maintenance of overall positive liquidity through open market operations by the RBI, liquidity support through various means to the NBFC sector in which there have been instances of credit defaults, and enabling of financial support for stalled housing and real estate projects.

“Mechanism for resolution of stress in NBFCs has been created by empowering RBI to take action in this regard through amendments...and bringing NBFCs with an asset size of Rs 500 crore and above within the ambit of resolution under IBC,” Sitharaman said.

To address concerns due to frauds contributing to reluctance in lending, she said the Prevention of Corruption Act has been amended to prohibit conduct of inquiry or investigation of offences relatable to decision taken by public servant in discharge of functions, without previous approval of the authority competent to remove him.

The Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds has been set up for distinguishing between commercial failure and criminal action cases of suspected frauds over Rs 50 crore, before initiation of investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Besides, the government has taken steps to facilitate and incentivise lending through successive cuts in lending rates, linking of loans for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to an external benchmark rate, and relief to banks’ cash reserve ratio requirement, among others.

“With regard to governance norms for banks, it is stated that the government has recently introduced comprehensive reforms in PSBs, taking into account global best practices, for empowering bank boards, strengthening the board committee system, improving the effectiveness of non-official directors and building a leadership pipeline,” the minister said.

She also said that specific reforms include empowerment of boards to recruit chief risk officers from the market at market-linked compensation, mandate to boards to provide non-official directors necessary training, and to undertake annual peer evaluation of their performance.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bad-loans-of-psbs-shrinking--sitharaman.html

Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Monday that the government has taken many measures including hike in the minimum support price and procurement of pulses to support farmers. The country had produced 23.40 million tonnes of pulses during 2018-19 crop year (July-June), still short of annual domestic demand of 26-27 million tonnes. The gap is met through imports.

However, for the current year, the government is targeting pulses output of 26.30 million tonne. Speaking at an event on the occasion of World Pulses Day, Tomar said, “pulses are becoming necessary not only in India but also in other countries. We faced huge shortage of pulses earlier but now the situation has improved.”

Research and development (R&D) at the government’s research body Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and appropriate policy intervention has helped achieve substantial increase in pulses output in last few years, he said.

The Minister also launched organic range of pulses at the day-long event, organised by cooperative Nafed and Dubai-based non-profit body Global Pulses Confederation (GPC).

As more number of people are becoming vegan across the world, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said, India has the opportunity to meet future demand but the country needs to take measures to improve yield level of pulses which at present are lower than pre-Green Revolution days of 1965. Nafed Additional Managing Director S K Singh said India can meet the pulses requirement of neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh from its surplus produce.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-to-become-self-sufficient-on-pulses-production.html

178,11-2-20,"2 CRPF men martyred, Naxal killed in Bijapur","Two commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force were killed and six other CRPF personnel, including an officer, injured in an encounter with Naxals in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district on Monday, officials said.

A Naxal was also died in the gun-battle, they said. The gunfight started around 10.30 am in a forest in Irapalli village under Pamed police station limits, located over 400km from here, when security forces were out on a counter-insurgency operation, Inspector General of Police Sundarraj P told PTI.

Separate teams of security forces, numbering around 800, had launched the operation in the Maoist core areas of Sukma and Bijapur districts on Sunday, he said.

One of the patrolling teams, comprising personnel from the CRPF's 151st and CoBRA's 204th battalions, had launched the operation from Tippapuram camp in the forests along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts, the IPS officer said.

On Monday morning, this patrolling team busted a Maoist camp near Irapalli and was advancing through the area when it came under fire from Naxals, triggering a fierce gun- battle between the two sides, Sundarraj said.

The exchange of fire lasted for about two hours after which the ultras escaped into dense forest, he said.

""Two constables - Vikas Kumar and Purnand Sahu - were killed in the gunfight, while six others, including an officer, sustained injuries"", he said. While Kumar was a native of Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, Sahu hailed from Rajnandgaon district in Chhattisgarh, the IGP said.

The body of a Naxal along with a weapon was recovered from the encounter spot, he said, adding the identity of the deceased was yet to be ascertained. The injured CRPF personnel were identified as deputy commandant Prashant Kumar, head constable Ajit Singh and constables Giriwar Oraon, P Pawan Kumar, Bibha Basu Mahata and Pawar Pandurang, Sundarraj said.

The martyred constables and the injured personnel were part of the 204th battalion of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA), an elite unit of the CRPF, he said. PTI

The injured were airlifted to the state capital Raipur for treatment, he said. The IGP, quoting preliminary information, said the ultras involved in the encounter were members of the dreaded battalion No. 1 of Maoists which is active in south Bastar, the IPS officer added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/2-crpf-men-martyred--naxal-killed-in-bijapur.html
179,11-2-20,China praises PM Modi’s letter to XI on coronavirus aid,"China on Monday appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s letter to President Xi Jinping offering solidarity and assistance to deal with the deadly coronavirus outbreak, saying it “fully demonstrated” New Delhi’s friendship with Beijing.

In a letter to Xi, Modi expressed solidarity with the president and people of China over the outbreak of the virus that has claimed over 900 lives in the neighboring country.

“We thank and appreciate India’s support for China’s fight against the NCP Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, the official name for coronavirus,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. “India’s acts of goodwill fully demonstrate its friendship with China,” Geng said during an online media briefing while replying to a question on Modi’s letter to Xi. Prime Minister Modi also offered India’s assistance to China to face the challenge, besides conveying condolences over the loss of lives due to the outbreak.

The prime minister also conveyed to Xi his appreciation for facilitating the evacuation of around 650 Indian citizens from the worst-affected Hubei province last week.

A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from China.

India too has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China as part of precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus.

“We stand ready to work with India and other members of the international community to jointly tackle fight the epidemic and safeguard regional and global public health security,” Geng said.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told the Indian media here on Monday that India was in touch with Chinese officials to find out the immediate requirements to deal with the epidemic.

The death toll in China’s coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 908 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province and the confirmed cases of infection crossing 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday.

A team of international experts led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) would arrive in China on Monday night to assist the Chinese health officials to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

“I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led 2019nCoV international expert mission to China, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, a veteran of past public health emergencies,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/china-praises-pm-modi---s-letter-to-xi-on-coronavirus-aid.html

182,11-2-20,NIA summons Cong leader to appear before it today,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has summoned senior Congress leader and former minister G M Saroori to appear before it on February 11 for questioning in connection with the terror incidents in Kishtwar district of Jammu & Kashmir, officials said.

Saroori, 67, is Jammu and Kashmir Congress vice president and three-time legislator from Inderwal constituency of Kishtwar.

The communally sensitive Kishtwar was rocked by a series of terror incidents since November 2018 after the hilly district was declared terrorism-free over a decade ago.

The terrorists made their appearance felt in Kishtwar town when they shot dead senior BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajit Parihar on November 1, 2018, while RSS functionary Chanderkant Sharma and his PSO were assassinated on April 9, 2019. The terrorists also snatched the service rifle of the deputy commissioner's PSO Daleep Kumar on March 8 and the rifle of PSO of People's Democratic Party (PDP) district president Sheikh Nasir Hussain on September 13, last year.

The NIA is investigating the terror cases in the district. The first major success against the terrorists operating in the district was registered on September 28 last year when security forces killed three ultras, including the mastermind behind the killings Osama Bin Javed, in an encounter in Batote area of Ramban district.

The major breakthrough came when the terrorists were fleeing an offensive by the security forces which saw over a dozen Hizbul Mujahideen militants and their overground workers arrested and several of their hideouts busted in Kishtwar district.

In September last year, Saroori's brother Mohammad Shafi was among a dozen persons booked in two separate FIRs for their alleged links with Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit in the district.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nia-summons-cong-leader--to-appear-before-it-today.html

At close, the BSE Sensex was down 162.23 points, or 0.39 per cent, at 40,979.62. The index swung about 373 points during the day.

Likewise, the NSE gauge Nifty ended lower by 66.85 points, or 0.55 per cent, to 12,031.50.

Indices were mainly dragged lower by heavy losses in auto and metal stocks.

On the Sensex chart, Mahindra and Mahindra crashed over 7 per cent, followed by other major laggards including Tata Steel (5.80 per cent), ONGC (2.84 per cent), Sun Pharma (2.39 per cent) and Hero Motocorp (2.34 per cent).

Sectorally, among the top losers were metal (3.14 per cent) and auto (2.37 per cent) indices. Power and consumer durables too fell 1.66 per cent and 1.64 per cent, respectively.

Auto stocks were down after industry body SIAM data showed that domestic passenger vehicle sales declined 6.2 per cent in January. While metal shares bore the brunt of growing concerns over the rising cases of coronavirus.

The industry body said that the Indian auto sector is apprehensive about coronavirus outbreak disrupting component supplies from China, but a clear picture will emerge only in the next few days after factories in the country reopen.

186,11-2-20,WHO warns overseas coronavirus spread may be ‘tip of the iceberg',"The head of the World Health Organisation said on Monday there have been ""concerning instances"" of coronavirus among people with no travel history to China, warning that it could be the ""tip of the iceberg"", as he urged all countries to prepare for the possible arrival of the novel virus that has killed over 900 people.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the doctors, nurses and health workers for doing ""their utmost"" at personal risk to contain the epidemic, terming them ""true heroes"" of the outbreak that first surfaced in December in Wuhan city in China's central Hubei province where millions of people are under lockdown in a bid to stop it from spreading.

""There've been some concerning instances of onward 2019nCoV spread from people with no travel history to China. The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,"" tweeted Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.

Ghebreyesus said the spread of coronavirus outside China appeared to be slowing, but could accelerate, warning that any breach in solidarity is a victory for the virus.

188,11-2-20,"Boko Haram kill, abducts dozens in northeast Nigeria","Boko Haram jihadists killed at least 30 people and abducted women and children in a raid in northeast Nigeria's restive Borno state, a regional Government spokesman said on Monday.

The attack Sunday evening targeted the village of Auno on a key highway linking to regional capital Maiduguri.

The jihadists stormed in on trucks mounted with heavy weapons, killing, burning and looting before kidnapping women and children, state government spokesman Ahmad Abdurrahman Bundi said.

They aimed at travellers who had stopped for the night and torched vehicles.

The attackers ""killed not less than 30 people who are mostly motorists and destroyed 18 vehicles,"" Bundi said in a statement after visiting the scene.

The attack, some 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Maiduguri, occurred in an area where fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have been active, mounting roadblocks to target security forces and civilians.

Witnesses said jihadists set alight 30 vehicles in the raid, including trucks that had stopped overnight on their way to Maiduguri. ""Many of the drivers and their assistants who were sleeping the vehicles were burnt alive,"" civilian militia fighter, Babakura Kolo told AFP.

The jihadists combed through the village, looting and burning shops and property before withdrawing, he said.

Auno lies on the 120-kilometre highway linking Maiduguri to Damaturu, a major regional city in neighbouring Yobe state. The highway has been increasingly targeted by ISWAP militants in recent months. The surge has followed the creation of so-called ""super camps"" by the Nigerian military in the northeast — a strategy under which small army camps have withdrawn from several areas and combined into fewer, larger bases. Last month four Nigerian soldiers were killed and seven injured when the jihadists attacked troops positioned in Auno.

189,11-2-20,Asia breaks the barrier,"Making Oscar history

The film took Hollywood’s top prize on Sunday night, along with awards for best director, best international film and best screenplay. In a year dominated by period epics — 1917, Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood, The Irishman — the film academy instead went overseas, to South Korea, to reward a contemporary and unsettling portrait of social inequality in Parasite.

True to its name, Parasite simply got under the skin of Oscar voters, attaching itself to the American awards season and, ultimately, to history. The win was a watershed moment for the Academy Awards, which has long been content to relegate international films to their own category. Multiple standing ovations greeted Bong’s several wins. “I am ready to drink tonight,” Bong said, prompting roars from the crowd. Unexpectedly called up again for best director, Bong saluted his fellow nominees, particularly Martin Scorsese, and concluded: “Now I’m ready to drink until tomorrow.”

The victory for the film — which had echoes of the surprise win by Moonlight over La La Land three years ago — came in a year when many criticised the lack of diversity in the nominees and the absence of female filmmakers. But the triumph for Parasite, the Palme d’Or-winner at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, enabled Hollywood to flip the script and signal progress, nevertheless. No Korean film had ever won an Oscar before.

In doing so, the film academy turned away another history-making event, again denying Netflix its first best-picture win despite two contenders in The Irishman and Marriage Story, and a big-spending awards campaign blitz.

South Koreans reacted with joy after the good news came as their country struggles to guard against a new virus and counter North Korea’s nuclear threat.

The film’s win made history in South Korean film industry too. The class satire is the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards, and is the first South Korean film to ever win an Oscar.

South Korean social media were overwhelmed with congratulatory messages. Bong, Parasite and other Oscar-related news also dominated search terms throughout Monday at major internet portal sites, which had been preoccupied with the outbreak of a virus in China that has killed more than 900 people and sickened tens of thousands of others, mainly in China.

“It’s happy news, like welcome rain, to the Republic of Korea, which is depressed, stagnant and thrown into despair due to Wuhan pneumonia,” the main opposition Liberty Korea Party said in a statement. Wuhan is the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak.

President Moon Jae-in and his advisers began a regularly scheduled meeting by clapping their hands to celebrate Bong’s wins. Moon later tweeted that he is proud of Bong and his staff and “particularly grateful to them for giving courage and pride to our people who are overcoming difficulties.”

“I think this was a great opportunity to let the world know the true value of Korean movies,” said office worker Cho Sung-ho, 54. “I think it is very meaningful that the Academy Award this time has acknowledged the superior quality of Korean films.”

Actor Priyanka Chopra said that this win is a call for representation. She believes that this signals the fact that it is time for wider representation in Hollywood, beyond the cinema that only the US makes. “It’s the time of representation. As people and as entertainers. Our craft has the power to transcend borders and languages, and tonight Parasite demonstrates exactly that. Congratulations to the entire film for shattering the glass ceiling and making history as the first non-English film to win Best Picture,” she wrote on her social media.

While Parasite registered a historic win and Janelle Monae addressed the diversity issue through her opening number, the 92nd Academy Awards made way for new faces and opinions to emerge and take the limelight

The Oscars closed the awards season in style, with statement necklaces and classic gowns, traditional tuxedos and some young rule-breakers. In a milestone win that instantly expanded the awards’ horizons, Bong Joon Ho’s masterfully devious class satire Parasite became the first non-English language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.

The prom king gets his crown

This we know to be true: If Hollywood is high school, the Oscars is prom night. And Brad Pitt has always been the prom king, missing only his actual crown.

The much-admired actor, finally winning his first acting Oscar for his sly, knowing performance in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, grew emotional as he looked back at his fairytale rise to Hollywood stardom, beginning with a combustively sexy performance in “Thelma & Louise” nearly three decades ago. “Once upon a time in Hollywood. Ain’t that the truth!” he said, misty-eyed.

Zellweger completes comeback with best-actress Oscar win

Renée Zellweger completed a Hollywood comeback for the ages by winning the best actress award for her role as Judy Garland in Judy. Written off during a six-year hiatus from acting that ended in 2016, Zellweger returned to claim her second Oscar after 16 years. “If only I could stand up straight, I was shaking so much,” Zellweger said as she walked offstage. “Oh my word.”

Time to come alive

As the very first person to take the stage, Monae set the tone when she plainly addressed the diversity issue in her opening number. “It’s time to come alive, because the Oscars is so white, it’s time to come alive!” she sang. Her performance directly referenced films and actors who’d been snubbed in the nominations and also the missing female directors. “I’m so proud to stand here as a black, queer artist telling stories,” Monae said. “Happy Black History Month.”

Missing: A certain reproductive organ

Diversity — both racial and gender — was also a major topic of the “non-monologue” given by “non-hosts” Chris Rock and Steve Martin. (Like last year, the show famously went hostless.) Rock quipped pointedly that actor Mahershala Ali had two Oscars, but “you know what that means when the cops pull him over? Nothing.” Martin noted that among the directing nominees, something seemed to be missing. “Vaginas?” replied Rock.

A first for indigenous people

An emotional highlight of the night was Taika Waititi’s win for best adapted screenplay for the anti-hate themed Jojo Rabbit. Waititi, from New Zealand, became the first Oscar winner of Maori descent. He dedicated his victory “to all the indigenous kids of the world who want to do art and dance and write stories. We are the original storytellers, and we can make it here as well.”

Later, as a presenter, Waititi took the stage and noted the Academy was gathering “on the ancestral lands of the Tongva, Tataviam and the Chumash.”

And for disabled actors

When The Peanut Butter Falcon star Zack Gottsagen appeared to present in the live-action short category, it was a first for both him and for the Oscars. Gottsagen was the first presenter with Down syndrome, and he received a standing ovation after intoning the familiar line: “And the Oscar goes to ...”

And speaking of voices

When Joaquin Phoenix won, he spoke about “the opportunity to use our voice for the voiceless.” He added that he saw a commonality in the different causes people in the Hollywood community fight for. “Whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity,” he said. He also apologised for past behaviour. “I’ve been a scoundrel in my life,” he said. “I’ve been selfish, I’ve been cruel at times, hard to work with. I’m grateful that so many of you in this room have given me a second chance.”

Eminem, take two

Also getting a second chance was rapper Eminem, who stunned the crowd by showing up for a surprise performance of Lose Yourself — 17 years after it won best original song from the film 8 Mile.

Backstage: Dazed winners and sweet reunions

A whole other show happens just a few feet to the right of the main Oscars stage in the wings where presenters gather, ecstatic winners get a moment to process what just happened and the production staff stays busy making sure everything is going to plan. Here are a few moments that the cameras didn’t catch at the 92nd Academy Awards.

“WHOSE IS THIS?”

Joaquin walked offstage in a bit of a daze, with tears still in his eyes from his emotional acceptance speech. Jane Fonda, waiting to present the best picture award, was among the few familiar faces in the wings for the Joker star who stopped to give her a hug and a kiss.

Phoenix looked down at the golden statuette in his hand and said, “Whose is this?” The woman escorting him to his next stop said gently, “It’s yours.”

STEVE MARTIN GETS READY

Steve Martin made sure to get to the wings extra early for his and Chris Rock’s show opener Sunday but his promptness also meant he had a little time to kill.

He offered support to Janelle Monae’s background performers. “You’ll do a good job,” Martin said with a thumbs up. “But you’re supposed to say break a leg.” And he even took a moment to allow himself to enjoy the performance, watching on the monitors with a big smile. But he quickly turned back to thinking about his imminent moment on stage. “As long as I have my opening line, I’m fine,” he said, continuing to pace.

A breakdown of the gowns, bling and beauty

A look at fashion highlights from the big night:

The gowns

Scarlett Johansson, Renée Zellweger, Charlize Theron, Cynthia Erivo and Regina King served up standout looks.

King’s pale pink Versace with just the right amount of silver embellishment was a flawless fit. Johansson’s Champagne-hued Oscar de la Renta was a strapless wonder with strand details at the top. Theron’s black Dior Haute Couture offered one shoulder up and one down, along with a high side slit. Erivo shut it down in a white custom Atelier Versace one-shoulder bustier gown. Zellweger didn’t disappoint in a white symmetrical body hugger from Armani with one long sleeve.

“Regina King and Cynthia Erivo really did the ballgown right,” said Justine Carreon, senior market editor for Elle.com. “Cynthia Erivo had those kind of modern paniers on the hips. Regina had a pink princess moment, but it still had a very modern neckline.” Nobody took any big risks, she said, though there were some statements made.

Young Hollywood didn’t disappoint

Janelle Monae stunned in silver Ralph Lauren with a hood, long sleeves and about 170,000 Swarovski crystals. Florence Pugh wore a tiered gown in welcome green from Louis Vuitton. Billie Eilish donned fuzzy, oversize Chanel jackets and pants to go with her bright green and black hair. Timothée Chalamet detoured from a slew of classic black tuxedos in a custom Prada navy gabardine jacket with satin racing stripes and matching trousers.

“She always brings such drama to the carpet in such an elegant way,” E! style correspondent Zanna Roberts Rassi said of Monae’s look. Monae, along with Eilish and Billy Porter (in a golden feather top and orange ball skirt), show trends aren’t everything. The trend was to be yourself.”

“It’s less about trends. It’s more about showing who they really are. Billie Eilish and Billy Porter tend to just stick to their guns. When it comes to fashion, they don’t let themselves be confined to any box. It’s true that Eilish loves a logo, but that’s true of her generation, from Gucci to Louis Vuitton,” she said.

Vintage represented, but just a tad

Margot Robbie hit the carpet in Chanel from the brand’s spring 1994 haute couture collection. It was a black fitted bustier gown with detached sleeves that practically touched the ground. A pearl pendant was front and center.

The bling

There was an abundance of statement necklaces on women (Mindy Kaling, Julia Louis, Zazie Beetz) but there was also a show of “gents jewelry,” said Claibourne Poindexter, jewelry specialist.

From Porter in multiple bracelets and rings from Swarovski to men bringing back the lapel brooch (Chalamet’s vintage Cartier), “there is no doubt that men are embracing jewels for the first time in a long time,” he said.

Among other favourites: Anthony Ramos in a long necklace and lapel brooch worn with a white suit. As for the women, Greta Gerwig wore diamonds and emerald from Bulgari, as did Beetz. Theron wore a diamond drop necklace by Tiffany & Co. weighing in at more than 20 carats. Louis-Dreyfus wore more than 60 carats set in platinum from Harry Winston. Vintage represented in a small way, thanks to Rebel Wilson’s gold and diamond double row necklace by Pomellato to Chalamet’s 1950s ruby and diamond clip, Poindexter said.

“Over the last several years we’ve seen a consistent increase in gentlemen who wear jewels as a great way to diversify their style on what is arguably a more difficult wardrobe to show individuality in,” he said. Gerwig’s emerald beads and diamonds has her “following in the footsteps of many powerful women in film,” Poindexter said. “From Elizabeth Taylor in her own Bulgari emerald and diamond jewels purchased on a visit to the Bulgari boutique with Richard Burton to Monica Vitti posing for Karen Radkai in a full suite of oval shaped emerald and diamond jewelry in 1963, Bulgari has had a long reputation of being a favorite among the film and jet set,” Poindexter said.

The beauty

The Oscars are often a parade of nudes, sheers or pale pinks, especially in nail polish, said Cat. “So I was excited to see so many actresses go for a bolder look. Black nail polish in particular reigned supreme, with a variety of cool iterations,” she said.

191,11-2-20,Writers of colour,"Barnes & Noble suspends reissues of classics with new images

Barnes & Noble is withdrawing a planned line of famous literature reissued with multicultural cover images that has been met with widespread criticism on social media.

“We acknowledge the voices who have expressed concerns about the Diverse Editions project at our Barnes & Noble Fifth Avenue store and have decided to suspend the initiative,” Barnes & Noble announced.

The author Adriana Herrera had called the books, scheduled to be launched this week, “the classics in blackface.”

Diverse Editions, a joint project between Barnes & Noble and Penguin Random House, featured 12 texts, including Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and L Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz. The words are the same, but on the cover, major characters are depicted with dark-skinned illustrations by artists of “different ethnicities and backgrounds,” as per Barnes & Noble.

It was announced at a time when the publishing industry is already facing scrutiny over the novel American Dirt and its depiction of Mexican life and culture. “Absolute TONE-DEAF decision-making,” Mexican-American writer David Bowles, a leading critic of American Dirt, tweeted about Diverse Editions.

The decision also comes in February, which is the Black History Month, an annual celebration of achievements.

To much disbelief online, the organisers of Diverse Editions had said they used artificial intelligence in reviewing more than 100 older books and determining whether the race or ethnicity of a character is specifically stated. Few would argue that Alice from Alice in Wonderland or the title characters of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are fitting for a tribute to black history.

“They could have Googled, chosen a dozen books by actual Black authors that are classics and sent those out with fresh covers and a big event,” author MIkki Kendall tweeted. “Add in bringing in contemporary Black authors to discuss these works and the whole thing is a win. They didn’t do the easy or logical thing.”

Barnes & Noble acknowledged that the new covers were “not a substitute for black voices or writers of colour, whose work and voices deserve to be heard. The booksellers who championed this initiative did so convinced it would help drive engagement with these classic titles,” as per the bookstore chain. “It was a project inspired by our work with schools and was created in part to raise awareness and discussion during Black History Month, in which Barnes & Noble stores nationally will continue to highlight a wide selection of books to celebrate Black history and great literature from writers of colour.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/writers-of-colour-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/writers-of-colour.html
192,11-2-20,Rural rhythms,"Printmaker and photographer Jyoti Bhatt’s excursions to different villages inspired him to create a personal language of symbols through intaglios that came from indigenous cultures. By Uma Nair

Photographer, archivist, printmaker and visual historian, Padma Shri Jyoti Bhatt belongs to the arc light of Indian artists who have spent six decades exploring India’s indigenous arts. Over the years, it is Bhatt’s investigations of rural and tribal designs that have influenced the motifs he has used in his printmaking. He has been actively engaged with intaglios since the mid 60s and these images constitute an important chapter in the history of printmaking in India. They demonstrate great artistic sensibilities, creativity and a unique understanding of traditional cultures. Each print can be seen as an artwork in its own right as well as a historical document. His works set him apart as an ethnographer.

Through his show of original intaglios at Bihar Museum, starting today, he goes back in time. Here are some excerpts:

Tell us about your photograph documentation that began in the 1960s.

In 1961, I won an Italian government scholarship to study at the Academia Di Belle Arti in Naples for two years. From Italy, I went to the Pratt Institute in New York, where I received a Fulbright fellowship. I was trained in the graphic arts and began to take a particular interest in printmaking.

When I returned in the 1960s, I was asked to take photographs of the Gujarati folk art for a seminar at the Bhartiya Vidhya Bhavan in Mumbai, keeping the disappearing rural arts in focus. I was asked to chronicle the arts and indigenous practices of rural parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Bihar from 1967 to 1995. I travelled extensively, visiting villages and tribal regions, photographing folk arts and craft traditions in their local areas, as well as people who inhabited these spaces. Those folk and craft traditions became part of my intaglios.

It is said that at the MS University in Baroda, you became a catalyst for other artists picking up printmaking as a genre. Would you like to reflect on those days in the 1960s?

When I began, my early works were influenced by cubism as well as lighthearted and colourful pop art kind of imagery. It was inspired by traditional Indian folk designs.

It was in 1966 that I returned to MSU Baroda with a thorough knowledge of the intaglio process that I had gained at the Pratt Institute at Brooklyn, New York. I found intaglio exciting. The thought that so many prints could be made was a sense of commonality I believed in because I didn’t like the idea of elitist art. This caused friends such as Jeram Patel, Bhupen Khakhar and Gulam Mohammed Sheikh to follow the same process. At the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda, we were soon known as “The Baroda School” of Indian art.

When we look at your work, we can also find a wide repertoire of historical evidence. How did you explore such a wide variety of practices?

I knew that when I began, I had to include whatever I could capture on my frame. Cultural evidences have a wide canvas so I was looking at tribal musicians and women who had mastered pottery, to artistes and dancers, weavers, wall painters and even children. Sometimes I would walk into a makeshift hut and see the wet wall and suddenly see the calf ready to shut his eyes and sleep. That is how I got the image, Calf (Madhya Pradesh, 1983). Their cattle were as important to them as their family members. When it comes to art traditions, people and their environs are the most important.

Your photographs pay great attention to background details...

I was looking at a world that was full of rural rhythms in the simplest of circumstances. For instance, in A tribal house from rural India (South Gujarat, 1987), a mother and her child are sitting against a wall in their hut. Resting next to them are tools and impediments, some household appliances and weapons used by the tribal folks. The tools are shown as an impression on the wall. And I observed that the villagers were so simple yet full of their own elemental ideas. Life in the village has its own tranquil pace and their creative pursuits are what engaged me throughout.

Your prints reflect the ingenuity of indigenous iconography. Please reflect on this journey.

My focus has always been on the surroundings. When I look at it now, I see that it presented a holistic perspective in an age where traditions are vanishing. Everything had its own significance. You call it a slice of history but I would say that it is a living moment in the lives of the humble.

Printmaking for me became a process of rich imagery and a residue of living traditions. I recall how in Rajasthan, the intricate floral patterns of a rangoli or a mandana, painstakingly created by a woman in the courtyard of the house, were important statements of a rural lifestyle that we hardly see anymore.

Many of the artforms I photographed even as late as 1994 are not visible anymore. The number of people who made them have lessened. Most of these traditions have started losing their essence. For instance, people now buy Kolam — the Rangavalli designs — in the form of plastic stickers from shops within South Indian temples, which, ironically, have supported this tradition the most. I used the designs in my prints as a motif for longevity.

In later years, in my etchings, intaglios and screen prints, I also tried to explore a personal language of symbols that belonged to indigenous cultures — peacock, parrot, lotus, stylised Indian gods and goddesses, and some unending variations on tribal and village designs — which became part of my iconography. Now I am happily exploring inkjet digital printing and holography. I like the multiplicity of print. I am happy that many art lovers can buy my prints.

200,11-2-20,A fresh perspective,"An exhibition of paintings and sculptures Trails of Materials explores the journey of three artists through various objects and recycled waste. By Team Viva

Medium and material often lead an artist towards evolution, change and transition. It has been seen as the precursor to every kind of growth. It reveals the concept that lies within the artwork. The interesting part is that it raises questions about the boundaries often drawn around a particular style, material or presentation.

Three artists — Satish Sharma, Anju Kaushik and Rubkirat Vohra come together to explore their journey though objects in a group show of paintings and sculptures — Trails of Materials.

While Satish has been painting for two decades, he has traversed the works that recall the musings of Vincent Van Gogh, moving on toward abstraction which celebrates pure colour and texture. His canvases evoke a three-dimensional form that celebrates earth in different shades — a deep madder red, the aquamarine of seashore blues, solemn slate greys and the darkened shades of a black night.

Satish says, “For me art is breaking out of boundaries. I felt it first when I switched to abstracts. The act of throwing colour on canvas, let it take its own shape and form was liberating. It opened up my mind and journey to unknown beginnings.”

The artist has also been moving towards monochromatic expressions with a preference for brighter colours.

Anju’s new works are more about the sculpturesque, with a preference for high-relief surfaces. She prefers working with discarded objects, transforms them with plaster of Paris, concrete and wood. The act of reclaiming old, rusted and discarded objects and giving them new life is particular to Anju’s practice. The objects challenge the idea of what is rejected elevating it from what may appear to be a part of mundane existence.

Anju’s works are often connected into a loose narrative, where she makes a comment on the environment, where a fossilised fish shape is a poignant reminder of urban detritus and waste. A hunk of concrete is brushed with paint, nails, wire and placed upon a concrete bracket creating a new relationship between the elements of waste. “Every time I look around, I find bundles of empty bottles, canes, plates, nails, building materials and other junks. It makes me think that there is still some life in them. I get new ideas from them. Through my painting, I give a new identity to the waste and change them into three-dimension sculpture.”

Rubkirat enjoys working with metal and wood, creating composite forms from a malleable lead that has a low heat point. The abstractions hint towards architectural forms and human existence. The objects are aesthetic, disassociated from the world of narrative. Ranging from oils, charcoal on canvas, metallic objects to delicate constructions from wire and linear drawing work, it evokes her feelings. One could say that her inner voice experiments with objects.

Rubkirat says that her work is contemporary and not in the historical architectural forms. Although she conforms to her inner self, her art is deeply immersive lending a serene calmness to the viewer as though stemming from her own contentment and realisation.”

Her “abstruse creations” are created with nails, metal, wood, wires, charcoal, canvas, fire. It lends a sense of satisfaction to the viewer.

Together, the works of these three artists bring home a fresh perspective on the materiality of objects. We may appreciate how these objects and their materials communicate across cultures and temporal boundaries, moving in some instances beyond the intentions of their creators. The materials have the ability to transport the viewer into discovering their own narrative behind the presented narrative, but they may also hone in on the story that the artist is keen to tell us in their own language and materiality.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-fresh-perspective-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-fresh-perspective.html
201,11-2-20,Understanding ground dimensions must in NZ: Thakur,"Understanding the peculiar dimensions of the grounds and negotiating the wind factor is a must for bowlers to succeed in New Zealand, reckons India pacer Shardul Thakur.

“There are no grounds alike in New Zealand, so it is very important to understand the ground dimensions. How to bowl, etc. In each game, as a bowler, you may have to change your plan because the last game in Auckland, straight boundaries were short. Before that in Hamilton, the side boundary was short. The dimensions of each ground are different and you have to bowl accordingly. Here in the next game, we will get a bigger ground compared to the others,” said Thakur ahead of final ODI game.

Thakur feels the conditions make New Zealand one of the toughest places to play cricket in.

“It is very difficult because you don’t get to play on grounds like this every day. That’s why they say New Zealand is a difficult country to play cricket in. I feel that when you practice in the nets you have to practice in the manner in which you are going to bowl the next day.

“Mentally too, it is crucial to be prepared because if you are not prepared mentally, the opponent can take you by surprise. So both things are important. If you see, their batsmen use the wind and the short side,” he added.

India will be aiming to avoid a 0-3 whitewash today and with the series already out of reach, Thakur feels he and his teammates can play even more freely.

“When you play international cricket, every game matters for every player. When you are 2-0 down, you can express yourself even more — our skills, our variations in bowling. Batsmen can play their shots, can execute shots and express themselves. That’s how we will approach it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/understanding-ground-dimensions-must-in-nz--thakur.html

Bangladesh were bowled out for 168 in their second innings after resuming the day on 126-6 as Pakistan’s pace and spin attack was too hot to handle despite a flat Rawalpindi stadium pitch.

Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who at 16 years and 359 days became the youngest bowler to take a Test hat-trick on Sunday, finished with 4-26 and was declared man of the match.

Despite Naseem being unavailable to bowl on Monday with rib pain, Pakistan mopped up the last four wickets in 90 minutes, inflicting their 10th defeat on Bangladesh in 11 matches with one draw.

Pakistan skipper Azhar Ali said home wins — only possible in recent months, after the resumption of Test cricket in Pakistan following a decade’s isolation over security concerns — were important to boost confidence.

“It’s an important win and home wins always increase confidence within the team,” said Azhar. “We have to play important away series including one in England (July-August this year) so we will carry this confidence.

“Naseem and other bowlers bowled superbly and it was an outstanding batting display, so all in all it was a complete team effort.”

B’desh skipper Mominul Haque started the day by square-driving paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi for his fifth boundary in the first over, but then fell leg-before in the same over for 41.

New Zealand, though, will have the experience and leadership of Williamson for the final game as he has passed the fitness test.

“He certainly had a full workout and all is on track for tomorrow. He’s looking good to be ready to play. We'll have one final look at him in the morning and make sure nothing happens overnight,” New Zealand stand-in head coach Shane Jurgensen said on the eve of third ODI.

The major difference between the two sides has been the top-order’s impact.

With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan missing due to injuries, Virat Kohli missing out on scoring big and KL Rahul batting later in the order, India’s traditional ODI strength was neutralised without New Zealand having to do any hard work.

Openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal have shown only momentary flashes of brilliance and have not replicated the kind of starts the Indian batting has grown accustomed to from its top-order.

Rohit’s absence has been a major factor in India’s defeat in this series. The opener averaged 57.30 in ODI cricket in the past 12 months, having a major impact on Indian fortunes in this format.

In that light, the burden of scoring runs has been placed squarely on Kohli in this series. With 66 runs in two innings, he did not come through for once and the rest didn’t rise to the occasion either.

All of it resulted in reversal of fortunes on the limited-overs leg of this tour, as India had arrived here at Mt Maunganui a week ago leading the T20I series by a 4-0 margin. They went on to drub the Black Caps 5-0, but now find themselves in the same position at the same ground.

It is also a reversal of results from the Men in Blue’s last visit here in 2019 when they won the ODI series 4-1 but lost the T20I series 2-1.

India’s previous ODI series loss in New Zealand was 4-1 on the 2014 tour here.

Shreyas Iyer, with a hundred and a half-century, has mirrored Ross Taylor’s rich form in Hamilton and Auckland. But Iyer lacked the finishing touch as compared to Taylor’s experience. He couldn’t see India’s chase through in Auckland like the senior Kiwi batsman did in Hamilton.

India may also look to experiment a bit before the Test series.

Rahul, Shaw, Iyer, Kedar Jadhav and Yuzvendra Chahal did not take part in the optional practice session on Monday.

Kohli was first into the nets against both pace and spin. Manish Pandey was in the nets beside him, while Rishabh Pant had a long session once again.

Pant has not played limited-overs' cricket since he suffered a concussion against Australia. If India goes as per routine plan, he is in danger of missing out entirely from playing white-ball cricket on this tour.

In the bowling department, all pacers were present for training, except Mohammed Shami.

New Zealand have added leg spinner Ish Sodhi and pacer Blair Tickner to the squad for this match. Sodhi played in the first ODI at Hamilton, bowling Kohli with a googly.

They were part of the New Zealand A team playing an unofficial Test against India A but did not take part on the fourth day’s proceedings. Tim Southee (stomach bug), Mitchell Santner (stomach bug) and Scott Kuggeleijn (viral fever) are hoping to recover in time for the third ODI.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pride-at-stake.html
204,11-2-20,"Praneeth & Co eye medal, crucial points at Asia Team C’ship","Unfazed by coronavirus fears, a full-strength Indian men’s team has landed here to compete at the Asia Team Championships from today, eyeing a medal-winning performance which will give players crucial ranking points in the Olympic year.

The Indian women team, which was supposed to be led by young shuttlers Ashmita Chaliha and Malvika Bansod, chose not to travel for the competition, fearing the spread of coronavirus, which has claimed over 900 lives in China so far.

A 44-year-old Chinese tourist from Wuhan had died on February 1 in Philippines, which has reported three virus cases so far. The two others were discharged from hospital after their tests were reported to be negative.

Former world number one Kidambi Srikanth and 2019 world championship Bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth will lead the Indian team which also has HS Prannoy, Subhankar Dey and young Lakshya Sen.

The Indian men’s team, which won the Bronze medal in the 2016 Championship, was initially clubbed with two-time defending champions Indonesia and hosts Philippines in Group A but with China and Hong Kong not playing due to a travel ban on them by the Philippines, the draw was re-worked at the team managers’ meeting on Monday.

India are now placed in Group B alongside Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The top two team in each of the four groups will make it to the quarterfinals.

India, who had lost to China 1-3 in the last edition in 2018, will begin their campaign against Kazakhstan today before taking on Malaysia on Thursday. This is only the third edition of the Asia Team championship, which serves as Asia qualifiers for the Thomas and Uber Cups.

Praneeth and Co are expected to have an easy outing against Kazakhstan, who are not a prominent badminton nation, but the clash against Malaysia will be a interesting one.

Malaysia boast of a young team, comprising world No 14 Lee Zii Jia, 2014 Youth Olympic Games Gold medallist Cheam June Wei and Leong Jun Hao, a former three-time Silver medallist at World Junior Championships.

In doubles, Malaysia have world No 17 pair of Ong Yew Sin and Teo Ee Yi, who claimed the Thailand Masters title last month, and the pair of Goh Sze Fei and Nur Izzuddin Mohd Rumsani, who were part of 2018 Asian team Championship Bronze medal winning team, in their team.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/praneeth---co-eye-medal--crucial-points-at-asia-team-c---ship.html
205,11-2-20,Leipzig hold Bayern in top of table clash,"RB Leipzig held Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich to a goalless draw at the Allianz Arena on Sunday to stay just one point behind the defending champions in the title race.

Leipzig worked tirelessly to thwart the hosts, for whom victory would have opened up a four-point gap after third-placed Borussia Dortmund’s 4-3 loss at Bayer Leverkusen.

Bayern are bidding to win an eighth straight league title.

They were awarded a second-half penalty which was then reversed when VAR showed Robert Lewandowski had been offside.

Second-placed Leipzig often rode their luck to repeatedly frustrate Bayern, but wasted a series of second-half chances themselves.

“The problem was that both teams could live with a 0-0 draw,” admitted Bayern forward Thomas Mueller.

“In the end, neither team wanted to take the absolute risks, which meant we didn’t play to our strengths.”

Bayern coach Hansi Flick expects this season’s title race to go to the wire.

“The Bundesliga will be tense until the end,” he said.

“There are a few teams with a chance.

“We want to keep our position, but it’s going to be a hard path to stay on.”

Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann said his side showed the bravery required to win in Munich.

“In the second-half, we had much clearer chances to win the game,” he said.

“We were brave, defended high up and had a good grip on the game.”

Leipzig striker Timo Werner, who missed a golden opportunity on 63 minutes, rued his team’s missed chances, including a skied effort by captain Marcel Sabitzer.

“In the beginning, it seemed just a matter of time before we scored,” admitted Werner.

“But in the second half we played as our coach (Julian Nagelsmann) wanted and were the better team. We could have won.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/leipzig-hold-bayern-in-top-of-table-clash.html
206,11-2-20,Cavani nears double-century,"Paris Saint-Germain survived the absence of Neymar and a Lyon fightback to win Sunday night’s Ligue 1 clash 4-2 at a stormy Parc des Princes, helped by Fernando Marcal’s truly stunning second-half own goal.

Runaway leaders and defending champions PSG were cruising at half-time with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe giving them a two-goal advantage against a Lyon side enduring a disappointing season.

Then Marcal comically blasted the ball into the roof of his own net just after the break, leaving Lyon looking at another heavy defeat in Paris, where they lost 5-0 in this fixture last season.

However, Martin Terrier and Moussa Dembele quickly pulled goals back, and PSG needed a late strike by substitute Edinson Cavani to secure the points.

“Normally after a goal like that the game is over,” said coach Thomas Tuchel of the own goal. “But we were not disciplined enough and it was a lesson for us that it’s never over.”

PSG’s performance showcased why they can ill afford to be complacent heading into their Champions League last 16, first leg match away to Borussia Dortmund on February 18, even if sporting director Leonardo insisted to Canal Plus that the tie was “not life or death” for the Qatar-owned club.

They will hope to have Neymar back by then. The world’s most expensive player sat out a second consecutive match due to a rib complaint.

“We play a lot of games and errors happen but I don’t know if it’s the time to be too critical,” Tuchel added. “The team was great and we can’t forget we were without lots of key players.”

Without Neymar — as well as his injured compatriots, Thiago Silva and Marquinhos, in defence — Tuchel’s side made it eight straight wins and stretched their unbeaten run to 21 games in all competitions.

Lyon, meanwhile, have not won in three and this result leaves the seven-time former champions in ninth place.

They are eight points adrift of the Champions League qualifying spots and their upcoming European double-header against Juventus looks certain to be a step too far for them.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cavani-nears-double-century.html

208,11-2-20,From history to canvas,"Curator Neeraj Gupta brings forth a show of sculptures and paintings for public spaces. By Uma Nair

To serve public awareness for the arts and provide opportunity to artists to widen their web of influence in the market that is, at the moment, regressive and stagnating, curator Neeraj Gupta, president of the Delhi Art Society, brings forth a show of sculptures and paintings for public space.

Public art spaces

Public Art includes about 17 artists who are seasoned sculptors as well as painters.

Neeraj Gupta’s elephant flits through time and tide, raising questions and inviting introspections that waft through our everyday idioms and practices. While Anjali Khosa Kaul creates a synergy of sorts with her series that depict forest botanical creations in wood, Bhola Kumar’s stone creation has about it a stealthy gravitas as it’s about dimensions and depth. Brajesh Verman explores history and time with a work that goes down into the roots of Sumerian culture to give us words that are integral to sovereignty — strength, courage, freedom and eminence —and echoes of antiquity.

Nature and the human form

Arun Pandit’s Couple is influenced by Rodin and Brancusi. His Patina creates a rooted synergy of sorts as it speaks about the beauty of bronze and the pathos of life and its many learnings. Bhaktibhushan De’s Nature’s Sorrow is an evocative work that talks to man about nature’s strength and its eternal quality of recycling. It also talks about the harmony that man needs because it has been destroyed by man’s greed.

Madhab Das creates the most enduring form of the human figure. Here, man is lost, deprived and full of despair. Kavita Nayyar’s terracotta works are symbolic of her love for nature. Her prowess as an artist of measure and substance is seen in detail.

Simran KS Lamba’s Trees created out of tree trunk and copper give us tenets of man and nature and the unerring power of trees. He OR IS IT SHE brings back the words of Hermann Hesse who said, “Trees are sanctuaries.” Rajesh Sharma creates an emblematic symbol of man with his sculpture that is made of steel circular rods. It presents man in a dual setting who is balancing different things. Uttam Pacharne’s brass piece echoes the emblematic essence of nature.

Evocative paintings

Kalicharan Gupta, the abstract maestro of Delhi, creates paintings that spell the quasi realistic language of the dispersion and scattering of light and colour fields. He brings alive both modernist and impressionist moods.

Sangeeta Gupta, the poet, thinker and abstractionist, creates a set of platters that she paints upon with acrylic to create a conversation.

Ranjeeta Kant’s painting speaks about the universal debacle of infanticide. Within the realism of the human failing, here, we see the poignancy of the miracle of life and the suggestion of beauty of living rather than death.

The multi-faceted Naresh Kapuria, who has worked with so many media, creates a stirring amalgamation of composition, contours and colour facets with his work that straddles many scenes and times as it oscillates through the pendulum of time.

Artist Prem Singh creates paintings that celebrate the lyrics of spring in an impressionist manner evoking the magic of hillsides and flowers blooming in spring.

The most important facet of this exhibition is to lend a thought for art that must travel through time and be made visible to an audience. The most important part of an artist’s creation is the end result when the work is gazed upon by thousands. Public art for a city is about history, memory, metaphors and moods and it enlivens art practices and lasts long.

210,11-2-20,Warner bags Allan Border medal,"An emotional David Warner on Monday won the Australian cricketer of the year award beating teammate Steve Smith by one vote in their first season following the ball-tampering ban that brought their rollicking careers to a one-year halt.

Dashing opener Warner won his third Allan Border Medal with 194 votes, with former Test captain Smith getting 193 votes and fast bowler Pat Cummins coming third with 185.

Ellyse Perry claimed her second Belinda Clark Award at the Australian Cricket Awards here.

Considering his stunning return to the game following a year’s suspension, an emotional Warner held back tears during his acceptance speech.

“I couldn’t be any prouder to stand here and receive the award ... (and) to see the rest of the other guys doing so well,” Warner said, according to Cricket Australia.

“I really had a hunger and determination to come back and really put my foot forward ... So to have a summer like that really put a smile on my face.”

“I know I’ve let you guys down in the past. It’s just been remarkable to come back,” Warner was quoted as saying by foxsports.Com.Au.

The dashing opener added, “With the World Cup, to not go the whole way was disappointing. The Ashes, retaining that was fantastic — I obviously didn’t turn up and I apologise for that — but I really had the hunger and determination to come back and do the best for our team.

“To come back and have a summer like that and just contribute, it really put a smile on my face — and I hope it did for you guys as well.”

Warner had previously won the coveted individual prize in 2016 and 2017. He polled a total of 194 across the Test, ODI and T20I formats to finish ahead of former captain Smith and nine votes clear of Cummins.

Warner now joined a select list of multiple winners of the Allan Border Medal, which includes Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Smith.

Meanwhile, Perry won the Belinda Clark Award after her teammate Alyssa Healy bagged both the T20 and ODI Player of the Year awards for women’s cricketers.

Australia’s limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch claimed the male ODI Player of the Year award, while Marnis Labuschagne won the male Test Player of the Year recognition.

Warner also claimed the male International T20 Player of the Year Award.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/warner-bags-allan-border-medal.html
211,11-2-20,"Jaiswal, Bishnoi, Tyagi named in ICC team of tournament","The prolific Yashasvi Jaiswal and highest wicket-taker Ravi Bishnoi were among three Indians named in the ICC U-19 World Cup Team of the Tournament on Monday.

Besides left-handed opener Jaiswal and leg-spinner Bishnoi, right-arm pacer Kartik Tyagi was the other Indian to feature in the 12-member team, led by World Cup-winning Bangladesh skipper Akbar Ali.

Jaiswal claimed the Player of the Tournament award after he played a crucial role in guiding India to the final.

With 400 runs to his name in six innings at an astounding average of 133, he topped the scoring chart comfortably, finishing 114 runs ahead of closest competitor Ravindu Rasantha of Sri Lanka.

Bishnoi topped the wicket-taking chart by claiming 17 in six matches with a miserly average of 10.64, while Tyagi, on the other hand, terrorised opposing batsmen throughout the tournament with his swing and scalped 11 wickets at an average of 13.90.

The official team of the tournament features representatives from six sides with the likes of Afghanistan opener Ibrahim Zadran and West Indies’ Nyeem Young in it.

In Akbar, Shahdat Hossain and Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Bangladesh also has three representations in the squad, while Afghanistan and West Indies have two players each.

Canada’s Akil Kumar has been included as the 12th man.

The team was selected by an adjudication panel of five, which included commentators Ian Bishop, Rohan Gavaskar and Natalie Germanos joined by ESPN Cricinfo correspondent Sreshth Shah and ICC representative Mary Godbeer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jaiswal--bishnoi--tyagi-named-in-icc-team-of-tournament.html
212,11-2-20,Bangladesh govt to organise public reception for U-19 side,"The Bangladesh government will organise a “public reception” to celebrate the country’s Under-19 World Cup triumph, its first in an ICC tournament across all levels.

In a high-voltage title clash, the end of which was marred by unruly celebrations by the champions, Bangladesh stunned favourites and defending champions India by three wickets in Potchefstroom on Sunday for the country’s biggest victory in its cricket history.

“The date will be set after the team returns. The reception will be held at Suhrawardy Udyan,” the country’s Road, Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader was quoted as saying by the Daily Star.

The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shaikh Hasina, Quader told scribes at the Secretariat on Monday.

No Bangladesh team had won a world event before the country’s U-19 side broke the jinx with victory over the three-time defending champions.

India’s cricketing battles with Bangladesh have been marred by acrimony since the 2015 World Cup quarter-final at the MCG.

Having scripted their biggest triumph on Sunday, some Bangladeshi players got carried away while celebrating.

While their captain Akbar Ali apologised for the “unfortunate incident”, his Indian counterpart Priyam Garg felt it is something that should not have happened.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bangladesh-govt-to-organise-public-reception-for-u-19-side.html
213,11-2-20,Rahane scores 101 in drawn game,"India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane warmed up for the Test series in New Zealand with an unbeaten 101 for the touring A side in the drawn four-day game against New Zealand A on Monday.

In response to New Zealand A’s 386 for nine, India A reached 467 for five in 109.3 overs when the game ended in a draw on the fourth and final day. The end of the second unofficial Test also marked the end of the A tour. Rahane stayed unbeaten on 101 off 148 balls and his knock comprised 15 fours and a six.

Shubman Gill, who has scored a double hundred in the first game at number four, continued his good run with the bat, making another hundred on day three, this time as an opener. Resuming day four at 107, Gill, who too is part of the Test squad, went on to make 136. Rahane took over from there and got much needed time in the middle ahead of the first Test beginning in Wellington on February 21. A practice game will also be played before the series-opener.

Vijay Shankar also made a valuable contribution with a 66-run knock. Test number three Cheteshwar Pujara had made a solid half century on day three. He could only score a run on day four and was dismissed on 53.

Among the other Test regulars, off-spinner R Aswhin bowled 37.5 overs in the New Zealand innings, conceding 98 runs for two wickets.

Brief Scores

New Zealand A 1st innings: 386 for 9 in 131.5 overs (Daryl Mitchell 103, Glenn Phillips 65; Sandeep Warrier 2/50). India A 1st innings: 467/5 in 109.3 overs (Shubman Gill 136, Cheteshwar Pujara 53, Ajinkya Rahane 101 not out; Blair Tickner 1/71, Ed Nuttall 2/98).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rahane-scores-101-in-drawn-game.html
214,11-2-20,Not many chinks in Virat’s armour,"He has dismissed Virat Kohli the most number of times in international cricket and New Zealand pacer Tim Southee on Monday credited helpful pitch conditions for the feat he “didn’t know” about.

Including Saturday’s ODI in Auckland, Southee has now dismissed Kohli nine times across formats.

“He is obviously a class player and doesn’t have many weaknesses. I think the wicket had a little bit of assistance with the new ball and if you put it in the right areas, there was enough there to ask a few questions. It is about assistance and the pitch conditions...,” Southee said on the eve of the third ODI.

“It is your job to take wickets...And Virat is a great player and he has been in great form. Especially in run chases he is exceptional, so I guess it’s always nice to see the back of him. I didn’t know that was the most...,” he added.

Southee said his side’s 2-0 series win over India in the current three-match contest shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone as the Black Caps, consecutive ODI World Cup finalists, have been playing well in this format for a while now.

“...They have been two great games of cricket and the ODI side has played some good cricket for a while even though we have been missing some important guys,” he said referring to injuries to key players such as regular skipper Kane williamson.

“The guys have played great ODI cricket for a while now, although it was our first time since the World Cup. But the group has played well for a long time,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-many-chinks-in-virat---s-armour.html
215,11-2-20,Guardiola set for City summer squad refresh,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola admitted his side could be set for an overhaul in the summer after falling 22 points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.

Guardiola will definitely lose David Silva, who has already announced he will leave the club after a decade at the end of the season.

However, the Catalan coach does not believe he needs the same degree of change as after a difficult first season in Manchester when the arrival of six new players inspired a romp to the title with a record 100 points.

“This group of players has done something unique — they have won the last six of the last seven domestic trophies in England. I admire them and I suffer with them when they don’t get what they deserve,” said Guardiola.

“Of course we have to do something because David Silva is leaving and in some other positions we are going to do it, but I don’t know how many or how much because the market is always difficult.

“There are still are two or three months to go and things can change a lot in that time.”

City could still turn a hitherto disappointing campaign into a glorious one as they face Aston Villa in the League Cup final in three weeks’ time, have progressed into the fifth round of the FA Cup and are preparing for a blockbuster Champions League last 16 clash with Real Madrid.

“There are still incredible nice things still to fight for,” added Guardiola.

“We are in the EFL Cup final in three weeks, we are still in the FA Cup, we want to try and finish second in the league and we have two big games against Real Madrid in the Champions League.”

One of those who could be sacrificed by City to make room and resources for summer signings is John Stones.

The England international has been scarcely used by Guardiola this season despite a lack of cover at centre-back due to the departure of Vincent Kompany and injury to Aymeric Laporte.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/guardiola-set-for-city--summer-squad-refresh.html

The former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh said that EVMs are not tamper-proof and no developed country uses them.

Singh tweeted: ""No Machine which has a Chip is Tamper-Proof. Also please do for a moment think, why no Developed Country uses EVM?

He has urged the Supreme Court and the Election Commission to look into the issue of EVM.

""Would CEC and Honourable Supreme Court please have a fresh look on EVM voting in India? We are the largest Democracy in the World, we can't allow some Unscrupulous People to Hack Results and steal the Mandate of 1.3 Billion People.""

Digvijay Singh has emphasised that postal ballots should also be counted ""If they match the Votes in the Counting Unit. Declare the result. If they don't match then count the Ballots of all Polling Booths in the Assembly. It would convince every one and save time also as this has been the consistent argument of CEC in favour of EVM"".

The Congress which ruled the state for 15 years under Shiela Dikshit has been struggling to open an account in Delhi.

The Chief Minister further said that all educational institutions should identify countries where teachers are needed and they should be taught languages that are needed in these countries.

He added that the identified languages could be made a part of the curriculum.

Yogi, however, lamented the fact that a large number of applicants, almost 70 per cent, had failed the recruitment examination for graduate teachers conducted by the UP Basic Education Board.

223,11-2-20,Messi can do it all,"Leo leads Barca with hat-trick of assists to beat Betis and keep pace with Real

Lionel Messi gave a hat-trick of assists on Sunday as Barcelona ended their turbulent week with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Real Betis to stay in touch with Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.

Madrid’s 4-1 win at Osasuna put pressure on Barca to respond, only for Betis to twice lead at the Benito Villamarin through a penalty from Sergio Canales and brilliant solo effort from Nabil Fekir.

Yet both times Barcelona hit back as Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets pulled them level before Clement Lenglet headed in with 18 minutes left, all three goals teed up by Messi.

Fekir and Lenglet were then sent off in a frantic contest by the end of which, Barca had the victory they so desperately needed following a difficult few days for the club.

Messi had put himself at the heart of a political spat this week by publicly taking exception to comments made by sporting director Eric Abidal, who suggested the players were the cause of the decision to sack Ernesto Valverde last month.

Barcelona were then beaten by Athletic Bilbao and knocked out of the Copa del Rey before the semi-finals for the first time in 10 years on Thursday.

“In Bilbao we played well but they knocked us out,” said coach Quique Setien. “This win will give us motivation and extra energy for the future.”

To make matters worse, winger Ousmane Dembele suffered another hamstring injury, which is likely to keep him out for the rest of the season, while centre-back Samuel Umtiti appeared in court too, for alleged damages to a rented villa.

It meant defeat against Betis was unthinkable, particularly for Setien, who could ill-afford another setback against the team he managed for two years between 2017 and 2019.

Instead, Barca turned the tide, with a chaotic performance that might have been punished by better opponents, but that keeps them three points behind Real Madrid, who had earlier won at a canter in Pamplona.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/messi-can-do-it-all.html
224,11-2-20,New King in Milan,"Lukaku stars in Inter’s second half comeback as Conte men move top of Serie A with 4-2 win against city rivals

Inter Milan moved top of Serie A on Sunday after storming back from two goals down to snatch a 4-2 win over AC Milan in a pulsating derby at the San Siro.

Inter pull level on 54 points with Juventus, who lost 2-1 at Hellas Verona on Saturday, but are ahead of the champions on goal difference thanks to a thrilling second half turnaround after Ante Rebic and Zlatan Ibrahimovic had put Milan 2-0 up at the break.

Lazio are just a point behind in third after Felipe Caicedo scored the only goal in a hard-fought win at Parma earlier on Sunday.

“It’s a special night because in the first half we were in great difficulty like we hadn’t been this season. There was the risk of taking a hammering,” said Inter boss Antonio Conte.

“Credit to these lads because they were able to resist the blows which means that we are ready for something good.

“It’s absolutely too early to talk about things that we can still dream of today.”

Milan had dominated the first half with Inter struggling to deal with Ibrahimovic, who soared above Diego Godin before knocking down for Rebic to tap the opener past Daniele Padelli.

Stefan De Vrij blocked another cross to deny Rebic a second tap in but Franck Kessie flicked on for a waiting Ibrahimovic to turn in the second.

The comeback began five minutes after the break when Brozovic lashed home a stunning volley and two minutes later Mattias Vecino finshed off an Alexis Sanchez pass to level the scores.

De Vrij put Inter deservedly ahead with a superb diving header with 20 minutes to go, and after Ibrahimovic hit the post for Milan Romelu Lukaku then headed home substitute Victor Moses’ cross three minutes into injury time to maintain Inter’s charge for a first Serie A title in a decade.

Milan’s collapse means they missed the chance to move into the Europa League places and sit 10th.

“It’s difficult to explain. The first half was almost perfect, the second half the opposite.” said Ibrahimovic.

“We conceded the first goal and the squad lost faith, then conceded a second and everything fell apart.

“Inter in the first half didn’t look like a team who were second but then demonstrated why they were after the break.""

Lazio in mix

Caicedo kept Lazio’s own dream of a first Scudetto in 20 years alive as a 1-0 win over Parma moved the Romans second in Serie A.

Simone Inzaghi’s side are right in the title discussion after extending their unbeaten run to 18 league games.

Their last Serie A defeat was in September to Inter Milan, who they host next weekend at the Stadio Olimpico.

“We are trying to stay in there, fighting against the battleships. With this spirit, we can advance very well,” said Inzaghi.

“Sunday will be a great game against a great team.”

Caicedo broke through just before the interval as the Ecuadorian volleyed home after Parma failed to clear a ball into the box.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-king-in-milan-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/new-king-in-milan.html
225,11-2-20,ICC to use front foot no-ball technology during ICC Women's T20 WC,"Front foot no-ball technology will be used in a global tournament for the first time at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia later this month, the International Cricket Council said on Tuesday.

The decision to use this system was made after successful trials conducted recently in both India and the West Indies.

""The third umpire will monitor the front foot landing position after each ball and communicate to the on-field umpire if the delivery was a no ball,"" the ICC said in a statement.

""The on-field umpires have been instructed not to call any front foot no balls unless advised to do so by the third umpire, although they will be responsible for calling all other types of no ball on the field.""

The technology was recently trialed across 12 games, during which 4717 balls were bowled and 13 no balls (0.28% of deliveries) were called. All deliveries were judged accurately, the ICC said.

Geoff Allardice, ICC General Manager Cricket said: ""Cricket has an excellent track record of introducing technology to support the decision making of our match officials and I'm confident that this technology will reduce the small number of front foot no ball errors at the ICC Women's T20 World Cup.""

""No balls are difficult for umpires to call accurately, and even though percentage of deliveries that are no balls is low, it is important to call them correctly. Since we first trialed this concept in the ODI series between England and Pakistan in 2016 the technology has improved significantly, enabling us to introduce it cost-effectively, and with minimum impact on the flow of the game.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/icc-to-use-front-foot-no-ball-technology-during-icc-women-s-t20-wc-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/icc-to-use-front-foot-no-ball-technology-during-icc-women-s-t20-wc.html

Exit polls have predicted a big win for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party, but the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders maintained that the surveys would fall flat.

The counting began at 8 am and will be held in multiple rounds, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ranbir Singh said.

""Elaborate security arrangements have been put in place. The exercise is being carried out as per the laid-down procedures of the Election Commission,"" Singh said.

Tight security arrangements have been put in place at various centres across Delhi, he said.

""The postal ballots will be counted first till around 8.30 am and then the votes cast through electronic voting machines will be counted,"" the senior official said.

""The counting centres are spread across 21 locations, spanning the 70 constituencies. Each centre has several counting halls, equal to the number of constituencies falling in that district,"" he said.

Each EVM consists of a ballot unit (BU), a controls units (CU) and a voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT.)

After counting of votes through CUs from every assembly constituency, five VVPATs will be randomly selected and they will be counted, the official said.

The counting centres are located across 11 districts, including at CWG Sports Complex in east Delhi, NSIT Dwarka in west Delhi, Meerabai Institute of Technology and G B Pant Institute of Technology in southeast Delhi, Sir CV Raman ITI, Dheerpur in central Delhi, and Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana in north Delhi.

The election, largely seen as a battle between the AAP and the BJP, was held on Saturday, sealing the fate of 672 candidates -- 593 men and 79 women.

Nearly 24 hours after the polling ended in Delhi, the Election Commission on Sunday announced that the final voter turnout was 62.59 per cent, five per cent less than 2015, and asserted that it followed the laid down process to compile data, after the AAP questioned the ""delay"".

There were 13,780 polling booths where every vote was accounted for by the presiding officers, which is a time-consuming exercise, Sandeep Saxena, senior deputy election commissioner, said at a press conference on Sunday.

Over 1.47 crore people were eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, including 2.33 lakh in the age group of 18-19.

The turnout in the 2015 Assembly polls stood at 67.47 per cent.

President Trump will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump and they will visit India on February 24–25, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

She said President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked on the telephone over the weekend.

""During a phone call over the weekend, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed the trip would further strengthen the India-US strategic partnership and highlight the strong and enduring bonds between the American and Indian people,"" she said.

The President and the First Lady will travel to New Delhi and Ahmedabad, which is in Prime Minister Modi's home State of Gujarat and played an important role in Mahatma Gandhi's life and leadership of the Indian independence movement, the White House said.

Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had travelled to India in 2010 and 2015.

""President Trump's trip to India is timely in view of the bilateral trade issues that need to be resolved and in light of the collaborations between the US and India in various realms,"" M R Rangaswami, Indian-American philanthropist and head of Indiaspora, told PTI.

Describing it as a significant visit, Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum, noted that the last three American presidents had made trips to India.

""It's essential to send a message to the region that India is a significant partner and the president values that,"" Aghi told PTI.

India has a role to play not only in its immediate neighbourhood, but in making sure that the South China Sea and the Indo Pacific region is part of the international global order, he said.

Trump's visit follows Modi's tour of the US in September, during which he met with the US President in New York on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.

The meeting had come just days after the two leaders attended the mega 'Howdy Modi' rally in Houston which was attended by more than 50,000 Indian-Americans.

The two leaders also met in August at the G7 summit held in the French town of Biarritz.

Prime Minister Modi, while interacting with the media alongside President Trump, had rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, saying the two countries can discuss and resolve all issues bilaterally and ""we don't want to trouble any third country.""

India trip will be Trump's second overseas this year, after a two-day visit to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum in Davos.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-president-donald-trump-to-visit-india-on-feb-24--25--white-house-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/us-president-donald-trump-to-visit-india-on-feb-24--25--white-house.html

239,11-2-20,What happened to BJP's tall claims of win? Kamal Nath on Delhi Polls,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said he was aware of his own party Congress' dismal show in the Delhi Assembly polls, but questioned the BJP about its ""tall claims"" of victory.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party was set for a resounding victory in the Delhi Assembly elections to retain power for a third term.

As votes for the February 8 elections were counted, the AAP was leading in 57 of 70 seats and the BJP in 13, leaving the Congress virtually decimated in a city it had ruled for three consecutive terms, according to the Election Commission figures.

Asked about Congress' poor performance in the Delhi polls, Nath told reporters, ""We are aware of this. But what happened to the BJP which was making tall claims? Being at the Centre, Modiji is close to Delhi's electorate which would have elected the BJP, if satisfied with his work.""

He said BJP leaders now don't talk about unemployment and farmers, but they speak on issues like nationalism, Pakistan and Citizenship Amendment Act.

The ""real face"" of the BJP has now been exposed, the chief minister said.

""I have a basic question about CAA. Is there any war going on, or refugees coming to India? Then what was the need to get CAA passed by conducting Parliament proceedings till midnight? What was their aim? They only wanted to give a divisive message,"" Nath alleged.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what-happened-to-bjp-s-tall-claims-of-win--kamal-nath-on-delhi-polls-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/what-happened-to-bjp-s-tall-claims-of-win--kamal-nath-on-delhi-polls.html
240,11-2-20,'Janta malik hai': Nitish Kumar on Delhi poll results,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday side-stepped queries on the outcome of assembly polls in Delhi, where the coalition comprising his JD(U), BJP and LJP has been drubbed by the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, with a terse observation will of the people is supreme.

""Janta malik hai,"" said Kumar with hands folded above his head and the ghost of a smile playing on his lips as he sauntered past a posse of journalists tossing queries on the sidelines of a function where he unveiled a statue of RSS ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

The JD(U), of which Kumar is the national president, had contested two assembly segments in Delhi Burari and Sangam VIhar - and is trailing in both by huge margins.

Although the JD(U) has never been a major player in the national capital, the current elections were significant because it was the first time that the BJP a formidable force in Delhi chose to take its smaller allies in Bihar along to take on the huge challenge posed by Arvind Kejriwal's party, which is less than a decade old.

The tie-up in Delhi had been frowned upon by JD(U) national general secretary Pavan Varma a former diplomat, who aired his differences in the open and faced the axe.

Similar was the fate of Prashant Kishor whom the chief minister had made his party's national vice-president and whose position in the JD(U) had become increasingly untenable on account of his collaboration with Kejriwal in the capacity of an election strategist.

An indignant Kishor has threatened to visit Patna after the dust settles in Delhi and unveil his future strategy, besides ""exposing"" Kumar.

The torpid opposition in Bihar, led by Lalu Prasad's RJD with the Congress as a major ally, is likely to experience a burst of vigour on account of the results in Delhi, despite their dismal performance, which came barely a couple of months after the BJP's ouster in the adjoining Jharkhand.

However, the development is likely to be received with a sense of relief by the JD(U) as the party will now be even more hopeful that Nitish Kumar's detractors in the BJP will be kept on a tight leash.

After the Lok Sabha polls last year, several BJP leaders in the state had begun to make statements that time had come for the saffron party to stake claim for the chief minister's post, thereby threatening to upend the alliance with the JD(U).

A lid was, however, put on the controversy with repeated assertions by Amit Shah, the then BJP chief, that Kumar will lead the NDA charge in the assembly polls.

Nonetheless, JD(U) sources say that a better than expected show in Delhi could have emboldened Nitish-baiters in the BJP and not augured well for the ties between the two parties, re-stitched with tenuous threads in the wake of the recent acrimony that lasted for a four-year period during which the chief minister remained outside the NDA and vowed to make a ""Sangh-mukt Bharat"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-janta-malik-hai---nitish-kumar-on-delhi-poll-results-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-janta-malik-hai---nitish-kumar-on-delhi-poll-results.html

247,11-2-20,Be safe,"A study finds that 23% deaths caused by acute respiratory infections can be prevented through proper handwashing habits. PIONEER HEALTH reports

Proper hand washing may seem trivial to some, but it is more important than many realise — in schools, in healthcare facilities, and in the home. Particularly at a time when lethal Coronavirus — a variant of the common cold virus — is making alarming headlines. The death toll in China from the novel coronavirus epidemic has jumped to 908 and the number of confirmed cases has risen over 40,000, according to reports on Monday.

Experts say it is not the masks but hand washing that will help in to keep the disease at a bay. The WHO has come out with a guidelines on handwashing with soap to prevent Coronavirus.

“One of the most important ways of stopping respiratory outbreaks such as this is washing hands,” David Heymann, who led WHO’s infectious disease unit at the time of the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, said recently at a Chatham House press briefing in London.

That’s because “if you touch a patient, if you shake hands, if you touch a door that has a droplet on it — which could theoretically happen — then you touch your face (or) your mouth and you become infected.”

“So, handwashing is the most important. Second, people who are suspected as being patients, be very careful when you are dealing with them. Avoid face-to-face contact and wash hands when you’re treating,” Heymann says.

The outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China has been recognised as a global health emergency.

Apart from Coronavirus, there are many other reasons to wash hands too — it is a most important protective health measure.

Experts say that this is often neglected but it is the most cost-effective intervention that can help avert 40 per cent of diarrhoeal disease deaths and 23 per cent of deaths due to respiratory infection deaths.

The UNICEF India points out the importance of hand washing, noting its connection with diarrhoea — the most common cause of infectious disease outbreaks in India and the second most common cause of death among children under five worldwide according to the WHO. Every day, at least 1,300 children die due to diarrhoea and diseases linked to infections of the respiratory tract. Of these deaths, 320 happen in India.

As UNICEF notes, of the 1.5 million child deaths which occur yearly due to diarrhoeal diseases, 40 percent can be prevented by handwashing with soap at critical times — including before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet.

Similarly, acute respiratory infection deaths can be prevented 23 per cent of the time by proper handwashing practices and the habit can also be linked to a number of improved health outcomes. New born survival rates improve by 55 per cent if proper handwashing practice is followed, whilst controlling the spread of infectious diseases and viruses ranging from pneumonia to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can be bolstered if handwashing is helped.

Handwashing is also among the most simple ways of reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections, which occur at a rate of one in every four hospital visits in India. Hygiene has been pinpointed as a major driver of this. Doctors say that for viral infections including the common cold and flu, the most effective way to protect yourself is regular handwashing with warm water and soap plus the vigilance to resist touching your nose and mouth.

In view of importance of this simple but important health practice, the WHO has announced October 15 as a the Global handwashing Day, a day dedicated to increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives. However, despite Government stress on this important hygiene practice, handwashing habits in India are poor among the populace. According to a study in 2017, “only 26.3 per cent washed hands before child feeding, 14.7 per cent before breastfeeding, 16.7 per cent after disposing child faeces, and 18.4 per cent after cleaning a child’s bottom.”

Practice healthy habits

To wash your hands properly, the WHO suggests scrubbing your palms with a large dollop of soap before interlacing and clasping the fingers, then scrubbing around the thumbs and the backs of your hands.

The whole process should take 40 to 60 seconds.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/be-safe-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/be-safe.html
248,11-2-20,Cyberknife therapy can help,"Dr Aditya Gupta is a Director, Neurosurgery & Cyberknife Centre at Agrim Institute for Neuro sciences, Artemis Hospital, Gurguram

Cancer spread to the brain is one of the feared complications of cancer that poses significant mortality and morbidity in the patients with advanced cancer. This occurs when the cancer cells travel through the blood stream or the lymph system from the original tumour and metastasize (spread) to the brain. This is known as metastatic cancer. For example breast cancer that has spread to the brain would be referred to as metastatic cancer and not primary cancer.

According to Globocan 2018 report, issued by the International Association of Cancer Registries (IARC) associated with World Health Organisation (WHO), over 28,000 new brain tumour cases are reported annually in India. Around 24,000 patients lost their lives battling such deadly and cancerous tumours.

The following can be the symptoms of brain metastasis but many patients may experience additional complications caused by the original tumour and its related manifestation.

Increased pressures within the skull: In most of the cases symptoms are caused by the expansion of lesions and increased ICP (Increased Cranial Pressure). The most common symptoms of ICP are headaches, vomiting, and disturbance in consciousness.

Headache: It is the initial symptom in more than half of the cases of brain tumour and this is faced by the most of the patients at some point in their life.

Vomiting: This is an occasional accompaniment with the headaches. It is far more common in children.

Seizures: It is an uncontrolled and electrical disturbance in the brain. It causes changes in the mental behaviour, movements and level of consciousness. These are almost associated with 35 per cent cases of brain tumours.

Virtually any systemic malignancy can metastasize to the brain, but there are some which have greater tendency to do so, Melanoma (a type of skin cancer) has a tendency metastasize to the brain. Other cancerous tumours in skin, breast renal and colon can also metastasize the brain. Some differences are seen in the types of primary malignancies responsible for metastasis of the brain in both the genders. In males, lung cancer is the most common source of brain metastasis whereas breast cancer is the most common source in females.

Why Cyberknife M6 over other traditional methods of treatment?

The treatment varies with the size and type of tumour. The primary sites of malignancy are extent to both locally and in rest of the body, the general individual health and presence of other medical problems. The goals of the treatment involves improve body functioning, controlling the cancer and its satellite its tumour within the brain.

Cyberknife M6 is performed in a non-invasive manner with a higher brain surgery recovery time. The characteristics of M6 to pinpoint the exact location of the tumor in real time using 3-D imaging techniques during the treatment of brain tumor and ablating the tumor without any cut marks has proven outcomes to overtake the traditional methods of treatment. With the flexibility of the treatment to be done in one to five sessions each of 30 minutes duration provides comfort to the patient and the maximum level of restricting the tumour from spreading further.

The main advantage of cyberknife radiation therapy is that it directly alters the individual deposits inside the brain without affecting the brain functioning. For treatment of metastasis such as melanoma, radiation therapy (cyberknife) may be the only option.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/docyard---cyberknife-therapy-can-help-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/docyard---cyberknife-therapy-can-help.html
249,11-2-20,Say bye-bye to wrinkles,"With age, skin becomes weak and visibly loose that results in wrinkles. DR AJAY RANA shares tips that can help to keep aging signs at bay

Wrinkles is a natural part of aging and are most prominent on skin areas which is exposed to sun, such as the face, neck, hands and forearms. There are many factors like smoking or prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays can make them worse. The neck skin is thin and faces the exposure of UV rays. Due to which, it shows signs of aging sooner than other parts of the body. The dermis, the layer on the neck area that contains collagen, is very thin, making it more prone to aging than other parts of the body.

There are many technologies which are now used to get rid of these neck wrinkles. Fractionated CO2 lasers work beautifully to help make the neck skin look younger, less wrinkled, and tighter. Wrinkles are the thin lines and creases that form in any area of the skin. Some wrinkles become so harsh and especially noticeable around eyes, mouth and neck.

As our skin gets older,it naturally becomes less elastic and more fragile. Due to this, decreased production of natural oils dries your skin and makes it appear more wrinkled. Ultraviolet radiation speeds the natural aging process, is the primary cause of early wrinkling of the skin. Regular exposure to UV light breaks down skin’s connective tissue such as collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin.

With age the skin gets weakens and the skin of the neck become thins, visibly loose, and accumulates wrinkles. Apart from the natural aging process and hereditary factors of the body, there are other factors that intensify the appearance of wrinkles in the neck.

Skin of the neck contains thinner which is more sensitive to sun damage and other environmental factors that negatively impact the skin. Many bad habits can also affect our skin adversely. Smoking accelerates the aging process of the skin that brings on wrinkle formation earlier than the natural aging process and deepens existing wrinkles. It dehydrates the skin which slows down normal cell processes that keep the skin healthy.

These habits starve the skin of the nutrients and oxygen supply that it requires and narrows the blood vessels. Smoking inhibit the supply of Vitamin A to the skin, which prevents the skin from shedding old skin cells and generating new ones. Both habits dramatically damage the skin’s elasticity and collagen production, which help in the formation of thin and wrinkled skin, especially in the neck area.

Some tips to get rid of neck wrinkles:

While cleaning your face, also clean the neck. It helps in removing the dirt, toxins of the neck.

Avoid using soap, as it can change the pH balance of the skin. Use a gentle, creamy cleanser instead of soap.

Protect the neck from the harmful rays of the sun and apply sunscreen to the neck.

Work on exfoliating your neck once a week. It removes dead skin cells and keeps skin fresh.

Always keep the skin hydrated so that the wrinkles are less visible, and it also helps prevent creases from forming.

Botulinum toxin injections and esthetic surgery may also be used to reduce neck wrinkles.

Use retinol-based neck cream and serum with Vitamin C. These act as antioxidants and protect against the effects of UV rays by increasing the collagen factor.

The CBI has chargesheeted Dubai-based private person Manoj Prasad, whom it had earlier arrested. The investigating agency has moved an application in the court contending that further probe involving his brother, Somesh and Sunil Mittal, is required.

The CBI also concluded that there was no connection between Asthana and Prasad. The CBI also stated that ""there was no role of any public servant"" in the discussion Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Babu Babu had with Prasad.

Asthana was booked on allegations of criminal conspiracy, corruption and criminal misconduct under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) on a complaint filed by Sana.

Asthana had strongly refuted the charges.

The CBI on October 15, 2018, had registered an FIR against Asthana for allegedly accepting a bribe from an accused probed by him in return for ensuring relief and a clean chit in the case.

The case against Asthana was lodged after Hyderabad-based businessman Sana in his complaint to the CBI had alleged that he paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to Asthana so that he could be spared of any action in an investigation linked to meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

The money was allegedly paid over a 10-month period, starting from December 2017. Sana was being investigated by an SIT team headed by Asthana when he had accused him of accepting bribes. As per Sana's complaint, he had met Prasad, who claimed to have good relations with Asthana. Sana also alleged that Prasad's brother, Somesh, would help him in getting a clean chit from Asthana.

Sana, a close aide of Qureshi, was arrested on July 27 last year by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.

In October 2018, the battle between then Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana became public, leading the government to intervene in the matter and transfer both the officers.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cbi-vs-cbi--rakesh-asthana-gets-clean-chit-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cbi-vs-cbi--rakesh-asthana-gets-clean-chit.html
254,11-2-20,Competing theories: Exit polls vs late turnout surge,"Exit polls predicted huge majority for AAP, but some theorists doubt claims as voters after 3pm were left out for assessment

Exit polls may have predicted an Aam Aadmi Party’s sweep in the Delhi Assembly poll, but empathetic claims by top BJP leadership of a “lotus” bloom has injected an element of interest in the counting proceedings on Tuesday.

The pro-AAP camp will take heart from the fact that many of the exit polls have given it 60 plus seats in the House of 70. The India Today-Axis My India poll, which hit the bull’s eye on more than one occasion in the recent past, has gone to the extent of predicting 68 seats for the AAP in the best possible scenario.

However, both Home Minister Amit Shah and State BJP president Manoj Tiwari don’t agree to the exit polls’ predictions. They have stuck their necks out and claimed that the BJP will get between 45 and 48 seats and comfortably form a Government. The Delhi BJP unit is also reported to have ordered a 47 kg laddoo, hoping they will get no less than 47 seats, sources said.

While a few politicians accept defeat till the last vote is counted, questions are doing the rounds: Why would Amit Shah of all the persons would put his prestige on stake if he believed in the findings of the exit polls?

The skeptics are counting on claims of “late” evening surge of voters to trash the exit polls, saying they captured the voting trend up to only till 3 pm. However, such surge in voting is a universal trend in India and there is no empirical evidence to suggest that even if voters turnout in large number in the evening they would en mass vote for any political party only.

Delhi BJP leaders and their poll managers say Delhiites voted in two phases: The first being between 8 am and 3 pm when the AAP had a clear lead. However, thereafter, BJP’s voters started pouring in, they claimed. Neelkant Bakshi, the political adviser to Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari, posted a series of tweets with names of the Assembly constituencies where according to him the BJP will win.

The BJP is also claiming that the entire AAP leadership is unusually quiet after the polling, which is an indication that the party has not got the desired result.

The BJP leaders also claimed that the five per cent decline in the voting compared to the 2015 poll is also a cause of worry for the AAP as they feel that AAP voters did not come out to vote. In 2015, the polling percentage stood at 67.17 while the overall poll percentage in 2020 is 62.59.

Late surge, EVM tampering, silent voters — these are some of the theories doing the rounds on the eve of the counting of votes. For good measures, they have kept interest alive in the counting.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/competing-theories--exit-polls-vs-late-turnout-surge-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/competing-theories--exit-polls-vs-late-turnout-surge.html
255,11-2-20,Indians on quarantined ship send SOS to PM,"‘Save us asap’ asks one; 160 crew members, 8 passengers on ship off Japan

An unspecified number of Indians, who were among 3,711 passengers and crew members on board a cruise ship quarantined off Japan due to diagnosis of coronavirus cases, have sent an SOS video message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rescue them as soon as possible.

“Please somehow save us as soon as possible. What’s the point if something happens (to us)...I want to request the Government of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modiji, please segregate us and bring us back home safely,” said Indian crew member, identified as Binay Kumar Sarkar.

Quoting Sarkar, on board Diamond Princess, NDTV news channel said there are 160 Indian crew members and eight Indian passengers on the ship. Sarkar, in a video recorded from the ship, appealed to the Indian Government and the UN to segregate the Indians on board on urgent basis.

“None of them have been checked (for coronavirus),” Sarkar, a chef from Bengal, said in Hindi. He was flanked by five of his Indian colleagues who were wearing masks.

Around 60 people tested positive of the virus on Monday, taking the total number of those infected on the cruise ship Diamond Princess — which had arrived at the Japanese coast early last week and was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the novel virus on the ship — to 130. Authorities had initially tested nearly 300 people when the ship arrived at the Japanese coast.

Indian Embassy in Tokyo on Monday tweeted the information about the Indians on the ship. “Many Indian crew & some Indian passengers are on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess quarantined off Japan due to Coronavirus (nCoV),” it tweeted, without giving a specific number of Indians on the ship.

“In this context, for any query please contact First Secretary (Consular) @IndianEmbTokyo at fscons.Tokyo@mea.Gov.In @CPVIndia @MEAIndia @PMOIndia,” it said.

Those on the ship have been asked to wear masks and allowed limited access to the open decks as they are advised to remain in the cabins most of the times to contain the spread of the virus, according to media reports.

According to an AFP report, people on board the ship are facing difficulty due to the quarantine measures, particularly those in windowless interior cabins and others who require medication for various chronic conditions.

The Japanese Health Ministry said on Monday that around 600 people on board urgently needed medication, and around half received supplies over the weekend, it said.

Meanwhile, the operator of the ship on Monday vowed to refund all 2,666 passengers due to the onboard outbreak of the new coronavirus. Carnival Japan Inc, the Japanese branch of Princess Cruise Lines Ltd, which operates the ship, said refunds will be offered via travel agencies through which the passengers made their bookings.

The company will additionally cover all costs incurred by those quarantined aboard the ship since last Tuesday, when passengers were originally scheduled to disembark at Yokohama.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indians-on-quarantined-ship-send-sos-to-pm-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/indians-on-quarantined-ship-send-sos-to-pm.html
256,11-2-20,Opp raises din over SC ruling on SC,"The Government and the Congress on Monday sparred in Parliament over the Supreme Court ruling that States are not bound to provide quota in appointments and promotions.

As tempers began to fray and Opposition and treasury benches clashed with each other, the Government informed the Lok Sabha that it was not a party to the case, but insisted the issue was being discussed at the “highest level”.

The BJP ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) sought that the reservation for SCs/STs should be put in the 9th schedule so that none could make any change in it and another ally Apna Dal also asked Government to ensure that reservation continues irrespective of SC ruling.

The Janata Dal (U) rejected Opposition’s charge of BJP being anti-reservation saying it was the Modi Government which brought an ordinance to neutralise the SC ruling on SC/ST Atrocities Act. The Opposition parties demanded that the Centre file a review petition before the apex court.

After the Opposition accused the Centre of failing to defend the reservation system, Social Justice Minister Thawarchand Gehlot told the Lok Sabha that the Modi Government was not a party to the case, which is about a 2012 decision of the previous Congress Government in Uttarakhand, and asserted that the Central Government is “committed” and “dedicated” to reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs.

The Congress hit back at Gehlot and accused him of misleading the Lok Sabha. The party also decided to move a privilege motion against him. Outside Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said it was in the DNA of the BJP and the RSS to try and erase reservations. He asserted that his party will not allow doing away with quota.

Gehlot made it clear that the Centre was not asked to file an affidavit in the matter and said the issue is being discussed in the Government at the “highest level” and it will take “appropriate steps” in the matter.

When the Minister said the Supreme Court ruling was on an order issued when the Congress was in power in Uttarakhand, members of the Opposition party shouted “shame-shame” and walked out of the House.

As soon as the Question Hour started, Opposition members led by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought to raise the issue. He was also joined by members from other parties, including the DMK.

The Supreme Court has held that States are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

The apex court was dealing with pleas regarding Uttarakhand Government’s September 5, 2012 decision to fill up all posts in public services in the State without providing reservation to SC/STs. The order was quashed by the High Court.

Hitting back at the Opposition, the Government said the Congress is trying to politicise a sensitive issue.

“This is my charge that the Congress is politicising the sensitive issue,” Defence Minister and deputy leader of the House Rajnath Singh said.

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Kalyan Banerjee (TMC) targeted the Government, saying there has been an onslaught on SC and ST reservation since the Modi Government came to power.

Chirag Paswan of LJP, an NDA constituent, said the Government should immediately interfere in the matter and put the reservation subject in the Ninth Schedule so that no one approaches the Supreme Court on these issues. He said the order of the court and the behaviour of Opposition on the matter impacting a big population of the country.

While A Raja (DMK) said there are reasons to believe that the Government is not in favour of reservation, Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan Singh) (JDU) rejected Opposition charge that Government is anti-dalit and drew attention to Government’s intervention during SC verdict on SC/ST Act. Ritesh Pandey (BSP) allged the central government is against SC/ST and dalits.

Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal) said, “I want to register my objection and disagreement with the Supreme Court order and this is very unfortunate also”. She said one of the reasons for such orders are low representation of SC/ST and OBCs in judiciary and thus Government should immediately intervene in the matter,” she said.

Opposition parties in Rajya Sabha too demanded that the Government file a review petition in the Supreme Court over its ruling on reservation in jobs and promotions for SC/STs, and walked out of the House over its “unsatisfactory” response. Gehlot clarified that neither the Central Government was made a party in this matter nor any affidavit was sought from it, and asserted that it is committed to the welfare of SCs, STs and other backward castes.

Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said it is a serious issue as it concerns about one-fourth of the country’s population. “Immediately, a Cabinet meeting should be called and a decision to file a review petition should be taken,” Azad said.

Satish Chandra Mishra (BSP) said, “When the matter comes before Cabinet, you should also add promotion in judiciary.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opp-raises-din-over-sc-ruling-on-sc-st-quota-in-promotion-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-raises-din-over-sc-ruling-on-sc-st-quota-in-promotion.html
257,11-2-20,1st affected Indian on the mend,"Much to the relief of the health authorities here, the first patient in the country to be affected by the deadly coronavirus is recovering well and her samples that were sent to the Kerala unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV) have tested negative.

Health officials are awaiting test reports from NIV, Pune. At present, the medical student, who recently returned from Wuhan in China, is being treated at the Thrissur Medical College in an isolation ward after testing positive for the coronavirus on January 30. Her condition was “stable”, they said.

In Kerala as of now, 34 people are in isolation wards across various hospitals in the State.

“The blood test result of the first patient from Thrissur, from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) testing centre at Alappuzha, shows a negative result. But we need confirmation from the NIV at Pune,” said a senior medical officer from the Kerala Government.

After the first positive case was reported from Thrissur, two other Keralite students from Wuhan had tested positive in Alappuzha and Kasaragod districts.

“A total of 3,252 are still under observation across the State, of which 3,218 are under home quarantine,” said a release issued by the Health Department which has sent at least 345 samples for testing at the NIV Pune and so far 326 results have returned negative.

With various fake news on coronavirus doing the rounds, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said “fear psychosis” is being created over the pathogen and dismissed the suggestion that migratory birds could be the reason behind its spread.

Speaking ahead of the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) of wild animals, to be held next week in Gujarat, Javadekar said there was no relation between migratory birds and the virus.

“Let’s not create a fear psychosis on the subject. There is no connection of coronavirus with migratory birds. As far as diseases or viruses from birds and animals are concerned, the conference will discuss these issues,” he said.

The Union Health Ministry has screened over 1.97 lakh passengers travelling in 1,818 flights for coronavirus as a precautionary measure. Issuing a suo motu statement in Lok Sabha, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan Vardhan said screening of passengers has been initiated at 12 major seaports and all minor ports in the country to identify passengers and crew members coming from China and to isolate them in case they are found symptomatic.

In view of a confirmed case in Nepal, the Government has initiated screening at all integrated check posts from Nepal in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Land Port Authorities, the health minister said.

China reported the outbreak of coronavirus on December 31, 2019. As of February 9, a total of 37,198 confirmed cases and 811 deaths have been reported in China. A total of 354 confirmed cases have been reported outside China from 27 countries (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/1st-affected-indian-on-the-mend.html
258,11-2-20,"Students protest against groping at Gargi, FIR lodged","nAfter large number of students of the all-women Gargi College on Monday held a protest against the alleged molestation of students by a group of men at a cultural festival on the campus, the Delhi Police said it has launched a probe into the incident and is scanning CCTV footage.

They confirmed later in the afternoon that they received a complaint from the college authorities. A case has been registered at the Hauz Khas police station.

Over 100 students held a protest outside the gate of Gargi College on Monday. As per posts of students and teachers on social media, during the college festival “Reverie” around 6.30 pm on Sunday, a group of unruly, drunk men mobbed the entrances of the college and forced their way in.

Students alleged that the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Delhi Police personnel were deployed close to the gate through which the men entered the college.

According to students, there was a complete lapse of security. “The students were groped, molested and even assaulted by the men who appeared to be in their mid-30s. The college had claimed to have made security arrangements. I don’t think such an incident has taken place on any college campus across the country,” said a student who doesn’t wished to be named.

Another student said some men jumped over the gates, some broke open the gates and some jumped over walls. “They were drunk and went berserk,” she said.

“The men groped and dragged girls and performed obscene acts. Some girls ran towards washrooms. The men followed them and locked them inside,” she added.

The students alleged that they were threatened by the intruders, who also made objectionable remarks and used cuss words. They also claimed that auto drivers, who had parked their vehicles outside the main gate of the college, also entered the campus.

“The college had hired bouncers for security. The college security was also standing right there and watching it all. My friend, who was molested, rushed to a security guard and pleaded him for help but he did not move,” a BA student said.

The students said they reported the matter to the college management but in vain.

“The next day, on Feb 7, we took up the matter with teachers and college management. The management said they had ‘taken note’ of it. They didn’t promise to take any action, after which many students shared their horrific experiences on Instagram,” a BSc student said.

Students said Delhi University colleges have witnessed repeated instances of eve-teasing and sexual harassment during college festivals. However, the university hasn’t taken them seriously, which led to the February 6 incident at Gargi College.

Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal reached the college to take stock of the situation. The DCW has issued a notice the college and the Delhi Police for inaction.

Atul Kumar Thakur, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), South district, said appropriate action will be taken in the matter.

“Police are scanning footage of CCTV cameras to collect evidence and speaking to students to ascertain facts. The inquiry is being conducted by Additional DCP (South) Geetanjali Khandelwal,” said the DCP.

“After receiving a complaint from the college authorities on Monday, a case has been registered at the Hauz Khas police station under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrong­ful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention),” said the DCP.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed the incident extremely unfortunate while Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said those involved in the act were outsiders and the college administration has been asked to take strict action against them.

The Delhi units of the BJP and the Congress demanded that the culprits be arrested at the earliest.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/students-protest-against-groping-at-gargi--fir-lodged.html
259,11-2-20,Shaheen Bagh protesters can’t block public road: SC,"SC refuses to pass order; fumes over infant’s death, asks if 4-month old can walk to protest site

Protesters cannot block public road that causes inconvenience for others and there cannot be an indefinite period of protest in such an area, the Supreme Court said on Monday on anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh, but it declined to pass an interim direction on pleas for removal of protesters. The court observed that that people are entitled to protest but it has to be done in an area identified for agitations.

“You cannot block the public roads. There cannot be indefinite period of protest in such an area. If you want to protest, it has to be in an area identified for protest,” the SC said.

The apex court also took up the issue of the death of an infant son of a protester. The four-month-old baby had passed away in his sleep on the night of January 30 after her mother returned from Shaheen Bagh protest site.

“Can a four-month-old child be taking part in such (Shaheen Bagh) protests?”, the court asked while warning two women lawyers for making “explosive submissions” that children participating in the protests against the Citizenship Amended Act (CAA) are being called names, “terrorist”, “gaddar” (traitor), “Pakistani”.

“Don’t make explosive submissions. Please do not make such statements. We do not want people to use this platform to further create problems,” said a Bench, comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, when two women advocates — Shahrukh Alam and Nandita Rao — started making submissions.

A Bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph issued notices to the Centre, the Delhi Government and the Delhi Police asking them to respond to the pleas seeking removal of protesters from Shaheen Bagh and ensuring smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.

When the counsel appearing for the petitioners urged the court to pass some direction since there was inconvenience to the public, the Bench said, “It cannot be done ex-parte. We will hear the other side…If you have waited for over 50 days, wait for some more days.”

The top court posted the matter for further hearing on February 17.

“There is a law and people have grievance against it. The matter is pending in the court. Despite that some people are protesting. They are entitled to protest,” the court said, adding, “It should be done in an area which is designated for protests. You cannot create inconvenience for the people”.

“Can you block a public road? You cannot block it. Suppose there is a public park, you cannot hold protest there,” the bench said.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by advocate Amit Sahni, who had approached the high court seeking directions to the Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which remains blocked by anti-CAA protesters since December 15.

Besides Sahni, advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, appearing for former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg, also made a plea for some directions for removal of the protesters.

When the bench headed by Justice Bobde said it was taking suo motu cognizance of the letter written by a national bravery award winner Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, seeking that minors be barred from participating in any type of protest and agitation, advocates Shahrukh Alam and Nandita Rao interrupted claiming that children participating in the protest are being called names, “terrorist”, “gaddar” (traitor), “Pakistani”, in schools.

“They (children) come home crying,” the advocates submitted.

The intervention by the advocates did not go down well with the bench, which said, “We will not hear you on this. Don’t make such types of irrelevant arguments.”

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed them saying, “Can it be a ground for sitting on dharna with a four-month-old child or can they oppose this on the ground that children are being called names like gaddars in school.”

The bench asked, “A four-month old infant had gone to protest? But tell us which four-month-old child goes on its own to protest sites.” The bench said the two lawyers were deviating from the main issue of which it has taken cognizance of.

“We are not considering either CAA or NRC. We are not considering the abuses like Pakistani hurled in schools,” the bench said.

The bench made it clear that it was not stifling anybody’s voice. “We are not stifling any voice. This is a properly constituted suo motu proceedings by the Supreme Court of India,” it added.

“We have the highest respect for motherhood, and highest concern for children. Don’t make arguments to raise and create guilt. A child has died. Instead of causing more trouble, mothers should back this cause,” the bench said.

The lawyers had submitted that “these women (who are sitting at protest site) live in slums and have no option but to take their children along to the protest site”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-protesters-can---t-block-public-road--sc-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-bagh-protesters-can---t-block-public-road--sc.html

Lead researcher and Otago medical student Jono Drew explains the global food system is driving both the climate crisis and the growing burden of common chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. “International research has highlighted the climate and health co-benefits that arise from consuming a diet that is rich in plant foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes. We wanted to understand if this holds true here in New Zealand, and to tease out which eating patterns could offer the greatest co-benefits in this context.”

The research shows that a population-level dietary shift could, depending on the extent of changes made, offer diet-related emissions savings of between 4 to 42%.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/slimline-slimline-2020-02-11.html

The 64-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss, who remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017, avoided the usual scrum of reporters at the court entrance and went in with his lawyers separately.

The High Court judges will begin hearing arguments against a magistrates' court extradition order, signed off by former UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid in February last year.

Mallya had received permission to appeal on one ground, which challenges the Indian government's prima facie case against him of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans for his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

The hearing is scheduled for three days until Thursday, with a verdict unlikely right away but it would depend on how the hearing progresses.

268,11-2-20,studycentre,"Family conflict and parental monitoring are significant predictors of suicidal thoughts in children as young as nine and 10-year olds, says a study.

The majority of children surveyed in the study had caregivers who either did not know, or did not report, the suicidal thoughts of the children in their charge.

Historically, the belief has been that people don’t need to ask kids about suicidal thoughts before adolescence, said Deanna Barch, Professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, US.

“Our data suggests that’s absolutely not true. Kids are having these thoughts. They’re not at the same rates as adults, but they are nontrivial,” she added.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at 11,814 children between ages nine and 10 from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a longitudinal study in the US on adolescent brain health in which caretakers also participate.

Dividing suicidal thoughts and actions into several categories, researchers found that 2.4 to 6.2 per cent of the children reported having thoughts about suicide, from wishing they were dead to devising — but not carrying out — a plan.

When it came to actions, they saw 0.9 per cent had tried to commit suicide; 9.1 per cent reported non-suicidal self-injury.

In more than 75 per cent of cases the caregivers did not know about the child’s experience, said the study.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre-2020-02-11.html
269,11-2-20,"Excess smartphone use linked to mental distress, suicidality","Using smartphone for long hours every day may do you more harm than you can probably think of. Researchers have found that spending a lot of time with the device and on social media may lead to mental distress and suicidality among adolescents.

The findings, published in the journal CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) contains guidance for physicians, parents and teachers on how to help teenagers manage smartphone and social media use for a healthy balance between sleep, academic work, social activity, interpersonal relationships and online activity.

""Physicians, teachers and families need to work together with youth to decrease possible harmful effects of smartphones and social media on their relationships, sense of self, sleep, academic performance, and emotional well-being,"" said lead author of the study Elia Abi-Jaoude from Toronto Western Hospital in Canada.

This review of evidence, led by the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), focuses on smartphone use and does not consider online gaming.

""For adolescents today, who have not known a world without social media, digital interactions are the norm, and the potential benefits of online access to productive mental health information -- including media literacy, creativity, self-expression, sense of belonging and civic engagement -- as well as low barriers to resources such as crisis lines and Internet-based talking therapies cannot be discounted,"" the authors wrote.

The researchers recommend that doctors should ask teenagers to reduce social media use rather than eradicate it completely and encourage parents to be part of the conversations.

Parents should discuss appropriate smartphone use with teenagers to determine together how to reduce risks and set boundaries.

A recent poll from the US indicates that 54 per cent of teenagers think they spend too much time on their smartphones and about half said they were cutting back on usage.

""Encouragingly, youth are increasingly recognising the negative impact of social media on their lives and starting to take steps to mitigate it,"" the authors wrote.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/excess-smartphone-use-linked-to-mental-distress--suicidality-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/excess-smartphone-use-linked-to-mental-distress--suicidality.html
270,11-2-20,"Gunman dead, 2 officers hurt in shooting at Arkansas Walmart","Two police officers were wounded and a gunman was killed on Monday morning in an exchange of gunfire at a Walmart store in eastern Arkansas, authorities said.

Forrest City Police Chief Deon Lee said one of the officers was taken to a hospital about 70 kilometres to the east in Memphis where he was in surgery, and the initial prognosis is ""he's going to be OK.""

The officers responded to the Forrest City Walmart after someone called police to report a man who was making threats and was ""kind of talking out of his head,"" Lee said at a news conference on Monday afternoon.

Arkansas State Police Spokesman Bill Sadler said local authorities have identified the suspect as Bobby Joe Gibbs, 40, of Forrest City, though the state crime lab has yet not confirmed his identity.

Lee identified the injured officers as Lt Eric Varner and Detective Eugene Watlington. Both are assigned to the criminal investigation department and neither was wearing a bullet-resistant vest, Lee said.

The mayor heaped praise on the officers.

""Due to their heroism and quick response, no civilians were injured,"" Forrest City Mayor Cedric Williams said.

Walmart spokesman Scott Pope said the company was helping with the police investigation. Walmart is based in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Once the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division completes its investigation of the shooting, it will forward the case file to the local prosecutor to review the officers' use of deadly force.

Tammy Priddy, 57, works at Simmons Eye Center in the Walmart. She said she was preparing patient records for the day when she heard eight shots. She said she hid under a counter in the lab until the gunshots stopped.

""The first two shots kind of startled me, and then a co-worker came in and said it was gunfire,"" Priddy said.

She and a co-worker ran from the building and officers outside the Walmart ordered her to get as far away from the building as possible. She was not injured.

""I was too afraid to think of anything except to get to safety,"" she said. ""We kept our minds straight to where we were safe and we were able to get to safety.""

Police formed a perimeter with yellow crime scene tape around the Walmart parking lot after the shooting. Police cars with flashing lights blocked roads to the store.

The store was closed and employees were sent home. A small strip mall and two gas stations saw no business Monday afternoon, as they were within the police perimeter.

Mary Martin, who said she was Gibbs' aunt, went to the Walmart after she heard about the shooting. She said Gibbs didn't have a job, but had previously worked as a DJ.

""He was a good person. He loved his family,"" she said.

When asked about the description of Gibbs ""talking out of his head"" at the store, Martin responded: ""That doesn't sound like Bobby.""

It's not the first time in recent months that a Walmart store has been the scene of a shooting.

A man was injured in a shooting at a Walmart in Memphis earlier this month, three people were fatally shot at a Walmart in Duncan, Oklahoma, in November, and a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, on August 3.

The retailer came under criticism for having insufficient security at the El Paso store on that day and has since quietly expanded security at all its stores in the city to include an armed off-duty police officer and a security guard.

A spokeswoman for the company said in November that the hiring of off-duty officers in El Paso was not a blanket policy. It's unclear what security measures were in place at the Forrest City store on Monday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gunman-dead--2-officers-hurt-in-shooting-at-arkansas-walmart-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/gunman-dead--2-officers-hurt-in-shooting-at-arkansas-walmart.html

272,11-2-20,Guterres to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib during trip to Pakistan,"UN Chief Antonio Guterres will visit the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, in Kartarpur during his visit to Pakistan next week.

The UN Secretary-General will arrive in Islamabad on Sunday and will hold bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on that day and speak at an event on sustainable development and climate change.

Guterres will “travel to Kartarpur to visit a holy site, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib,” Deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters here on Monday.

The UN Chief is expected to visit one of the most prominent Sikh pilgrimage sites next Tuesday.

Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life at Kartarpur Sahib, which has now become the world's largest Sikh Gurdwara.

On February 17, Guterres will also speak at the International Conference on 40 Years of Hosting Afghan Refugees in Pakistan, which is being organized by the Pakistan government and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), along with High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.

He will participate in a high-level panel discussion and other events at the conference.

Guterres will also meet Pakistan President Arif Alvi.

The Secretary-General will be in Lahore on February 18, where he will meet students and attend an event on Pakistan's polio vaccination campaign.

He will visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib before returning to New York on February 19.

“We welcome #Pakistan and #India opening #KartarpurCorridor today connecting two key Sikh pilgrimage sites, paving way for interfaith harmony and understanding by facilitating visa-free cross border visits by pilgrims to holy shrines,” spokesperson for the Secretary-General had tweeted.

The Kartarpur Corridor links Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan. It was opened by Prime Minister Khan on November 9 in a historic people-to-people initiative between the two countries.

The Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib is located across the Ravi river in Pakistan and is about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district of Punjab.

273,11-2-20,Amazon wants to depose Trump over loss of military contract,"Amazon wants President Donald Trump to submit to questioning over the tech company's losing bid for a USD 10 billion military contract.

The Pentagon awarded the cloud computing project to Microsoft in October. Amazon later sued, arguing that Trump's interference and bias against the company harmed Amazon's chances of winning.

Amazon was considered an early front-runner for a project that Pentagon officials have described as critical to advancing the US military's technological advantage over adversaries.

The project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the US military to improve communications with soldiers on the battlefield and use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.

The Pentagon was preparing to announce its decision between finalists Amazon and Microsoft when Trump publicly waded into the fray in July. Trump said then that other companies told him the contract “wasn't competitively bid,"" and he said the administration would “take a very long look.” Oracle had also protested after it and IBM were eliminated from an earlier round of bidding.

Amazon is looking for more information about what happened before and after Trump ordered a review. Amazon's court filing cites an alleged comment that surfaced in a book last year that said Trump privately told then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to ""screw Amazon"" out of the contract.

George Washington University procurement law expert Steve Schooner said a deposition of Trump would be “clearly relevant to the primary allegations underlying their lawsuit,” but that doesn't mean it will happen.

“I can't imagine this president sitting for that deposition,” Schooner said in an email Monday.

Besides seeking Trump's deposition, Amazon is also asking to depose Mattis, current Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other government officials.

In a filing with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims unsealed Monday, Amazon said Trump has a “well-documented personal animus towards” Amazon, its CEO Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Amazon says that Trump is the only who can testify about the “totality of his conversations and the overall message he conveyed” about the bidding process.

Trump has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes and of putting brick-and-mortar stores out of business. Trump has also gone after Bezos personally and accused the Post of being Amazon's “chief lobbyist.” The White House, Pentagon and Department of Justice didn't immediately return requests for comment Monday.

Amazon said in a statement Monday that it's important to discover what happened to preserve public confidence in the procurement process because Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to interfere with government processes to advance his personal interests.

""The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends,” the company said.

A judge is expected to decide as early as this week on whether Microsoft can start working with the Pentagon on the cloud computing project. Amazon has asked for work to be halted as its lawsuit proceeds.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/amazon-wants-to-depose-trump-over-loss-of-military-contract-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/amazon-wants-to-depose-trump-over-loss-of-military-contract.html
274,11-2-20,At least five dead in suicide attack in Kabul: officials,"A suicide attack rocked the Afghan capital Kabul early Tuesday killing at least five people, officials said, in what was the first major assault in the city in months.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes after nearly three months of relative calm in the capital.

""This morning at around 7 am, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives... Killing five people including two civilians and three military personnel. Twelve were wounded, including five civilians,"" said the ministry of interior's spokesman Nasrat Rahimi.

The ministry of defence confirmed the death toll but gave a smaller figure for the injured, saying at least six people were hurt in the attack.

A witness near the scene in western Kabul said the blast happened near the Marshal Fahim military academy.

""It was a big explosion that rocked our house. We also heard gunfire afterwards. Ambulances rushed to the area quickly,"" resident Samiullah, who goes by one name, told AFP.

The Kabul police chief confirmed the location, according to a local broadcaster.

In recent weeks the Taliban have refrained from attacking major urban centres in an effort to keep talks with the US on track, though violence in the provinces has continued.

The last major attack in Kabul was in November when at least 12 people were killed after a minivan packed with explosives rammed into a vehicle carrying foreigners during morning rush hour.

Four foreign nationals were among those wounded in the attack.

The military academy has been the scene of several attacks in the past, including an Islamic State-claimed assault last May.

Tuesday's blast comes as Washington and the Taliban wrangle over a possible deal that would see US troops begin to leave Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.

However, there appears to have been little progress in reaching a deal in recent weeks, prompting the insurgents to saddle blame on the White House and what they say are a growing list of demands by the Americans to pave the way for a deal.

The US and Taliban had been negotiating for a year and were on the brink of an announcement in September 2019 when President Donald Trump abruptly declared the process ""dead"", citing ongoing Taliban violence.

Talks were later restarted in December in Qatar, but paused again following an attack near the US-run Bagram military base in Afghanistan.

As talks have fluctuated, violent attacks in the country have raged, with the number of clashes jumping to record levels in the last quarter of 2019, according to a recent US government watchdog report.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/blast-rocks-western-kabul--official--witness-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/at-least-five-dead-in-suicide-attack-in-kabul--officials.html
275,11-2-20,Eminem on Oscar performance: Younger me didn't feel Academy Awards would understand me,"Eminem's ""Lose yourself"" performance was one of the biggest surprises of the 92nd Academy Award, and the rapper said he was happy to have made it to the stage 17 years after he won an Oscar for the ""8 Mile"" song.

The rapper, who was in talks to perform in 2003, gave the ceremony a miss and the co-writer on ""Lose yourself"", Luis Resto accepted the Oscar on his behalf.

In an interview with Variety, Eminem said at that time, he felt Academy Awards were not a right place for him to perform.

""I kinda figured maybe since I didn't get a chance to do it at the time, maybe it would be cool. Back then, I never even thought that I had a chance to win, and we had just performed 'Lose yourself' on the Grammys... So we didn't think it was a good idea. And also, back at that time, the younger me didn't really feel like a show like that would understand me.

""But then when I found out I won, “That's crazy!” That to me shows how authentic and real that award is — when you don't show up and you still win. That makes it very real to me,"" the rapper said.

At the time some reports claimed that Eminem didn't perform because the Oscars wanted him to do a censored version of the song.

""Oh no, that wasn't the case at all, because there's not even that many cuss words in it — there's only a couple. That's not true at all,"" he said.

276,11-2-20,"There's divisive politics happening, but we are wired for unity: AR Rahman","Academy Award-winning composer A R Rahman says the term ""oneness"" can make people question its existence in today's cynical world, which is rife with divisive politics and mentality.

Rahman and musical artiste Ameya Dabli are set to perform at the '""Ekam Satt Unity Concert: The 50th Symphony"".

When asked how he views the ""unity"" concert, Rahman told PTI, ""It's going in the right direction and even though in today's cynical world, when you say 'oneness' people ask, 'What oneness are you talking about?' because there's so much of divisive politics happening, there's so much divisive mentality.

""But ultimately as human beings, we are hardwired for unity, we find peace in unity, in sharing hopes, knowledge and in that context, this seems to be an amazing idea,"" he added.

When asked whether it was important for artistes to speak about love and unity at a time of divisive politics, the musician said it was better for people to discover the truth on their own.

""Take school children for example. If you tell them anything, they will tell you, ""You have already told me twice. You don't have to tell me again."" (So), it's better for people to find truth themselves. That's the best thing.

""I think there's the birth of a new world that's coming in, which is going to be beautiful. And birth, always, has pain. I feel that's where we are moving right now.""

The show, to be held on February 29, will see Rahman play his Sufi ensemble renditions and Dabli will present his music with unique instrumentation exclusively arranged with music composer Ranjit Barot.

Rahman said a Sufi performance is more like ""meditation"" and he has been doing it since the '90s with songs like 'Piya Haji Ali', 'Khwaja Mere Khwaja', 'Kun Faya Kun' and 'Maula' from ""Delhi 6"".

""Even though these are just songs, for me it was therapeutic composing them and there's a lot of attention and heart from the writers like Prasoon Joshi, Shaukat Ali and Irshad Kamil...

""They all come from very good intentions and that's the reason they outlived the movies. Some of the stuff is intertwined with Indian Classical music. I like going back to them and playing some masterpieces.""

Rahman said only a spiritually-minded person can come up with music that is healing.

""If you have a cook, who has dirty hands, you will fall sick! Same goes for music. When you are composing, you are giving something to millions of people or even 10 people, it is a process of meditation and service. That's what I have been taught and I have been trying to do.""

Personally, the composer said, the process of creating music has healed him.

""The selflessness that comes in and there's a certain quality of music, which makes you feel redeemed that you are not bothered about the results. The process in itself is so beautiful.

""Take so many classical singers, their 'ragas' elevate them as well as satisfy them. Satisfaction is a rare thing. No matter how much money you have, you are never satisfied but I think, music has that quality. When you are creating it or singing it, you feel satisfied.""

The concert will take place at Jio Gardens, Mumbai.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/there-s-divisive-politics-happening--but-we-are-wired-for-unity--ar-rahman-2020-02-11.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/there-s-divisive-politics-happening--but-we-are-wired-for-unity--ar-rahman.html

China is a major market where it expects most 5G smartphones to be shipped.

As per report, MediaTek predicts China will still ship around 100-120 million 5G smartphones this year, accounting for a global market share of 60 per cent, news portal GizmoChina reported on Monday.

Earlier, US based investment banking and financial service company Goldman Sachs is forecasting a hefty 200 million 5G smartphone shipments globally in the coming year.

The predicted value is about 20 times more than the sales figure of 2019.

According to estimates, there will be about one million new 5G base stations in China this year. This is higher than the original 600,000 prediction by Goldman Sachs.

Additionally, Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi co-founder Lei Jun announced the company is planning to pump $7 billion in 5G, AI and IoT over the next five years.

Last month, Chinese local research agencies suggests that 20 per cent of all mid range smartphones will support 5G, thanks to the expansion of the network in the country.

Earlier, the device made its way to China's 3C certification database, revealing it is coming with a 15W charger in the box.

The device from this certification bears the SM-F700 model number which matches previous certification exploits.

It may feature a 6.7-inch tall aspect ratio display that can be folded and unfolded vertically.

The phone is expected to feature a dual-camera setup on the outside and a 10MP selfie camera.

The device will be able to record 8K video, and a 5G version will be released in South Korea.

Ice Universe had also earlier claimed that the upcoming fold may have an ""ultra-thin glass display"" instead of plastic.

Rahul made 112 runs (from 113 balls), including nine fours and two sixes, as he rescued India from 62/3 in the 13th over after being sent in to bat.

He put on 100 runs with Shreyas Iyer (62 off 63 balls) for the fourth wicket, and later on another 107 runs with Manish Pandey (42 off 48 balls) for the fifth wicket.

For New Zealand, who have already clinched the series after winning the first two matches, Hamish Bennett finished with 4/64 from ten overs to emerge as the most successful bowler.

The home made two changes, with captain Kane Williamson returning from injury. Spinner Mitchell Santner came in for Tom Blundell. India made one change with Manish Pandey included ahead of Kedar Jadhav.

India made another poor start. Kyle Jamieson (1/53) bowled opener Mayank Agarwal (1), who has suffered a torrid tour of New Zealand thus far. The big blow came when captain Virat Kohli (9) was out, caught at third man in the seventh over.

The other opener Prithvi Shaw provided the initial flourish with 40 off 42 balls, including three fours and two sixes. But, he was run-out going for a suicidal second run in the 13th over.

Iyer and Rahul then took charge of the proceedings, and anchored the Indian innings. The former batted steadily and reached his half century off 52 balls, his third 50-plus score in this series.

But Iyer could not carry on as he was caught off Jimmy Neesham (1/50) as the ball looped up, for a soft dismissal.

It was down to Rahul then, who crossed 50 off 66 balls. His partnership with Pandey progressed well as India reached 250 in the 45th over.

Rahul's hundred came off 104 balls, and he perished in a bid to accelerate thereafter. This is where India's innings fell apart, as Pandey also holed out off Bennett shortly afterwards.

Sent in to bat, India were down 62 for 3 in the 13th over after the dismissals of Mayank Agarwal (1), captain Virat Kohli (9) and Prithvi Shaw (40) but Rahul got a useful ally in in-form Shreyas Iyer (62) to take India to a competitive total.

Rahul, who hit nine fours and two sixes during his 113-ball innings, and Iyer stitched exactly 100 runs from 18.2 overs for the fourth wicket to revive the Indian innings.

After the end of the promising innings of Iyer, Rahul shared another 107 runs for the fifth wicket with Manish Pandey (42).

The Kiwis were off to a confident start in their chase with Martin Guptill (66) and Henry Nicholls (80) and putting on a 106-run stand. However, wrist spinner Yuzvendra Chahal took three wickets to bring India back in the game.

Colin de Grandhomme (58) and Tom Latham (32), though, took their side past the finish line with an unbeaten 80-run partnership.
