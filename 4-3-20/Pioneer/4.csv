0,04-3-20,Congress must seize the day,"No clear leaders have emerged from the anti-CAA movement. However, the grand old party has not been able to take advantage of this opportunity and fill the leadership vacuum

The anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests have entered a critical phase, with the courts taking cognisance of them. However, as is the case in India, the judicial process is taking time and most likely we have a long wait ahead of us before a verdict is delivered.

So far, the protesters have remained leaderless and without any organisational strength. But the brutal police crackdowns on the demonstrators in Delhi and elsewhere have earned them the sympathy of the masses and helped the agitation to expand to other parts of the country. Though in some places they are becoming violent, by and large the demonstrations are peaceful but going nowhere.

The JP movement threw up many socialist leaders like Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Nitish Kumar and so on, who became regional satraps later. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal emerged from the Anna Hazare anti-corruption movement. Though the issue is emotive, so far no leader of significance has emerged from the anti-CAA movement. In the absence of effective leadership and dedicated workers, it risks fizzling out.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused the Opposition, particularly the Congress, of instigating these protests, the grand old party has not come to the forefront in a more aggressive manner, like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Left parties have. The Opposition parties now have the opportunity to use these protests to take on the Modi Government. But they would have to play a more active role instead of giving the anti-CAA protesters tacit support, the way they have been till now. It is clear that the movement calls for a mature leadership to handle the issue in a pragmatic and peaceful way.

Already Delhi has recorded 47 deaths in the clashes between pro and anti-CAA protesters, which also left nearly 250 people injured. This mindless violence is not going to take us anywhere as the Government is determined not to back down on the CAA issue. And, even if the Government decides to negotiate, with whom will it confer? No clear leaders have emerged so far. This is where the Congress Party is missing a golden opportunity. Despite being the oldest national party in the country, it has not been able to seize the moment and lead the protests. This is largely because of the leadership crisis within the party.

Second, it is unable to build a credible secular narrative stressing the point that it was the Congress, which made a major contribution to the framing of the Indian Constitution. It has been unable to cash in on the freshness given to the idea of secularism by lakhs of protesters reciting the preamble of the Constitution.

Third, the Congress is not clear about its ideological narrative while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been able to project its Hindutva ideology successfully.

Currently, the Congress is in power in seven States, including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry and Rajasthan. It can easily make an impact at least in these States. Several non-BJP Chief Ministers, too, have declared that they will not implement the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in their States.

However, the Congress is unable to build on this and get support from Opposition leaders. Its president Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of 19 Opposition parties before the Budget Session last month but major parties like the TMC, the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and even its ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), stayed away.

Earlier, Sonia declared, “The Congress Working Committee must categorically declare that millions of Congress workers will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of India in their struggle for equality, justice and dignity.”

The party also held flag marches on its 135th Foundation Day on December 28. Congress MPs in both Houses wore black badges while attending the President’s address to the joint session. Sonia led a protest in the Parliament complex to express solidarity with the anti-CAA protesters.

A high-level Congress delegation called on the President and urged him to intervene and withdraw the CAA. But, the question is, whether these efforts are enough and if they have made any impact at all apart from the BJP accusing the Congress of instigating the stir.

The problem is that the Opposition remains divided and it will have to counter the forceful campaign of the BJP and the Modi Government, which could generate a Hindu backlash. The BJP has mobilised the Sangh Parivar to run counter campaigns to convince people about the need for the CAA. The Modi Government is also trying to counter the negative and unflattering publicity in the foreign media on the riots and other human rights issues.

It was not flattering that on the day of US President Trump’s impeachment vote, the three most influential newspapers — The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal — had India on their front pages with critical and unflattering stories.

With the second part of the Budget Session beginning on Monday, there is still no evidence of Opposition unity. Leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati are not willing to work under the Congress’ leadership. Even the Left parties are unhappy with the Congress for going to the President alone. It appears to be a missed opportunity for the Opposition, including the Congress, as the issue is emotive, sensitive, political and social and needs to be sorted out at the earliest.

1,04-3-20,A sorry spectacle,"The onus is on the people of Delhi to see through the designs of politicos and pressurise them to empower the police to operate without fear or favour

Ostensibly the best equipped, staffed and trained police force in the country, the Delhi Police has had an unimaginably poor run and diminished perception in recent times. If the Police Adequacy Index, derived from national data, part of the Status of Policing in India Report 2019, ranks it as the best-performing force, then its fate in the unseen and under-reported hinterland of the nation is worrisome, to say the least. Even before the gut-wrenching violence in Delhi’s northeast flared up, the police force was in the news for displaying selective bias in managing social unrest in universities across the capital.

However, the cancerous “inner health” of the organisation was in full display a few months ago when police personnel protested against their own senior leaders for their failure to defend the rank and file of the force. The top brass had a tough time pacifying the police personnel, who wore black bands and sloganeered against them. An unprecedented and frightening portent emerged as the law enforcers exposed their own vulnerability to society when they were expected to safeguard the people from societal regression. An embarrassing “acknowledgement” and “acceptance” of the demands of the personnel ensued, though the rot within the system was obvious and was temporarily brushed under the carpet, only to stare in the face soon.

The promise of shanti, sewa and nyaya (peace, service and justice) collapsed and ran hollow as the death toll in the communal riots that broke out in the northeastern parts of the city rose to well over 40. Beyond the stark statistics of the dead and the wounded, it is the failure of the Delhi Police in maintaining a strict law and order situation over a specific area, for about three to four days in the national capital, that is unfathomable. Something, somewhere was terribly amiss as violence of this kind could not have been on account of the fact that the police force was either out-gunned (metaphorically), out-numbered or out-trained by a disorderly mob, however violent. This at a time when security preparedness was at an all-time high in the capital city, given the parallel visit of US President Donald Trump.

It would be incorrect to assume that security imperatives for the presidential visit sucked up or dried the Delhi Police’s resources from the violence-affected northeast area to be concentrated in central Delhi. For the resident resources are both adequate and subject to additional requisitioning if required, especially when violence in the periphery of an all-important event is unacceptable to all. Supreme Court judge KM Joseph succinctly summed up the situation when he said, “If you act the way the law requires you to act, you will see the difference.” Implicitly, the police force had not acted enough, or in time.

However, it is equally important to recognise the constraints under which the Delhi Police functions. It is susceptible to political pressures of all hues, with conflicting interests. It is part of the turf war between the State and the Central Government as the constitutional wiring ensures that it falls under the Home Ministry, through the Lieutenant Governor. It is delinked from the administrative services of the locally-elected Government. This makes the Delhi Police waver between owning and disowning its actions to suit the political narrative of political parties.

Dangers of the larger, looming crisis, of “institutional independence” and its ramifications, are personified by the fate of the force. The top echelons of the police have “proximity” and “vested interests” with the career-impacting politicos, whereas the main body of constabulary suffers from the lack of “voice”, “concern” and “operational independence.” A contrast of the police soldier with that of the armed forces is self-explanatory. The latter is still relatively and structurally more independent, less-interfered with and allowed to operate kinetically. It is not a function of individual superiority as much it is of institutional ethos, circumstances and cocooning — the same family in a village in Haryana sends one son to the Delhi Police and the other to the Indian Army.

The awe-inspiring height of the colourfully-plumed Delhi Police marching contingent with exaggerated hand swings, that would consistently walk away with the trophy for the best marching contingent in the Republic Day parade, is a far cry from the reality and perception on the street. In an embarrassing ode to the prevailing public perception, a political party openly asked Delhiites to make videos of police personnel asking for bribes and harassing people — the accusation resonated and the public empathised with the taint.

On the recent Delhi violence, videos of senior police officials standing pliantly behind politicians making hate speeches complete the picture of political control and subservience. In perhaps a disturbing but hopefully unrelated coincidence, a Delhi High Court judge, who had rightfully slammed the police force for inaction and inefficacy against hate-mongers and alluded to the 1984 riots, was transferred.

For far too long, systemic inefficiencies in the police services have been allowed to fester, perpetuate and worsen. The complete capitulation and meltdown of the Haryana police posse in Panchkula in 2017 could hardly inspire confidence and respect. Requisitioning the Army (as also suggested now) should always be the absolute “last call” as it is bad for the forces, for the Army and for the nation, too. It suggests an unmanageable breakdown.

Beyond all policing reforms and restructuring that are long overdue, if there is one change that can unleash incalculable doses of policing professionalism, it would be to structurally and meaningfully detach its operational functioning from political intrusion and allow it to be “independent” like the judiciary or the armed forces.

Equally, the current situation is a forewarning to these still relatively “independent” institutions of the fate that awaits them if they were to surrender their functional “independence.” The political blame-game among competing political parties in Delhi will only worsen with the stoking of even more polarising, distractive and untamed passions. The onus is on the people of Delhi to see through the designs of these politicos and pressurise them to empower the police to operate without fear or favour. Else, the Delhi Police will continue to carry the can of blame, both conveniently and a bit unfairly.

2,04-3-20,The contagion,"The Govt must ensure operational readiness and a healthy obedience of protocols if we are to beat the Coronavirus

As the rapidly spreading Covid-19 has hit home with returning travellers picking up the virus in transit or from the countries they visit, India, like China, has a huge challenge in arresting the contagion in densely knitted communities. Except, unlike China, this is an uncharted territory administratively and preventive behaviour requires human conditioning without setting off a panic economy. The first hurdle is the nature of the virus itself, which can be asymptomatic in some cases, lying dormant in the host for up to a fortnight and yet infecting others before s/he can manifest full-blown symptoms. Such carriers could easily make it past the airport thermal screens. Sometimes the carrier may have a relatively mild infection with generic symptoms — most Indians are known to tackle the flu virus comparatively better. This means that many cases have not been counted and estimates could be flawed. Many hosts may be unaware and be in normal circulation. Yet others may be using medicines to lower fever to avoid a 14-18 day quarantine. Which is why the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) updated travel advisory said temperature screening alone at ports of exit or entry is not an effective way to stop the international spread of the virus. This is precisely what happened with the parent of a Noida school student, who, on returning, hosted his child’s birthday party, resulting in that school now being sanitised and students in direct contact quarantined. Or the man in Delhi who went to visit his family in Agra or the tourist dining at Delhi’s Hyatt Regency. The second toughest barrier thus happens to be contact tracing through an integrated disease surveillance programme. This involves identifying people that the infected person has come in touch with or within breathing distance, screening, monitoring and isolating them and mitigating the domino effect. China has been pretty aggressive about mitigation procedures but in India, the normal behavioural tendency is denial rather than willful submission. That hiding and blending in can be India’s toughest obstacle in containing the spread. For fear of quarantine may stop many people from voluntary health declarations on arrival or listing details. There needs to be an immediate awareness drive to demystify health status checks as a preventive cure and eliminate fear psychosis. The third weakest link in the chain is our stretched surveillance system and a poor public health infrastructure, which may not allow for aggressive detection and compromise accuracy of data collection. While the Kerala template in tackling the deadly Nipah virus has been cited and adopted, the Coronavirus spread is multifarious and needs a unified protocol. With 15 laboratories under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) capable of identifying the virus, the Health Ministry is planning to scale that number up to 50.

India must ensure operational readiness and a healthy obedience of protocols. Every basic healthcare unit staff needs to be trained in quarantine drills. There must be enough stock of protective gear, supporting drugs like lopinavir and ritonavir, and space for isolation wards, especially in areas underserved by the health network. The Government has already stopped exports of paracetamol and vitamins. We also need a military-like discipline on public hygiene protocols for the virus can stay on metal, glass and plastic surfaces from two hours to nine days. Spreading trained medical personnel in the event of a massive outbreak could affect critical care in hospitals. As of now, the average Government allopathic doctor to population ratio is 1:10,926. Which is why community surveillance and a first crisis responder system need to be developed. That’s why information dissemination has to keep pace with its absorption at the neighbourhood level. Over and above everything else, we need to keep calm and stop spreading untruths. Yes we have a sizeable older population, who are at the greatest risk and, therefore, we have to be especially vigilant about the chronically ill among them. Also, there must be a mechanism to sort coronavirus from ordinary flu patients as the symptoms are mostly similar. Unnecessary overcrowding can overwhelm the healthcare delivery capacity of both the private and public sectors. Unless we have a targetted approach, those in need of real care might just get left out and more carriers could roam free. The virus is not as fatal as say an ebola but the difference between crisis and containment is a reasoned approach and a reorientation of personal healthcare as we know it.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-contagion-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-contagion.html
3,04-3-20,A friend of India,"Jack Welch’s legacy will be debated for decades to come but the iconic American businessman was good for us

General Electric (GE), the firm that never forgot to remind us that it was founded by American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, came to be known as The House that Jack Built in the last decades of the 20th century. Jack Welch was the man who took the company to new heights during his stint as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GE for two decades. The market value of its stock rose from $14 billion to more than $400 billion, an eye-popping increase of 2,700 per cent. His management mantras became staple reading at business schools across the world. Yet, after he retired, his high-handedness, which included some obnoxious views on executive compensation and unemployment as well as revelations about some of his decisions while he was at the helm of GE, would have tainted his reputation. His ruthless leadership style and penchant for slashing jobs had earned him the nickname of Neutron Jack. While there were 24,000 GE employees back in 1980, by 1995, that number had fallen to 6,720. His successor, Jeff Immelt, whom he hand-picked, eventually spun off some of Welch’s more extravagant operations, including much of GE Capital, the company’s financial services arm.

However, no matter how his legacy is remembered in the business world, India will remember him as the man who took a punt on the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector with GE Capital. While this business was grown by very capable Indian lieutenants such as Raman Roy and Pramod Bhasin, it was Welch’s decision to establish the call centre business in the country and take advantage of our huge untapped source of human capital that must be fondly remembered. Welch set into motion a series of events that allowed the country to dominate the burgeoning Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) sector. Much of the BPO operation is today run by the spin-off company, Genpact, but one could argue that the tremendous growth of this industry in Gurugram and Noida, seen at the turn of the century, is in no small part due to Welch. While it is true that Indian companies such as Wipro and Infosys would have emerged nonetheless, GE’s confidence in India gave countless American corporations the confidence to use Indian firms to deliver back-end services. For this one fact alone, Welch should be remembered in New Delhi and Bengaluru as the American who had an outsized impact, much more than any other.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-friend-of-india-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-friend-of-india.html
4,04-3-20,The RAF had tackled over 300 incidents in many areas,"Following the communal riots in Northeast Delhi, the Rapid Action Force had tackled over 300 incidents of fire as compared to a few cases of quelling violent protestors. Almost eight companies of the force, which is about 700 personnel, were actively deployed from February 25 in various riot-hit areas like Dayal Bagh, Govindpuri, Karawal Nagar, Khajuri Khas and Bhajanpura.

According to a senior official, the blue-dungaree donning RAF personnel rescued a number of people who were trapped inside burning houses even as they doused flames that had engulfed numerous buildings and vehicles parked on the road.

“Despite not having protective gears, the RAF personnel saved people from a number of fire-engulfed buildings as there was no one else to help them,” he said.

“The RAF teams encountered as many 300-350 incidents of fire when they fanned out in these areas. The troops and the commanders led from the front and entered burning houses to rescue people,” said an RAF official.

Fire-fighting is not the primary charter of the RAF but as a force in uniform it is the duty to help people in distress, whether trapped in violent protests or in fire-engulfed buildings.

As per an official report, RAF Commandant Bhavesh Chaudhary along with his two jawans, constables Shiromani Singh and Sunil Kumar, entered a burning house in Brijppuri area and helped to rescue a family on the night of February 25.

“This RAF team had also cleared the road beneath the Jafrabad metro station on the same day, which was blocked by protestors, by moving in heavy anti-riot vehicles like Vajra and taking out a march displaying strong body language,” said the official.

“When another team of the force along with Delhi Police personnel entered Chandbagh area on the same day (February 25), rioters pelted stones at them which was retaliated by firing of tear gas shells,” the sources in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said.

“Hundreds of tear shells were fired to disperse the crowds but not a single bullet was fired by the RAF,” they said.

A team led by RAF Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Alok Awasthi also took out a march in the affected areas and talked to locals even as they maintained their presence in the area for long hours to keep troublemakers at bay.

The force personnel also rescued those who were surrounded by violent mobs at numerous spots.

On February 27, a team of about 16-17 personnel patrolling in Shiv Vihar area saved an auto-rickshaw driver and three others as a mob was lynching them, the officials said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/the-raf-had-tackled-over-300-incidents-in-many-areas.html
5,04-3-20,Tiwrai says will promote Jan Aushadhi Kendra in city,"On a similar line of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP’s) Mohalla Clinic, Delhi Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) has planned to publicize the Jan Aushadhi Kendra which will be known as the Prime Minister’s Shop. In a Parliamentary committee meeting with Prime minister Narendra Modi, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwrai with core members planed to execute the centre run scheme including Ayushman, Ujjawala and few others.

While on March 7, the BJP will commence its plan to publicize the central government schemes, Jan Aushadi Kendra will remain on the top as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to address the Nation on same.

Tiwari said that March 7 will be celebrated as Janaushadhi Day and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will communicate with the beneficiaries and shopkeepers of Jan Aushadhi Center through video conferencing at 10 am.

“In Delhi too, TV screens have been arranged by the government and other institutions at all Janaushadhi centers on which this program will be shown. All the MPs, MLAs, public representatives and Pradesh, District and Mandal Office bearers will participate in this programme,” Tiwari said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tiwrai-says-will-promote-jan-aushadhi-kendra-in-city.html
6,04-3-20,Suspected coronavirus cases put UP on alert,"An alert was sounded across UP after some people in Agra and Lucknow were suspected to be infected by coronavirus.

The UP government has set up a 22-member high-powered committee for taking preventive measures on the coronavirus as well as to spread awareness among the masses. A meeting of the high-power committee headed by Medical Education Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna and Chief Secretary RK Tiwari was scheduled to be held on Tuesday evening to update the health officials about the measures taken to defuse the threat.

However, Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh, while talking to a news channel on Tuesday, confirmed that six people in Agra were suspected to be infected by the deadly virus. The minister said that their blood samples had been sent to the National Institute of Virology lab in Pune and National Centre for Disease Control in New Delhi. Singh said that samples of 23 others and the family members of the six suspected cases were also sent for test. The six people suspected to be infected by the virus have been shifted to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi.

Singh said that special monitoring was being done at the airport and on the Indo-Nepal border.

The UP government has set up a helpline — 18001805145 — on which people can report any incidence or get their confusion over the coronavirus removed.

Meanwhile, a suspected coronavirus infected patient who arrived in Lucknow from Dubai was admitted to the Lok Bandhu hospital in the state capital.

Doctors said the passenger, who arrived at Lucknow airport, was detected with symptoms of COVID-19 . His blood sample has been sent to Pune for test.

On the other hand, till date, 2200 people from China have arrived in UP and out of them, samples of 120 have been sent for test.

Meanwhile, two private schools cancelled classes in Noida on Tuesday for the next few days as a precautionary measure after the father of a student tested positive for coronavirus, officials said. The two schools announced their closure in messages sent to the parents, a day after the Union Health Ministry reported two fresh cases of coronavirus, one of them in Delhi.

One of the schools, where the Delhi man’s son is a primary class student, said it would remain closed from March 4 to March 6. The parent had thrown a birthday party last week for the child, triggering fears that the students who attended it might be at risk.

Medical samples from five students from the school have been taken to check if anyone has been infected, an official said.

Earlier in the day, the school said it was postponing internal examinations scheduled for Tuesday due to some “unavoidable circumstances”. The board exams are not affected, the messages sent to the parents made clear.

The second school said it was suspending classes up to March 9 and sanitising its campus. Fumigation was underway at both schools. A Health department team led by Noida’s chief medical officer visited one of the schools in the morning, an official said.

Meanwhile hotels and tourists sites in Agra have been instructed to inform the office of the chief medical officer as soon as visitors from Italy, Iran or China arrive, so that they could be screened for coronavirus infection, an official said on Tuesday.

As soon as any information is received, a team of doctors will be dispatched to examine the visitors for symptoms of COVID-19, Agra’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Mukesh Vats told media persons.

“We have issued instructions to all hotels in the city that if any person is coming from Italy, Iran or China, they should inform us. As soon as the hotel informs us, a team of doctors goes to the hotel, and examines them for symptoms of coronavirus. All the tourists sites have been told to inform the 24-hour control room about visitors from countries where coronavirus outbreak has been reported,” Dr Vats said.

Asked whether symptoms of coronavirus had been found in any visitor in Agra, he said, “The group of 19 tourists who had come from Jaipur were staying in Crystal Sarovar, and had arrived day before yesterday (Sunday) at 2:00 pm. Next (Monday) morning at around 8:00 am, they left for Delhi.”

“After this, another batch of 18-19 tourists was staying at the Taj Convention Hotel. They have been tested and have not been found symptomatic. The history of the tourists was scanned, and symptoms searched. All of them are normal. The second batch was tested yesterday in the afternoon,” Dr Vats said.

The UP government had on January 27 directed officials to set up 10-bed isolation wards in every district hospital and medical college of the state as a precautionary measure to deal with any suspected case of coronavirus.

The directive came during a review meeting of the Health department chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The chief minister directed that special vigil be maintained at airports and on Indo-Nepal border. He further directed Health officials to take necessary steps in coordination with the Union Health Ministry. Directions were also issued to spread awareness about the virus and precautionary steps.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/suspected-coronavirus-cases-put-up-on-alert.html
7,04-3-20,An unmitigated disaster,"The impact of the riots is not restricted to lost lives and economic opportunities. Its reverberations have also been felt in the way in which the global community has responded

History tells us that the myth of Roman emperor Nero fiddling while Rome was burning was just that, a myth. For one, the fire that burned Rome to the ground occurred in 64 AD and the violin was invented in the 12th century, more than a thousand years after Nero’s reign. So, whatever Nero may have played, if he really did play something, it certainly wasn’t the fiddle. There is, however, no such doubt about what Prime Minister Narendra Modi was doing while Delhi burnt recently. His obsequious fawning over US President Donald Trump and his family was there for all to see on prime television and along with Delhi’s reputation as a progressive Capital, Narendra Modi’s own standing as a statesman on the global stage turned to mud and ashes.

Funnily enough, his fall from grace was best reflected on American late night talk shows, such as John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight, where Modi became a butt of low humour. Moreover expressing anger over the issue at this late stage, as some papers suggest he has done, only adds to his credibility problem, as trust is no longer a tradable commodity available to him.

However, the seriousness of this tragedy can best be understood once we look at the issue in its larger perspective. Forty-seven dead and counting is the official death toll with over 250 injured. And, as in most such cases, the likelihood of gross underestimation cannot be ruled out. Even using official figures, the seriousness of the incident can be gauged from the fact that while over the last 70 years 90-odd souls have perished in all the previous Hindu-Muslim conflagrations in Delhi, more than half that number perished in just the 72 hours of rioting that we recently witnessed. Crucial 72 hours, in which the Delhi Police added to its glorious tradition of utter ineptness, shame and unprofessionalism as men in uniform waited for the murderous rage of the unhinged to spend itself. If allegations are to be believed, some of them even joined in the mayhem. Certainly, they are undeserving of the uniform they don, especially of the former Police Commissioner, whose inaction just days prior to his retirement showed him up as wholly unworthy of respect or that rank. Sadly, 40 years of a wasted legacy to leave behind.

As is often the case, violence, especially mob violence, tends to be motivated by fear of the unknown and a dread of the other. True to form, here, too, fear has been the key that has been used to divide communities, consolidate hate and finally to destroy lives and livelihoods.

Among politicians and even civil society, there are no innocents here. Many among the Opposition parties, supported by the anti-BJP set, went about stoking terror among minorities, suggesting that the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) was just the first step towards their exclusion from citizenship, without a shred of evidence to support their accusations. They are as much to blame for the targeting of the Muslim community as those non-entities from the BJP, who encouraged goons to resort to violence and whose only claim to fame is being second generation politicians. Thus, their only hope of impressing Modi was through a display of zealous fealty. Of course, for some of them, revenge was certainly a motive after the drubbing the BJP got in the Delhi Assembly Elections, despite the saffron party’s best efforts.

It was patently obvious to most, except the politically-illiterate, that the CAA was an ill-conceived attempt by the BJP to win brownie points in Assam, after it had committed hara-kiri in the manner that it went about organising the National Register of Citizens exercise there. The fact that the Home Minister continues to vociferously support the CAA suggests that the obvious fact that the issue in Assam is not about religious identity but ethnicity, has been beyond his comprehension.

It is only a matter of time before their wishful thinking that CAA will help them in the Bengal elections turns out to be a mirage, despite the pathetic performance of the Trinamool Congress till date. As that old proverb goes, “for want of a nail a kingdom was lost.”

Just as following the money trail helps catch fraudsters, the body count clearly points to those who were responsible for this conflagration. It is bound to haunt them for times to come, despite all denials. What it does also reveal is that the leadership that permitted such violence was utterly bereft of common sense. To initiate such attacks when President Trump was visiting, with the Western media being focussed on the country, shows a spectacular lack of foresight with regard to timing. More so, when the economy that is in the doldrums stares at a unique opportunity to turn things around because of Chinese manufacturing having been stymied by the effects of COVID19. But now the nation finds itself held hostage by the very violence that was permitted to be unleashed. Unfortunately, the impact of these riots is not restricted to lost economic opportunities only, as its reverberations have also been felt in the manner in which the international community has responded with outrage, especially our friends in West Asia.

Given the fact that over the last few years Modi had expended a fair amount of energy on improving and expanding ties with both Saudi Arabia and its allies, as well as with Iran and its friends, the violence has meant taking two steps backwards.

This attention to the region paid handsome dividends when Modi decided to act in Jammu and Kashmir to abrogate Article 370, in all but name. While Pakistan attempted to exert pressure in the international fora on the issue with the help of Malaysia and Turkey, its actions were largely unsuccessful because of the position taken by both Saudi Arabia and Iran.

However, the ongoing detentions in Jammu and Kashmir and the anti-CAA protests across the country finally forced Saudi Arabia to accede to calling a meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in April 2019, to discuss Kashmir and the CAA, much to the Modi Government’s discomfiture.

We really need not hold our breath over how the Saudis will react to these riots. In any case, we now have the Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, an extremely good friend of India, out rightly denouncing the violence by tweeting, “Iran condemns the wave of organised violence against Indian Muslims. For centuries, Iran has been a friend of India. We urge Indian authorities to ensure the well-being of all Indians and not let senseless thuggery prevail. The path forward lies in peaceful dialogue and rule of law.”

Strong words indeed and while the Government summoned the Iranian Ambassador Ali Chegeni and protested his Foreign Minister’s condemnation of the incident maintaining that it was an “internal matter”, the truth is that the Government finds itself on the back foot with the Foreign Minister becoming a laughing stock as he attempts to defend the indefensible.

Finally, leave alone our interests in West Asia, we seem to have made a mess of things closer home as the Bangladesh Government attempts to come to terms with the fallout of our intemperate actions. All that we now need is a Democrat in the White House and Modi’s cup of joy will overflow.

8,04-3-20,The personal data time bomb,"The need of the hour is to create an atmosphere of trust and enable legal provisions ensuring protection of citizens’ data

As the citizen database created from the National Population Register (NPR) and the Aadhaar card is being updated and work on a Personal Data Protection Bill is on, it is time that citizens and social activists question the acceptability of the right of Government bodies to eavesdrop on citizens and conduct mass surveillance. Awareness about the potential technical vulnerabilities of these databases and carefully-drafted clauses in the proposed data protection law is a great place to start. The citizen database generation has met with opposition and resistance in many countries around the world for fear of breach of privacy, data misuse, Government agencies controlling personal data and overwhelming powers to the authorities. In India a database — the largest in the world at 1.3 billion — has already been created and interlinked with other data sources for the purpose of good governance and e-services. As seen all around the world, data empower authorities to track, control and help/harass people out of social and political motivation. In the event of lack of legal provisions for protection, citizens may land up in situations of privacy breaches and bureaucratic tangles. Without a data privacy Bill conforming to global gold standards in place, the country may see many more uprisings and seething groups of people with complains against the ruling party.

Beside the continued analysis of prudence of the exceptions created in the Bill, the general apprehension is of data security. Massive databases always invite security breaches and a biometrics database interlinked with more than one data sources is a gold mine of sensitive data, vulnerable to exploitation. Such a data breach is not just costly, it may be irreversible as you cannot change your fingerprints or irises like you do your passwords.

Incidents of leaks from various Government databanks, including the Aadhaar card database and from public sector banks, are on the rise. Hence, linking these databases to social media sites and other data sources for various Government programmes and schemes is alarming, even when implemented with the motive of a greater community good.

The Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) and the State Resident Data Hub (SRDH) store acutely sensitive personal information of citizens, including their biometrics. Any individual or a body having illegal access to this database can jeopardise the citizens and national security. Citizenship database systems can also create incentives for identity theft and be used for nefarious purposes by criminals/terrorists. Identity theft in India has been one of the fastest-growing White Collar crimes and each one of us, using the internet and being a part of the massive Government databases, is vulnerable. Identity theft and cloning are two sides of the same coin and can be used to steal financial assets as well as frame an innocent citizen for a crime he/she did not commit.

Misconfigured databases and lack of end-to-end encryption are common causes leading to breaches in massive databases which have been seen in India and in countries like Turkey, Ecuador and a few others. All leaks were precipitated by erroneous technical maintenance.

At the worst, such leaks may put children in danger of kidnapping/extortion/abuse as addresses and other vital personal information and details are disclosed.

The possibility of generating national IDs and using them to enforce immigration laws has been another existing concern as minorities in countries like China, Germany and the European Union among others have been targetted. The principal source of data — its number and quality — depends on the country’s census. And in the light of availability of fraudulent documents, right from Aadhaar card, driving licence to ration cards, we are not sure the available data in the last census and surveys are all genuine or belong to lawful citizens. False data and lack of right documentary proof from the people applying to be incorporated in the legacy citizen database (digitised database) in Assam were some of the major causes of failure of the NRC (National Register of Citizens) or the clause around the foreigners issue of the Assam Accord of 1985.

Subsequent to the Assam experience, the general population is now beset with the apprehension that the NPR will pave the way for a nationwide NRC. The amended questionnaire of the updated NPR is somewhat in alignment with such thinking, as this is tilted towards the ethno survey design as done in the US to identify illegal immigrants. An ethno survey is designed to yield high quality multi-faceted data on the process of international/illegal migration. It helps in sorting the immigrants living in a country to determine who are most likely to be unauthorised by looking at where they were born, when they came to India, how old they are, how they are related to other people in their households and so on.

Besides big data sources — social media content, internet activity and mobile phone-based sources — the country’s health systems have been used as a source of data on undocumented migrants in various nations. Until 2010, the British Government introduced a series of measures to make access to public services difficult for migrants and the National Health Service was directed to enforce immigration controls, which included a requirement to inform immigration authorities of people suspected of being in the country illegally. This measure is now being withdrawn in the wake of human rights violation issues. Lastly and most importantly, the private sector’s possession of the amount of personal data is alarming as it holds no accountability. We need to be worried about the fact that we have given away more personal data to multinational private corporations than to the Government and there’s no reason for us to believe that private organisations will practice self-regulation and not misuse the personal data that they possess.

Apart from technical giants like Google and Facebook that are collecting our data, we give away private information every time we swipe a credit card. This information is being used by commercial organisations to categorically target users for advertisements. The worst we saw was the Cambridge Analytica scandal that revealed that social media data is being used by political campaigners across the world to influence voters, polarise people of different communities and different political affiliations. I believe that the Government should definitely have the right to collect some personal data but laws should be put in place to ensure that the data is used only for pattern recognition and not for individual profiling. Every company that deals with high volumes of personal data should be mandated to have a data governing body that ensures the firm’s compliance with the law. They must ensure that the employees are adequately trained on sensitive data and a risk-management strategy/contingency plan are put in place to deal with a potential loss/misuse of personal data. The need of the hour, during this time of fear and apprehension around the CAA, NPR and a possible NRC, is creating an atmosphere of trust through communication channels and enabling legal provisions to ensure protection of citizens to avoid any bureaucratic mess while dealing with the massive databases of the masses.

9,04-3-20,CM Yogi has a narrow escape,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had a narrow escape when his SUV hit the fencing on a narrow strip on Brahmanchal Hill in Mathura while returning after offering payers at Barsana on Tuesday.

The driver somehow controlled the vehicle and no one was injured.

Luckily, the driver was driving the SUV at slow speed due to the narrowness of the strip and applied brakes immediately or else the vehicle would have skidded into a trench on the other side of the strip. Later, Yogi left the place to fly back to Lucknow.

Earlier, addressing a Rangotsav programme at

Radha Bihari Inter College in Barsana, Yogi said, “Bankey Bihari Krishna became Radha-Krishna after serving cows. We will not allow these cows to be slaughtered and will not tolerate their abuse. We will protect and promote cows. Medicines and vaccines are being sent to every district to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease and cattle will undergo ear-tagging to identify which animal did not receive the medicine.”

The chief minister further said that his government was giving Rs 900 per month, per cattle head to take care of stray bovines.

Yogi further said that when the Bharatiya Janata Party took over in Uttar Pradesh three years ago, a discussion started on what to do for culture and cultural order.

“There was suggestion of making Braj region a pilgrim centre. Not only was the region made a pilgrim centre but the government also recognised it after which seven sacred sites were refurbished and Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad was set up for development of the region,” he said.

The chief minister said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I have been resolving age old issues. Three years ago, Deepotsav was organised on Deepawali in Ayodhya and it became a spectacle for the entire world.”

“Besides we have achieved success in

cleaning the river Ganga. In the next two years, we must attempt to make Yamuna as clean as the Ganga. These are not just rivers but our cultural heritage and we have motherly bond with them,” the chief minister said.

Yogi assured the people that there would be no hindrance in development work. “Through a systematic action plan, we are working to find a solution to salty water of ‘Braj’ region and also revive and build more and more ponds for water.

Earlier, the chief minister offered prayers at Ladliji temple in Barsana and was feted with a ‘dupatta’, a Radha-Krishna idol and ‘prasadam’. During this time, entry of pilgrims remained suspended for a brief period.

The chief minister also inaugurated a tourist help centre on the hills to facilitate devotes coming for darhsan and also a cow hospital. He also participated in Laddoo Holi at Radha Bihari Inter College.

UP ministers Laxmi Narain Chaudhary, Dr Neelkanth Tewari and Shrikant Sharma accompanied the chief minister during his visit to the temple.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-yogi-has-a-narrow-escape.html
10,04-3-20,Demolition in Sukhna catchment area: UT to approach High Court,"With uncertainty looming over the use of old map and its scale demarcating the catchment area of Sukhna Lake by the Survey of India in 2004, the Chandigarh Administration is likely to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court to resolve the matter.

The HC had on Monday declared Sukhna Lake legal entity and ordered demolition of unauthorised constructions in its catchment area as delineated in the map prepared by the Survey of India in

2004. In a series of directions issued a day before, the HC had directed the Administration to issue notification declaring Sukhna Lake as Wetland under the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 within a period of three months. Apart from this, the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana were also directed to issue necessary notifications for declaring Sukhna as Wetland falling in their respective areas within a period of three months to protect fragile ecology and to support the lake eco system.

The Administration, however, is in a fix over the use of old map, in which the physical features and terrain on the map was done with 1:40000 scale on certain data of 1995-96. In its draft notification for declaring Sukhna Lake as wetland, the UT Administration had used Survey of India’s 2004 map and an objection was raised over the issue of old map with scale of 1:40000.

Following this, the Administration had written to the Survey of India seeking latest map demarcating the catchment area of the man-made water body.

But after Survey of India’s refusal in providing the latest map, the Administration had decided to carry out ground work for demarcation of Sukhna Lake’s catchment area on its own and provide the map with 1:5000 scale. The scale of the map is the ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the ground.

Notably, the HC order issued on Monday was based on Survey of India’s 2004 map of lake’s catchment area.

“The Administration will approach the Court to resolve the issue of map used for demarcating the catchment area of the lake. After the draft notification of lake was issued last year, people had raised objection that an old map has been issued and also, concerns were raised about its visibility,” said a senior officer of UT Administration while talking to The Pioneer.

He said that the Administration has decided to use a latest map with a scale of 1:5000. This would be informed to the HC to resolve the matter. The HC has given three months to the Administration to issue notification declaring Sukhna as wetland, he added.

The rainfed Sukhna Lake was created in 1958 by damning the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Sukhna Hills and was created as a gift to the citizens of Chandigarh for enjoyment of peace and tranquility.

As per the statistics with the Administration, capacity of the lake was 1074.4 hectare metres in 1958 which reduced to 513.28 hectare metres. The water spread area was 228.64 hectares in 1958, which declined to 148.28 hectare in 2005. And,the average depth of the man-made water body was 4.694 meter at embankment level in 1958 which declined to 3.484 meter in 2005.

For the preservation of the Sukhna Lake, the HC has directed the Administration to ensure that the average capacity of the lake is increased by atleast about 100-150 hecatres by one-time large scale desilting (dredging) of the lake.

Thereafter, the capacity once created should be maintained through regular dredging. The states of Punjab, Haryana and the union territory of Chandigarh were directed to lower the storage capacity of the check dams to ensure regular flow of water into Sukhna Lake, the order stated.

The HC had also imposed a cost of Rs 100 crore each on Punjab and Haryana Governments as “exemplary/punitive/special damages” for allowing with impunity construction in catchment area of the lake falling in their jurisdiction.

The states of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were also directed that no waste water or sewage flows into the river from the villages i.e Kansal, Kaimbwala and Saketri

While a letter was recently sent to both the State Governments by Administration to draw their attention to the issue of waste water flowing into the N-Choe and forest area of Chandigarh, no response was received from the neighboring governments.

According to the UT’s report, the sewage flowing into Sukhna Lake forest reserve has been causing damage to the flora and fauna in the area and had earlier led to skin problems in a herd of Sambars inhabiting the area.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/demolition-in-sukhna-catchment-area--ut-to-approach-high-court.html

12,04-3-20,Capt sets Govt’s roadmap for remaining 2 yrs,"Facing fire for alleged inaction from his own party men besides the opposition, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday virtually set the Government’s roadmap for the remaining two years by announcing a slew of decisions for generating employment, ending transport monopoly, bringing new mining policy, and other burning issues.

Days ahead completing three years in power, Capt Amarinder announced 2000 road permits to check transport monopoly, bringing mining policy “very soon”, filling vacancies and meeting shortage of staff in various departments with priority for posts reserved for the SCs and physically disabled, among others.

Chief Minister’s announcements came after several Congress MLAs, during the discussion on the state budget, pointed fingers at the state government’s functioning and delayed approach in taking significant decision harming the state’s interests.

Hailing the decision to revert the retirement age to 58 by ending the optional extension policy, Capt Amarinder declared that the government would hire three against every employee retiring from the government. “A single case of retirement in a high pay scale could help generate jobs for three youth in the lower bracket…This would help us in clearing the backlog we have,” he said.

He said that all the vacancies that will be created as a result of the move would be filled in the next two years, as the Government has already provided 57,000 jobs, including contractual. Chief Minister also announced 5,000 mini bus permits for the youth.

2000 ROUTE PERMITS TO CHECK MONOPOLY

Reiterating the State Government’s commitment to check “monopoly and undue” business in the transport sector, Capt Amarinder announced 2000 route permits for regular 52-seater stage carriage buses during the next two years.

After several MLAs demanded bringing a Transport Policy, the Chief Minister pointed out that the matter was sub-judice but necessary action would be taken as per the directions of the Court, as and when the issue was settled.

He informed the House that following the High Court’s judgment declaring number of permits illegal, the government has issued 142 show cause notices which, after thorough examination, will be cancelled if found illegal. “In addition, 15-day show cause notices is also being issued for another 212 permits and it would also meet the same fate of found illegal,” said the Chief Minister, promising total transparency in issuance of permits, along with all possible steps to break the monopoly in the transport sector.

MORE AMBULANCES FOR STATE

Capt Amarinder also announced his Government’s decision to deepen the ambulances network, through ‘Dial 108’, to ensure quick and effective delivery of health services at the doorstep.

The number of ambulances will be increased from the existing 242 to 400 during the next two years, enabling 24X7 access to ambulance services for every cluster of 30-35 villages, he said.

WHITE PAPER ON POWER DRAFT READY

Maintaining that the draft White Paper on Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous Government was ready, Capt Amarinder said that more work was needed on it before tabling it in the House.

Waving the draft copy of the white paper, Capt Amarinder said that the existing PPAs needed to be thrashed out in detail.

The Chief Minister had, in January this year, announced that the Government would bring out a White Paper to expose the alleged fraud committed by the Akalis in signing the PPAs with private players during their regime.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-sets-govt---s-roadmap-for-remaining-2-yrs.html
13,04-3-20,"All sign boards in Haryana in Hindi, Punjabi languages","Haryana Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar on Tuesday said that the Government is committed to promote Punjabi as second language in the State and in future all sign boards in Haryana will be written in Hindi as well as in Punjabi languages.

The minister was teplying to a question raised by Congress MLA from Assandh (Karnal) Shamsher Singh Gogi in the Assembly regarding total number of offices using Punjabi language in the State.

On Tuesday, the assembly proceedings were held in Punjabi language for about six minutes. It was a special day especially for those who have been continuously pressurising the State government to promote Punjabi language. Though MLAs and ministers from the Sikh community were also present in the House, other MLAs coincidentally participated in the discussion.

Congress MLA Gogi while addressing the House in Punjabi said that the achievement of the BJP government is only that they have ended the services of Punjabi teachers during six years. No sign boards at the offices in Haryana are written in Punjabi languages.

Interrupting, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar replied in Punjabi that the budget has provided for the promotion of Punjabi language and the Punjabi Sahitya Akademi is also functioning well.

The issue was given a new twist by Congress MLA from Jhajjar and former Education Minister Geeta Bhukkal when she spoke supplementary questions while speaking in Punjabi language.

Addressing the Chief Minister and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Bhukkal raised the issue of writing names and posts in Hindi as well as Punjabi outside the offices of all ministers and officials. Bhukkal also raised the issue of separate Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee of Haryana. Currently, this committee is not recognised in Haryana.

When Gujjar was replying in Hindi that the government was promoting Punjabi language, Bhukkal quipped that the cause would be netter served if the minister answers in Punjabi.

Gujjar said that the government has taken a big decision towards promoting Punjabi language. The state government has announced that in future all sign boards in Haryana will be written in Hindi as well as Punjabi language.

14,04-3-20,Congress MLAs disrupt proceedings in Assembly,"Congress MLAs on Tuesday disrupted proceedings of the Haryana assembly after their protest march was stopped by security personnel at some distance away from the entrance to the Vidhan Sabha complex. The legislators were taking out a protest march against the BJP-JJP government when they were stopped near the civil secretariat parking by the security personnel.

The security personnel said they were ordered by Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta not to allow any protesting legislator carry any hoarding, banner or placards inside. After being detained there for nearly 15 minutes, the Congress MLAs were allowed to proceed when Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda assured them that they never intended to carry placards inside the House. As soon as the legislators entered the Vidhan Sabha, they disrupted the question hour for about 20 minutes. Hooda objected to being stopped at the gate near the parking lot, claiming it was ""an illegal and undemocratic step"".

""We were not going to enter the House with placards and posters, then why we were stopped there? You have to protect our rights,"" he told the Chair, demanding that a map be shown to him to clarify from where the Vidhan Sabha complex''s boundary starts. Though the speaker told them that it was his verbal order that no one should be allowed to carry posters, banners or hoarding inside, the Congress MLAs raised slogans, saying the Government was ""acting in a dictatorial manner"".

In response to the Congress protest, BJP MLAs raised the slogan of ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"". As the ruckus prevailed, Home Minister Anil Vij intervened and reminded the Congress MLAs how during their rule, BJP legislators ""were often named and not allowed to enter the Vidhan Sabha"". ""Whatever happened with you today is very good, you should remember your time too,"" Vij told them. As the Congress legislators rushed to the Well of the House, Speaker told them not to break discipline.

Hooda pointed out that the security staff had not shown them any written orders, to which the speaker told him that if they had given prior intimation about their protest, he would have had time to issue orders in writing. On the speaker telling the Opposition that even some members of the public could have entered the premises due to the protest, Congress leader Geeta Bhukkal said, ""It is a matter of shame that this Government, which has failed on the law and order front, thinks anti-social elements could mingle with the legislators."" The Congress MLAs resumed their seats when the speaker assured them that their rights will always remain protected.

Earlier led by former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and senior party leaders Kiran Choudhary and Geeta Bhukkal, the Congress MLAs held a protest against the state government over ""unkept promises"" and various alleged scams. The Congress MLAs after alighting from their cars nearly one kilometre away from the assembly complex, took out a protest march. Carrying placards and posters, they raised slogans against the state government, accusing it of not ordering any probe against the alleged paddy and mining scams.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-mlas-disrupt-proceedings-in-assembly.html

18,04-3-20,UP eyeing top global firms for its Defence Manufacturing Corridor,"The Uttar Pradesh government is mulling ways to sell its Defence Manufacturing Corridor to top global firms following the signing of defence deals worth $3 billion by India and US during US President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to the country.

The state government plans to organise a conclave of top global defence and military hardware manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, Airbus, Boeing, CAE etc, in Lucknow after Holi festival.

In the recent DefExpo-2020, the state government had signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with 23 private companies for investments worth Rs 50,000 crore in the Defence Manufacturing Corridor.

As India aims to achieve $5-billion defence exports in the next five years, the UP government is looking to become a major hub of military hardware and aviation manufacturing, thereby contribute to the ambitious federal target.

“We are planning to organise a meeting with representatives of top defence manufacturers next month. The dates would be finalised after the conclusion of the ongoing legislature session,” Industrial Development Minister Satish Mahana had said.

31,04-3-20,Deaf boy of poor family of 15 siblings brought out of penury,"A 21-year-old Muslim boy in Bhawanipatna who is hearing-impaired and born to a poor family of 15 siblings, could be brought to the mainstream of life.

Arif is the second child of his parents Ibrahim Ali (55) and Mahjabi Khatun (42). Ibrahim is a garment seller, locally known as pheriwalla. Ibrahim and Mahjabi’s total 15 children are within 5 to 22 years of age and all are living in their below the poverty line (BPL) rented make shift household in Nabapada, near Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium adjacent to LIC office in Bhawanipatna at a monthy house rent of Rs 2,000 which is quite difficult to accommodate a dozen of family members.

Arif now works in Bhubaneswar, after undergoing skill development training.

Poverty, social rejection, ineffective public policy implementation and role of State in uplliftment are at crossroads in case of this family, who originally is from Bihar but settled in Bhawanipatna years ago.

Arif’s childhood was spent amidst acute poverty and neglect. Living in a small makeshift house without education was a nightmare for him. The family was not sound enough for treatment for Arif even. He took admission in a Government school but his special character (deaf) impaired his life miserably till he was discovered by his mentor and social worker Suraj and Smita Tripathy, chairperson of Gurukul Foundation.

Arif’s family was convinced by the two activists and also explained to Arif’s local teacher and district administration officials about free boarding, lodging and skill development training scopes in Bhubaneswar. Arif was later admitted to sewing machine operator trade of skill training being funded through SIPDA programme of DEPwD under Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in Government of India.

Arif completed 270 hours of training in SMO trade and scored more than 90 percent marks in the assessment, said SCPwD director (operations) Debasish Panda, who coordinated it.

After completion of training, Arif joined in the Gram Tarang Employability Training Centre (GTETS) apparel designing and production center as a trainee to prepare all types of costumes and dresses for students with a token salary of Rs 7,000 per month, said Partha Sarathi Mohanty, production incharge and GM, GTETS.

While working in GTETS which is located inside the premises of Centurion University, Bhubaneswar, Arif became aware of higher studies and saved some money to join in secondary school courses of Government of India’s National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) which has a study centre in Centurion University, said Prof SupriyaPatnaik, Vice Chancellor, Centurion University.

Arif joined there and he came across another long term skill development training programme of one year being funded by HPCL.

Now Arif has been selected as the group leader with higher perks and responsibility which added to his self confidence, said Suraj, his mentor.

Arif also learned various games, yoga, physical exercises, meditation and cleanliness etc along with residential skill training.

""We have been focusing on skill training of special children who are away from a career path or self determination,"" said Prof Mukti Mishra, president Centurion University who created a niche for such special persons irrespective of any caste, creed, sex or religion in the age group of 15 to 59 years encompassing persons from cyclone ravaged areas to that of highly impoverished forest dominated inaccessible Maoist affected areas in Odisha and eastern India.

""We have no words to express our profound gratitude to almighty who through Arif’s mentor, training centre and job provider enabled Arif with a ray of hope to live a life with dignity. God has given me all these including Arif and 14 other children. Let God show the right path and education. Arif should help people, society, respect parents, family and others,"" said Mahjabi, Arif’s mother with teary eyes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/deaf-boy-of-poor-family-of-15-siblings-brought-out-of-penury.html
32,04-3-20,State to have direct control over pvt security agencies,"The State Government would set up a direct controlling mechanism to handle the private security agencies, which are having a mushrooming growth due to ever-increasing financial activities.

The Government would appoint a Controlling Authority (CA) in the Department of Home for handling the regulatory mechanism for these agencies. The Controlling Authority would not only improve the regulatory system but also ensure development of the security environment for these institutions.

The Private Security Agencies Regulation (PSAR) Act, 2005 empowers the State Governments to appoint the Controlling Authorities and, accordingly, the Odisha Government would put in place such a CA soon, sources said.

While earlier senior police officers were appointed as Controlling Authority of the private security agencies, now it has been decided to post senior officers serving in Department of Home as CA so that it would be in consonance with the PSAR Act.

It has been observed that some of the State Governments have appointed senior police officers as CAs, but it is not in sync with the provisions of the law, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has pointed out.

The Ministry wants that this responsibility needs to be directly handled by a State Government’s Home Department. So, the State Governments have been impressed upon appointment of CAs as per the statute at sufficiently senior level officer in Home Department rather than entrusting the responsibility to police.

Meanwhile, the Union Government has recently formulated Model Rules of PSAR Act, namely, The Private Security Agencies (Private Security to Cash Transportation Activities) Rules. The rules have been framed to check the incidents of attacks on cash vans and risk of large volumes of cash falling into the hands of unwanted elements.

The purpose of the Model Rules is to enforce safety and security requirements such as designing of the cash vehicle, number of staffs and guards to be deployed in a vehicle, checking up of their antecedents before giving them employment, proper training requirement of staffs, and how much money to be carried in a vehicle and sizes of private vaults and their operations.

The rules prescribe the operation timing for transporting cash through the cash vans.

Now, the Odisha Government would frame the rules as per PSAR Act. After the rules are framed, the State Government would give a deadline of six months to the private agencies handling cash.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has requested the State Governments for early notification and enforcement of the Model Rules. This issue was reportedly raised in the Eastern Zonal Council (EZC) meeting in Bhubaneswar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-to-have-direct-control-over-pvt-security-agencies.html

Following this, she lost her mental stability. This is narrated by one of Lakshmipriya’s former colleagues of the school.

According to Pureena, a priest, Lakshmipriya has been begging on the Badadanda for past 10 years. “Once I asked her to help her out and provide her a house. But she refused the offer and said Lord Jagannath’s blessings are with her.”

Asked about her condition, Lakshmipriya alleged that her relatives hatched a conspiracy and damaged her eyes.

40,04-3-20,"7 yrs on, woman presumed killed by hubby appears","A woman presumed to be dead was found alive with her paramour after seven years of her mysterious disappearance.

But due to faulty inquiry, the husband of the woman was earlier arrested by Patkura police and was forced to languish in jail on the alleged charges of killing his wife.

The woman was rescued recently by Patkura police from Pipili. Meanwhile, the rescued woman is the mother of two children and has been leading a conjugal life with her paramour.

According to Patkura police station IIC Sujit Pradhan, Itishree Moharana alias Mili of Samagola village under Kujanga police station had tied knot in 2013 with Abhaya Sutar, son of Gandharba Sutar, of Chaulia village under Patkura police limits. After a fortnight of the marriage, Mili had gone to her father’s house with her husband and she later informed to her family that she had been facing torture from her husband and in-laws for more dowry.

Later, Prahallad Moharana managed to send his daughter back to her in-laws house. But, on the same night Mili went on missing mysteriously. Though, Abhaya and his family members later made frantic search ,but failed to trace Mili.

On the basis of Prahallad's FIR, Patkura police had arrested Abhaya for killing his wife on August 18, 2013 whereas Abhaya’s other family members managed to get bail from the Orissa High Court.

However, after Abhaya’s release from jail, he decided to search his wife on his own.

On a tip-off, a police team led by the Kendrapada SP conducted raid at Pipili and managed to rescue Mili along with her paramour Rajib Lochan Moharana of Badapada village under Choudwar police station. They along with their two children were produced before the SDJM Court.

Meanwhile, rights activist Pratap Kumar Mohanty filed a petition before the NHRC alleging that due to faulty investigation of police, Abhaya was jailed. He prayed before the NHRC to direct a Crime Branch inquiry into the case and ask the SP of Kendrapada to submit an action taken report within four weeks, besides Rs 10 lakh compensation to the victim.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/7-yrs-on--woman-presumed-killed-by-hubby-appears.html

48,04-3-20,"Hill clearing, tree felling rampant in Dhenkanal","Cutting of trees in foothill of Paniohala at Dhenkanal town has been continuing rampantly since long. Curiously, the revenue officials, forest officials and police are behaving like mute spectators.

One retired revenue official told that unknown persons were clearing the trees with machine during late night at the foothill of Paniohala existing in south Madhuban in Dhenkanal.

After clearing the hill, the earth and timbers are lifted by trucks in a clandestine manner. The retired revenue officer on condition of ananimity said cutting of Paniohala hill and trees in such illegal process was not only a heavy loss to the State exchequer but would lead to landslide and environmental hazards.

Even though the residents near the foothill could not sleep the entire night, due to the sound of machines and trucks, no one dares to protest. It appears everything is happening under the very nose of police, forest and revenue officials.

57,04-3-20,"Coalition partners laud Budget, AJSU calls it ‘unrealistic’","The coalition partners in the Hemant Soren-led Government lauded the first annual State Budget tabled by Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon on Tuesday, calling it a development-oriented, far-sighted and holistic Budget that would immensely benefit farmers and people from the lower strata of the society. However, AJSU Party, which sits on the opposition bench, found the Budget ‘unrealistic’ and ‘unfair’ on the several thousand contractual workers who were expecting regularization of services.

Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) Working President Keshav Mahato said that the Budget will help combat poverty, address unemployment and prove to be a boon for farmers. “The Government has come up with a holistic budget. Decisions such as waiving off farmers’ loans and giving up to 100 units of free electricity are historical and well-meaning,” Mahato said.

Three parties – Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) – are partners in the recently-elected Government here. Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon’s announcement about the Government’s proposal to waive off loans of up to Rs 2 lakh on farmers during his budget speech is in accordance with the Congress party’s election manifesto. It is also a leaf out of Congress-led Chhattisgarh, another tribal-dominated State of Eastern India. The Government’s proposal to give free electricity of up to 100 units and other freebies like ‘Dhoti/Lungi, Saree’ scheme have been widely accepted by political parties.

Given the condition of the State exchequer, this budget is historical in many ways, said JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.

The budget, he said, focused on employment, education, health, agriculture, drinking water and Roti, Kapda Makan – the basic necessities of people.

“The budget is historical if we consider the condition of the exchequer,” he said, adding that the former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP led Government only came up with budgets in favour of “contractors” and this budget was the first budget that targets the welfare of commoners. “This is our first step towards achieving the targets that we have set for the next five years. It will form the foundation for State’s progress and growth,” Bhattacharya said.

AJSU Party General Secretary Lambodar Mahato, however, spotted lacunae in the budget, and claimed that the JMM did not come up with any decision on the several thousand contractual workers in Jharkhand. “While the Government has been repeatedly complaining about the lack of funds in the exchequer, it has not come up with any measures to address the fund crunch,” said Mahato, who is one of the two AJSU Party legislators in the 81-member Assembly.

AJSU Party chief Sudesh Mahto said that the budget fails to fulfill the promises made by the ruling parties in their respective election manifestos. The budget, he added, does not aim to address the poor condition of the State exchequer and is disappointing for industrialists.

“The budget is not in accordance with the manifesto which helped the parties win the elections,” he said.

Addressing media persons at Congress Bhavan on Tuesday, JPCC Working President Rajesh Thakur said that the budget will benefit people from the lower strata of the society and help in their uplift. “The budget is pro-people and it will benefit the poor, especially the farmer of the State,” said Thakur.0",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coalition-partners-laud-budget--ajsu-calls-it----unrealistic---.html
58,04-3-20,Budget Session of State Assembly commences on stormy note,"The Congress MLAs created ruckus on the opening day of the budget session of Uttarakhand assembly even as the many organisations held demonstrations outside the assembly on Tuesday.

As soon as the proceedings of the assembly started with the Governor Baby Rani Maurya reading her address, the Congress MLAs marched to the well of the house and raised slogans against the state government.

The Congress accused the government of being anti people and anti farmer and demanded that Gairsain should be declared as permanent capital of Uttarakhand. The pandemonium was such that no one could hear the address of the governor.

The deputy leader of the Congress legislature party, Karan Mahra, Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat and Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami were more vociferous in their protest.

The Congress MLAs also tried to push their way to the chair but were prevented by the marshals. Congress MLA, Harish Dhami was seen pounding the desk of official writers of Vidhan Sabha. The governor took 40 minutes to complete her address.

Later talking to the media persons, Karan Mahra said that BJP government has failed to fulfill the promises it had made to the people of Uttarakhand in governor’s address of the past.

He said that it was promised in the governor’s address of 2018 that the dues of the sugarcane farmers would be paid within 26 days but even after two years, the farmers are still waiting for their dues to be cleared.

He said that the BJP government had promised that it would set up the institution of the Lokayukt within 100 days of assuming office but no decision on this important issue is being taken even after three years.

Mahra said that the unemployed, farmers, employees and all sections of the society are being neglected by the government and the district development authorities are creating problems for the people. He also questioned the short duration of the assembly and said that by holding session for only five days, the government has made a mockery of its legislative functions.

Congress MLA, Manoj Rawat accused the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat of running away from questions during the assembly session. He said that the sessions of the assembly are strategically convened to ensure that the questions related to the departments headed by CM never come up during question hour. He said that the state government should declare Gairsain as the permanent capital of Uttarakhand.

However, the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the Congress party has no agenda and it has created disturbance during the address of governor just to hide its failures. He said that the state government would present a very good budget.

The parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that the behaviour of Congress MLAs shows that they are not associated with the issues of public interests.

61,04-3-20,Police to seize Dhullu’s properties,"Police have decided to seek court’s permission for seizing properties of absconding Baghmara MLA Dhullu Mahto if the legislator does not surrender by the end of this week, Dhanbad Senior Superintendent of Police Kishore Kaushal said on Tuesday. Mahto, who faces charges of land-grabbing, molestation and extortion, has been absconding since February 19.

“We will seek the court’s permission for seizing his (Mahto) property and assets if the legislator does not surrender by the end of this week,” said Kishore, adding that the police have been raiding different locations to nab Mahto, but he has remained traceless since an arrest warrant was issued against the legislator.

Mahto is a two-time legislator, and he managed to retain his Baghmara seat despite an anti-incumbency wave in Jharkhand during the 2019 Assembly polls.

His political career has been riddled with controversies so far. While the arrest warrant issued on February 19 was in connection with a land-grabbing case, the legislator is also an accused in cases of molestation and extortion, police said. “We will issue arrest warrants in all cases in which he is an accused and arrest him at the earliest,” said the SSP.

Mahto managed to escape from his residence in Dhanbad on February 19 minutes before a police team raided his Chitahi-based bungalow to arrest the legislator. Police, however, arrested four of his aides, who are being interrogated. Mahto’s supporters tried to stop policemen from performing their duty and also raised a ruckus over the raid. Several local women carrying brooms in their hands blocked the way of the cops and created hurdles in the process of the raid. “He is an accused in more than one case, and we will take all necessary steps to charge him under the relevant sections of the IPC,” said Kishore.

Dhanbad police in February lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Mahto in connection with an extortion case of June 2018.

Earlier in November 2018, a member of the BJP’s women’s wing had accused Mahto of molestation. She even alleged that the MLA had tried to rape her. And when she had resisted and didn’t give in to his sexual advances, she had been threatened, she said. Following which the woman had gone to Katras Police station to lodge an FIR against Mahto. However, the police did not act on her complaint.

Later, she lodged an online FIR. However, no action was taken on the online complaint, following which she moved to Jharkhand High Court, which on August 28, 2019, ordered Jharkhand police to lodge an FIR against Mahto.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-to-seize-dhullu---s-properties.html

The police have even charged and arrested some people for the scam, so how the government can validate this recruitment exam is questionable. It is obvious that the government is trying to save some of its own officials who are involved in this scam because such kinds of frauds are deeply rooted in the system of the government which cannot proceed further without the involvement of government officials from the inner circle.”

“We are protesting for more than two weeks for the annulment of the forest guard recruitment exam but no response has been given by the State Government. We were even sent to prison for our protest but the government is not ready even to respond to us.

71,04-3-20,MP reiterates focus on wildlife & tourism,"Madhya Pradesh has reiterated its focus on wildlife tourism and strengthening its ongoing efforts towards combating the threats of climate change and global warming by focusing on wildlife conservation and upliftment of forest dwellers.

The state will also be focusing on creating favourable conditions for the conservation of tigers especially the endangered Bengal Tiger and the rare White Tiger. Madhya Pradesh ranks first in the country with 526 tigers as per the results of the All India Tiger Assessment declared on July 29, 2019.

Sustained tiger conservation efforts have paid rich dividends in Madhya Pradesh where the population of the big cat registered a healthy rise of 218 in four years from 308 tigers in 2014 to 526 in the 2018 census. The State has 6 Tiger Reserves (combining parts of National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries) namely Kanha, Pench, Satpura, Bandhavgarh, Panna and Sanjay.

The state also plans to create around 11 more protected areas within the state from the current numbers of 24 Wildlife Sanctuaries and 11 National parks. The new areas, covering over 2,100 sq. km, represent perhaps the largest addition of protected areas attempted by any state in the past three decades.

According to Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Secretary, Madhya Pradesh Tourism and Managing Director, Madhya Pradesh Tourism Board, “Madhya Pradesh is referred to as wildlife state of India with numerous sanctuaries and reserves. At a time where the numbers of many animal species are declining, Madhya Pradesh has played a pivotal part in India’s wildlife conservation programs.

As the World Wildlife Day approaches on 3rd March, we would like to reiterate our commitment to protecting endangered wildlife, especially tigers through a scientific, planned and people-centric approach with strict enforcement guidelines and team support.”

From preserving tiger population, to being the state with the highest leopard, vultures and gharial (an ‘endemic’ crocodile species) population to having successfully increased the population of the highly endangered Barasingha (a hard ground swamp deer), Madhya Pradesh has come a long way in protecting the natural order and habitat for animals. It has implemented many important conservation policies and ensured a crackdown on poaching, he added.

6 of the 11 National Parks of Madhya Pradesh are also integrated with Project Tiger, a conservation programme that was launched in 1973 by the Central Government when the tiger numbers had dwindled so dramatically that there were fears that the big cat was in danger of extinction. The government had sanctioned INR 92 crores CFA specially to promote the wildlife circuit at Mukundpur, Bandhavgarh & Pench in 2015-16.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mp-reiterates-focus-on-wildlife---tourism.html

77,04-3-20,BJP terms Budget as anti-people,"BJP legislative party leader and former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi has described Hemant Soren government’s first budget as complete disappointment and an effort by State Government to befool people of State. The BJP leader termed the budget as big disappointment for rural populace such as farmers and labourers, unemployed youths and others.

Marandi said that the Government, which talked about the welfare of poor and tribals did not even make any effort to increase man-days (a day regarded in terms of the amount of work that can be done by one person within this period) of MGNREGA workers.

He said, “Today the labourers who come to work from the village have to return due to lack of work. Majority of such labourers are from scheduled caste and scheduled tribes community.” The former Chief Minister demanded the government to increase the daily wage under MNREGA upto Rs 300 so that farmers and labourers are benefitted.

Marandi also termed the Government announce to waive farmers loan as a hoax. He said, “Millions of farmers have been cheated by limiting the farm loan waiver to its category and scope. Apart from this, the Soren Government has dashed their hopes by announcing the closure of the Krishi Ashirvad Yojana, the pump set distribution scheme run by the Raghubar Das Government.”

The BJP leader said that the budget has disappointed the youth and unemployed youths. “The unemployed youths were expecting unemployment allowance in accordance with the election promises, but they have cheated,” said Marandi.

By not announcing the pay scale to the para teachers, the Government has even cheated the para teachers. Marandi said that agriculture is the biggest employment generating sector, but the Government has allocated only Rs 3000 crore has failed the address the needs of farmers.

He said that by allocating only Rs 10 crores for technical education for students it indicates that technical education is not priority of State Government.

State BJP president Deepak Prakash too has slammed the budget saying that the budget appears to be inexperience and anti-development.

Prakash said that the budget will slow down the pace of development and it will adversely affect rural economy such as farmers, laborers, youth and others.

The Hemant Soren Government on Tuesday presented its first budget in the State Assembly and announced farm loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 and 100-unit free power besides stating that all residents will be covered under medical treatment for up to Rs 5 lakh. The BJP had boycotted the budget.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-terms-budget-as-anti-people.html

Before the start of Assembly proceedings, the BJP MLAs staged a protest outside the House and reiterated their demand for making Marandi as Leader of Opposition. The BJP MLAs holding placards attacked Soren government for creating obstacles in making Marandi as Leader of Opposition. Meanwhile, the speaker called an all party meet to end the deadlock over leader of opposition issue.

BJP MLA from Godda, Amit Mandal protesting against State Government even tore the white paper released by government on Monday. The Godda MLA described the white paper as a bundle of lies.

Mandal citing the Economic Survey Report released by the government said that in the survey report it is clearly written on page 3 that the growth rate of Jharkhand has been 6.9 per cent. “In the era of global recession, the State's growth rate is higher than the average, it shows that the State has developed. Then how is the government saying in its white paper that the condition of the state is poor,” said Mandal.

The Assembly for last three days has been witnessing ruckus with BJP members demanding Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto to accord leader of opposition (LoP) status to Babulal Marnadi. The state government on Monday passed the supplementary budget of Rs 1214.94 crore amidst ruckus created by BJP lawmakers.

80,04-3-20,"City residents hail Budget, call it a complete package for State","The State budget presented by the Jharkhand State Finance Minister Rameshwar Oran for the financial year 2020-21, has bought immense satisfactions to the common man of Ranchi. From housewives and travel agents to people from various backgrounds have hailed the various provisions provided,

“The Government has fixed employment of 50,000 people in the tourism sector. If the Government is able to achieve this, it can be a huge asset to the State.

The effort being made to promote tourism in Jharkhand is quite commendable. The introduction of ‘Kailash Mansarovar Yatra’ along with rupees one lakh being given to the travellers will enable the common man to make the trip.

Jharkhand tourism has a lot of potential and the efforts being made to promote and utilize it will be worth it in the long run,” said Rakesh Jain from a travel agency Ghumojee.com.

“The most attractive thing is the effort being taken for the Hindu community is of sending them to ‘Kailash Mansarovar Yatra’ and giving them the subsidy. This is a new scheme floated in Jharkhand and people of the State will benefit from it.

A lot of focus has been made on rural development instead of it being a city centric budget.

Various projects like ‘check dams’ which will help farmers have also been focused on. They have almost touched people across all corners in an attempt to fulfill all their promises,” said Amritansh Vtas, Jharkhand High Court Advocate.

CS Preeti Garodia, Director Advance Commerce Academy feels focus of the budget is on health, farmers, youth and of course the tribals. “The Jharkhand Government budget is all of Rs 86,000 Crore. Households using less than 300 units of electricity will be given 100 free units which is appreciable.

Setting of 100 mohalla clinics, increasing the salary of

specialist doctors working in rural areas by 40,000 per month will also yield positive results.

Farmer loans of up to Rs 2 Lakh have been excused but I feel farmers should be made to use updated technology, interest friendly loans is a better move.”

“Government has paid attention to al the sectors. More focus should have been given to the basic infrastructure of the State capital. Condition of the roads is extremely poor, which is a major cause of accidents.

Provisions for installing CCTV cameras should be made which is essential for the safety of women. The condition of Government schools and other institutions is not up to the mark so proper funding should be done in this sector as well. Malnutrition is very high in Jharkhand.

State should also focus on the nourishment of children as they are the future,” said Shilpi Singh, faculty member at TIME.

“A pro people budget has been made by the newly made government of Hemant Soren. It is heavily influenced by the Kejriwal style of politics and is very populistic.

Giving 100 free units will help those below the poverty line.

Efforts have been made to increase tourism. A 300 bed cancer hospital is a very good step and much required. Opening two cold storages in every district will help the food processing industries.

No new taxes have been imposed and the average Jharkhand will be very happy with the budget,” said Sunil Verma, a City based investment consultant.

“I think the present government has considered the various factors before laying down the budget.

In its endeavour to boost healthcare, the State has allocated funds for the establishment of mohalla clinics which is a great initiative.

However, it should have taken women healthcare separately as disease like anemia is very common among the adult females of Jharkhand and proper allocation of funds in the sector would help in fighting it. It also works for the betterment of the middle class by allocating 100 units of free electricity,” said home maker Mukti Singh.0",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-residents-hail-budget--call-it-a-complete-package-for-state.html

Bhagat said, “This Assembly session is important in many ways especially as it is being held in Gairsain, which the BJP has stated in its Sankalp Patra, will be made the summer capital of Uttarakhand. This is also the budget session which is very important as it is. By holding the budget session of the Assembly in Gairsain, the government has given a befitting reply to the Congress and other opponents spreading misinformation about the government. This has once again exposed the propaganda of the opposition,” opined Bhagat.

The governor had to complete her address amidst the din raised by Congress members, which has once again exposed the irresponsible attitude of the Congress members, he said.

96,04-3-20,"Cong MLAs score self goals, take on their own Govt","Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday virtually turned into a playfield for the Congress MLAs to score goals against their own team.

As the growing resentment within the Congress cadres regarding non-fulfillment of the key poll promises is not unknown, the party legislators minced no words to take on their own Government head on in the House.

While the State Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa openly admitted the Government and Punjab Police’s “weakness” for not putting SAD MLA Bikram Majithja behind bars, senior leader Surjit Singh Dhiman highlighted the large scale corruption in Government offices.

That is not all! Congress firebrand MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring showed the mirror to the State Government by asking the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to soon control transport and sand mafia as no Budget will help the Congress in the next elections if these promises are not fulfilled.

Warring, the two-time MLA from Gidderbaha, pointed that the Congress MLAs have to face embarrassment and humiliation when the people ask them why the Congress had not ended the liquor, transport, and sand mafia in the State.

“I request the Chief Minister and the Finance Minister with folded hands to please implement the transport policy at the earliest as the Government is on back foot on this issue. Every day someone from this side (treasury benches) or from that side (from opposition) stands up and raises the issue…this mafia should come to an end,” said Warring adding that at least 200 buses should have been announced to check the mafia.

“Kindly fulfill your commitment of giving 5000 licences to the young people to run their own buses under ‘Yaari Enterprises’ announced in the first budget,” he said in the Capt Amarinder’s presence.

Participating in the debate on Budget proposals for 2020-21, Warring pointed out at the Rs 600 less excise collections in Punjab while demanding to fix the responsibility of officers for the same. “We are being questioned on why the liquor is most expensive in Punjab, but excise collections are less. It is because the officers appointed by the Government are not accountable.

I have learnt that distilleries in the State are only selling eight trucks without paying taxes, for every two trucks that tax is paid. This is because the officers here do nothing,” he said, amidst approval by the MLAs from both sides.

Taking up the issue of trauma centre for Gidderbaha, announced in the previous Budget, Warring said that the project is yet to see the light of the day as the officers are not doing the work even after the Minister (Balbir Singh) Sidhu’s numerous directions. “Isn’t it the Chief Secretary’s responsibility to check. But the Chief Secretary do nothing other than raising objection on all files,” he said in an emotionally-charged speech.

Recommending that the Government should allow “open mining”, Warring alleged that people in Punjab are talking about a Rajasthan-based sand contractor, referring to him as “Chandak daku”, who now controls the sand mining business.

“You are the ‘Babbar sher’ of Punjab. I urge you to act against all the mafias as this is a huge embarrassment for the Government,” said Warring amidst the thumping of benches, not only by several Congress MLAs, but also by the entire Opposition.

Concluding his speech, Warring underlined that in case the Government did not check these mafias before the 2022 elections, “gal nai banani chaahe jo marzi Budget le aao…”(It would not help no matter what kind of budget you propose).

Earlier during the zero hour when SAD MLA Bikram Majithia blamed Randhawa for patronizing gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, lodged in State’s jail, Randhawa made no bones while saying that it was the “weakness of our own Government”, and that of Punjab Police that people like Majithia were not put behind bars.

Earlier, Congress MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman also highlighted the large scale corruption in the Government offices, while demanding the Government to look into this immediately. “The policies are not being framed in accordance with the party’s pre-poll promises,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-mlas-score-self-goals--take-on-their-own-govt.html

116,04-3-20,Chicken sale down by 50%,"Coronavirus is weighing on Indian poultry sector in a more negative way. With fresh suspected cases detected in the country, many people have stopped buying and consuming chicken.

This has led to fall in demand of chicken in the country. The prices of broiler chicken have also come down to Rs 35-40 per kg from Rs 90 per kg in January 2020 in Delhi and NCR areas. According to poultry farmers, chicken sales in India have come down over 50 per cent and prices dented by 20-30 per cent in the last one week. Presently, chicken is being sold between Rs 150-180 a kg depending on the locality from Rs 200-220 a kg in January.

Nasir Alvi president of Ghazipur Fish and Chicken market said the wholesale prices of chicken have crashed due to an abrupt drop in demand. “The supply has also reduced to 50 percent. The sale has been declined 25-30 in the market due to Coronavirus as buyers are not coming. Presently only 50-60 trucks come daily in Ghazipur mandi as compared to 125-150 trucks daily in December,” Alvi said. The cost of broiler chicken production is Rs 75 per kg.

119,04-3-20,No decision on Muslim quota yet: Uddhav,"In a clear reflection of the fact that all the three ruling MVA constituents were not on the same page on crucial issues, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said here on Tuesday that while his Government had not taken any decision on giving reservations to Muslims in educational institutions, it was setting up an experts’ committee to study the issues relating to the National Population Register (NPR).

Addressing a news conference in the run-up to the MVA government completing 100 days in office, Uddhav said that the Muslim reservations proposal had not yet come before the state Government for a decision, while his Government would take a decision on the implementation of NPR in the state on the basis of recommendations of an experts’ committee to be appointed to examine the issues relating to it.

Uddhav’s comment on the Muslim reservations issue should be seen in the context of an announcement made by Maharashtra Minorities Affairs Minister Nawab Malik of the NCP February 27 that the state government would soon come out with a legislation according 5 per cent reservations to Muslims in educational institutions in the state.

Similarly, his Uddhav’s statement on NPR should be seen in the backdrop of his own conditional support to it, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s statement the State Assembly need not pass a resolution CAA and NPR as Maharashtrians had nothing to fear from them and the Congress’ consistent stand that it is opposed to CAA, NPR and NRC.

Responding to questions relating to Muslim reservations, Uddhav said at the news conference: “The Muslim reservations issue has not come up before the state government. When the issue has not come before us, the question of our taking a decision on (5 per cent) reservations to Muslims in educational institutions does arise”.

When asked about the announcement about the reservations to Muslims made by NCP Minister in the State Legislative Council, Uddhav said: “He has not made any announcement as such. As and when the issue comes before the government, we will examine it. You should know that we are in the midst of a litigation in the (Supreme) over reservations to Marathas. Yesterday, I made a statement about reservations to Dhangar community. Let us talk about reservations to Muslims as and when it comes before us”.

“Hence, I would humbly request those clamouring for reservations to Muslim not to waste their energy but save and use the energy when the issue comes up before the state government. The Shiv Sena has not made its stand clear on the issue. My party will take a call when the issue comes up for discussion,” the chief minister said.

On the issue of the State Assembly passing a resolution on CAA and NPR, Uddhav said: “I have said several times before that three parties in the government will take a collective decision on the issue. We are setting up an experts’ committee to study what is in NPR and then we will take a decision... As a chief minister of the state, I would like to reiterate that I would not allow anyone to take away the rights of the citizens in the state”

It may be recalled that in tweets put out on February 18, Uddhav had spelt out the Shiv Sena’s stand on CAA, NRC and NPR. “CAA and NRC are two different subjects. NPR is a third subject. There is nothing to worry about in CAA. NRC has not come and it will not be implemented. If it (NRC) is implemented, it will not affect just Muslims, but it will also affect Hindus, Adivasasis and other deprived sections of the society,” Uddhav had tweeted.

In another tweet on NPR, the chief minister had said: “NPR is more of a census. But, still I will have a look at the questions in the data collection form. But, I do not there is impediment in NPR. Because, the census takes place once in ten years”.

At his press conference on Tuesday, Uddhav confirmed that he was going ahead with his visit to Ayodhya on March 7 on the occasion of his government completing 100 days in office.

Asked if his party’s alliance partners were reacting to his impending visit to Ayodhya, Uddhav said: “Whoever wants to join me to Ayodhya, they can do so. After all God is God. The God’s door is open for all. Whoever wants to join me, they can do so or they can go earlier than me”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-decision-on-muslim-quota-yet--uddhav.html

Earlier, there were no restrictions on outbound shipments of these products.

Apart from paracetamol, vitamin B1, B6 and B12, other APIs and formulations over which the export restrictions have been imposed include tinidazole, metronidazole, acyclovir, progesterone, chloramphenicol, ornidazole, formulations made of chloramphenicol, clindamycin salts, neomycin, and paracetamol.

A notification by the DGFT said the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulations would require licence. “Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs is hereby restricted with immediate effect and till further orders,” the DGFT said in a notification. API is raw material for pharmaceuticals.

Although India is heavily import dependent for APIs from China, it exports a limited quantity of pharma ingredients. The country’s API imports stood at around USD 3.5 billion per year, and around 70 per cent, or USD 2.5 billion, come from China. Restrictions on the exports are important as there would be an increase in demand for these products in the country.

In February, the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) asked the DGFT to issue orders restricting export of 12 APIs and formulations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that there was no ground to review the verdict pronounced last year.

“We find no ground to interfere in the review petitions. The same are dismissed,” said the bench also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose.

The order was passed on February 18 but it was uploaded on the apex court website on Tuesday.

While seeking review of the 2019 verdict, Fadnavis had told the court that there was a “clear error” in the apex court’s judgement as the law stipulates for disclosure of details about criminal cases only if charges are framed and on conviction.

In its October 1, 2019 judgment, the apex court had set aside a Bombay High Court order which gave a clean chit to Fadnavis and held that he did not deserve to be tried for the alleged offence under the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA).

The verdict had come on an appeal by one Satish Ukey, who had challenged the high court’s order.

Hours after the Vile Parle police booked Chavan and four of family members, the Opposition BJPs Mahila Morcha upped the ante, statged a dharna and demanded her resignation from the membership of the Upper House of the Maharashtra Legislature

“After her daughter-in-law registered case against her mother-in-law and four other family members, including her husband, it is condemnable that Chavan has made objectionable allegations against her daughter-in-law. The Chief Minister and State Home Minister should take cognisance of the complaint of Chavan’s daughter-in—law and initiate stringent action against her,” BJP’s Pradesh Mahila Morcha president Madhavi Naik said.

“Chavan’s conduct has come as a blot on the State Legislative Council. Hence she should resign from membership of the Council,” Naik said.

Rejecting the charge that his party was trying to “shield” its senior leader and MLC Chavan, NCP national spokesperson and Minister Nawab said that the law would take its course.

The complainant-victim has alleged that her brother-in-law Anand Chavan used to make lewd gestures at her and his wife Sheetal mentally harassed her when she lived with them at their home at Vile Parle. The victim further said that the problems began when she recently delivered a premature female child that died later. The Chavans allegedly wanted a male child since the couple already has a 7-year old girl child.

Meanwhile, Vidya Chavan and her family rubbished all the allegations by her victim daughter-inj-law. She has claimed that she was not interested in living with her husband and her in-laws. She said that her family was now taking care of the minor daughter.

Talking to media persons here on Tuesday, Chavan that her engineer-son Ajit has sought divorce by mutual understanding agfter their 10-year marriage, but instead his wife went ahead and lodged the police complaint.

Chavan alleged that one day when her daughter-in-law’s WhatsApp stopped working and when Ajit got it repaired and checked her messages, discovered she was having extra-marital affairs with four men.

According to Chavan, her son Ajit revealed everything on his wife had cheated his family and his in-laws on December 7, and later even cancelled their plans to go to Denmark.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ncp-mlc--family-booked-for-harassing-daughter-in-law.html

144,04-3-20,PM raps Manmohan for ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ suspicion,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took a sharp dig at Congress leader and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for looking at the chant of “Bharat mata ki jai” with suspicion even as he spoke about the need to establish peace, harmony and unity in the backdrop of Delhi violence where his party MPs have been accused of making highly provocative statements during Assembly elections.

Modi who had since 2014 evoked the chant of “Bharat mata ki jai” during his poll campaigns hit-out at the Congress and its leaders at the BJP’s Parliamentary party meeting for portraying the slogan as something divisive and out of sync with country’s “secular” ethos.

Modi latched on to the former PM’s comments at a recent book launch event where the latter said the slogan has turned “militant and purely emotional” and is being “misused”. Modi said the former Prime Minister finds a “bad smell” even in a slogan like ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and looks at it with suspicion.

Singh also said the chant tends to exclude “millions of Indians”, apparently referring to the minorities. A section of Muslim leadership is opposed to the slogan saying it violates their religious beliefs. AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi reportedly said he would not chant it even if a knife is pulled out at him.

The BJP has been accused of forcing minorities to prove their nationalistic credentials and ‘Nationalism’ by chanting ‘Bharat mata ki jai’. In the recent Delhi riots, a video doing the round purportedly showed some youngsters, beaten-up during the riot, being asked to chant the slogan.

Seizing on Singh’s remarks, Modi said in the meeting that similar controversies were created over ‘Vande Mataram’ during the freedom struggle and singing it was considered a “gunah” (crime) with many people choosing to leave the meetings of the Congress when it was played, sources said quoting the Prime Minister.

“It is unfortunate and sad that 70 years after Independence, raising a slogan like ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ is being depicted as a crime... It is unfortunate that a person who held the post of Prime Minister is saying so,” Modi said, adding that every patriot will be pained with this. He said country looks ‘Bharat mata’ as Goddess and questioned parties like Congress and TMC opposing her chant.

Keeping ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ on their minds, they should work for the country’s development which, Modi told BJP leaders, is supreme.

He said several forces are working to destabilise the country and called upon party leaders to work more vigorously for it. He said that political interests are supreme for some parties while national interest is of utmost importance to the saffron organisation. “Hamare liye desh hith dal hith se uper hai,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi quoted Modi as saying.

A fight is going on between those wedded to national interest and people preferring party interest over it, he stated, asserting that the country is supreme for the BJP and ‘vikas’ is its mantra, Joshi said after the meeting. Senior BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and its president J P Nadda, were in the meeting.

In the backdrop communal riots last month which claimed 47 lives in the North-East Delhi, the Prime Minister said peace, harmony and unity are prerequisites for the country’s development. He asked BJP MPs to take lead in ensuring amity in society with their words, mind and deeds.

The Congress has been seeking Shah’s resignation for “inaction” while the national Capital was already on its edge. Muslim women, strongly opposing Citizenship (amendment) Act, have been sitting on a two-and-half -month-long ‘dharna’ at Rs Shaheen BaghRs asserting that the Act was discriminatory towards the Muslim community.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-raps-manmohan-for----bharat-mata-ki-jai----suspicion.html
145,04-3-20,NCLT approves NBCC bid for Jaypee Infratech,"State-owned NBCC on Tuesday got approval from the NCLT to acquire debt-laden Jaypee Infratech through an insolvency process and complete around 20,000 pending flats over the next three and half years.

In its hearing on Tuesday, the Principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), headed by Acting President BSV Prakash Kumar, gave a go-ahead to the resolution plan of NBCC.

In a significant direction that will help NBCC in faster completion of stuck projects of Jaypee Group, the tribunal ordered that the Rs 750 crore deposited by Jaypee Infratech’s parent firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) with the registry of the Supreme Court would be part of the resolution plan.

“Rs 750 crore would be treated as part of the plan,” the bench said in its oral order adding the resolution plan is approved with the modification. The written order will be available on Wednesday.

The successful resolution of Jaypee Infratech would not only provide a much-needed relief to thousands of distressed homebuyers but also go a long way in reviving the Indian real estate sector, especially the sluggish housing market of Delhi-NCR.

Jaypee Infratech went into an insolvency process in August 2017.

In December last year, a committee of creditors (CoC) comprising 13 banks and around 21,000 homebuyers, approved the resolution plan of NBCC with 97.36 per cent vote in favour.

NBCC’s proposal was approved by the lenders in the third round of bidding process to find a buyer for Jaypee Infratech.

In its bid, NBCC had proposed to complete over 20,000 pending flats in housing projects launched by Jaypee Infratech in Noida and Greater Noida (Uttar Pradesh).

Homebuyers’ claim amounting to Rs 13,364 crore and lenders’ claim worth Rs 9,783 crore were admitted.

NBCC offered 1,526 acres of land to lenders under a land-debt swap deal.

On Yamuna Expressway, NBCC proposed to transfer the road asset to lenders but before that it would take a loan of around Rs 2,500 crore against toll revenue to fund construction spend.

Jaypee Infratech went into insolvency process in August 2017 after the NCLT admitted an application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium.

Anuj Jain was appointed as an IRP to conduct insolvency process and also manage the affairs of the company.

In the first round of insolvency proceedings conducted last year, the Rs 7,350-crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of Suraksha Group, was rejected by lenders.

The CoC rejected the bids of Suraksha Realty and NBCC in the the second round held in May-June 2019.

The matter reached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and then the apex court.

On November 6, 2019, the Supreme Court directed completion of Jaypee Infratech’s insolvency process within 90 days and the revised resolution plan to be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha Realty.

On December 7, 2019, the CoC decided to put on vote simultaneously the bids of NBCC and Suraksha Realty to acquire the bankrupt realty firm. The voting process started on December 10 and ended on December 16.

As many as 13 banks and over 21,000 homebuyers had voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC).

Buyers had 57.66 per cent voting rights, fixed deposit holders 0.13 per cent and lenders 42.21 per cent. For a bid to be approved, 66 per cent votes were required.

In the voting result, NBCC got the entire 57.66 per cent vote of homebuyers and 0.13 per cent of fixed deposit holders. The public sector firm got 39.57 per cent votes of lenders out of the total 42.21 per cent votes. Suraksha managed to get only 2.12 per cent votes as only fixed deposit holders and two lenders — Axis Bank and Jammu and Kashmir Bank — favoured it.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nclt-approves-nbcc-bid-for-jaypee-infratech-nclt-approves-nbcc-bid-for-jaypee-infratech.html

Divulging more on this development, Ashu, in a Press communiqué released here on Tuesday, said that the Punjab Government was pressing hard the Union Government to accept its demand of shifting the surplus food grains over stocked in the godowns of the State to other States in a bid to save the food grains to get spoiled.

Ashu on Tuesday called upon the Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi to urge him to take early call on the repeated request of the Punjab Government to shift the food grains before it is too delayed to use the food grains for human consumption. Besides this, Ashu also requested the Union Minister to expedite the process of lifting of the wheat and paddy.

The Minister apprised Paswan that currently, 200 lakh metric tonnes of food grains are stocked in the godowns of Punjab, comprising 109 lakh metric tonnes rice and 91 lakh metric tonnes wheat. “It is an alarming stage as the Punjab state will face acute shortage of storage space to stock the upcoming Rabi and Kharif crop as the agriculture department of the state has predicted bumper procurement 135 lakh tonnes wheat in coming season, which will multiply the woes of the department to store it in the available storage space.

He appealed the Union Minister to formulate comprehensive uniformed policy so that food grains in the agriculture based states like Punjab may not get spoiled.

The Food Supply Minister said that Punjab not only grows food grains, but also asked by the union government to manage its storage uptill three years, whereas in states, the food grains are not being stored more than three months. He said that if Union Government formulates a uniform policy in this regard, food grains from Punjab can be stored in other states. He said that special permission is granted for only 10-12 goods trains daily to lift grains, which should be increased at least 20 trains for lifting of food grains.

About the current storage situation of the State, Ashu also brought to the notice of the Union Minister that around 30 lakh metric tonnes grain is lying in open which was purchased last year. He also requested the union government to immediately release Rs 750 crores, which is outstanding on part of union government for preservation of wheat crop by the Punjab.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/centre-lets-punjab-shift-12l-tonnes-of-surplus-rice-to-up.html

pending dues: rly contractors to observe strike

Ghaziabad: Indian Railways has not paid the bills of thousands of construction companies for a long time. This amount of bill is above twenty five thousand crores. Railway contractors across the country will be on a symbolic strike on March 6 to protest against non-payment. If this amount of payment is not done before Holi festival, then all the railway contractors of the country will go on indefinite strike. In a Press conference held here on Tuesday, the National president of IR Infrastructure Providers Association, IRIPA, Balakishan Sharma, announced that he was unable to pay salaries to his employees due to non-payment of their companies from the railways on time. He alleged that just two days ago, Railway contractor Devanket Reddy committed suicide in Hyderabad due to non-payment. If the condition remains the same, the other railway contractors of the country will either die of hunger in the same way or they will also be forced to take steps like Reddy. He told that at present, more than 20 lakh workers across the country are doing day-to-day construction work on various railway projects. Sharma said that the construction companies have no money to pay them daily wages or monthly wages. Even on the festival of Holi, there are people to pay their salary. For the past several months, the Railways have almost not paid the construction companies their bills. Whereas, the contractors are responsible for paying the installments of loan to the banks to the workers and other staff to the suppliers and the arrears of the construction material used in the projects.

151,04-3-20,"Telcos pay over Rs 8,000 cr to Govt in dues","Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio on Tuesday paid cumulative over Rs 6,000 crore to the government towards deferred spectrum dues while Tatas said it has deposited another Rs 2,000 crore for ad hoc statutory liabilities.

The development came as DoT prepared to send out fresh missive to telcos questioning them about discrepancies in AGR dues assessed by firms and its own calculations.

On Tuesday, Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) CEO and MD Ravinder Takkar again met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash although he remained tightlipped about the meeting.

While crisis-ridden VIL has paid about Rs 3,043 crore to the telecom department for deferred spectrum dues — essentially instalment payments that are made by telcos for airwaves bought in past auctions — Bharti Airtel submitted Rs 1,950 crore and Reliance Jio Rs 1,053 crore towards the same.

The payment made by VIL in particular assumes significance as the company has been under financial pressure and is confronted with AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) liabilities of over Rs 53,000 crore.

This is the last lot of payments that telcos will make towards deferred spectrum liabilities, as the Union Cabinet had late last year approved a two-ear moratorium on such spectrum payment dues.

Separately, Tata Teleservices on Tuesday said it has made an on-account AGR payment of an additional Rs 2,000 crore to the Department of Telecom (DoT) on March 2 ""in good faith and as a matter of abundant caution"" towards licence fees, spectrum usage charges and applicable interest, penalty and interest on penalty.

""This on account payment is subject to reconciliation after the conclusion of the process of computation and verification being conducted by DoT spanning a period beginning from FY2007 and spread across 20 circles,"" the company said in a statement.

According to sources, DoT has decided to send fresh letters to telecom companies questioning them about the variation in AGR dues assessed by firms themselves and its own calculations. This is because amounts paid by telcos so far, even those who have announced full and final settlement, are woefully less than DoT's AGR estimates.

Sources said the letters would go out within a day or two to telecom companies.

Bharti Airtel recently submitted over Rs 18,000 crore to DoT declaring it has made full and final settlement towards its AGR liabilities but the amount is far less than over Rs 35,000 crore that the government estimates the company owes it.

It is pertinent to mention here that Bharti Airtel on Saturday said it has made payment of Rs 8,004 crore towards AGR dues to the government, an amount over and above Rs 10,000 crore it has already paid. The amount of Rs 8,004 crore includes Rs 3,004 crore towards full and final settlement on AGR dues based on self assessment, and a deposit of buffer Rs 5,000 crore to cover DoT's reconciliation differences.

""Based on the aforesaid payment we have now complied with AGR judgment and the directions in the order of the Supreme Court dated October 24, 2019,"" Airtel had said in a regulatory filing.

Similarly, Tata Teleservices has paid Rs 2,197 crore in AGR dues, and now additional Rs 2,000 crore to cover reconciliation differences, while DoT estimates the liabilities to be about Rs 14,000 crore.

VIL has so far deposited Rs 3,500 crore in two tranches to DoT but is still assessing its full AGR dues. According to the government's calculation, VIL owes Rs 53,000 crore in AGR liabilities.

After the meeting with the DoT secretary, Takkar declined to comment on how soon VIL would be able to complete the self assessment of dues.

DoT has also asked all telecom companies to furnish names of their MDs and their addresses, sources said adding this had been a requirement of the court which wanted those details.

In all, 15 entities owe the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore in unpaid statutory dues — Rs 2,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges. Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and VIL account for about 60 per cent. These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court last month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and VIL for extension in the payment schedule and asked companies to deposit their past dues for spectrum and licences.

Since the February 14 tongue lashing that the Supreme Court gave telecom companies for missing its previous deadline of January 23 to pay past dues as well as the DoT for failing to enforce it, firms and the telecom ministry had been doing separate maths on the actual dues.

Meanwhile, IIFL Securities in a note on Tuesday said its recent interaction with senior DoT officials suggests that the department is keen on ensuring that India remains a three private player market and ""its own assessment tallies with our estimate that ARPU has to double from current levels"".

The IIFL note also highlighted that AGR burden for telcos may be 10-15 per cent lighter, based on accurate assessment.

""Key risk is the Supreme Court imposing fresh punitive measures when it learns that the entire amount due has not been paid; however, we believe this is unlikely,"" IIFL Securities said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/telcos-pay-over-rs-8-000-cr-to-govt-in-dues-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/telcos-pay-over-rs-8-000-cr-to-govt-in-dues.html
152,04-3-20,Modi did not take ex-PM’s remarks in right spirit: Cong,"Asserting that the Government should give up its “obduracy” to allow a debate in both Houses over the Delhi riots, the Congress on Tuesday said the “silence of Parliament” on the matter will be a poor reflection on the world’s largest democracy. Congress’ senior spokesperson Anand Sharma also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a veiled dig at his predecessor Manmohan Singh.

Addressing the BJP parliamentary party meeting, Modi said attempts were being made to create a controversy around the slogan ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ (Hail Mother India) in the same way objections were raised about ‘Vande Mataram’ after the freedom struggle.

At a recent event, Singh had said the slogan of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ was being misused to construct a “militant and purely emotional” idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens. Sharma said it was “unfortunate” that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not take Singh’s remarks in the right spirit.

“Instead of being sarcastic, he should understand that Dr Manmohan Singh is known for his humility and wisdom. Bharat Mata belongs to all those who live in this country. The slogan ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ or the tricolour have to be held in high respect and not to be used for polarisation, division and violence,” he told reporters outside Parliament.

The Deputy Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha said Congress leaders have requested Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and the government to immediately start a discussion on the riots in Delhi. “There is a need for Parliament not only to discuss (Delhi riots) but also to fix accountability, that is exactly what Parliamentary democracy is all about,” Sharma said.

“The Government should give up its obduracy, its rigidity, and in the larger interest of Indian democracy and respect the institution of Indian Parliament by accepting discussion on the issue,” he said. It is time to send a message to the people in Delhi and citizens across the country that Parliament, irrespective of parties, is collectively concerned and jointly condemns what has happened in the national Capital, Sharma said.

Highlighting the importance of PMEGP scheme, Saxena said, “India is passing through a transitional phase from developing nation to a developed nation. Schemes like PMEGP are the strongest pillars on which the future of India is embarked. We aim not only to provide employment at the doorstep, but also to encourage the traditional artisans, self help groups and educated unemployed to build Enterprise of their dreams. This scheme also helps prevent migration of unskilled workers to urban areas.”

155,04-3-20,Centre assures Andhra to clear some part of subsidy dues,"The Centre has assured Andhra Pradesh Government to clear some part of the pending subsidy dues of over Rs 4,300 crore for undertaking rice procurement at a minimum support price (MSP) by next month.

Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday gave the assurance in a meeting with Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath on this issue.

After the meeting, Paswan said that it was a genuine request from the Andhra Pradesh government. “The Centre, too, does not have funds and we may get some allocation at the end of March. From that, we will release (the fund) as much as possible to Andhra Pradesh. Some subsidy dues are pending in most States, where procurement has been decentralised. Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra are some of the States where foodgrain subsidy dues are pending”, he added.

The dues will be released to the Andhra Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd (APSCSCL) which has undertaken the procurement operation in the State. After the meeting, the AP Finance Minister said total Rs 4,308 crore was the pending rice subsidy from the Centre. Of which, Rs 1,598 crore dues were between financial years 2013-14 and 2016-17.

“The Government of India normally releases 90 per cent of claimed amount as advance subsidy in each quarter. However, there has been a delay in the release of subsidy for this year, creating hurdles in clearing the outstanding payments to farmers on time,” he said.

However, the state government has been clearing the payments for farmers from its own resources in order to avoid unrest among farmers and also honour the commitment of MSP given by the central government, he added.

State’s Finance Minister said the Andhra Pradesh Government has cleared payments of Rs 6,000 crore so far to the farmers and the outstanding dues stand at about Rs 3,000 crore, which is leading to unrest among the farming community.

Senator Amy Klobuchar and former mayor from Indiana Pete Buttigieg not only announced that they were dropping out of the race but also endorsed 77-year-old Biden’s bid to challenge President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 3 election.

Former US congressman Beto O’Rourke, who dropped out of the race last November, also backed Biden.

Democratic moderates have been urging party leaders to urgently unite to stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, from becoming the party’s nominee to take on President Trump.

Responding to the barrage of endorsements, Biden said, ‘Pete and Amy and Beto backed our campaign — now we need you. This is our moment to come together as a party to beat Donald Trump. If you’re with us, chip in today to keep our momentum going.”

“Whether you supported Pete, Amy, Beto, or any other candidate in this race — know that there is a home for you in our campaign. I will do everything I can to earn your vote,” he tweeted.

NCLAT set aside the CCI's 2018 order whereby the latter had said that Flipkart and Amazon are not dominant online marketplaces in the country.

The All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) had alleged abuse of market dominance against Flipkart India Pvt Ltd. The vendors' body was of the view that Flipkart provided preferential treatment to certain sellers.

The anti-trust regulator in its November 6, 2018 order had said: ""Flipkart India is not dominant in the relevant market of services provided by online marketplace platforms for selling goods in India therefore, the issue of abuse of dominant position does not arise.""

This is another blow for the company after the anti-trust body in January had ordered an enquiry into the operations of both Amazon and Flipkart on multiple counts, including deep discounts and exclusive tie-ups with preferred sellers.

However, on February 14, the Karnataka High Court ordered a stay on the CCI probe. The order came on the writ petition filed by Amazon seeking a stay on the investigation.

Further, days after the Karnataka High Court ordered a stay, the Walmart-backed Flipkart also moved the court urging it to set aside the probe. In its writ petition, Flipkart Internet Private Ltd said that although the High Court has ordered a stay on the investigation, the probe order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ""deserves to be set aside"".",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nclat-asks-cci-to-probe-flipkart-over-unfair-practices-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nclat-asks-cci-to-probe-flipkart-over-unfair-practices.html

The report titled 'The Coronavirus and Revealed Preferences' further said the RBI, on its part, has a dominant revealed current preference for bringing back credit growth.

""Again the revealed preference in MPC (on aggregate, not necessarily for each individual member) seemed to be to look for room to ease as soon as inflation allowed, even before the impact from the coronavirus had taken hold. With new evolving information, the nudge is likely to come sooner than before,"" the report said.

It is also noteworthy that the central bank chose to put out an assurance statement with respect to evolving developments, despite already being in the midst of substantial incremental non-traditional monetary easing, the statement said.

""All of this means that monetary policy, conventional and otherwise, will continue to play a pivotal role for now with consequent benefits for quality interest rates,"" it added.

The report pointed out that the finance minister's revealed preference is also similar to that of the RBI, i.E to get credit growth to rebound.

""This is also basis a recognition that scope for incremental fiscal response has been somewhat limited given the well documented constraints.

""In fact this space may get even further constrained if lack of growth buoyancy stresses tax growth and tepid financial markets stress capital receipts targets,"" it said.

The report, however added that it is unlikely that the government will compromise on spending to meet the fiscal deficit targets.

Noting that the global monetary policy will continue to be extremely supportive, it said in India too, the RBI's revealed preference will get a further leg up and conventional easing may start supporting unconventional tools already in deployment.

169,04-3-20,India's services sector growth hits seven-year high in Feb: PMI,"Marking its quickest rise in over seven years, India's services sector activity expanded for the fifth successive month in February, tracking spike in business orders, renewed export demand and strengthening business confidence, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday.

The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index rose from 55.5 in January to 57.5 in February. This is the fastest expansion in services output since January 2013.

Service providers saw a marked increase in new work intakes during February, the second-fastest in over seven years.

A return to growth of new orders from abroad contributed to the increase in total sales. The pace of expansion in international demand for Indian services was moderate, but above its long-run average.

""Growth in India's service sector accelerated further halfway through the final quarter of fiscal year 2019-20, with the trend for business activity improving in each month since last September when the sharpest contraction for 19 months was recorded,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

Further, the Composite PMI Output Index that maps both the manufacturing and services sector increased from 56.3 in January to 57.6 in February, remaining above its long-run average of 54.6.

Lima said, behind the resilience in the trend for business activity stands healthy demand for services from both the domestic and international markets.

February data showed that robust increases in both manufacturing and services output pushed growth of private sector business activity to an eight-year high.

""Positive gains in new work across the manufacturing and service sectors suggest that private sector output will likely increase markedly again in March, boding well for final quarter GDP following expectations of a flat growth rate in Q3 FY 2019-20,"" Lime stated.

Meanwhile, the rate of job creation was modest and the slowest in three months.

Despite experiencing another increase in outstanding work halfway through the final quarter of fiscal year 2019-2020, service providers restricted hiring activity in February.

Further, input costs in the service economy increased amid reports of higher food, labour, material and oil costs.

As per the survey, the rate of inflation softened from January. Anecdotal evidence suggested that lower prices for onions, and fuel helped curtail inflation.

Only a modest increase in selling prices was recorded in February, one that was softer than in January and much weaker than noted for input costs.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-services-sector-growth-hits-seven-year-high-in-feb--pmi-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-s-services-sector-growth-hits-seven-year-high-in-feb--pmi.html

Noting that the COVID-19 outbreaks have emerged in many countries, Xi said it is important to step up communication and exchange with the WHO and carry out scientific research cooperation on source tracing, drugs, vaccines, testing and other fields with other countries, especially those hit hard by the virus.

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has full genome sequences of the new virus with various countries and permitted a team of experts from the World Health Organisation and other countries to visit the virus hit areas.

Chinese researchers have also been actively sharing their latest study results and participating in international cooperation on diagnosis and effective treatments, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

After receiving the genome sequence of the virus from China, researchers in the United States were able to map the first 3D atomic-scale structure of a key 2019 novel coronavirus protein, making a breakthrough toward developing vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics, according to a study published online in the journal Science in February, it said.

The WHO-China joint mission, consisting of 25 experts from eight countries and the WHO, conducted a nine-day field study trip on COVID-19 last month in China’s capital Beijing and several different provinces including Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak.

The team made a range of findings on the transmissibility of the virus, the severity of the disease, and the impact of the measures taken.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/xi-calls-for-int---l-efforts-to-find-cure.html
173,04-3-20,Pope ‘tests negative’ as Vatican ups controls,"Pope Francis, who is suffering from a cold, has tested negative for the coronavirus, an Italian newspaper reported on Tuesday, as Italy battles Europe’s worst outbreak.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni did not respond to an AFP request for comment on the Messaggero newspaper report, and sources said it was unlikely the Holy See would comment on the pope’s health on Tuesday.

Francis cancelled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy this weekend, after axing all public meetings at the end of last week over the cold. “Unfortunately, a cold forced me not to take part this year,” the 83-year-old pontiff told a crowd on Saint Peter’s Square after suffering two coughing fits while reciting his traditional Angelus Prayer.

174,04-3-20,"Taliban attack Afghan Army bases, throwing peace talks into doubt","The Taliban carried out dozens of attacks on Afghan army bases, officials said Tuesday, hours after ending a partial truce and throwing into doubt peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents.

The intra-Afghan negotiations are due to begin March 10 according to a US-Taliban deal signed in Doha on Saturday, but a dispute over a prisoner swap has raised questions about whether they will go ahead.

The agreement includes a commitment for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan Government to free around 5,000 insurgent captives — something the militants have cited as a prerequisite for talks but which President Ashraf Ghani has refused to do before negotiations start.

The row has highlighted the tough road ahead, with the Taliban’s decision to end a partial truce Monday complicating matters further.

In the last 24 hours the Taliban conducted 33 attacks in 16 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.

“As a result, six civilians were killed and 14 wounded. Eight enemy were also killed, 15 wounded,” he said on Twitter.

Two soldiers were killed in one of the attacks in southern Kandahar province, a government statement said.

An attack in Logar province near Kabul killed five security forces, the provincial governor’s spokesman Didar Lawang told AFP. The halt to the limited truce, which began on February 22, ends what was a welcome reprieve for ordinary Afghans who have born the brunt of the deadly violence. But experts said the move was unsurprising as both sides seek to exploit whatever leverage they hold to force the other’s hand.

“Of course violence will go up, was bound to happen. No surprise Ghani balking on prisoner release: 1 of his few levers,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/taliban-attack-afghan-army-bases--throwing-peace-talks-into-doubt.html

180,04-3-20,Currency in banking,"To be a private banker, one must have love for numbers and excellent interpersonal and communication skills, says Amit Goyal

The banking industry serves a broad range of individual and business customers. Banks and credit unions have variety of various personnel to serve the requirements of their clients from customer service representatives to financial advisors to non-public bankers. These institutions employ private bankers to supply a further level of service for top and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) clients. Private bankers are typically employed with an outsized financial organisation, while financial advisors or wealth managers serve outside the banking environment. In essence, private bankers are personal financial advisors for the very rich.

Scope

They add many various parts of the financial services industry. This includes banks, credit unions, investment banks, and wealth management firms. They provide banking, advisory, and investment services to ultra-rich clients. They are typically assigned to clients of a selected bank branch. Unlike financial advisors, they are doing not have the responsibility of continuous prospecting. For smaller banks or credit unions, a private banker may make phone calls or reach out to prominent individuals or businesses to attract new high net-worth clients to the financial institution. Private bankers, in partnership with and supported by the bank, can also be liable for implementing client appreciation events to make sure a high level of retention for the bank. Many private banking divisions in large banks handle virtually all aspects of clients’ finances. They often work with fewer clients to supply the main target and personalised service that non-public banking clients often demand. In some firms, private bankers specialise in managing client portfolios while relationship managers handle other client needs.

Qualification

Most financial institutions require private bankers to hold at least a bachelor’s degree. Undergraduate work best fitted to a career privately banking focuses on accounting, finance, or business. Although not necessary, a marketing or advanced diploma in banking and finance degree may also benefit a private banker in his career. Most employers like better to hire experienced candidates with master’s degrees in business disciplines like finance, accounting or business administration. Many employers also look for experienced job candidates who have graduate degrees in mathematics, statistics or law. Course add subjects like taxation, risk management, investing and financial planning are especially valuable to prospective private bankers.

Skills Required

Private bankers must even be ready to analyse financial information to make and implement recommendations. That’s why they should have a great understanding of the banking and financial systems, along with knowledge about credit and lending practices. They should also stay au courant of current events like economic and market news. Even though they normally affect high net-worth individuals, private bankers should be ready to affect all kinds of clients.

They must be ready to analyse financial information to make and implement recommendations. The greatest responsibility is to take care of relationships with HNWIs to make sure their assets remain with the financial organisation. An individual working as a personal banker must establish a rapport with individuals quickly and build trust with potential or current clients. Excellent interpersonal and communication skills are a must.

Career Path

Many private bankers begin working in entry-level securities analyst positions in wealth management firms, banks, brokerages or other organisations within the market. Many financial analysts study stocks, bonds, and other securities to supply financial plans, analytical reports, and proposals for personal bankers, portfolio managers, and other senior investment professionals within the firm.

With experience and a record of high performance, a securities analyst specialising in investments can rise into a personal banker position.

Other professionals within the field begin working as personal financial advisors serving retail clients at banks and other financial services firms. Personal financial advisors do much of an equivalent work that non-public bankers do, but they typically affect clients who don’t have the wealth to justify the value of the highly personalised services private bankers typically offer. A record of success as a retail-level advisor can cause an edge as a personal banker.

Remuneration

A private banker’s compensation is typically comprised of a base salary plus commissions based on assets under management (AUM) fee.

According to the foremost current information available on Pay scale, entry-level private bankers can earn the minimum amount as `25,000 per month including commissions and bonuses.

Private bankers with a little book of clients tend to earn a lower income than private bankers with an outsized, established book of business. Similarly, private bankers who add regional banks or credit unions are less likely to get on the upper end of the salary scale than those that work for larger national financial institutions.

181,04-3-20,‘Sports create a sense of belonging’,"The Special Olympics movement aims at providing an environment for intellectual disabilities of all ages to be part of an inclusive learning platform, says Dipak Natalie

Why is it important to create inclusion in India today?

Inclusion is the way forward, not only in India, but across the region and worldwide. In a multi-cultural and diverse country like India, an important member of the Asia Pacific region and global community - having inclusive and accepting mindsets towards people of all abilities creates a more understanding and caring society; which in turn builds a stronger, more united and resilient people. Meaningful exchanges and learnings among different groups in society helps all of us realise that we are more alike than different.

People with intellectual disabilities are able to achieve their full potential only when we create an inclusive environment where they feel accepted, cared for, and not judged for being who they are. All it takes is for each and every one of us to have the courage to reach out to them, interact with them and simply, be a friend.

The Special Olympics movement aims to provide such an environment. By allowing people with and without intellectual disabilities of all ages to play sport together; by letting young people of all abilities to co-create solutions for inclusion together; by getting healthcare professionals and the community to better understand the medical needs of people with intellectual disabilities; we are changing mindsets bit by bit and helping to sensitise communities in India and across the region to the needs of people of all abilities.

Is there a connection between sports, inclusion and education?

Sports is our engine, but inclusion is the ultimate vision of the movement. By allowing people with and without intellectual disabilities to play sport together on the same team, we foster mutual understanding, respect and friendships. Team sport builds a sense of belonging, and creates bonds beyond the sports field. Within a team, everyone has a specific role to play and is recognised and respected for that. Sports training also helps instill discipline.

When athletes are given the opportunity to achieve their best on the sporting arena, to represent their country and be celebrated on the global stage, it gives them an immense sense of accomplishment. The confidence gained often extends to other aspects of their lives, such as in the way they handle their jobs or their personal relationships.

What is the importance of unified sports in a student’s life?

With schools and colleges being the nurturing ground for the decision makers of tomorrow, unified sports plays a significant role in helping to foster inclusive mindsets among the young. It breaks down barriers and helps young people realise that with or without disabilities, they are not so different. By playing together, they build friendships that will hopefully develop into lifelong ones. It helps people of all abilities develop social and emotional skills together, creating an inclusive learning environment for all. With young people at the forefront of the inclusion movement, it is our hope that the next generation will be a unified one, eradicating inequality for people with intellectual disabilities.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---sports-create-a-sense-of-belonging---.html

It was the third such downing in three days amid escalating fighting between Turkish forces and Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-backed regime.

A missile fired by Syrian regime forces on the city of Idlib, meanwhile, killed nine civilians in the province of the same name that is Syria’s last opposition bastion.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces have since December battled to retake the jihadist-dominated stronghold, where Ankara backs some rebel groups.

An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report said that as of February 19, 2020 the Iranian stockpile stood at 1,510 kg, as opposed to the 300 kg limit set under the agreement.

Some experts consider this level to provide sufficient material to produce a nuclear weapon.

However, it would still need several more steps, including further enrichment, to make it suitable for use in a weapon.

The report says that Iran has not been enriching uranium above 4.5 per cent.

An enrichment level of around 90 per cent would be needed for weapons use.

The 2015 deal has been hanging by a thread since the US withdrew from it in May 2018 and went on to impose stinging sanctions on Iran, in particular targeting its vital oil sector.

The latest IAEA report on the deal comes just days after a meeting in Vienna of the remaining parties to the deal which ended without a clear plan to keep the accord alive.

The agreement promised Iran an easing of very damaging economic and other sanctions in return for its scaling back its nuclear programme.

“We do not agree with such accusations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, raising questions about the objectivity of the report.

“It is obvious that no commission could have received reliable information on what is happening on the ground,” Peskov said.

187,04-3-20,Happiness is key,"Anxiety and depression is common in students. Most are unable to take pressure and seek help. To tackle this, many institutes have introduced happiness programmes to help them, says DR Sam Paul Isaac

The most beautiful and memorable time in a person’s life is when he was a student. It is their time to explore, learn, be curious, ask questions, enjoy and not worry. But, in recent times, a student’s life does not seem that happy and carefree. They are always stressed out about doing better and getting enough grades. In these competitive times, a student has no time to relax; they have a packed schedule with tuitions, school, homework, projects, workshops and preparing for competitive examinations. They are always planning for the future and putting themselves through the mental trauma of being ahead in the race.

Anxiety and depression have been a common phenomenon amongst students and the numbers are increasing every day. Most students are not able to take so much pressure and hence are seeking mental help. Looking at the need of the hour, a lot of educational institutions and other humanitarian organisations have introduced happiness programmes to help students with their mental well being.

Let us see how these happiness programs help the young budding minds to find their way out of their mental prison:

Introducing reactive and preventive counseling groups: Schools and colleges have started providing free mental health care through counseling centers and doctors. Reactive counseling helps students who already have mental trauma to deal with them whereas, in preventive sessions, the students learn about preparing themselves for any situation that might lead to stress or any kind of mental grief. These groups work with the teachers, parents, administrators, and psychologists to give the student the necessary help required.

Awareness programmes: To deal with a problem, you have to acknowledge it. After school awareness programmes and camps have gained popularity among students where they are taught about the problems that exist. These programmes not only focus on mental health but also on drug and alcohol abuse. The students are taught social skills, how to resist peer pressure, manage stress and resist substance use to overcome problems.

Parental counseling and handling parental pressure: One of the biggest contributors to a child’s worry is the expectation of a parent. Sometimes, without even realising, parents become the most stressful factor for a child’s well being with their constant reminders to the child to do well in life. Parents worry, and hence, they want a particular lifestyle, a particular future for their children, they also get competitive and expect their children to win in every aspect of life.

Hence, not only the child but the parent needs to learn to handle pressure as well. The counseling groups help the parents to see things from the child’s perspective and also guide children to deal and handle parent pressure.

The benefit of a good diet, exercise, and meditation: Institutes are going out of their way to make students and parents realise how important it is to eat healthily. Eating food that is fresh, that uplifts mood, makes the gut strong and improves metabolism can bring tremendous results for someone’s mental health. With that, investing some time in physical activities like jogging, running, walking and some form of exercise, releases the right hormones and keeps the mind fresh and relaxed. Meditation has also proved to be a very successful means to channelise positive energy and de-stress the mind.

Courses introduced to understand mental health: Educational institutions have introduced courses, seminars where they bring professionals to talk about dealing with stress and competition These courses focus and develop leadership skills, team-building skills, helpful nature among students and also teach them how to deal with change. Mentors from corporate sectors are brought in to explain the transition from college to work. Students are introduced to books and activities that help them deal with stress.

These small changes that the institutions are introducing to help their students have a healthy life are commendable. We look towards a bright future for students with these measures in place.

189,04-3-20,MindIT,"Studying in a reputed college is the steppingstone towards a good career ahead. Colleges are known not only for its infrastructure, but its lineage,pedagogy and above all the opportunities it provides for career prospects.

Over three lakh prospective candidates of CAT/MAT are vying to secure an entry in the top 50 or 60 colleges pan India each having a capacity of 120 or soper batch.

On a rough estimate there are approximately 3500 plus management colleges of varying pedigree. Simple statistics show that competition is stiff and the students need to make a mark on the admission team to secure a seat in a college of repute.

As is oft quoted: You cannot get a second chance to make the first impression.

What to do!

Usually good colleges follow a two/three tier selection process, which includes an initial talk with the admission counselors, followed by a short written aptitude to see your analytical and written expression, a group discussion and finally culminating into a interaction with a panel of faculty or one senior faculty member.

So,if this is the menu lets see how we can go about this business of Business school.

First, prepare yourself well for the management aptitude test which ever you decide. The late planners land up in a soup usually landing up in colleges which they regret later.

Some of these exams are CAT/MAT/NMAT/CMAT and their likes. While some are college specific the first three cover a large spectrum of colleges pan India. Getting a good score is important as this is the first impression the college gets about a student's academic acumen, besides the scores obtained in school and graduation.

Second, your preliminary action with college admission team-Be polite and ask relevant questions related to pedagogy, curriculum, fee structure, hostel facilities etc. Get a date for visiting the college or request for Skype /Video/Telephonic interview depending on your schedule. Make sure you are available at the scheduled date and time. Opportunity missed is opportunity lost.

Third, prepare yourself for interaction. Whether distance or physically interview, ensure you are decently attired.

Keep abreast with your domain knowledge. You may not be able recall all the answers, but not replying to any, will leave a poor impression. Professionalism is judged by a good technical knowledge too.

General awareness is more important than anything else. Businesses are affected by geopolitical development across the world, and saying that you are not interested in political matters or matters of governance, does not show you in good light. This knowledge will help you in your Group discussions too.

Merely listing out a few hobbies and interests in your resume just to impress is most counterproductive action students often do.

If you have shown interest in a game then a little knowledge about the rules, some records, important players and its popularity in the country shows your ability to go into details. Same goes for music and movies.

The chat with faculty should be interactive. Read the website and keep a few questions ready on subjects like career prospects, course contents and its value, personality development. It impresses the admission team to admit a well-informed student with a questioning mind. Avoid asking packages and remunerations.

In the end a pragmatic and pleasant demeanour scores over other shortcomings. Keep a positive attitude and you can surely secure a place for yourself in your two year journey of learning and earning.

190,04-3-20,Pandya smashes 39-ball 105,"Fit-again India all-rounder Hardik Pandya sent a strong message ahead of the South Africa ODI series where he is eyeing a comeback by smashing a whirlwind 105 off just 39 balls playing for Reliance 1 against CAG in a Group C encounter of the 16th DY Patil T20 Cup at the Reliance Corporate Park here on Tuesday.

Hardik was at his brutal best as he hit eight fours and 10 huge sixes en route his blitzkrieg as Reliance 1 posted 252/5 in 20 overs. After the innings, Hardik said he is happy with the way he is shaping up after being away from the game for almost six months.

“It’s fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone,” Hardik said on DY Patil Sports Academy Facebook page.

On his big-hitting prowess, the 26-year old added: “If it’s there in my arc I just back myself and go for it. Most of the times, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”

Pandya showed his all-round skills with a knock of 38 off 25 balls to help his side post 150 for eight in their 20 overs in the first match as well.

191,04-3-20,"Prasad, Joshi, Siva short-listed for selectors’ job","The Karnataka duo of Venkatesh Prasad and Sunil Joshi were on Tuesday shortlisted along with three others for the national selectors’ job, the interviews for which will be held in Mumbai today.

Former India spinners L S Sivaramakrishnan and Rajesh Chauhan have also been called for interviews and so has been former India medium pacer Harvinder Singh. The interviews begin at 11 am local time.

The Cricket Advisory Committee comprising Madan Lal, R P Singh and Sulakshana Naik shortlisted five candidates to replace outgoing selection panel chief MSK Prasad and fellow member Gagan Khoda.

As many as 44 applications were received for the two positions and among those who had applied were former India pacer Ajit Agarkar, considered a frontrunner for the job, and former wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia.

“Agarkar’s name was very much considered but in the end the CAC shortlisted Siva, Prasad, Chauhan, Joshi and Harvinder. He can be considered when the tenure of the other three selectors (Jatin Paranjpe, Sarandeep Singh and Dewan Gandhi) ends,” a BCCI official said.

Agarkar not being shortlisted also is an indicator that the Board is likely to stick to the existing zonal policy for the national selectors.

In that case, Harvinder, who has played for Punjab and Railways, can represent Central Zone replacing Khoda while Sivaramakrishnan, Prasad or Joshi can take MSK’s place from South Zone.

“India is a huge country and zonal representation is needed,” the official added.

Venkatesh Prasad already has some experience in the job, having been part of the junior selection panel. The 50-year-old played 33 Tests and161 ODIS, taking 96 and 196 wickets respectively.

50-year-old Sivaramakrishan played nine Tests and 16 ODIS and is a known commentator. Harvinder featured in three Tests and 16 ODIs.

The others in the fray, Chauhan and Joshi, played 21 Tests and 35 ODIS, and 15 Tests and 69 ODIs respectively.

The new selection panel will pick the squad for the three ODIs against South Africa, beginning in Dharamsala on March 12.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/prasad--joshi--siva-short-listed-for-selectors----job.html
192,04-3-20,"Gaurav, Ashish enter pre-quarters","The seasoned duo of Gaurav Solanki (57kg) and Ashish Kumar (75kg) advanced to the pre-quarterfinals of the Asian Olympic Qualifiers for boxing with dominating wins in their respective opening-round bouts here on Tuesday.

Commonwealth Games Gold-medallist Solanki defeated two-time Kyrgyz national champion Akylbek Esenbek Uulu, while Asian Championship Silver-medallist Ashish got the better of Taiwan’s Kan Chia-Wei. Both the Indians won 5-0 following strong performances.

Ashish will square off against Kyrgyzstan’s Omurbek Bekzhigit Uulu, who has been seeded fourth. The Indian had beaten Uulu in the quarterfinals of Asian Championships last year.

“I have played Chia-Wei before but I lost to him previously. Today I made no mistake. It was a clean performance from my side,” said Ashish after his victory.

“It has boosted my confidence especially after the good training we’ve had. I next face the fourth seed whom I have beaten before and am confident of putting up a good show.” Solanki, whose CWG Gold was in the 52kg division, will be up against top-seeded Uzbek Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov, who got a bye into the second round.

Mirzakhalilov is the reigning world champion in this weight category besides being a Gold-medallist at the 2018 Asian Games as well as the Asian Championships.

Solanki dominated from the word go, helped by Uulu’s poor defence. The Indian was relentless and accurate in his attacks, scoring mostly through clean straight punches.

Later, Ashish also produced a confident performance against a sprightly rival. The Indian kept his guard low and relied on counter-attacks to get the judges’ nod.

The Indian’s superior reach and power wore down the Taiwanese boxer, who took a tumble more than once in the second and third rounds after a split verdict in the opening three minutes.

Advancing to the semifinals in this event would assure boxers of a spot in the Tokyo Olympics scheduled later this year.

Today, the women pugilists will begin their quest.

193,04-3-20,Gerrard all set to stay with Rangers,"Steven Gerrard moved Tuesday to quell speculation about his future as manager of Rangers following last weekend’s Scottish Cup defeat by Hearts by insisting he was “ready to go again”.

After the 1-0 loss at Tynecastle on Saturday, a downbeat Gerrard said it was “the lowest I felt since I came into the job by a long way”.

The Liverpool great also said “I just need to think”, with Rangers facing the prospect of another season without a trophy.

But speaking ahead of today’s home match against Hamilton, Gerrard insisted he was staying at Ibrox.

Asked if he had thought about his future with Rangers, the former England midfielder replied: “Long term? No, no.

“I’m OK, good, ready for the next challenge which is Hamilton tomorrow.

“From the end of the game at the weekend which was bitterly disappointing, I have done a real lot of thinking to myself and shared those thoughts with people around me and I am ready to go again.”

Gerrard's contract with the Glasgow giants runs until 2024 and he said he intended to honour that deal.

“I’m in. I’ve signed up to something here. I’m in, I’m all in,"" Gerrard insisted. “I always knew there was going to be periods like this that were tough, real setbacks.”

Hearts’ Oliver Bozanic scored the only goal of the Cup tie to put the spotlight on Gerrard’s decision to drop top scorer Alfredo Morelos for disciplinary reasons.

Morelos was suspended for Rangers’ 1-0 win in Braga on Wednesday and was given permission to fly back to Colombia, but returned to Glasgow late.

Gerrard said on Tuesday that Morelos had accepted his punishment, which would remain private, and would be available to face Hamilton.

“It is important that we move on from these situations, it is dealt with strongly, which it has been and we move forward,” Gerrard explained.

“Is he going to be perfect? No. Is he going to make mistakes and frustrate me from time to time, possibly.

“But I need to make sure I do the right thing for him and the club in this situation and that’s what I felt I have done,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gerrard-all-set-to-stay-with-rangers.html
194,04-3-20,"Juve, Milan aim for cup glory","Juventus and Inter Milan can get their seasons back on track with Italian Cup semi-final return-legs midweek, which take place amid Serie A fixture chaos caused by the coronavirus.

Locked in a battle for the league title the pair have been overtaken by surprise package Lazio as the city of Rome remains relatively untouched by COVID-19.

Inter, who travel to Napoli tomorrow hoping to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg at the San Siro, haven’t played in Italy since being beaten at Lazio on February 16 as the virus concentrated in the Lombardy and Veneto regions.

Their home match against Sampdoria and the weekend’s schedule title clash with Juve were both postponed, provoking a furious reaction from the club’s CEO Beppe Marotta, who wanted the match played behind closed doors.

Two Europa League last 32 matches against Ludogorets is all Inter have had for preparation in that time, and their disrupted schedule comes in the midst of a dip in domestic form that has left the former league leaders third behind Lazio and traditional rivals Juve.

They face stiff opposition in Napoli, who look a side reborn since Gennaro Gattuso replaced Carlo Ancelotti as coach in December.

They have surged up the Serie A table into sixth and impressed when they held Barcelona to a draw at the Stadio San Paolo in midweek.

The reigning league champions meanwhile host AC Milan in the other semi-final today in a match that will be open to the public, or at least a portion of it.

They face a Milan side whose only defeat in 2020 so far came against Inter in a thrilling derby last month and who were unlucky to come away from the first leg with only a 1-1 draw.

However Maurizio Sarri’s side will be favourites despite ropey recent form that has seen them lose to Napoli and Hellas Verona and scrape past relegation fodder Brescia and SPAL.

Their 1-0 defeat to Lyon in the Champions League led to questions over Sarri’s future on the Juve bench, and should Milan reach the final with a first ever win at the Allianz Stadium the calls for his dismissal will only become louder.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/juve--milan-aim-for-cup-glory.html
195,04-3-20,Gunners reloaded,"Arteta gamble pays off as Arsenal FA Cup win eases Euro woe

Mikel Arteta admitted he took a risk by making nine changes for Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Portsmouth in the FA Cup fifth round but insisted he had no choice because some of his stars were still shell-shocked after their Europa League exit.

Arteta’s side reached the FA Cup quarter-finals thanks to goals from Sokratis Papastathopoulos in first-half injury time and Eddie Nketiah six minutes after the break at Fratton Park on Monday.

It was a much-needed boost for Arsenal, who crashed out of the Europe League in a painful last-gasp defeat against Olympiakos on Thursday.

Arteta conceded that fielding such an inexperienced line-up — only David Luiz and Bukayo Saka retained their places — could have put Arsenal’s only chance of silverware this season in jeopardy.

“They fully deserve the chance and I know it is risky to play them in this competition but they are worth a risk,” Arteta said of his young side.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was in tears after missing a costly late chance against Olympiakos, and Mesut Ozil were both absent, while Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe were on the bench.

“I assessed the team and physically some of them were knackered, some of them had issues, some of them mentally were hanging on what happened that day.

“So I tried to pick the right team knowing how they were and I made the most of it. If you win, it is okay but if we had lost obviously it would have been the wrong decision.

Focus, desire

“The energy, the focus and the willingness and desire to play in this competition is really important.”

One sour note for Arsenal came when Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira was taken off injured on a stretcher just 15 minutes into the game and left Fratton Park on crutches.

“He was in a lot of pain, he is in a brace at the moment,” said Arteta.

“He will be assessed in the next few days and we will know more. I don’t know if it’s the bone or ligaments, we don’t know yet.”

Portsmouth manager Kenny Jackett said Arsenal were worthy of their place in the next round after surviving an early barrage from the third-tier promotion chasers.

“I felt that we put quite a lot of pressure on them in the first half,” he said.

“We needed one of those moments to go for us but fair play to them, they got the blocks and we couldn’t make those moments tell.

“I’m disappointed with the first goal and the timing of it, we really needed to go in at half-time 0-0 and build it up for the second half,” he said of conceding deep into first-half stoppage time.

“Fair play to my players, they never gave up and didn’t buckle — Arsenal have deserved to win the game but we are proud of what we have done in the competition and are still doing well in the league.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gunners-reloaded-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gunners-reloaded.html
196,04-3-20,"CSK has made me better player, helped tackle difficult times: Dhoni","Gearing up for a return to competitive cricket with the IPL, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni credited his franchise for making him a better player and helping him tackle some difficult situations both on and off the field.

Dhoni, who has been on a sabbatical since India's semifinal exit from the ODI World Cup last year, on Monday received a rousing reception at the the MA Chidambaram Stadium here during his first training session with CSK ahead of the event beginning March 29.

""...CSK has helped me improve in everything, whether it was being a human being or being a cricketer, handling situations that are tough both in and out of the field and how to be humble once you are doing well,"" Dhoni was quoted as saying on a Star Sports show.

His ardent CSK fans fondly call him 'Thala', and the 38-year-old said the love and respect he has got from them is special.

""'Thala' basically means brother, so for me it's more the abstract of the fans, the love and affection towards me is the reflection of that,"" he said.

""Whenever I am in Chennai or down South they never call me by my name, they address me as 'Thala' and the moment someone calls me 'Thala' they are showing their love and respect but at the same time he is a CSK fan.""

Ex-India batsman and former national team batting coach Sanjay Bangar said the break Dhoni had taken could help him reinvent himself.

""It is tough to find rhythm initially but it can also be a huge advantage. When you are playing international cricket, the amount of pressure you are under, you sort of getting into a tunnel vision with regard to various responsibility and the needs of the team.

""So from a player perspective, if he has taken a break for 6-7 months, he has a good chance to rediscover, refresh and reinvent.""

There has been never-ending speculation on Dhoni's career but the wicket-keeper batsman, who led India to two world titles, has maintained a stoic silence on what his next move would be.

He was dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players in January.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/csk-has-made-me-better-player--helped-tackle-difficult-times--dhoni-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/csk-has-made-me-better-player--helped-tackle-difficult-times--dhoni.html

199,04-3-20,‘One must manage finances smartly to study abroad’,"Pursuing education abroad can be expensive. ROHIT SETHI shares tips on what students and parents can do to ease the burden

That feeling of excitement when you receive an email in your inbox reading — Congratulations! Your application for study-abroad programme has been accepted is beyond explanation. However, pursing education abroad can be costly. Studying and living abroad can help individuals grow mature only if they can learn and master the art of finance management. Let’s take a quick look at how all of it can be smartly planned.

Funding options offered by banks and financial institutions: Parents usually start saving up early and accumulate a large sum of money to meet the expenses of their children studying overseas. They invest in long-term low-risk financial scheme to save big but it is not sufficient to fund overseas education. Education loans come as a saviour here to bear a majority of the expenses. Banks have started providing education loans of more than `7 lakh at a comparatively lower interest rate of 10-11% per annum. Meanwhile, university-sanctioned educational loans have a relatively lower interest rate of around 7%. However, loan-payment tenure is longer in the US. So, it is essential to do an extensive research before applying for an education loan to secure the best possible interest rate and get the repayment burden reduced for future.

Opting for part-time jobs: Part-time working can be a great option to manage personal and living expenses abroad while studying. Many universities provide on-campus part-time work and other internship opportunities across the city to international students as an effort to ease their financial pressure. Such part-time jobs on or outside the campus do not let the students compromise on their university schedule. Most of these jobs don’t require much effort and pay well.

Studying abroad will always be on higher side but students belonging to middle-income group families don’t have to give up on their dream of studying abroad. A little planning is all it takes to manage the finances.

Water Conclave 2020 at IIT Roorkee

The Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IIT Roorkee) organised the three-day Roorkee Water Conclave (RWC) in collaboration with National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee (NIH Roorkee). The focus of RWC-2020 was on Hydrological Aspects of Climate Change.

With industry 5.0 in the offing, the massive impact on global climate and aquatic resources cannot be denied. Freshwater sources across the world are squeezing by the day, and it has become pertinent to come up with a solution to this burgeoning crisis.

The paucity of water would affect the entire globe, but it would have a scalding impact on the developing economies due to their dependence on agriculture that is a water-intensive activity.

Scaling processes for their conservation to basin level would create an impact on in the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries.”

Carey, who was a part of Australia’s World Cup team last summer, will make his debut in the cash-rich IPL this season after the Delhi based franchise purchased him for Rs 2.40 crore in the player auction.

“I can’t wait, even if I’m not playing, to just sit alongside him (Ponting) and chat cricket with him.

“Delhi are really strong at the top with the openers and Rishabh Pant at number four so if there’s an opportunity, it’d be at five or six. Which is great for me, if I can keep improving my game in the subcontinent.”

“Delhi’s a nice spinning wicket so there will be some work to do when we get over there,” he added.

202,04-3-20,Eng to ditch handshakes in SL: Root,"England captain Joe Root on Monday said his players will not be shaking hands on their tour of Sri Lanka in a bid to avoid the coronavirus.

Root was quizzed on the coronavirus on Monday as England prepared to depart for their two-Test tour.

The Yorkshire batsman said instead of shaking hands, England players will greet each other with fist bumps.

England were hit by a series of gastroenteritis and flu problems before and during the first Test on their recent tour of South Africa.

“After the illnesses that swept through the squad in South Africa, we are well aware of the importance of keeping contact to a minimum and we’ve been given some really sound and sensible advice from our medical team to help prevent spreading germs and bacteria,” Root said.

“We are not shaking hands with each other, using instead the well-established fist bump, and we are washing hands regularly and wiping down surfaces using the anti-bacterial wipes and gels we’ve been given in our immunity packs.

“There is no suggestion that the tour will be affected, but of course it is an evolving situation so we are in regular contact with the authorities and will proceed as advised, but at this stage we fully expect the tour to continue as planned.”

England will play the first of two practice games against a Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI in Katunayake on Saturday ahead of the Tests, which will form part of the ICC World Test C’ship.

England won 3-0 in Sri Lanka two years ago but Root is expecting a tougher challenge this time.

“The conditions will be a bit different with the time of year we are going this time,” he said.

204,04-3-20,Sunil Joshi named selection committee chairman,"Former India spinner Sunil Joshi was on Wednesday named chairman of the national selection panel by the BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), which also picked ex-pacer Harvinder Singh in the five-member group.

The CAC, comprising Madan Lal, R P Singh and Sulakshana Naik, named the two selectors. Joshi replaces MSK Prasad (South Zone), who had an extended run after completing his four-year tenure.

""The committee recommended Mr Sunil Joshi for the role of Chairman of the senior men's selection committee,"" read a statement from BCCI Secretary Jay Shah.

In an unprecedented decision, the BCCI said the CAC will review the panel's performance after one year and ""make recommendations"" accordingly.

Harvinder was chosen from central zone and replaces Gagan Khoda in the panel.

The existing members of the selection panel are Jatain Paranjpe (West), Devang Gandhi (East) and Sarandeep Singh (North).

""We have picked the best guys for the job. We picked them (Joshi and Harvinder) because they were clear in their views,"" Lal told PTI.

Specifically on Joshi, Lal said: ""We liked his straight-forward attitude. He is experienced also (having been part of the Bangladesh support staff)"".

The CAC had shortlisted five candidates for interviews -- Joshi, Harvinder, Venkatesh Prasad, Rajesh Chauhan and L S Sivaramakrishnan -- from a list of 40 applicants.

The likes of Ajit Agarkar and Nayan Mongia did not even make the short-list but the former will be back in contention after Paranjpe's term ends in September along with Gandhi and Sarandeep.

Joshi's selection from South Zone and Harvinder getting picked from Central Zone also shows that the Board has stuck with the zonal policy.

Their predecessors, Prasad and Khoda, who were appointed back in 2015 and given an extension last November.

The 49-year-old Joshi played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs between 1996 and 2001, taking 41 and 69 wickets respectively.

Harvinder, who is 42, represented India in three Tests and 16 ODIs between 1998 and 2001, taking four and 24 scalps respectively.

The playing credentials of the Prasad-led panel were often questioned and this time too, the CAC decided to pick Joshi and Harvinder over more experienced candidates.

In the media interaction held after the announcement, Lal said the BCCI office-bearers, including president Sourav Ganguly, gave the CAC a free hand in choosing the candidates.

""Ganguly did not even say a word,"" added Lal.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sunil-joshi-named-selection-committee-chairman-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sunil-joshi-named-selection-committee-chairman.html

The mercy petition of Pawan has been rejected by the President, a Home Ministry official said.

A 23-year-old woman paramedic student, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya -- the fearless -- was gang-raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012. She succumbed to injuries on December 29 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore where she was taken for better medical treatment.

A total of six people -- Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Kumar Singh, Pawan Kumar Gupta, Ram Singh and a juvenile -- were convicted in the gang rape and murder of the paramedic student here.

The President has already rejected the mercy petitions of Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay.

211,04-3-20,Delhi govt moves court seeking fresh date for execution of 4 Nirbhaya case convicts,"The Delhi government on Wednesday moved a city court seeking a fresh date for execution of the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, after President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the last remaining mercy plea in the case.

According to Delhi Prison Rules, a 14-day period has to be given to a death row convict after the dismissal of a clemency plea before the prisoner can be hanged. All the four men are to be hanged together.

A Union Home Ministry official said President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petition of 25-year-old Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four condemned prisoners.

The Delhi government told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana that all legal remedies of the convicts have been exhausted and nothing survives now.

The judge then directed the convicts to file their response by tomorrow even as the lawyer for the prosecution said no notice was required.

While issuing the notice, the court said principles of natural justice are part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and the sacrosanct principle of ""Audi alteram partem"" (listen to the other side) cannot be ignored.

The hanging of Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) besides Pawan previously scheduled for March 3 was deferred for the third time in six weeks by the court on Monday in yet another twist in the case marked by apparent delaying tactics by the condemned prisoners. The President has already rejected the mercy petitions of Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay.

The court on Monday postponed the hanging till further orders.

Nirbhaya's father expressed the hope that the convicts will be hanged this month.

""He(Pawan) has one option left -- that is to challenge the mercy plea in Supreme Court as the others have done. Let's see what happens next, but we are confident of getting justice,"" he told PTI over phone.

""We are hopeful that the convicts will be hanged this month and justice will be finally delivered to us after a long wait,"" he said.

The first date of execution--January 22--fixed on January 7 was postponed by the court to February 1. But on January 31, the court indefinitely postponed the hanging. On February 17, the court again issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 am.

The Delhi High Court, meanwhile, declined to entertain a plea seeking directions to the National Human Rights Commission(NHRC) to intervene and enquire into the mental and physical state of the four death row convicts.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said the petition was not maintainable as it should have been first filed before the NHRC.

Asking the petitioner to move the NHRC, the bench disposed of his plea.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.

The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

The case has witnessed a series of twists and turns right after a Delhi court on September 13, 2013 awarded the death sentence to the four convicts, less than one year after the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Review petitions and curative petitions were then filed in a staggered manner in the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court order on March 13, 2014 confirming the death sentence. The last option of mercy petition before the President to escape the gallows was exercised by the convicts one by one.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-govt-moves-court-seeking-fresh-date-for-execution-of-4-nirbhaya-case-convicts-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-govt-moves-court-seeking-fresh-date-for-execution-of-4-nirbhaya-case-convicts.html

The army chief pointed out that Chinese dominance in the South China Sea showed small incremental steps achieved the aim without firing a single shot or inviting retaliatory action.

214,04-3-20,SC allows pleas against RBI circular barring banks from providing services related to cryptocurrency,"The Supreme Court Wednesday allowed banks and financial institutions to provide services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI circular of 2018 which had prohibited them.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of ""proportionality"".

""Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,"" said the bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.

""When the consistent stand of RBI is that they have not banned VCs (virtual currencies) and when the Government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals including two draft bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate,"" the bench said in its 180-page verdict.

The apex court delivered the verdict on pleas challenging the RBI circular.

According to the circular, the entities regulated by the RBI were prohibited from ""providing any service in relation to virtual currencies including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or sale of virtual currencies"".

The court said there is no doubt that RBI has very wide powers not only in view of the statutory scheme, but also in view of the special place and role it has in the economy of the country.

These powers can be exercised both in the form of preventive as well as curative measures but the availability of power is different from the manner and extent to which it can be exercised, it said.

The petitioner, Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), had argued in the top court that the RBI had banned cryptocurrencies on ""moral grounds"" as no prior studies were conducted to analyse their effect on the economy.

It had contended that the RBI barred all the entities regulated by it from providing services to any individual or business dealing in virtual currencies.

Regarding the petitioners' comparison with other countries on the issue, the bench said in its judgement that the judicial decision cannot be coloured by what other countries have done or not done.

The court said the petitioners argument that most of the countries, except China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, UAE, have not imposed a ban (total or partial) may not take them anywhere as the list of nations where such a ban has been imposed discloses a commonality.

""Almost all countries in the neighbourhood of India have adopted the same or similar approach (in essence India is ring fenced). In any case, our judicial decision cannot be coloured by what other countries have done or not done.

""Comparative perspective helps only in relation to principles of judicial decision making and not for testing the validity of an action taken based on the existing statutory scheme,"" it said.

There can also be no comparison with the approach adopted by countries such as UK, US, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Canada as they have developed economies capable of absorbing greater shocks, the bench said.

""Indian economic conditions cannot be placed on par. Therefore, we will not test the correctness of the measure taken by RBI on the basis of the approach adopted by other countries, though we have, for better understanding of the complexities of the issues involved, undertaken a survey of how the regulators and courts of other countries have treated VCs,' it said.

The court said persons who have suffered a deadly blow from the RBI's circular are only those running VC exchanges and not even those who are trading in VCs.

""Persons trading in VCs, even now have different options.... But the VC exchanges do not appear to have found out any other means of survival (at least as of now) if they are disconnected from the banking channels,"" it said.

The court also said that as on date VCs are not banned, but the trading in VCs and the functioning of VC exchanges are sent to comatose by the RBI's circular by disconnecting their lifeline, that is, the interface with the regular banking sector.

The court noted that the RBI's concern is about the entities regulated by it and till now, it has not come out with a stand that any of the entities regulated by it, be it nationalised banks/ scheduled commercial banks/ cooperative banks or NBFCs, has suffered any loss or adverse effect directly or indirectly, on account of the interface that the VC exchanges had with any of them.

It is not the case of RBI that any of the entities regulated by it has suffered on account of the provision of banking services to the online platforms running VC exchanges, it added.

In 2013, the RBI in an advisory cautioned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks that they were exposing themselves to.

On July 3, 2018 while hearing IMAI's plea, the top court had refused to stay the RBI circular prohibiting banks and financial institutions from dealing with the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-allows-pleas-against-rbi-circular-barring-banks-from-providing-services-related-to-cryptocurrency-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-allows-pleas-against-rbi-circular-barring-banks-from-providing-services-related-to-cryptocurrency.html

216,04-3-20,"Tahir Hussain bail: Court summons SIT, defers hearing","A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned concerned Special Investigating Team (SIT) officer probing the case related to suspended Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain.

Hussain, who is absconding, has been in the eye of a major controversy for his alleged involvement in the recent violence in Delhi's northeast area and the killing of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer whose body was recovered from a drain near his house.

Anticipating arrest, Hussain had moved a bail application on Tuesday.

Uttar Pradesh Congress minority cell president Shahnawaz Alam has said that by not standing in support of Azam Khan, the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has sent out clear signals about his future politics.

""It is shameful that a leader who has given thirty years of his life to a party is being isolated in this manner. If the SP cannot stand behind one of its tallest leaders, then how can the party be expected to protect the minorities who are often implicated in false criminal cases?""

The Congress now wants to project a pro-minority image by lashing out against the Samajwadi Party which, till now, had been considered a custodian of minorities, especially Muslims.

Mohd Azam Khan's brother-in-law Zameer Ahmed Khan had told reporters outside Sitapur jail on Monday that, ""The SP MP is disturbed by the fact that the party did not stand by him when the state government started targeting him soon after BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh. It was only later that some senior leaders spoke about it.""

Zameer Ahmad Khan said the senior SP leader is so upset with the party that he is not willing to meet other party leaders who are visiting him. He said that the veteran leader is feeling cheated by party's attitude even though SP president Akhilesh Yadav visited him in Sitapur jail the day he was shifted from Rampur prison.

SP MP Mohd Azam Khan has been facing more than 84 criminal cases related to land encroachment, land grabbing, book theft, buffalo theft, goat theft, power theft etc.

He, along with his wife Tanzeen Fatima and son Abdullah Azam, were arrested last month on February 26 after they surrendered in a Rampur court in connection with forgery of birth documents of Abdullah Azam, who has already been disqualified as member of the UP assembly on the same grounds.

The family was shifted to Sitapur jail the next day and their bail application in a district court was also rejected on Monday.

222,04-3-20,"UN body challenges CAA in SC; MEA asks, who’re you?","India slams move, says it’s internal matter, UN has no locus standi

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in an unprecedented move, has approached the Supreme Court of India on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying there is a need to take into account the “international human rights law, norms and standards” in the proceedings. India has criticised the UN body’s move.

India’s Permanent Mission in Geneva was informed on Monday evening by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet that her office has filed an intervention application in the Supreme Court on the amended citizenship law, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said in response to queries on Tuesday.

The intervention plea in which High Commissioner, former Chile President Michelle Bachelet, seeks to be made party in a case against the CAA has said differentiations “drawn by the law are not” sufficiently objective and reasonable”.

Strongly making India’s position clear while opposing the UN Commissioner’s move, Kumar said, “The CAA is an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of Indian Parliament to make laws. We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty.”

Reacting to the development, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel attacked the Government over the issue saying it is “unwarranted interference” but it is the Modi dispensation that is to be blamed for the “mess”.

“No doubt that UN’s intervening application is a case of unwarranted interference in our matters,” Patel said in a tweet. “But who is to blame for this mess? The Government of India for creating a window for such interference by enacting a law which breaches global standards on human rights,” the Congress treasurer said.

Meanwhile, the MEA Spokesperson said India is clear that the CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of its constitutional values. “It is reflective of our long standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of the Partition of India,” he said.

“India is a democratic country governed by the rule of law. We all have utmost respect for and full trust in our independent judiciary. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position will be vindicated by the Supreme Court,” Kumar said.

The External Affairs Ministry response also said the CAA “constitutionally valid” and upholds human rights values. Meanwhile, when asked whether the UN body can approach the Supreme Court, an official said it was for the Supreme Court to decide.

Shortly after it was passed, the United Nations said it was fundamentally discriminatory in nature. A spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said it would “have a discriminatory

effect on people’s access to nationality.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-body-challenges-caa-in-sc--mea-asks--who---re-you--2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/un-body-challenges-caa-in-sc--mea-asks--who---re-you-.html
223,04-3-20,"House proceedings washed out as BJP, Cong stick to guns","Both Houses adjourned for day over riots

Parliament on Tuesday saw continued logjam over the Opposition’s demand for resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah over the Delhi communal violence. With neither side ready to blink first, there is little hope of resumption of proceedings any sooner.

The BJP and Opposition members tried to shove each other in the Lok Sabha amid demands for an immediate discussion on the Delhi riot as the Government said it is ready for it on March 11 after Holi.

BJP woman MP Sangita Singh Dev said she was pushed by Congress MP Ramya Haridas and Jyothimani in the post-lunch Session. She said she had filed a complaint with the Speaker.

Both the Houses were adjourned for the day as order could not be restored in the House with the Opposition seeking discussion on Delhi riots. The Lok Sabha did transact some business amid the din, but the Upper House saw a complete washout.

After Speaker Om Birla told the Lok Sabha during the post-lunch Session that the discussion would take place on March 11 after Holi festival, Opposition members stormed into the Well demanding an immediate discussion.

As tempers in the House rose, Birla warned that the unruly members will be suspended for the entire session.

However, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury walked over to the side of the Well facing the Treasury Benches, which led to a commotion between the BJP and Opposition members.

Other Opposition party members too followed Chowdhury towards the Treasury Benches and a commotion broke out as BJP members blocked their way.

Pushed by Congress women members, Dev was held by Union Minister Smiriti Irani.BJP MP from West Bengal Locket Chatterjee was seen having heated arguments with Chowdhury, and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tried to pacify them. Amid the din in which the BJP and the Congress members tried to shove each other and some members banged the door leading to the secretary general’s desk, Birla adjourned the House for the day. After the adjournment, Irani was seen engaged in a heated argument with Opposition members over the banging of the door as other BJP member sought to pacify her.

Earlier in the day, Opposition members’ demand for immediate discussion on the issue of Delhi violence led to the Speaker adjourning the House twice. As the House met at 2 pm, Birla said he has spoken to members from the Treasury Benches as well as the Opposition and they have agreed to accept what the Speaker decides.

Even as Opposition members raised slogans of “down down BJP”, “save India”, and some tore papers and threw them in the Well, Birla continued with the proceedings of the House and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The pandemonium led to the adjournment of the House for the day. Earlier in the day, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the Government was ready for a debate on the issue during Zero Hour but the Opposition sought an immediate discussion.

Emphasising that “restoration of peace and normalcy” is the topmost priority of the Government, Joshi said, “charcha ke liye taiyyar hai (we are ready for discussions)”. However, Opposition members were not satisfied and demanded that there should be an immediate discussion. In response, Joshi said the Speaker should decide. A this stage the Speaker said it would be better if discussion takes place after Holi on March 11.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/house-proceedings-washed-out-as-bjp---cong-stick-to-guns-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/house-proceedings-washed-out-as-bjp---cong-stick-to-guns.html
224,04-3-20,PM to dedicate social media ac,"Ending speculation of more than 16 hours over his tweet that he is thinking of giving up his social media accounts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday afternoon said he will hand over his accounts on such platforms to women “who inspire” on Sunday — March 8, celebrated as International Women’s Day.

“This Women’s Day (March 8), I will give away my social media accounts to women whose life & work inspire us,” he tweeted.

“This will help them ignite motivation in millions. Are you such a woman or do you know such inspiring women? Share such stories using #SheInspiresUs,” he tweeted.

Modi’s Monday late night tweet triggered f rumours that he is thinking of leaving social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram., etc. “This Sunday, thinking of giving up my social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube. Will keep you all posted,” said PM on Monday around 9 pm.

While some wondered whether he was thinking of quitting social media as he was fed up with the menace of fake news, others suggested that India might launch a China-type indigenous social media platforms. In about an hour, the tweet was retweeted over 26,000 times.

The Prime Minister is one of the most-followed world leaders on social media with 53.3 million followers on Twitter, 44 million on Facebook and 35.2 million on Instagram. The Twitter handle of Prime Minister’s Office has 32 million followers.

225,04-3-20,"Father, daughter held for sheltering Pulwama bombers","In a major breakthrough in the ongoing investigation in the Pulwama terror attack case in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in an IED blast on February 14, 2019, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested a father-daughter duo who facilitated the terrorists from Hakripora village of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district.

The accused have been identified as 50-year-old tipper driver Tariq Ahmad Shah and his 23-year-old daughter Insha Jan.

Confirming their arrest, the NIA issued a statement claiming, during initial interrogation, accused Shah has disclosed that his house at Hakripora, Pulwama, was used by suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, Mohd Umar Farooq, a Pakistani terrorist and IED maker, Kamran another Pakistani terrorist, Sameer Ahmad Dar, a Jaish-e-Mohammad ultra and Mohd Ismail, a Pakistani terrorist.

Insha was in constant touch with Farooq over telephone and other social media applications for the attack.

“His house was also used by the terrorists for preparing and recording of video of suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, which was released by JeM soon after the Pulwama attack”, NIA statement added.

Referring to the role of 23-year-old daughter of Insha, NIA statement claimed, “Insha Jan facilitated the terrorists at their home and provided food and other logistics during their stay on more than 15 occasions for 2-4 days each time, in their house during 2018-19.

The father daughter duo were arrested by the NIA close on the heels of arrest of Jaish-e-Mohammad over ground worker (OGW), Shakir Bashir Magrey, a resident of Hajibal, Kakapora in Pulwama. Magrey, owner of a furniture shop too had provided shelter and other logistics assistance to the suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar. He was introduced to Adil in mid 2018 by a Pakistani terrorist Mohd Umar Farooq and he became a full time OGW of JeM.

During the investigation, Magrey too had revealed that he had collected and delivered arms, ammunition, cash, and explosive materials to JeM terrorists, including those who were tasked for Pulwama suicide bombing. Magrey accepted that he had given shelter to Adil and Pakistani terrorist Umar in his house from late 2018 till the attack in February 2019, and assisted them in the preparation of the improvised explosive device (IED).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/father--daughter-held-for-sheltering-pulwama-bombers.html
226,04-3-20,India's UN Women's Day programme cancelled because of COVID-19,"An International Women's Day programme organised by India at the UN has been cancelled as world organisations curtail meetings to protect against the COVID-19 threat.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath was scheduled to hold a dialogue on Monday in honour of Hansa Mehta, one of the framers of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in conjunction with the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) that has been suspended.

""Women's Economic Empowerment and Inclusive Global Economic Growth"" was the theme of the dialogue that has been cancelled, according to a diplomat at India's UN Mission which organised it along with UN Academic Impact.

Gopinath's IMF and the World Bank (WB) announced on Tuesday that they are going to hold virtual meetings as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus instead of requiring the physical presence of participants.

The international economic organisations' heads, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF and David Malpass of the WB, announced the switch for their high-level spring meetings that were to run from April 13 to 19 in Washington with finance ministers and central bankers attending.

""Our goal is to serve our membership effectively while ensuring the health and safety of Spring Meetings participants and staff,"" they said in a joint statement.

The WB had earlier said that 2,800 delegates from member countries, 350 observers, 550 civil society organisation representatives and 800 journalists usually attend the annual spring meetings.

The spring meetings include several side events like seminars, civil society meetings and cultural events, all of which have been cancelled.

The IMF said that for the virtual meetings format it ""will leverage our IT and virtual connections capabilities to the fullest, complemented by our online platforms (such as the World Bank Group and IMF websites and social media accounts), online media briefing centres, and other means of digital communications.""

The CSW said it decided to cancel its 64th session at the suggestion of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who advised against travel to New York for the meeting that was to have run from March 9 to 20 with about 7,000 participants from governments and civil society groups.

The session was to have been a landmark meeting as this year marks the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the women's Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.

The Commission said that after a procedural meeting that will include opening statements, the adoption of a draft political declaration and consideration of draft resolutions, and other sessions and programmes will be suspended.

Guterres's Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that he made the recommendation after consulting the Senior Emergency Policy Team, UN Medical Services and the World Health Organisation.

Mehta is credited with making the Declaration of Human rights gender-inclusive by insisting that the first article say that ""all human beings are born free"" instead of only ""all mena as the draft said.

UN Academic Impact, which co-organised the Mehta dialogue, works with higher education institutions to promote the UN's goals.

227,04-3-20,"Aircel-Maxis case: HC grants time to Chidambaram, son to reply to ED plea against anticipatory bail","The Delhi High Court Wednesday granted time to former finance minister P Chidambaram and his son Karti to respond to the Enforcement Directorate's plea challenging their anticipatory bail in the Aircel-Maxis case.

Justice Anu Malhotra allowed the oral prayer of Chidambarams' counsel seeking more time to file the reply to ED's plea.

The court directed the Chidambarams, represented through senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and lawyer Arshdeep Singh, to file their reply within three weeks and asked the ED to place on record its rejoinder, if any, two weeks thereafter. The court listed the matter for further hearing on May 12.

Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan and advocate Mallika Hiremath, representing the ED, submitted that the court had issued notice to Chidambaram and his son on October 11 last year to file response to the agency's plea, however, they have not yet done so.

The ED had earlier contended that the special judge pronounced its order granting anticipatory bail to the Chidambarams on September 5, 2019 without considering the Supreme Court's order which had come on the same day in the INX Media case.

The probe agency had said the trial court failed to appreciate that custodial interrogation of the accused was required and its finding the offence not grave enough was completely perverse and untenable in law.

It had contended that in the Aircel-Maxis case, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) the approval sought was for Rs 3,500-crore which was beyond the jurisdiction of the finance minister, still it was approved by Chidambaram.

It had said the father-son duo should not be granted pre-arrest bail as some witnesses are common in the Aircel-Maxis and the INX Media cases and the investigation could be hampered.

The trial court had also granted anticipatory bail to them in the Aircel Maxis case filed by the CBI.

The ED, in its plea, has contended that the pre-arrest bail in a case of economic offence was unwarranted and urged the high court to set aside the trial court's order granting relief to Chidambarams and cancel their anticipatory bail.

It has claimed that the two remained evasive during the investigation and there is a likelihood that they could tamper with the evidence and influence witnesses.

It has said the position of Chidambaram and his son that they are members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha cannot be a legally tenable ground to grant them anticipatory bail.

The CBI is probing how Chidambaram, being the finance minister in 2006, granted FIPB approval to a foreign firm, when only the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) was empowered to do it.

The ED is probing a money laundering case in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which the Chidambarams have been questioned by the agency.

While granting anticipatory bail to the Chidambarams, the trial court had said the charges against them were not of grave magnitude as the alleged money laundered is a ""paltry amount"" of Rs 1.13 crore compared to the money purportedly received by accused already discharged in the cases.

It had, however, directed the Chidambarams to join the probe in the cases lodged by the two agencies and said that in the event of arrest, they be released on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and one surety of like amount.

In the INX Media case, the CBI had registered an FIR on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in the FIPB clearance granted to the media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram's tenure as the finance minister.

Thereafter, the ED lodged a money laundering case in this regard in 2017.

Chidambaram has approached the Supreme Court seeking bail in the INX Media case lodged by CBI after the Delhi High Court on September 30, 2019, denied him the relief.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aircel-maxis-case--hc-grants-time-to-chidambaram--son-to-reply-to-ed-plea-against-anticipatory-bail-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/aircel-maxis-case--hc-grants-time-to-chidambaram--son-to-reply-to-ed-plea-against-anticipatory-bail.html

Two separate delegations of Congress leaders visited different areas in northeast Delhi.

The delegation led by Gandhi included K C Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, K Suresh, Mukul Wasnik, Kumari Selja, Gaurav Gogoi and Randeep Surjewala.

This delegation visited a private school in the Brijpuri area of northeast Delhi that was vandalised and burnt during the riots.

Arun Modern Public Senior Secondary School, which is over 32 years old, suffered massive damage and the Congress delegation went around the gutted classrooms and surveyed the burnt busses.

Speaking with reporters, Gandhi said, ""This (school) is India's future. Hate and violence has destroyed it. Nobody has benefited from this. Violence and hate are enemies of development.""

""India is being divided, burnt. This will not benefit Bharat Mata,"" he said.

Gandhi along with other leaders also visited a mosque near the school that was affected in the violence.

Sources said the Delhi Police advised Gandhi not to go beyond the Brijpuri Nullah.

The other delegation, comprising mostly MPs, left in a bus from the Kerala House here and included Hibi Eden, Gurjeet Singh Aujla and Abdul Khaleque.

Their first stop was Chand Bagh where they met shopkeepers and asked them about the losses they suffered.

The Congress has demanded that the issue of communal riots in Delhi be debated in Parliament and proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been disrupted over the issue.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi last week had deputed a five-member team to visit the riot-affected areas of Delhi and submit a report to her after assessing the situation there.

All international passengers will henceforth be screened at airports, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at a press conference. Earlier, travellers from only 12 countries were screened at airports for the disease that has claimed over 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 worldwide.

Seventeen Indians abroad have been infected, 16 from a cruise ship in Japan ""being treated at onshore medical facilities"" and one from the United Arab Emirates, the Ministry of External Affairs said.

With Holi less than a week away on March 10, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president J P Nadda and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said they would not celebrate the festival of colours or hold any Holi Milan gathering. President Ram Nath Kovind's office also said Rashtrapati Bhavan will not hold any Holi gathering.

""Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence this year, I have decided not to participate in any 'Holi milan' programme,"" the prime minister tweeted.

Giving a break-up of the cases in the country, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said one patient is from Delhi, six more, his relatives, are from Agra, one is from Telangana and there are 16 Italians as well as their Indian driver in Rajasthan. The figure includes three earlier cases in Kerala who have been discharged.

The minister said the government has adopted a cluster approach, as part of which health authorities will check and sensitise every household within a three kilometre radius of the house of the infected person.

The government also intends to set up a laboratory in Iran so Indians there can be tested for possible exposure to the virus before being brought back, he said. An estimated 1,200 Indians, mostly students and pilgrims, are in Iran.

As Indians all over came to grips with the global epidemic, the health crisis was discussed at a meeting of the Union cabinet. Union minister Prakash Javadekar said over six lakh people had been screened for coronavirus symptoms in 21 airports.

Briefing reporters, the Information and Broadcasting minister said more than 10 lakh people entering India from the open borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar have also been screened.

While only the virology institute based in Pune is fit for conducting coronavirus tests, the government has now set up 15 more labs and is in the process of establishing 19 additional centres, he said.

""The government is proactively engaged in dealing with coronavirus. The prime minister is monitoring the situation daily,"" he said.

Several state governments, including in Rajasthan and Delhi, screened visitors and others for the disease in hotels and guesthouses.

With 16 Italian tourists, who came to Rajasthan by road from Delhi, testing positive, the desert state swung into action to contain the infection.

State Health Minister Raghu Sharma said in the assembly that at least 215 people had come into contact with the group. These included 53 people in Jhunjhunu, 14 each in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer, 44 in Bikaner, six in Udaipur and 76 people in Jaipur.

Swab samples of 93 people were taken with 51 suspected patients tested negative whereas reports of 41 others are still pending, he said.

He said Italy has the third largest number of coronavirus cases in the world (more than 2,500) and the tourists should have been screened earlier.

A 69-year-old man was the first one in the group to test positive for the disease. Subsequently, his wife, too, tested positive at Jaipur's Sawai Man Singh Hospital, where the couple is now admitted.

The other 14 members of the group and their Indian driver have been quarantined at the ITBP camp in Chhawla.

In Delhi, Kejriwal said efforts are on to check and screen 88 people who came in contact with the Delhi man who tested positive for coronavirus.

Vardhan said the 45-year-old man from Mayur Vihar and six of his relatives from Agra whom he recently visited are being treated at the Safdarjung hospital.

Kejriwal said a taskforce headed by him has been formed to tackle the situation emerging from the coronavirus infection.

""We are concerned about situation but no need to panic,"" he said.

A coronavirus testing lab will be set up at the Lady Hardinge Hospital and also at the LNJP Hospital if necessary, Kejriwal said.

As the coronavirus came perilously close to home and dos and don'ts about the disease were circulated, some advocated that the Indian way of greeting, the Namaste, was the way to go. Many people went into panic mode and started stocking up on hand sanitisers and masks.

Many shops, including in the national capital, said stocks of both had run out.

However, Kejriwal said there is no shortage of masks.

In Rajasthan, too, purchase orders have been given for 50,000 personal protective equipment kits and five lakh each of N95 and triple layer masks to deal with the problem, Rajasthan minister Sharma said.

Many schools in the National Capital Region said they were fumigating and sanitising their premises.

232,04-3-20,"China virus steps up attack, triggers chaos","India readies for defence, Italian couple quarantined in Jaipur, 6 suspected cases in Agra

The coronovirus (COVID-19) scare spread fast across the country on Tuesday as an Italian tourist in Jaipur tested positive for the virus, six suspicious cases were reported from Agra, while Hyatt hotel in the national Capital sent its restaurant staff for self quarantine.

Air India asked passengers who travelled with the patient from Italy to volunteer for self-screening, and IndiGo airline sent for home observation four of its crew members, who were on a Dubai-Bengaluru flight on February 20 with a coronavirus-infected Hyderabad resident.

India has so far reported six confirmed cases, of which three have recovered while three others are admitted in the hospitals. Two patients with a travel history from Italy and Dubai have been admitted in Safdarjung Hospital here while an Italian is being treated in a Jaipur hospital.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba held a review meeting through video-conference, with the Secretaries of Ministries, Chief Secretaries and Health Secretaries to assess action taken to containment of the virus. The States have been asked to set up quarantine facilities, augment isolation wards, involvement of district clusters in cluster management while standard operating procedure (SOP) is in the pipeline for COVID-19 management in private hospitals.

More suspected cases are coming to light. For instance, the wife of the Italian tourist found to have been infected with coronavirus initially tested positive for the virus here on Tuesday. Her samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for finality, an official said.

“The wife of the Italian tourist too developed symptoms and samples were collected. The report indicates positive signs of the virus in her. For further confirmation, we are sending her sample to the NIV, Pune,” the official of the Rajasthan Health Department said.

The Italian couple has been kept in isolation at the Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Hospital in the State while six suspected cases of COVID-19 reported from Agra have been admitted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and their blood samples have been sent to the Pune lab for testing. More than 3,100 people have died and over 90,000 have been infected worldwide by the virus.

In view of no let-up in cases, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has shifted twenty-four people, including 3 Indians and 21 Italian nationals, staying at a hotel of South Delhi to its quarantine facility at Chawaala for testing. Their test results are expected to come on Thursday.

With the virus showing no signs of abating, the Central Departments too have stepped up their efforts to detect and check the infection which has killed 2,912 people in China so far. The Union Civil Aviation Ministry on Tuesday conducted a meeting with all airports officials to review and guide the preparations to prevent the spread of the infection in the country. The DGCA has asked the airlines to ensure that their crew on all flights has protective gears like surgical masks and gloves.

Passengers from Italy, Iran, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia are being screened at Indian airports.

States too are gearing up to meet the crisis, if any. Addressing a Press briefing along with Health Minister Satyender Jain, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia outlined the measures taken by the State Government. “In 25 hospitals (19 Government and 6 private), the process of setting up of isolation wards is underway. 3.5 lakh masks, 8,000 separation kits are being made available,” he said, adding that twelve testing facilities were operational in the national Capital.

Sisodia also asked people not to panic and urged them to take precautions like not touching face without washing hands and exercising good hygiene. Jain said, “People need to be aware that it is a flu-like disease.” He advised people to use disposable napkins for sneezes or coughs and urged heart disease patients, or diabetic patients to take special care.

Similarly, Eatela Rajendra, Health Minister of Telangana which reported its first confirmed case on Monday said on Tuesday that a budget of `100 crore has been allocated to fight the virus in the State and urged the people to not panic.

“`100 crore has been allocated for combating coronavirus. The man who had come from Dubai and tested positive for COVID-19 is recovering. This virus is not deadlier than swine flu. The death toll is not more than 2-3 per cent. A few basic measures can prevent this virus from taking effect,” he said.

The Odisha Government as a precautionary measure has sent a couple, hailing from Uttar Pradesh and working in a Singaporean cargo ship to one of its hospitals after the man developed mild fever on the ship’s arrival at Paradip port here from China where the coronavirus death toll has reached 2,943, official sources said.

The Haryana Police on its part, on Tuesday directed its field units to take immediate action to safeguard on-duty personnel from potential coronavirus infection by providing them masks, gloves and hand sanitisers.

Similarly, the seaport and airport have been put under high alert, officials said on Tuesday. Dakshina Kannada district is particularly under surveillance as three confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported from neighbouring Kerala earlier, they said. Besides DK, alert has been sounded in Udupi, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mysuru.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-virus-steps-up-attack--triggers-chaos-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/china-virus-steps-up-attack--triggers-chaos.html
233,04-3-20,2 Noida schools shut,"Rise in demand for masks, sanitisers; shortage at stores

After father of one of their students tested positive for coronavirus, two private schools in Noida declared holidays for next few days as a preventive measures, said officials.

Amid a coronavirus scare in Delhi-NCR, the demand for surgical and N95 masks, and sanitisers have increased manifold in Noida with some people claiming they were being sold at rates much higher than the actual cost.

Meanwhile, one of the schools in Noida, on the outskirts of Delhi, where the Delhi man’s son is a primary class student, said it will remain shut from March 4 to March 6, while the other said it will be closed till Saturday. The board exams are not affected, the messages sent by the schools to the parents made clear.

It came to light that the man had thrown a birthday party last week for the child, triggering fears that those who attended it including some students and his relatives might be at risk.

Samples from six people from Noida, including three children, have been taken to check if anyone has been infected, Noida’s Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava said.

Fumigation was underway in both the schools and a Health Department team led by Noida’s chief medical officer visited the site, an official said.

While some family members of the man, an accountant and others who came in contact with him were asked to remain quarantined at their homes in Delhi and Agra, six others from Agra with “high-viral load” have been kept in isolation at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and their samples sent to NIV, Pune, officials said.

Contact tracing of the people who came in contact with the six is simultaneously being done through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network, the Health Ministry said in a statement.

Sources said the patient from Mayur Vihar in Delhi, had travelled to Italy recently. The senior doctor also urged people not to panic, saying that the virus is “fragile in nature”.

The Noida administration on Tuesday launched two helplines — 8076623612 and 6396776904 — for people with any queries on coronavirus. Bhargava said there were adequate medical facilities available with isolation wards at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida and the Super-speciality Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Training Institute in Noida.

The GIMS has a dedicated 10-bed facility while the super-speciality hospital has nine beds, he added. District Magistrate B N Singh stressed that no school in Gautam Buddh Nagar has been asked by them to shut or suspend classes. He, however, added that one private school in which the children of the man who has tested positive in the initial test for coronavirus was sanitised and hence closed for three days.

“In this school, the board exams will continue as such but the centre has been changed to St Joseph School in Greater Noida and we have got permission for that from the exam board also,” Singh added. He said the other school which has decided to suspend classes till March 9 has done it on their own.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2-noida-schools-shut-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/2-noida-schools-shut.html
234,04-3-20,Drink orange juice to cut obesity risk and better heart health,"Want to live a healthy and long life? Please take note. Researchers have found that drinking two-and-a-half glasses of orange juice a day could reverse obesity and reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

According to the findings, published in the Journal of Lipid Research, the researchers are studying a molecule found in sweet oranges and tangerines called nobiletin, which they have shown to drastically reduce obesity and reverse its negative side-effects.

""We went on to show that we can also intervene with nobiletin. We've shown that in mice that already have all the negative symptoms of obesity, we can use nobelitin to reverse those symptoms, and even start to regress plaque build-up in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis,"" said study researcher Murray Huff from Western University in Canada.

The research team demonstrated that mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet that were also given nobiletin were noticeably leaner and had reduced levels of insulin resistance and blood fats compared to mice that were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet alone.

However, they still haven't been able to pinpoint exactly how nobiletin works.

According to the study, the researchers hypothesized that the molecule was likely acting on the pathway that regulates how fat is handled in the body.

Called AMP Kinase, this regulator turns on the machinery in the body that burns fats to create energy, and it also blocks the manufacture of fats.

However, when the researchers studied nobiletin's effects on mice that had been genetically modified to remove AMP Kinase, the effects were the same.

""This result told us that nobiletin is not acting on AMP Kinase, and is bypassing this major regulator of how fat is used in the body. What it still leaves us with is the question - how is nobiletin doing this?"" Huff said.

According to the researchers, this result is still clinically important because it shows that nobiletin won't interfere with other drugs that act on the AMP Kinase system.

The current therapeutics for diabetes like metformin, for example, work through this pathway, the researchers said.

The next step is to move these studies into humans to determine if nobiletin has the same positive metabolic effects in human trials.

""Obesity and its resulting metabolic syndromes are a huge burden to our health care system, and we have very few interventions that have been shown to work effectively, we need to continue this emphasis on the discovery of new therapeutics,"" Huff concluded.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/drink-orange-juice-to-cut-obesity-risk-and-better-heart-health-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/drink-orange-juice-to-cut-obesity-risk-and-better-heart-health.html

236,04-3-20,Iran says 92 dead as virus reaches all but one province,"Coronavirus has killed 92 people in Iran, officials said on Wednesday, as the world's deadliest outbreak outside China spread to all but one of the country's provinces.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile dismissed a US offer to help it fight the novel coronavirus outbreak, charging that Washington hides behind a ""mask of sympathy"" while sanctions are depriving the country of medicine.

The Islamic republic reported 15 new deaths from COVID-19 and 586 additional cases, bringing the overall toll to 92 dead and 2,922 infected.

""This virus doesn't have wings to fly. We're the ones spreading it,"" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who gave the latest figures, told a televised news conference.

""We have to cut down on unnecessary interactions. We have to be extra careful in the coming weeks,"" he added, calling on the public to refrain from travelling and gathering at events such as weddings.

The provinces of Tehran and Qom were the worst-hit with 253 and 101 new cases of COVID-19 respectively, according to the spokesman.

The Shiite holy city of Qom, south of Tehran, is the epicentre of Iran's coronavirus outbreak and where its first deaths were reported on February 19.

Authorities have since scrambled to halt its rapid spread.

Schools have been shut, major cultural and sporting events suspended, and working hours reduced.

Tehran's streets were considerably quieter than usual on Wednesday, with few shops open.

Many people wore masks as they walked along streets hung with large posters on preventing infection.

Despite the preventive measures, the novel coronavirus is now present in all but one of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the latest figures.

The provinces of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, North Khorasan and Zanjan were added to the list on Wednesday, leaving only Bushehr in the south unaffected.

US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was ready to aid Iran with the virus outbreak.

""If we can help the Iranians with this problem, we are certainly willing to do so...All they have to do is ask. We will have great professionals over there,"" he said.

His counterpart in Tehran dismissed the offer, saying ""our people know well that you are lying"" with American sanctions still in place that block Iran's access to medicine.

""Those who have deprived the people of even medicine and food through sanctions, who have done the most vicious things... They appear with a mask of sympathy and say that we want to help the nation of Iran,"" Rouhani said, in a clear reference to the United States.

Washington pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran in 2018.

Humanitarian goods, especially medicine and medical equipment, are technically exempt.

But international purchases of such supplies are forestalled by banks wary of conducting business with Iran for fear of falling foul of the US sanctions.

Rouhani said the US must lift sanctions blocking medicine purchases to prove its honest intent to help.

""This is the first step... To free banking relations for purchasing medicine, transferring medicine and shipping medicine and food,"" he said.

The novel coronavirus has so far infected some high-profile Iranian officials.

The national emergency services chief Pirhossein Kolivand was the latest such infection announced on Tuesday.

It came a day after the virus claimed the life of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a member of the Expediency Council which advises Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

It also comes a week after the country's deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, fell ill with COVID-19.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-says-92-dead-as-virus-reaches-all-but-one-province-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-says-92-dead-as-virus-reaches-all-but-one-province.html

241,04-3-20,Facebook tweaks Libra project amid pressure,"Hit by regulators and political pressure, Facebook is reportedly planning to now offer digital versions of government-backed currencies, including the US dollar and the euro, apart from the cryptocurrency Libra.

According to a report in The Information on Tuesday, the social networking giant would also delay the roll out of its digital currency by several months.

According to the report, Facebook Calibra wallet, originally slated to launch this summer, is now coming out in October.

The crypto wallet will also support other major currencies apart from Libra.

Facebook, however, denied the report that earlier stated that Calibra wallet will not offer Libra.

""Reporting that Facebook does not intend to offer the Libra currency in its Calibra wallet is entirely incorrect. Facebook remains fully committed to the project,"" a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge.

Several US senators have opposed Facebook's digital coin, arguing that the social networking giant has been irresponsible with user data privacy. They have even called the digital cryptocurrency Libra ""delusional"" and ""dangerous"".

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Congress last October about Libra, defending the idea, but acknowledging the struggles left to overcome.

The Libra Association last year said that that over 1,500 entities indicated interest in joining the Libra project effort since the project was announced on June 18, 2019.

Facebook and 20 partner organisations formally joined the digital currency project during a meeting in Geneva in October.

However, the project courted controversies and telecom major Vodafone, which was one of the 21 organisations which signed onto the Libra Association charter in October, decided to exit the project.

Earlier, companies including PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, Mercado Pago, eBay, Stripe and Booking Holdings withdrew from the project.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-tweaks-libra-project-amid-pressure-2020-03-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/facebook-tweaks-libra-project-amid-pressure.html
242,04-3-20,Kiara Advani's clone is the new TikTok rage,"A TikTok user named Kalpana Sharma has been winning new fans on the social media app simply by cloning Bollywood actress Kiara Advani.

Among Kalpana's 'talents' is recreating dialogues that Kiara's protagonist Preeti mouthed in the 2019 blockbuster ""Kabir Singh"".

While Kiara continues to go from strength to strength in Bollywood with her last year's consecutive hits ""Kabir Singh"" and ""Good Newwz"", Kalpana is winning new fans on social media by simply being a lookalike of the actress and copying her dialogues and mannerisms.

Kalpana in fact is one of many social media sensations who have become a rage just by cloning big Bollywood stars. Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan, Alia Bhatt, Tiger Shroff, Katrina Kaif, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Jacqueline Fernandez, Kareena Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Karisma Kapoor are some stars who have lookalikes aping them on various social media outlets, particularly TikTok.

In fact, Katrina Kaif's clone, Alina Rai, has become so popular that she has lately even got a break in showbiz. She recently featured in a Punjabi pop music video. Some stars like Aishwarya have multiple clones on TikTok.

A few actresses who are no more -- like Sridevi and Madhubala -- have TikTok dopplegangers, too.

While on Kiara, she will soon be seen in the Netflix film ""Guilty"". This year, she has an impressive line-up of feature films. She will be seen alongside Akshay Kumar in the horror comedy ""Laxmmi Bomb"", will star in the heroine-centric project ""Indoo Ki Jawaani"", and co-star with Sidharth Malhotra in the biopic ""Shershaah"", before teaming up with Kartik Aaryan in the horror comedy ""Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2"".

Fears of catching the virus have sparked a run on masks as well as sanitising hand gel in France, leading some stores and online retailers to hike prices.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier Tuesday that he had ordered France's consumer and anti-fraud watchdog to open an investigation after reports that prices had doubled or even tripled.

249,04-3-20,WhatsApp launches Dark Mode for both iPhone and Android,"Facebook-owned WhatsApp on Tuesday announced to roll out the much-awaited 'Dark Mode' feature on both iPhone and Android devices globally.

'Dark Mode' is designed to reduce eye strain in low-light environments and prevent those awkward moments that happen when your phone lights up the room.

The feature is being rolled out with the latest version of WhatsApp.

The users would notice a special dark gray background and off-white colour that lowers the brightness of the screen, cuts down the glare and improves contrast and readability, said the company.

""When designing dark mode, we spent time researching and experimenting with a focus on two particular areas: Readability and information hierarchy.

""When choosing colours, we wanted to minimise eye fatigue and use colours that are closer to the system defaults on iPhone and Android, respectively,"" said WhatsApp.

""We also wanted to help users easily focus their attention on each screen. We did this by using colour and other design elements to make sure the most important information stands out,"" it added.

Users on Android 10 and iOS 13 can use Dark Mode by enabling it in system settings.

Users on Android 9 and below versions can go into WhatsApp settings, then chats, theme and select 'Dark'.
