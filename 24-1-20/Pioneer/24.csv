0,24-1-20,Illogic and the showman,"The US under the Trump administration typifies the reckless decision-making of military imperatives without prior experience, counsel or professional advice

Traditionally, the US administration has benefitted from the military experience that resides in the “White House.” Prior to their political ascendancy, around 29 of the 45 US Presidents have held military experience. However, the incumbent President Donald Trump has been an exception. He has had a controversial past of medical deferment that purportedly kept him out of military enrollment during the Vietnam War. Post the World War II, in the midst of the cold war era, nine successive US Presidents were former combatants till the tenures of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and now Trump. Even the US Congress and Senate have had a substantial presence of veterans (they represented more than half of Congress for much of the late 20th century), who have debated and drafted security policies in pursuance of national objectives.

Given that the post World War II period entailed bloody American military involvement in places like Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East, Somalia and Afghanistan as well as other covert wars and operations, the reassuring presence and understanding of the accompanying security sensitivities added the necessary nuance, steel and perspective on governance. But the last 12 years have seen a gradual reduction in the representation of veterans (till very recently) in both Houses. Trump though has displayed himself with misplaced enthusiasm for military trappings, bravado and parades to posit his own surrogate muscularity in pursuit of politics.

Most of his interventions, allusions and invocation with military imperatives have been high on instinctive showmanship and theatrics but have been low on efficacy. He started his tenure by appointing the iconic Marine Corps General James Mattis as the Secretary of Defence. The latter was found to be too rational, grounded and a well-read professional for Trump’s boorish and fickle preferences. The US President authorised the usage of the “mother of all bombs” (GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, the most powerful non-nuclear explosive) in Afghanistan. Today, he is negotiating “peace talks” with the Taliban, which has already accounted for well over 2,000 US casualties. He got the US military to rashly rain 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles (each costing approximately a million and a half dollars) on a dilapidated airbase and then another hundred on an industrial site in Syria, among other military commitments. Today, most Syrian lands have been lost to his bête noire, Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian Government.

Units of the US Special Forces, in conjunction with allies — Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — conducted operations along with supporting militias in the Yemen theatre. As a result, a ragtag Army of Iran-supported Houthi rebels have been cocking a snook at the much larger, affluent and better armed forces of the US and its allies. While he did get to “take out” a past his prime Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and more recently the Iranian Commander of Quds Force, Major General Qassem Soleimani, the essential American foothold in the Middle East remains shaky and is desperately in need of a “pull-out” to limit further damage.

Taking militaristic decisions is inevitable for a superpower that is mired in protecting its hegemonic interests across the globe. However, recent decisions and the fate of the Trump-led US military’s involvement across the globe warrant serious introspection. It’s not that “team” Trump did not have competency but his impatience with reason and restraint has ensured that the likes of Mattis have left, got fired, joined his “echo chamber” or, as mentioned in the famously anonymous Op-ed in The New York Times, are part of the silent “resistance working within the Trump administration.” The Op-ed, authored by a senior person in the Trump administration, evocatively noted his leadership style to be “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” Further, it went to express the conundrum of the hapless staff, who would “privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander-in-chief’s comments and actions.”

A thoroughbred professional, Mattis became a typical sufferer of Trump’s foolhardiness when he refused to carry out killing orders of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, to make war plans to attack Iranian facilities and opposed the decision of the US’ troop withdrawal from Syria. On Mattis’ resignation, the former combatant was hailed as the “last adult” in the Trump administration. Questions now abound if Soleimani would have been “taken out” today if Mattis was still around.

The decision to up the ante with Iran did have the backing of some veterans like four-star general Jack Keane and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David Petraeus among others. But as Congressman Adam Smith said, “Trump has no idea what he’s doing but isn’t afraid to do it.” This unheeding trait has led to multiple forms of military adventurism with little to show on the ground at a time when Trump is in the last leg of his first tenure.

The usual phenomenon of spectacular military actions, resulting in a bipartisan “rallying around the flag” and, thereby, bumping up the crucial presidential approval ratings, is an old hat (in all democracies). After the Gulf War, former US President George HW Bush’s approval ratings went up from 58 per cent to 89 per cent. His son, George W Bush’s invasion of Iraq got a similar spike from 58 per cent to 71 per cent. Barack Obama’s elimination of Osama bin Laden took his ratings from 44 per cent to 51 per cent. But Trump’s Soleimani action did not result in any noticeable jump. He continues to languish in the mid-40 approval percentages. Clearly, Trump has politically abused the “military card” too often and it no longer resonates. On the contrary, his embarrassing description of “beautiful weapons” in the serious business of deploying the “last resort” responsibly diminishes the statesmanship and restraint required of his position.

What deliberately polarising politicians like Trump also achieve is that they dangerously “divide” perceptions within the veteran community, which is usually bipartisan on security matters and goes by military “facts.” This sort of brazen politics has alienated the likes of Trump’s fellow Republican and former combatant Senator John McCain, whose professional integrity as a soldier was affronted by usurpers like him.

Matters of military need to be spared from political appropriations. Else, the required institutional ethos and perceptions are weakened. Following this, the overall national security preparedness, too, would stand diminished.

1,24-1-20,A really bad year,"India slips on the global democracy index from 2018 even as Thailand goes up. We are losing the war of perception

As the world’s largest democracy, no matter how grudging an admission this might be by assessors of the Western world, we should at least be held up as tolerable and accommodative if not the best. So India dropping by 10 places to 51st on The Economist’s Democracy Index 2019, is a cause for worry rather than an easy example of Western bias. Simply because the publication has earned global respect and acceptability as least biased and careful about facts. And as a member of the Fourth Estate, it fulfils its responsibility of upholding what global regimes are flawed at, in political, economic and social liberalism. So it is considered credible enough. Also, it has never rated India so harshly or lowly ever since it began the index 12 years ago. So what is alarming? India’s decline in its overall score from 7.23 in 2018 to 6.9 last year and its classification as a “flawed democracy,” just two steps away from being called an authoritarian regime. Given our much-claimed vibrancy, we should have scored at least eight or thereabouts on all counts. The index termed the erosion of civil liberties as the primary cause of our democratic regression. Which means that even by the Modi regime’s own standing since 2014, the last six months have severely damaged perception. Except for pluralism and electoral processes, where we scored 8.67, there has been a drastic slide in the perception of governance, political culture and civil liberties. In short, it is the functionality and leadership of the Government that has clearly been put under the scanner. Before we dismiss these observations as part of a worldwide conspiracy hatched by a minuscule group of “urban Naxals”, “funded academics” or give in to the compulsive urge to generate counter-propaganda, we must stop to think that the idea of democracy suffering in India has never been a talking point. This is simply because it has always been seen as a descendant of its civilisational moorings, its liberal ethos and, therefore, incapable of forced human constructs of oppression and supremacy. This is the reason why the world supported the abrogation of Article 370 only because the Government argued it as an issue within our constitutional space and never thought that it would be followed by authoritarian clampdowns or adventurism. That acceptance was followed by a significant review of citizenship laws and a renewed impetus on re-establishing majoritarian Hindu pride through the Ram temple. Considering their upending tectonics and the monolithic aggression that went against our grain of consensus politics, dissent was but natural. But the Government, instead of sizing up its destructive potential and neutralising it through a process of dialogue, went about hammering it with mindless brutality. Contentious politics cannot be force-fed in a democracy and for a Government that rests on a valid people’s verdict, undermining it would only backflush on its true intentions.

The countrywide internet shutdowns on dissenting voices and protests have given us the dubious distinction of authorising over 67 per cent of the world’s internet shutdowns. Holding up the information highway has become the latest tool for authoritarian governments around the world to control the political narrative on their terms and carpet-bomb any opinion or emotion against it. We are guilty of it while claiming to be a democracy. The otherisation and ghettoisation of politics, perpetuated through citizenship laws and a census based on profiling, are clearly divisive in intent and end up playing a nation’s people against each other. The crackdown on students and civil society protests have been the proverbial last straw. The restrictive and biased media has relegated itself to being the Government’s official propagandist than a conscience-keeper. The discourse in the country has been polarised to such an extent that we fail to realise that every argument is justified on its axis and needs to be heard, judged and then decided on its merit or demerit. That is the democratic process, which is now being dumped as a liability than an asset. And if free speech is under threat, then obviously the estimation of India as a democracy will be called into question. Going by the study, almost one-half (48.4 per cent) of the world’s population lives in a democracy of some sort although only 5.7 per cent reside in a “full democracy.” As the world’s largest democracy, imagine the diplomatic sweep India can harness for the future. Critics might draw some solace from the fact that the US had also been demoted from a “full democracy” to a “flawed democracy” in 2016. But then the number of “full democracies” increased to 22 in 2019, with Chile, France and Portugal joining the top-ranked countries. Even Thailand, for long considered running a faux model, had the biggest improvement in score. Should we still be defending ourselves?",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-really-bad-year-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-really-bad-year.html
2,24-1-20,A big tent,"Few vehicles have been so anticipated in the Indian market as the Kia Carnival has been. Not so much for the car itself but for the competition it will supposedly bring. So is it the Innova beater everyone wants it to be?

The Toyota MPV in all its forms — Qualis, Innova and Crysta — has been an unqualified success story in India. There are enough people out there that are on their second, third and fourth purchase. This success has been built on a bedrock of extreme reliability, amazing resale value and just a bit of boredom. And somehow no one has managed to knock the Japanese off their perch, and they have tried. You had the Nissan Evalia, which sank with little trace and then the Chevrolet Tavera, which was well, inadequate. But buyers in this segment have been clamouring for more choice. Toyotas are expensive and despite the price, they are a bit light on features, particularly on the technology front — still no native smartphone interface like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If you want to guess why the Liva and Yaris didn’t have the sales that some expected, this is one reason why.

But this isn’t a story about Toyota, this is about the Kia Carnival, the white knight that some motoring journalists would have you believe has come to slay the evil Toyota dragon. At the very outset let me get something straight, the Carnival is a fabulous product in its own right and while it might take away some Innova sales, particularly at the top of the range, it is not an Innova “killer.” There are very compelling reasons to consider the Carnival, if you’re someone who spends a few thousand kilometres on the road every month, going to the interiors of the country and want a degree of comfort. That is, if you’re a politician, this is possibly the best vehicle you can get. Heck, I believe that the Carnival can challenge the Fortuner as India’s political wagon of choice.

There are a couple of reasons for this, first and foremost, the Kia Carnival will not challenge the Innova’s dominance in fleet sales, at least initially. The Carnival is available with a 2.2 litre 200PS engine driving the front wheels mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, and while these are good things, they will limit its appeal in the taxi market. That is because this is clearly not a taxi, Kia would like you to believe that this is a luxury liner and well in limousine trim, it certainly is quite luxurious indeed. The Carnival, which will have seven, eight and nine seat variants, is a large car with immense amount of space as well as, and this is critical, easy to manipulate seats. In addition, it has a boatload of features that marks it out as far more luxurious. But all of this comes at a price, not just a real price, which is that even entry-level variants of the Carnival are expected to cost Rs 25 lakh at the very minimum. The top-spec limousine variant will top out at close to Rs 35 lakh, according to market buzz.

Make no mistake, for that kind of money you get a lot. Not only are the second row seats “captain” seats, they can be adjusted six ways. It would have been a nice touch if both second-row seats were electronically controlled but that is nit-picking. The optional technology packet sees 10-inch Android touchscreens installed on the back of the headrests, which you can use in a pinch to watch a movie that can be played back through a USB drive. What is nice is that Kia is providing a lot of charging points, including one 220V two-pin point on the second row, which is really appreciated. And multiple points to charge your phones, from a wireless induction plate in the front, to multiple USB points on three rows in addition to regular 12V points. This coupled with the fact that the rear sunroof also opens makes the Carnival a great place to sit in. It would be nicer still had Kia installed ventilated seats on the second row as well, but that might be asking for too much.

How is the Carnival to drive? When you see the size of the car and hear about the smallish motor coupled to a front-wheel drive, you might think it is sluggish and you would be partially right. Well, the eight-speed gearbox mitigates that to a certain degree and once you are at speed, it can cruise comfortably at the speed limit without any hesitation. And this is not a performance car by any stretch, it is meant to be a comfortable vehicle. With excellent ride as well as the fact that body roll has been minimised, the Carnival is a great car to sit in.

Let’s be honest, nobody who buys the Carnival will buy it to drive themselves. It is going to be a vehicle that you get driven around in and on that front, the flat floor, the sliding doors and the adjustable seating options make this a winner if you have a large family or just want to move around in a large vehicle. If you’re a politician or a chief executive, the Carnival makes sense. It does have issues, it may not fit into some parking slots in Indian malls, it certainly can’t replace the Innova as a camera car - the shoots for the Carnival used the Innova as the camera car. And the Carnival will not be cheap. Base versions will cost as much as the top-end of the Innova range. So as I said earlier, this is not an Innova (and Fortuner) killer — it will take some sales away — but this is a unique vehicle in its own right and should make its own mark on the market.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-big-tent-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-big-tent.html
3,24-1-20,An astronaut’s friend,"ISRO is using a half-humanoid robot to smoothen out creases for Gaganyaan, our manned mission

So what if we have to wait awhile to send an Indian woman into space, we have a half-humanoid robot in the shape of one doing so. And she will test-pilot drills for our first manned mission as part of the Gaganyaan project. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will be sending Vyommitra to mimic humanistic functions in the spacecraft, even converse with intended astronauts and respond to their queries. This preparatory drill is being done to ensure that Indian astronauts can complete their historic manoeuvre without a glitch. India though is not the first nation to send a robot into space to ensure safety of manned flights. NASA had sent Robonaut 2 to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2011 and Japan’s Kirobo had landed there in 2014. Advanced versions are being developed to do a recce for human settlements. Post the failed lunar mission last year, ISRO seems to have learnt its lessons well and is proceeding with extreme caution with AI-aided dry runs.

While the nation would rather not talk about Chandrayaan 2 simply because its rover failed to land on the dark side of the moon, it has had its own success. Forget the lost rover, at the end of the day, it is indigenously developed and manufactured and is testimony to not only R&D and innovation but the ability of home-grown companies to expand capabilities. The Gaganyaan is a logical follow-through of this mission. India has already set a benchmark in PSLV and GSLV launches. It recently launched the high-power communication satellite GSAT-30. This is expected to provide improved coverage and will enable Indian broadcasters to air content in the Middle East, Australia and other parts of Asia, widening the arc of our soft diplomacy. The commercial satellite launch market is estimated to be $30 billion by 2025 and ISRO is certain to be a top player in it. With Vyommitra, ISRO hopes to expand its ability to analyse data and ensure trajectory and payload optimisation for bigger missions. NASA is using AI for its next rover mission to Mars, too. But then a word of caution here. Robots aren’t heroes. As much they promise a new era in space exploration, they must ascend the curve with utmost care.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-astronaut---s-friend-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/an-astronaut---s-friend.html
4,24-1-20,"Nadda, Yogi slam oppn over CAA","Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that everyone had the right to speak in a democratic way but those who created chaos should not be under any illusion as the government had a solution to every problem and it would recover losses from those who damaged public property.

Yogi was addressing a public meeting at Kothi Meena Bazaar in Agra on Thursday.

Addressing the meeting, Bharatiya Janata Party national president JP Nadda said that there was no need to be afraid of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“This is a law of the people. The country has suffered in the last several years because of decisions taken after Independence,” he said.

Nadda slammed the Congress for opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying the leadership of the grand old party was suffering from “mental bankruptcy”.

“The Congress has lost all hopes. Its leadership is suffering from ‘manasik diwaliyapan’ (mental bankruptcy). The statements issued by the party in the last eight months will reflect that these are intended to help Pakistan,” he said.

In an apparent reference to the leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, Nadda said, “These days Dalit leaders are opposing the CAA. These Dalit leaders and the Congress hardly know anything about the CAA and are only spreading canards to mislead people.”

The BJP president said the political innings of the two parties was over and they had understood that times had changed and the country was marching rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The chief minister said that those who, on the signal of PFI and SIMI, destroyed public property, had now realised that their assets would be confiscated.

“Now, these people are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by pushing their women and children to the fore,” he said.

“Previous governments used to plead with miscreants but politics of all opposition parties has came to an end. That is why they are trying to spread confusion. These parties created their vote banks on these issues, but under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all issues have been resolved,” Yogi asserted.

The chief minister said that it was the government’s responsibility to make people aware of the reality so that they could connect themselves with the programme of ‘Rashtriya Punarnirmaan’ and ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’.

“The opposition is upset with abrogation of Article 370 that provided special status of the then state of Jammu and Kashmir and was hence speaking the language of Pakistan,” he said.

Yogi stressed that Citizenship (Amendment) Act was connected to India’s heritage which has been that of protecting people who come for shelter.

“The CAA is a law for granting citizenship, not for taking away citizenship. The opposition must understand its reality,” the chief minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nadda--yogi-slam--oppn-over-caa.html
5,24-1-20,CM: Ganga a symbol of India’s civilization Flags off ‘Ganga Raths’,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday that the people not only reposed their faith in the river Ganga, but the economy was also linked to the Holy river.

Flagging off two ‘Ganga Raths’ on Thursday, Yogi said, “With the prime minister’s inspiration, the state government is starting ‘Ganga Yatra’’. The Ganga is the symbol of the civilization of India. Civilizations have developed on its bank and traditions have been taken forward. It is our responsibility to make people aware of the cleanliness of Ganga.”

On the occasion, the chief minister also said that Ganga was a symbol of faith and every Indian considered it a part of heritage and tradition since Sanatan period.

Recounting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement in Varanasi in 2014 that he had come there for Maa Ganga, Yogi said that the prime minister vindicated his faith on ‘Ganga Maa’ by implementing the Namami Gange project in the country.

The chief minister said that river Ganga covered 2,525 kilometres in five states, of which, 1,025 kilometres were in Uttar Pradesh itself and hence the responsibility of its cleanliness rested with the people of the state.

“For this, the state government has taken several steps to make Ganga clean and ever-flowing,” he said.

The chief minister pointed out that 14 crore litres of sewage was falling in Ganga through Sisamau’s drain in Kanpur and this had been going on for 128 years.

“Due to Namami Gange project, today, not a single drop of sewage is flowing into the river. There was a time when not a single aquatic animal was left after Jajmau drain in Kanpur. Due to Namami Gange project today, big fishes are again in the river,” he said.

Yogi further said that due to Ganga and its tributaries, northern India had developed into the most fertile land of the country.

“Sufficient water is available from Ganga for 40 percent of the land area of the country,” he said.

The chief minister said that the government had decided that 21 municipal bodies and 1,038 gram panchayats through which the Ganga Yatra would pass would adopt organic farming in the coming years.

“Ganga Park, Ganga Talab and Ganga Maidan will be constructed on the banks of the river Ganga,” he said.

“Without the cleanliness of river Ganga , a grand Kumbh Mela was not possible in Prayagraj last year. During Kumbh, around 25 crore devotees took bath at the Sangam,” he said.

Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi, Jal Shakti Minister Mahendra Singh, Sugarcane Minister Suresh Rana, Tourism and Culture

Minister Neelkanth Tiwari, Minister of State for Jal Shakti Baldev Singh Aulakh, Chief Secretary RK Tiwari, Additional Chief Secretary (Home)

Awanish Kumar Awasthi and DGP OP Singh were also present in the ceremony.

Of the two raths flagged off on Thursday, one will go to Bijnor where Ganga enters Uttar Pradesh, while the other will go to Ballia from where the river exits into Bihar.

Yogi will participate in the Ganga Yatra from Bijnor on January 27 and travel through from Muzaffarnagar to Hastinapur. The following day, he will travel from Hastinapur to Hapur to Garh Mukteshwar to Amroha and then Bulandshahr.

Later, on January 29, the chief minister will go to Aligarh, Sambhal, Budaun, Shahjahanpur and reach Farrukhabad in the evening.

The following day, the Ganga Yatra will head to Kanpur through Kannauj and Hardoi.

On the other hand, the Ganga Yatra from Ballia will travel to Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Unnao and culminate in Kanpur.

Besides participating in Ganga ‘aarti’, Yogi will address a public meeting and visit villages near the river to review development projects.

6,24-1-20,Oppn assails CM for warning protesters,"The opposition parties on Thursday slammed Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for warning anti-CAA protesters that “azadi” slogans raised by them will be treated as sedition.

While the Samajwadi Party drew an analogy with the British rule, the Congress termed it “a language of dictators”.

The chief minister in a rally in Kanpur on Wednesday had said, “If azadi slogans are raised here like they used to be raised in Kashmir, then it will come in the category of sedition and stringent action will be taken by the government.”

Reacting to it, senior SP leader Ram Govind Chaudhary said the British too “had described freedom fighters as terrorists”.

“Now their successors or those who had sided with them are terming those raising azadi slogans traitors,” he said.

Chaudhary said there was no need to get “perturbed” by such warnings. “Their (BJP’s) countdown has started and that is why they are ranting,” Chaudhary said.

The SP leader alleged that the chief minister was threatening women against those hell bent on dividing the country. “Azadi is the birthright of all countrymen and those denying it will have to depart in the same manner as Hitler,” the SP leader said.

SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary too said the dissent against the CAA was being dubbed as treason by the chief minister, which was against the very essence of democracy.

“The chief minister is threatening women who are demanding their rights,” Chaudhary asserted.

When asked about the chief minister’s allegation that the SP was funding anti-CAA protests, Chaudhary said, “This amounts to making a mockery of people’s emotions.”

“Protests are on in all the states, including north-eastern region. Are we distributing money in all states,” Chaudhary wondered.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar `Lallu’ said the chief minister was speaking “a language of dictators”.

“If raising voice against the government’s oppression and politics of hatred is treason, the government should first arrest me,” Lallu said, adding that since the protests had rattled the government, it was accusing the Congress of sponsoring them.

“If people are on agitation path over this issue, why is the government not addressing it,” Lallu said.

At a public meeting in Kanpur, the chief minister had said, “...I would like to say from the soil of India, and especially the soil of Uttar Pradesh, that in the name of protests, if azadi slogans are raised here like they used to be raised in Kashmir, then it will come in the category of sedition, and stringent action will be taken by the government.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/oppn-assails-cm-for--warning-protesters.html
7,24-1-20,List of expectations,"As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gears up to present the Union Budget on February 1, India Inc shares its hopes and concerns

MSMEs need more incentives

At a time when the economy of India is experiencing a slowdown, the country is hoping for a balanced Union Budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. The middle-class is anticipating relief in income tax and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are looking for incentives. It is also crucial for the FM to formulate policies which ascertain 6.5 per cent real GDP growth for the fiscal year 2020-21.

Time to revamp MSMEs: While the economy is still facing a liquidity issue and MSMEs are bearing the brunt of the deceleration, achieving 6.5 per cent growth is a challenge but not impossible. If the Government could save Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and MSMEs, the scenario would turn favourable within a few months. Recently, the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) requested the Government to change the definition of MSMEs in response to alterations in the economic environment of the country in the last couple of years. MSMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy and the country cannot compromise with their health. Hence, a changed definition will help the sector enhance its contribution to employment-generation, poverty-alleviation and resource improvisation. A large number of MSMEs are struggling with financial challenges and without subsidies their sustenance is difficult. It is shocking that out of the 6.33 crore MSMEs in the country, only 0.05 lakh are medium enterprises. They are usually deprived of the Public Procurement Policy which mandates 25 per cent procurement from the micro and small enterprises. They are also barred from availing delayed payment reliefs through facilitation councils.

Need for sector-specific measures: Besides considering the problems of MSMEs, Sitharaman must also address the issues of underperforming sectors such as real estate, energy and telecom. There is an urgent need to reinforce sectors which strengthen the infrastructure of the country but are reeling under the impact of the downtrend. Last year, Sitharaman relieved large businesses by cutting corporate tax to 22 per cent, but businesses cannot flourish until MSMEs become secure and stable. The Government should also lower the tax burden on MSMEs by slashing the Goods and Services Tax in key sectors. The real estate sector, which is one of the growth propellers of the economy, has been struggling for almost a decade. To infuse life into this sector, the Government must consider its long-pending demands such as getting industry status, a single-window clearance mechanism, dropping the circle rate section from the Income Tax Act, elimination of taxes on vacant property, reduced land acquisition cost and tax rationalisation on Real Estate Investment Trusts.

Telecom, yet another crucial sector is hopeful that the Government will take measures to resolve the burgeoning debt issues in the Budget. Telecom companies are also demanding reduction in licence fee, Spectrum Usage Charges and relief in levies.

No compromise with liquidity: The next big challenge before Sitharaman is increasing liquidity in the market because it is directly proportional to the growth of MSMEs, especially start-ups. The IL&FS and DHFL fiascos had drastic repercussions on the financial markets, and one of the main reasons for the huge impact is the lack of availability of alternative options to bank funding. Now, Public Sector Banks have decided to cut their Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rates (MCLRs) which will be beneficial for the economy as it will improve liquidity in the market. Lower MCLRs will mean that NBFCs can borrow from banks at lower rates and the NBFCs that operate in SME lending and housing will benefit the most. It will strengthen the capitalisation structures of HFCs and help revive the real estate sector. Also, to bring back positive sentiments in the market and to counter the decelerating growth, better liquidity is needed and a lower MCLR would help meet this to a great extent. Industry pundits believe that stability in the sector will be regained by the first quarter of 2020. They are optimistic about increased demand for credit because urbanisation is taking place at a fast pace. Plus, there is a thriving start-up culture in the country and retail and e-commerce sectors have high penetration even in semi-urban areas. The Government should also keep inflation under control and it must not go beyond six per cent for at least three quarters. If all these issues are addressed, making India a $5 trillion economy will be a realistic goal.

Give IT sops to boost EV sales

The Union Budget announced in 2019 was in many ways a landmark one for pushing e-mobility. Not only was the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on electric vehicles slashed to five per cent, the Budget also offered major incentives for buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) in the form of income tax rebates on loan. These measures were designed to push the sale of EVs, which have been on the top of the Government’s priority list in recent years. These incentives were additional to the major commitment announced under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME-II) scheme to boost EV infrastructure. However, the sale of EVs remained lukewarm with an analysis suggesting that just 1,309 units of e-cars were sold between April and November 2019. With the economic slowdown and falling demand hitting the auto sector hard, the industry needs a slew of measures that will address concerns on both the demand and supply sides. With the Union Budget round the corner, there are hopes that the Finance Minister (FM) will announce measures to revive consumption, put more disposable income into the hands of the people as well as more sops for EVs. Importantly, the FM must give a policy push to e-bicycles which have the potential to be at the forefront of an e-mobility revolution.

Revive demand: In its annual review, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the declining consumption and investment, accompanied by falling tax revenue have arrested India’s GDP growth. The IMF also called for “urgent” policy actions to reverse this slowdown. Falling demand has been at the centre of the current slowdown and the country needs measures that can put more incomes into the hands of people and revive consumption. Cutting income tax rates and readjusting income tax slabs might be a tough call at a time when the Government’s revenues are shrinking but it might also be the bitter pill the economy needs. An income tax exemption on income up to Rs 5 lakh can positively impact salaried taxpayers and boost consumption. It can also spur buying among people who have deferred automobile purchases in view of the deceleration. However, just monetary measures will not be sufficient. The economy also needs a major fiscal policy push to increase employment and income. The Government must announce broad measures to infuse expenditure in strategic sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure and create income-generating avenues in the rural economy. This also includes revisions in GST slabs to create a low tax economy.

Institute a supportive scrapping policy: Earlier this year, the FM announced a scrap page policy aimed at shunting out old vehicles and increasing production. The policy is aimed at serving the twin objectives of reducing emissions and boosting consumer demand. The Government must ensure a quick rollout of the scrap page policy to encourage the replacement of older vehicles and must also lay down positive incentives for customers to push the disposal of older vehicles. The incentives may include exemption on road taxes for consumers and low interest loan schemes for purchase of new commercial vehicles. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the commercial vehicle industry suffered a decline of 22 per cent in sales between April and November 2019. We hope a supportive scrapping policy can help revive some of this lost demand.

Extend FAME II benefits to E-bicycles: E-bicycles have recently been categorised under EVs to get tax benefits. However, they do not get the benefits designated under the FAME-II scheme. We hope the Government recognises the need to promote e-bicycles as much as the need to promote e-cars. While e-cars address the concern of pollution, they do not solve the problem of traffic congestion. E-bicycles are both eco-friendly, space-friendly and also offer a viable solution to the anxiety that comes with lack of charging infrastructure as they can be easily pedalled back in case of battery loss.

Policy measures to reduce viability gap of EVs: More measures might be needed to reduce the viability gap of EVs. The Government must support the sector in different ways to make EVs more affordable and viable. These measures can include exemption on road tax, lower power tariffs for charging EVs, exemption of parking fees for EV users and exemption of permit costs among other measures.

Formulate retail policy soon

India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and the drivers of this growth can be credited to the burgeoning millennial population, growing middle-income households and an increasing representation of women in the workforce. All these factors contribute to economic growth by boosting retail consumption, thereby providing a highly positive outlook for businesses in the country. Meanwhile, as far as the market potential is concerned, the retail industry provides a robust platform for multiple stakeholders, including the consumers, distributors, manufacturers and additional sectors like transportation, logistics and so on. In fact, according to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), around 43 million people in the country are employed in the retail sector and the industries that support those businesses. In fact, the sector is generating employment at a fast pace, taking the second position after agriculture in terms of creating direct as well as indirect employment opportunities.

Despite the retail industry’s positive contribution towards the country’s economy, 2019 witnessed many players struggling to sustain the growth chart. Even though they are expecting growth to rebound in 2020, it will all depend on factors like the recovery in the manufacturing and other sectors, availability of finances in the hands of consumers to make easy retail consumption decisions and of course, the forthcoming Union Budget 2020 that will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. This will be her second Union Budget and the retailers have many expectations from the Modi Government in its second term.

Accelerating the process of national retail policy: It is a harsh reality that India to date has been unable to develop a robust manufacturing sector despite two decades of economic and trade liberalisation. Structural issues like scarcity of resources in the form of raw materials and trained labour force, lack of capital and credit facilities and inadequate infrastructure are causing major hindrances in the operations of small retail traders. This is also affecting the export-competitiveness of a large number of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). So, in this year’s Union Budget, these players want the Government to speed up the formulation and implementation of the National Retail Policy, as this would provide a significant boost to the development of 65 million small traders in the country’s retail sector and expedite/promote the ease of doing business in the country.

Promotion of digital and modern retail: The Indian retail industry is currently dominated by e-commerce and it is expected to grow to $200 billion by 2026 driven by rising smartphone penetration, the launch of 4G networks and increasing disposable incomes. That said, the competition is only increasing day by day. Bearing in mind the new-age consumers’ speedy adoption of technology, offline retail players must also modify their strategies to keep their brands relevant, the brand experience even and their products and services accessible across multiple channels. They are expecting the Government to modernise its retail by upgrading the use of Point of Sale Machines that would help retailers to access the customers’ information and efficiently manage their inventory, thereby improving their revenue-generation and profitability.

Boosting the consumption story: Due to the deceleration in the economy, retailers both small and premium ones, are bearing the brunt of a consumer class that has become careful in its purchasing decisions. This slowdown in consumption has dampened the demand in the retail segment. Retail players are hoping that the Union Budget will be pro-consumption and will come out with a slew of measures that will make small-ticket credit and additional cash accessible in the hands of the middle class. This will positively impact the retail industry by increasing demand and also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.

GST on clothes: Clothes are subject to five per cent GST if the taxable value of the goods is less than Rs 1,000 per piece, whereas, the sale value of clothing that exceeds Rs 1,000 is subject to 12 per cent GST. Retailers expect the Budget to focus on increasing the threshold for the five per cent slab to Rs 2,000 from the Rs 1,000 that is levied at present to give a fillip to the sector.

8,24-1-20,Aim for green industrial growth,"Centre, States must create a sustainable business environment and impactful economy while integrating with global benchmarks and practices

The world is moving towards sustainable businesses to tackle the challenges of climate change, empowerment of communities, health, education and other social causes to ensure the survival of life on the planet. From Davos, where the world’s most powerful people gather, to a humble policy document emerging from a bureaucrat’s desk, the theme is sustainability. In the midst of the clamour for making the blue planet a safer, healthier zone, lies the underlining theme of slowing the world order and tightening cross-border flows of goods, services and people. India, with its goal of a $5 trillion economy by 2024 in the middle of ominous forecasts of slow GDP growth, is facing a double challenge of sustainable growth vs a steroid shot of booster measures to put the economy on the fast track. While the full Union Budget 2020 will deliver parts of the promise and create hopes for more, the door is ajar for two important policies under consideration by the Government — the industrial policy and the e-commerce policy.

The proposed industrial policy (third after 1956 and 1991) ought to be a North Star for making India a global innovation, R&D and manufacturing hub, thereby achieving the $5-10 trillion target in the next decade. However, it must be kept in mind by lawmakers that this policy is coming at a time when the world has shifted towards Industry 4.0 and the global economy determinants are increasingly sinking into computing prowess of latest chips and bots while facing tremendous ecological challenges. This policy has a sated objective to develop and sustain global competitiveness for India; increase technology depth of the industry; increase employment avenues; increase share in global merchandise exports and reduce the environmental footprint. The stated vision is a one trillion gross value addition in manufacturing by 2025, (even though with right policy measures this target can be moved up.) The Government at this stage is in focussed stakeholder consultations to devise the right strategy for pushing India up in the world economic order.

The key questions being asked under the stated targets are how to bring the cost of capital expenditure in large-scale manufacturing in value terms for land, electricity and money at par with the globe benchmarks? How to reduce regulations and promote ease of doing business? How to develop India as a research, design and innovation hub by removing hurdles which are fully-integrated with the new asks from a connected digital economy? How to promote skills and workforce education as well as upskilling of the existing workforce to be able to function in the new industrial arena? How to focus on quality checks, testing and standards practices while recognising that we need to align with global benchmarks? Also, how to increase India’s global share in exports with a focus on our policy? Assist and put all industries on technology-aided platforms to enjoy the true benefits of a connected global economy? Achieve a stable, predictable, industry, consumer and economy-friendly policy framework to foster higher growth? Increase foreign direct investments? Promote sustainability as the core objective of all businesses in the country?

All these are commendable strategy directions which ask the right questions for an increasingly coagulating global order where technology innovations are diminishing physical barriers in fractions of seconds while protective Governments are putting iron fences around their economies and reducing global agreements to pieces of paper.

It is in this context that the new industrial policy seeks to achieve significance, as it comes at a time when every citizen is feeling the impact of the crumbling economy, job losses and more important, climate change. From extreme weather conditions being reported around the globe, to rising costs of providing basics to humans, not to forget, extinction of species, are a real danger today.

India needs to walk the tightrope of creating a sustainable business environment and impactful economy while getting more integrated with global benchmarks and practices. The new industrial policy needs a series of deliberations and clause by clause analysis of the vision, objectives before being drafted.

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has formulated a working group to finalise the policy which includes a couple of key State Governments. Nobody can deny the role States are likely to play in shaping the next economic growth for India. State Governments in the past have organised successful roadshows or “invest inwards” summits, promising big ticket businesses free land, cheap electricity and fast Government clearances for new projects. However, now they need to align with the Central Government and put in their key demands, challenges and proposed solutions towards developing their States which are sustainable, long-term and more importantly can survive changing regimes. It is a long shot but in the spirit of federalism, States need to get their records straight on power subsidies, clamp down on existing businesses using local administration and similar regulatory challenges. The deliberations so far have been behind closed doors. For a global “outward”-looking industrial policy, there should be an open consultation process, especially at the State Government level.

9,24-1-20,Derivatives are a double-edged sword,"Used both for hedging and speculation, the derivatives markets worldwide have grown to a humongous level, reaching about $1.2 quadrillion. However, their use has also brought giant corporations to their knees, hence investors must exercise caution

The term “financial weapons of mass destruction”, coined by billionaire Warren Buffett for derivatives, is not without reason. They can be used both for hedging and speculation and their markets worldwide have grown to a humongous level, reaching about $1.2 quadrillion, almost 10 times that of the world GDP.

However, the use of derivatives has also brought giant corporations to their knees during past global financial meltdowns. One cannot forget the bankruptcy of corporations like Enron and Barings Banks due to wrong speculative moves involving derivatives. Since they are a double-edged sword, one has to be extra cautious while using them.

What are derivatives anyway? These are instruments that derive their value from any underlying asset, which could be either a stock or a commodity.

Any investor or corporation can put money in any one of the popular derivatives for hedging or speculative purposes. Corporations use them for hedging if they want to reduce an existing risk or protect themselves from any volatility in the price of an underlying asset by taking an offsetting position, whereas speculation is trying to make profit due to any price changes.

Several analysts believe that the Indian stock markets are set to rise further in 2020 and may end higher by at least 13 per cent. It is being predicted that Nifty might end above the 13,000 mark. Similarly, the expectation for the BSE Sensex is that it will go above the 46,000 level. So, if we consider a bullish market for this year, what are the derivative strategies that an investor can use in this type of market where the prices of underlying assets are set to rise? Although the general belief is that stock markets will be bullish, there will certainly be variations as is natural.

In case the markets are extremely bullish, investors should go ahead with a long-call strategy. This is one of the simplest approaches and can be used by beginners in the derivatives market. There is only one transaction involved, i.e., buying call options. It helps investors use the power of leverage and make potentially unlimited profits and at the same time cap their losses. In the worst case scenario, when the markets do not behave as anticipated, loss is limited to the price of buying the call options.

A reverse call ratio spread is also an extremely bullish strategy where an investor can sell an option at a lower price, usually in-the-money or at-the-money and buy more options at the higher strike price, which is out-of-the-money, of the same underlying asset. So if an investor sells one option and buys two options with a higher strike price, a reverse call option strategy is created.

When the market outlook is moderately bullish and the investor is expecting some upward movement in the underlying asset, a long-call ladder strategy could be initiated. This strategy has the potential of earning from time decay if it expires in the range of the strike price. This strategy is created by buying one in-the-money call, selling one at-the-money call and selling one out-of-the money call of the same underlying asset with the same expiry. Experiments can also be made with different strike prices.

Another income-generating strategy that can be initiated in a moderately bullish market is a covered call option which can be created by using a stock and an option. This strategy is created by purchasing a stock and simultaneously selling a call option, which is out-of-the-money, usually on the higher side.

When the markets are becoming more neutral, buying a long-call would not be the best strategy to use. In a moderately bullish market, investors could take a short put option strategy, wherein they go short on a put position, i.e., they are obliged to buy the underlying asset in future at a predetermined price if the buyer wishes to exercise his option. This strategy will be helpful for investors if the price of the underlying asset increases moderately or even remains at the same level. In a flat market, this strategy will be beneficial as it gives investors a chance to earn some upfront money in the form of premium which can be adjusted against some margins.

Another strategy for a more neutral or flat market with a bullish view is bull put spread option, which involves two put options, both short and long. It is created by one short put with a higher strike price and one long put with a lower strike price. But here the expiration date remains the same. This strategy has a higher potential of being profitable as it is beneficial in situations when the prices are steady or are rising.

In case an investor has suffered any losses due to price fall, a stock repair strategy is there and can help the investor recover their losses even if the prices of the underlying asset show slight improvement.

This strategy is created by buying one at-the-money call and at the same time selling two out-of-the money call, of the same underlying asset with the same expiration. The trick here, though, is that the strike price of the sale should be very close to the buying price.

As one can see, there are different derivative strategies for different market outlooks. However, taking a bet with derivatives can be very dangerous as by paying a small premium, investors can end up initiating very large transactions and if the markets do not move the way the investors anticipated, the losses can be huge. These transactions should only be undertaken by an expert with knowledge about stock markets and in particular, derivatives.

10,24-1-20,Cong plans agitation for farmers after Delhi polls,"With the aim to marginalise Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party on people’s issues and to take the ruling BJP head-on before the next assembly polls, the Congress under Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would launch a state-wide agitation over farmers’ problems after the Delhi polls.

Sources in the Congress claimed that the party would organise ‘Kisan Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ under the banner ‘Kisan Bachao’ at the village-level every month to highlight farmers’ problems in Uttar Pradesh.

“In the second phase, ‘nukkad sabhas’ will be organised at block level and later, pad yatras’ will be taken out at tehsil and district headquarters,” the sources said.

Priyanka will also address five rallies, to be attended by senior-most leaders of the Congress.

The strategy for the agitation was chalked out during the four-day training camp of state leaders at Bhuemau guest house in Rae Bareli and the programme would be formally announced soon.

When it actualises, this will be the first major movement led by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in UP.

Congress MLC, Deepak Singh said the party would take on the Yogi Adityanath government on issues like stray cattle, payment of cane dues to farmers, non-availability of fertilisers, irregularities in procurement of paddy, no increase in minimum support price of foodgrains and rising cases of farmer suicides in the state, specially in Bundelkhand.

“Congress workers will reach out to farmers and get their problems in writing in a form. These forms will then be handed over to tehsildars/district magistrates and also sent to the state government,” Singh said.

The Congress workers would also distribute leaflets in which farmers’ plight would be compared during the United Progressive Alliance and National Democratic Alliance regimes. The party will also seek loan waiver for farmers, waiver of half of the power bills, cowshed, and watchdog allowance in every village.

Late on Wednesday, Priyanka had taken a dig at Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav by saying that some leaders did not think it prudent to move out of their homes to support the protests against the new citizenship law.

Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the families of those who were killed in a road accident in Amethi on Thursday.

The mother-daughter duo, who are on a two day visit to Sonia Gandhi’s constituency Rae Bareli for a training camp organised for party workers, visited Pure Bharetha, Pure Ganesh Lal, Gungwachh and Hathkila villages to express condolences to the bereaved families.

Six persons were killed when a car collided with a fertiliser-laden truck in Baramasi area of Amethi on Jagdishpur-Gauriganj-Pratapgarh national highway late Monday night.

Till recently, Amethi was represented by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha and was considered a stronghold of the party and the Gandhi family.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-plans-agitation-for--farmers-after-delhi-polls.html

Assembly Speaker Surjya Narayan Patro at a function of non-resident Odias in Surat said the flight services could take off only because of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s efforts.

The Speaker’s statement sparked a controversy and a debate between the two parties.

Adding fuel to the fire, Government Chief Whip Pramila Mallick said that the credit for the flight services goes to the Chief Minister, but the BJP is unnecessarily taking mileage out of it.

In his reaction, BJP State general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan said the Assembly Speaker should keep the sanctity of his post by abiding by the Supreme Court’s directive. He should not issue statements which could tarnish his image, he said.

“It is wrong to say that only because of the Odisha Chief Minister the flight services to Surat from Bhubaneswar could begin. The roles of Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and other leaders cannot be ignored in this regard. However, we accept the fact that the Chief Minister had written to the Centre demanding launch of the Bhubaneswar-Surat flight services,” said Harichandan.

16,24-1-20,E-Rickshaw welfare society protests against ban,"n The members of Devbhoomi E-Rickshaw Welfare Society held a protest on Thursday against a ban imposed on the operation of e-rickshaws on the main roads of the city.

Alleging unfair treatment and harassment, they are planning to rally to the Chief Minister’s residence on Monday and escalate their protest further if nothing is done to address their grievance.

According to district president of the society, Ravindra Tyagi, “The authorities are saying that e-rickshaws cause traffic jam on the roads.

There are only 2600 registered e-rickshaws that run in the city. On the other hand, only 795 three-wheelers (Vikrams) are registered but around 5000 are running on the roads.

How are we causing traffic jams? Most of the drivers have taken a loan to buy e-rickshaws. How are they going to survive?

Three of our drivers have died due to depression. Since August 27 last year, the government has banned the operation of e-rickshaws on the main routes of the city.

Even if some poor driver gets on any main road in Jakhan, Jogiwala or ISBT with some passengers, he is fined ` 2,000.

The Government should understand that we have to feed our families too.”

“We have met Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in the past too but we are just given false assurances.

That is why we decided to do this public protest to tell the Government that we cannot be suppressed by them.

25,24-1-20,Residents of Natthuwala complain about stray cattle,"n Stray cattle are causing damage to agriculture in some of the suburban areas of Dehradun like Natthuwala. Regarding this, the residents of Natthuwala met senior veterinary officer of Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) Dr V Sati on Thursday.

The locals told him about the destruction caused by the stray cattle in their farms. According to one of the locals Sushma Badoni, ""We have tried everything but nothing is done by MCD. We have called MCD, requested our councillor, and even some media persons have called the senior veterinary officer but all in vain. This is the reason we had to come here to request MCD to pick the stray cattle but I don't think we are taken seriously by the officials.""

“The stray cattle have even broken the boundaries to enter the fields. They have caused damage to crops and other items worth lakhs of rupees but the authorities are doing nothing. We are farmers and our crop is our livelihood.

The veterinary officer is saying that he has to look out for every ward in the city but conditions are much worse in rural areas than in the city. In the city, the stray cattle roam around on the roads and cause traffic jams or other problems to commuters but here they are destroying our living,” said Sumati Thapliyal, one of the locals.

According to the locals, they have gathered 20 stray cattle so that it would be easier for MCD vehicle to pick them but the vehicle is reportedly not available right now, alleged the locals.

The locals said that they were told that picking up stray cattle is not the same as picking garbage from roads. They run, they attack and after picking them they need proper space and food. It is not easy to pick twenty cattle at once, they were told.

“Today we came here to request the officials but if no action is taken soon we will stage a protest in MCD with more residents of Nathuwala,” said Darbeshwari Thapliyal, a resident of Nathuwala.

It is pertinent to mention here that after the recent inauguration of Gau Sadan in Selaqui, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey had stated that there will be no stray cattle roaming on the roads of the city by January 31.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/residents-of-natthuwala-complain-about-stray-cattle.html
26,24-1-20,Man ends life after killing wife-daughter,"nA man committed suicide after allegedly killing his wife and three-year-old daughter in Fundahar area in Raipur on Wednesday police said.

29,24-1-20,Split vote in 2019 a blow for BJP in State politics,"The 2019 general elections were an amazing phenomenon in Odisha. Though simultaneous elections to the Parliament and the State Assembly are being conducted in the State since 2004, the voters had never chosen split- voting system.

They used to vote for the same party at the Center and the State. For instance, in 2014 elections, the BJD had bagged 116 Assembly and 20 Parliament seats. But the situation changed in 2019. People chose BJP for the Center and the BJD for the State. In the Assembly poll, the BJD bagged 113 seats as against 23 of the BJP while in Parliament voting, the BJD lost 8 seats to settle at 12 and the BJP gained 7 seats to settle at 8.

The vote share of the BJP in the 2019 Parliament poll was 38.4 per cent, a 16.9 per cent increase than its previous poll share whereas the BJD’s vote share fell by 1.3 per cent to 42.8 per cent level. On the other hand,the BJD’s vote share “increased” by 1.3 per cent to reach 44.7 per cent level in the Assembly poll and that of the BJP increased marginally to 32.5 per cent by 14.4 per cent.

There was clearly 2 different vote shares of the two parties in the Parliament and the Assembly poll. Similar, split -voting was witnessed during 2017 Panchayat poll where the BJP got many Zilla Parishad seats whereas the BJD bagged Sarapanch and Sammittee member seats.

While speaking in the Rajya Sabha on the motion of thanks on President’s address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Odisha voters for their intelligence and maturity. He said,“Though Odisha is a largely rural area and not among the prosperous States, still its voters have chosen one party in Lok Sabha and another in Assembly.”

The Prime Minister’s outlook was positive towards the ‘spilt voting’ of Odisha as it was a pro-BJP Parliament- voting pattern. But the other side of the story was negative for the BJP. The voters preferred the BJD for the State power and centrifuged theBJP. Why did the BJD’s vote share increase in the Assembly poll instead of decreasing due to anti-incumbency?

One key factor for the BJP’s failure in the last State election was the absence of micro-organization and unsustainability of its occupied Assembly seats. The State BJP was more obsessed with Center Modi-wave, media campaigns and rallies than working at booth levels. The challenge for the new State BJP president is to correct this weakness and focus on ground, instead of depending on the Center

During the UPA time, the State Congress did the same blunder of depending too much on the Central unit instead of building grass root structures. It is like the drought affected Indian farmers waiting year after year for monsoon instead of digging theirown irrigation well to avoid drought.

In fact, the State BJP has always suffered due to its less focus on micro- organisation and its inability to repeat victory in its occupied Assembly Constituencies.

The first-phase growth of the BJP in Odisha occurred during 1980-1998 phase. During its formation year, the BJP had put up 28 Assembly candidates in 1980 poll in the State but failed to win any seat. In the 1985 Assembly election, the party opened its account by winning the Kamakhyanagar seat in Dhenkanal district. In 1990 Assembly poll, the party improved its performance and bagged 2 seats . 1995 Assembly election brought significant victory to the BJP. The State unit got 9 Assembly seats with 7.88 percent vote share, contesting for the first time in almost all seats. There has been slow growth of the party in the state due to the dominance of Biju Patnaik in the anti-Congress politics who was not inclined to share platform with the BJP.

The second phase growth of BJP occurred during 1998-2009 period in Odisha when the party formed alliance with the newly formed BJD to fight the Parliament and the Assembly elections. It formed the State Government as junior partner to the BJD in 2000 and 2004. In 2000 Assembly election, the Party got 18 per cent vote share and won 38 Assembly seats .In 2004 general election , the BJP got 32 Assembly seats in the same geography and bagged 17 per cent vote share.This period was the golden period of the State BJP.

The third phase in the BJP’s evolution occurred during 2009-2017 period. It was a devastating period for the State unit of the party. The BJD-BJP alliance collapsed before 2009 poll and the BJP had to fight the election alone. Its Assembly seat tally dropped to 6 in 2009 and 10 in 2014.The cause of 2009 and 2014 poll disaster was the absence of sustainability efforts to retain the previously occupied 38/32 Assembly constituencies.

The year 2017 marked the beginning of the fourth phase of Odisha BJP’s life. The party won an unprecedented massive Zilla Parishad seats in 2017 panchayat poll. The momentum continued till the 2019 general elections.

The split voting is a voter shield for BJD boss and CM Naveen Patnaik which may make 2024 Assembly poll more challenging for the BJP. The new State BJP president may focus on the sustainability of its occupied Assembly constituencies as well as replicate the models of Bhubaneswar MP and Puri / Brahmagiri/ Parlakhemundi MLAs to compete with the BJD in the coastal or general caste regions in 2024 Assembly poll.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/split-vote-in-2019-a-blow-for-bjp-in-state-politics.html

34,24-1-20,Threat to suspend us is human rights violation: Anganwadi workers,"n The protesting Anganwadi workers have termed the notices served to them with warning of suspension as the violation of their human rights.

According to state president of Anganwadi workers association Rekha Negi, “Suspending us does not make any difference per se because we just get Rs 125 per day but forcing and pressurising us to make us return to our work is the violation of human rights. We have not gone invisible without giving any notice to the department.

The government is pressurising Anganwadi supervisors too by delaying their salaries so that they can put pressure on us to resume work.

But we have rights too and no one can suspend us like that.”

However, according to the District Programme Officer (DPO) Akhilesh Mishra, no violation of human rights is happening and the department is working as per the standard procedure.

He said, “How is going on a strike supporting human rights while sending a notice asking them to return to their job is a violation of human rights? We are working according to the rules.

We have just issued the notice to appeal the protesters to resume their work. It’s up to them whether they want to come back or not, we are not forcibly picking anyone.

If they think that protesting for their rights is their human right then it is the duty of our department too to call them back to work.”

On the suspension of the Anganwadi workers he said, “At some places in Rudraprayag and Pauri, Anganwadi workers have been fired without any notice. We are still requesting the protesters here to join back but the ultimate decision about it is theirs.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/threat-to-suspend-us-is-human-rights-violation--anganwadi-workers.html

42,24-1-20,1st waste-to-energy plant of Govt commissioned in BBSR,"The country’s first Government-owned Waste-to-Energy Plant was commissioned at the Mancheswar Carriage Repair Workshop here on Wednesday.

Railway Board Member (Rolling Stock) Rajesh Agarwal inaugurated the facility in the presence of ECoR General Manager Vidya Bhushan and Additional General Manager Sudhir Kumar.

The plant, a patented technology called Polycrack, is first-of-its-kind in the Indian Railways and fourth in the country. It converts multiple feed stocks into hydrocarbon liquid fuels, gas, carbon and water.

Earlier, lots of nonferrous scrap generated from the Carriage Repair Workshop had no efficient method of disposal. As a result, these elements were being disposed by landfills which had hazardous impact on the environment. The polycrack technology does not emit any hazardous pollutants into the atmosphere.

The combustible, non-condensed gases are re-used for providing energy to the entire system. The emissions from the combustion are found to be much less than prescribed environmental norms. The process will produce energy in the form of light diesel oil, which is used to light furnaces.

The plant at Mancheswar has been constructed in a period of three months. Around Rs 2 crore has been spent for it. Wastes generated from the Mancheswar Carriage Repair Workshop, Coaching Depot and Bhubaneswar Railway Station would be feeder materials for the plant, which would access 500 kg of wastes per day. About Rs 17 lakh of income per annum would be generated from the byproducts, said an official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/1st-waste-to-energy-plant-of-govt-commissioned-in-bbsr.html
43,24-1-20,First elephant corridor padyatra held in State,"In a first, an Elephant Corridor Padayatra was organised by the Save Elephant Foundation in cooperation with the Orissa Environment Society and the Forest and Environment Department in the State for 10 days from January 12 to 21.

Experts participating in the Padayatra studied the position of elephant corridors linking various jungles and reasons behind various problems of the corridors and availability of foods for the pachyderms.

The Padyatra started after a meeting held under the chairmanship of Odisha Lokayukta Member Dr Debabrata Swain at Thakurmunda under Similipal area where Wildlife PCCF Dr Harishankar Upadhyaya and others made local residents aware of wild elephants, their habitations and corridors. A group took out a rally from here and moved 400 km to reach Tikarapada under the Satakosia tiger reserve, covering Hadagada, Anandpur, Remal, Daitari, Kaliapani, Kamakshanagar, Kaniha, Talcher, Handapa and Kurab. Similalry, another group moved through Bhimakunda, Anandpur, Ghagaon, Telkoi, Pallahada, Rengali, Riamal, Naktideula, Redhakhole and Kurab and reached Tikarpada.

A concluding meeting held here was also presided over by Swain. Former PCCF Dr Bijay Ketan Patnaik, OES president Dr Sundar Narayan Patra, secretary Jayakrushna Panigrahi, trust Dr chairman Dr Rajani Kant Jena, Satakosia DFO P Ramswami, trustee Jitashatru Mohanty, Dr Prakash Chandra Jena, former MLA Bibhudhendra Pratap Das, Raghunath Prushti, Er Manoranjan Mishra, Gayatri Devi, Sanjib Kumar Das, Dr Chanchar Sar and Dr Tanbir Ahammad spoke. During the Padayatra, participants held meetings at different places and interacted with locals about issues elephants, besides collecting date on pachyderms and their corridors.

It was marked that elephant habitations and corridors have been severely disturbed due to human interference in forms of various development projects such as construction of railways, roads and canals and undertaking of mining activities. They have also faced difficulties in getting adequate foods in the jungle.

It was also seen that cultivation of vegetables on elephant corridors and lack of awareness have intensified the man-animal conflict in many areas. More numbers of elephants are dying due to poaching, electrocution and use of poisons on vegetables. Thus, revival of elephant corridors by creating forests, shifting of human habitations from corridors and developing forests are some of the big challenges emerged before the State Government, animal lover and common people. A resolution containing these suggestions would be submitted to the State Government by the trust soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/first-elephant-corridor-padyatra-held-in-state.html
44,24-1-20,We need to initiate electoral reforms to be a strong republic,"Another Republic Day has arrived which provides an opportunity to the citizens for introspection on our achievements and failures in our republican march. The republican system, originates from the will of the people determined by free and fair election, which makes election process as its foundation. Unfortunately, successive Governments have failed to reform the election process to inject purity to the electoral verdict.

If Gandhiji, Netaji, Nehru and other leaders are credited for wining independence, Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan is credited for leading the fight to restore hard-earned freedom from Emergency rule imposed on June 25, 1975 by Indira Gandhi that curtailed freedom and imprisoned lakhs of people including, JP, Morarj Desai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Chandrasekhar, Biju Patnaik and others. It is JP led opposition unity that brought an end to Emergency when our judiciary was helpless in protecting freedom of the citizens while most of the media except a few failed to question the emergency excesses. If people would not have removed Indira Government by peaceful war of ballot, many would have suffered jail terms and died as judiciary then upheld emergency powers of the Government.

Abuse of law to curtail fundamental rights under different Union Governments continues unabated. Our IPC still adorns the sedition law of British that jailed Tilak and Gandhiji during freedom movement. Dissenting with any policy of the Government is fundamental to a republican democracy which should not be branded anti-national. People holding constitutional offices are trusties of the collective conscience and wisdom of the citizens and hence need to be amenable to criticism. The political history of democratic countries has many examples of Government tolerance to criticism. In past some citizens of USA publicly opposed the Vietnam policy or in the recent times expressed dissent on the President on his alleged attempt to influence Ukarine authorities to probe against his political rivals. They also opposed to his Iran policy. Have they been branded anti-national in the USA. We are taking pride as largest democracy of the world and must maintain its quality.

The 1974 Bihar students’ movement which later turned as A “Sampoorna Kranti” movement or JP movement as popularly known, had made electoral reform as main demand. The Janata party which came to power on the background of JP movement failed to fulfill the very objective of its formation and as a result disintegrated within three years. After coming to power Janata party leaders quarreled among themselves leading to the fall of the Government, which deeply hurt Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan who virtually had come to tears by describing “Mera Bag Ujadgaya”.

Keeping an election free and fair is a condition to sustain multiparty democracy. Jayaprakash Narayan was very emphatic for electoral reform for which he had constituted Tarkunde Committee which among other things called for formation of voter’s council to help in free and fair election. Volumes of reports by succeeding Law Commissions, Goswami Committee, Indrajit Gupta Committee as well various other reports on the subject are getting dust. Political parties are not at all serious in the matter. What they speak in opposition, forget once they get into power. It is not question of law or authority, but person’s credibility and probity in public life which is crucial to run any constitutional office. TN Seshan, the 10th Chief Election Commissioner, during his tenure could inject life into the Election Commission of India and heralded reforms in elections which his predecessors had failed to address. In 1992 he made history by cancelling elections in Bihar and Punjab on the ground of fairness. Some of his succeeding Election Commission failed to strengthen the confidence. The timing of election in mid of heat summer discourages public to participate in full strength. Besides, holding election in multiple phases even in small States smacked of political influence behind such decision. Poor and independent candidates found it difficult to mobilize their campaign in such long drawn process while for rich parties it was not that difficult, since they move in AC fitted vehicles and have resource to feed and lodge their leaders and workers. Several events like booth capturing by ousting / intimidating agents of opposition candidates came to notice, in some States when CEOs recommended for re-election. The EVM machines cannot root out such rigging unless Presiding Officers are made accountable to report on any booth capturing / rigging which is normally not done by polling officials to earn wrath of superior authority or to prevent exposure of system weakness.

Growing nexus between black-money and politicians has become a threat to democratic polity. The so-called ceiling on the election expenditure is a mockery and unpractical. Vajpayee had reportedly described the process as most non-transparent. No poor citizens can use his right to seek election, as the process is too cumbersome and complex, beyond the reach of poor and ordinary persons. In one Assembly segment in a southern State in 2009, a candidate reportedly spent Rs 1 lakh in each booth to hold community feasts which means in fooding alone, he spent Rs 2 crore in an Assembly segment. Other expenditures including number of unregistered vehicles, campaign materials he used to win the election may add up several lakhs. This is clear indicator as to how the expenditure ceiling works.

Affidavit is required to be filed together with nomination papers but this works as another deterrent for ordinary people to come forward to seek election to Assembly or Parliament. The present position of law debarring persons convicted of 2 years or more is good but it has affected political activists engaged in genuine political movements. A promising youth leader of Gujarat was debarred as being convicted for cases arising out of his political movement. Everyone knows that a series of such movements he launched led him to jail. Filing motivated cases against political adversaries is not new in India. The successive Governments have misused or abused authority by engaging premier investigating agencies like IT, ED, CBI against political rivals. Conviction or imprisonment in crimes like murder, peddling of arms, contraband materials, explosive substance etc. or monetary corruption can be the ground for debarring a person from contest but not cases of political fight.

Similarly, affidavits relating to information on property works as handicap to ordinary citizens particularly in tribal areas, for those who are not professional politicians and for those who want to contest independently. For example, if a citizen of a remote and tribal area desires to seek election during fag end of nomination process, he would find it difficult to collect necessary information in short time to meet various parameters. It is very easy to draw up criteria from AC chambers without realizing conditions on the ground whether such measures would facilitate or obstruct a participatory democracy in a multi-party republic like ours. Instead of affidavit, a format for declaration of various parameters can be accepted by Returning Officer at the time of filing nominations which can be sworn before the Returning Officer along with Oath Form. This would carry same legal weight and person making false declaration can be prosecuted.

The selection process for Election Commission needs to be changed to draw public confidence. The Government of the day appoints members to EC which needs to be depoliticized. A committee consisting of Chief Justice of Supreme Court, Law Minister, leaders of largest opposition party, and a nominee of CEC can constitute screening committee to select CEC and other members to strengthen independence of the EC. It seems that most of our political parties are not interested to reform the electoral process. Parties accuse each other as per their position in opposition or ruling space which the country has been witnessing over the years.

The renowned Unit-1 Market of Bhubaneswar is in a dilapidated state now. The question is whether we should come up with another market in the same place. The centralised market was a necessity several decades ago; and it has served the purpose well. Today if we come up with a similar facility and invite everyone in the city to the central business place, are we not planning for chaos in the city centre? Should we invite everybody to the city centre to buy their vegetables and groceries? It suits the people of the city to have four or five markets located strategically in four or five different parts of the city. Such decentralised establishments will help both buyers and sellers in addition to decongesting the city centre. The traders also will have more options as the new markets will be in a position to accommodate them. The place, where the market is existing now, can be converted into a site to showcase Bhubaneswar’s life and achievements. I appeal to the elected representatives, the officials and the citizens of this great city to think about such a proposal before going ahead with any other move.

55,24-1-20,Thieves decamp with Rs 15 lakh from ATM in Palamu,"Unknown criminals decamped with more than Rs 15 lakh stored in the SBI ATM at Harihurganj on the intervening night of Wednesday/ Thursday about 68 Kms off Daltonganj. Criminals broke open the ATM chest and took away the cash.

Giving this information SP Palamu Ajay Linda said the loot of 15 lakh of cash from ATM became public this Thursday morning and Harihurganj police swung into action.

The criminals had taken away the DVR of the CCTV camera thus blunting all chance and hope of police to scan the recorded images of the criminals.

Linda said this ATM was ‘idle’ over the last three days but no SBI official found time to tell this storage of this much of huge cash there in the ATM in all these days and now when criminals decamped with more than 15 lakh then the SBI is coming up with the complaint.

Linda said there remains no security guard at this SBI ATM.

He questioned the wisdom of the senior SBI officials as to how any ATM can be left unguarded when its services are claimed to be 24x7.

The criminals even made bid to break open the vault of the bank but failed.

A nearby welding shop was raided by the criminals from where they got hammer and gas cutter which they used to rip apart the cash box of the ATM. Police have lodged the case and a hunt is said Linda adding the gang is suspected to be a local one.

On complicity of any bank personnel the SP said police are investigating the matter. SDPO Chhaterpur Shambhu K Singh said the bank officials just take security angle too lightly and never bother to keep police informed of this particular ATM not functioning since 3 days with such a cash there as had the SBI informed the Harihurganj police and taken help this incident might not have happened as then police would have patrolled this ATM more.

It was also speculated that the CM had submitted the list of lawmakers, who will be inducted in Cabinet, however, in the evening Chief Minister again visited Raj Bhavan urging the Governor to defer the date of Cabinet expansion.

By afternoon MLAs from both Congress and JMM camp said that Soren Government’s first Cabinet expansion will take place on Friday. Congress MLA from Lohardaga and Minister in Soren’s Cabinet Rameshwar Oroan said, “Even we had the idea that Soren’s first Cabinet expansion will take place on Friday.”

The Soren Government decided to defer the date for Cabinet expansion as State has witnessed two back to back incidents at Chaibasa and Lohardaga. Hemant Soren said, “As the State has witnessed shocking incident at Chaibasa, in which seven innocent people were killed, we had decided to defer the oath ceremony as this is not the time for celebration.”

Seven villagers were killed in the jungles of Burugelikera village of West Singhbhum district, by the Pathalgadhi supporters. The incident came to light when the seven villagers who had opposed to Pathalgadhi movement went missing from the village.

Also on Thursday violence broke out in Lohardaga after pro CAA March was attacked by anti-social elements. After the incident, violence broke out in the area in which half a dozen people including police personnel were injured.

Friday was said to first Cabinet expansion of Soren government after he took oath as 11th Chief Minister of State on December 29.

Three MLAs including two from Congress ( Alamgir Alam and Rameshwar Oroan) and one RJD MLA Satyanand Bhokta took oath along with Soren at the function held at historic Morhabadi ground. Sources said that on Friday eight MLAs will took oath which includes five from JMM quota and three from Congress were to take oath.

From Congress camp, names of Bermo MLA and trade union leader Rajendra Prasad Singh, first time MLA from Mahagama Deepika Pandey Singh who was also in Rahul Gandhi team holding the post of national general secretary in Youth Congress and Congress in-charge of North East. The name of Jamshedpur West MLA Banna Gupta and first time Congress MLA from Ramgarh Mamata Devi was doing rounds.

However, sources said that the Soren government decided to defer the Cabinet expansion as both the parties have not reached a consensus on number of ministerial berths both the parties will get and probable faces in new Cabinet.

Sources said that on Thursday evening State Congress in-charge RPN Singh met Congress president Sonia Gandhi to finalize the names of ministers from Congress camp.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cabinet-expansion-deferred-due-to-chaibasa-massacre.html
57,24-1-20,BJP attacks Government on law and order,"The BJP on Thursday attacked the Hemant Soren Government on the law and order situation in State. Union Tribal Affairs minister, Arjun Munda attacking Soren Government over Chaibasa and Lohardaga incident said that law and order comes under State Government and it is duty of State Government to check such incidents.

On the media query that police have recovered the bodies of seven villagers who were in West Singhbhum district for allegedly opposing Pathalgarhi, Munda said, “It is duty of State Government to maintain law and order in State. If the State Government needs any help and assistance from Centre the Union Government is always ready to help.”

Munda said that the police are investigating the case and exact reason behind the Chaibasa incident can be known after investigation is complete. However, police have said that all seven kidnapped people including a deputy mukhiya have been allegedly killed by pro-Pathalgadi supporters in West Singhbhum district.

These people were allegedly kidnapped by pro-Pathalgadi supporters for staging protest against Pathalgadi movement. On the issue of Lohardaga incident Munda said, “The incident is unfortunate, police should deal strictly with people indulging in such type of incidents. It is duty of State Government to maintain law and order.”

Stones were hurled at a rally taken out in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act in Lohardaga district on Thursday, sparking tensions in the area. After the stone pelting there was large scale violence in the area with protestors targeting police van, shops and business establishments.

Reacting strongly to the violent incident that took place in Lohardaga, State BJP president Laxman Gilua said that incident of sponsored stone pelting, arson and violence on peaceful procession in support of CAA in Lohardaga today is condemnable.

Gilua said that incident of sponsored stone pelting, arson and violence on peaceful procession in support of CAA in Lohardaga today is condemnable. The procession was taken out peacefully by the route set by the administration, which included thousands of men and women. Gilua also attacked State Government for poor law and order situation in State.

He said, “On one hand there is genocide of tribals, violence is being done in a peaceful procession, it is not a good sign for state as there is serious administrative lapses on both the incidents.” Gilua said,”If such type of incidents are not checked than the BJP will not sit silent. We will not allow the state to become anarchic under any circumstances.”

The State BJP has strongly condemned violence in Lohardaga and termed it as State Government and local administration failure. BJP state spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that people were taking out a peaceful march supporting Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in town when they were attacked by anti-social elements with petrol bombs and stones.

The protestors attacked the mob with swords and poles. Shahdeo said that the manner in which the peacefully protesting procession was attacked seems to be part of a larger conspiracy. The BJP spokesperson claimed that law and order situation in state has worsened after new government formation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-attacks-government-on-law-and-order.html

60,24-1-20,"Cong, SAD, BJP, AAP join hands to save Punjab waters","n Transcending political barriers, Punjab’s all prominent parties — Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), besides others — come together on one platform on Thursday with the sole aim of saving Punjab waters.

During the all-party meeting convened by the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, all political fronts unanimously demanded reassessment of the state’s water availability and resolved that the Centre should ensure that Punjab’s river water is not in any way transferred from basin to non-basin areas of the state’s three rivers.

Expressing concern over the state’s critical water situation, all parties also unanimously demanded suitable amendments to the proposed Inter-State River Water Disputes Act to set up a new tribunal, besides ensuring that Punjab gets adequate water “in a just and equitable manner in keeping with its total demand and securing livelihood of the future generations”.

“Punjab does not have surplus water and is facing a threat of desertification with declining availability of its river water and fast depleting groundwater. The state’s groundwater that meets 73 percent of its irrigation requirements, has declined to alarming levels, threatening the livelihood of farmers,” the resolution read.

It added, “In such a situation, it is unanimously resolved that the Government of India should ensure that Punjab river water is not in any way transferred from basin to non-basin areas of the Ravi, Sutlej and Beas as per the internationally accepted riparian principle.

Further, alternatives should be ascertained, including amendments to the proposed Inter State River Water Disputes Act to set up a new tribunal for a complete assessment of availability of river waters before the decision, to harness, develop and provide adequate water to Punjab in a just and equitable manner in keeping with its total demand and securing livelihood of the future generations.”

The resolution was moved by Water Resources Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria at an all-party meeting convened by the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to ascertain ways to address the state’s continuously aggravating water crisis.

Though the resolution did not mention the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, leaders of all political parties, including the SAD and AAP, maintained that any move to construct the controversial canal with Haryana could be fatal for the State.

FILE ANOTHER SUIT IN SC SEEKING FRESH ASSESMENT OF PUNJAB WATER: AAP

Extending full support to the government in promoting crop diversification to enable water conservation, AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema suggested that Punjab should file another suit in the Supreme Court seeking fresh assessment of the available water in the State. He added that the state should insist on redistribution of water on riparian laws.

“The situation in Malwa is bad,” he said, citing the growing number of cancer cases resulting from industrial water pollution, especially in Buddha Nullah. AAP MLA from Sunam Aman Arora urged the State Government to form a sub-committee of Minister, officers and representatives of all political parties to further work on the vital issue.

BESIDES LEGAL REMEDIES, PURSUE SYL ISSUE POLITICALLY TOO: SAD

Terming Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal (SYL) a major issue, SAD’s senior leader Balwinder Singh Bhundur said that apart from legal remedies, “it is important to pursue the matter politically also”.

Extending SAD’s support to any step taken by the Capt Amarinder government to tackle the crisis, Bhundur said that reassessment of the water levels in Punjab’s rivers was imperative. Also urging all parties not to indulge in blame game, Bhundur said that all parties should unite to protect Punjab’s water resources. Dubbing SYL as “suicidal” for Punjab, SAD’s former Minister Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal endorsed the Chief Minister’s oft repeated warning that it would lead to violence and possible revival of terrorism in the State.

“The Supreme Court should hear a fresh petition and stay its decree on construction of SYL. If the Centre’s fresh legislation for a new tribunal is passed, it would spell disaster for Punjab,” he added. Calling for change in Section 12 of the Inter-State River Water Dispute (Amendment) Bill, 2019, to protect Punjab’s water interests, he underlined the need to put up a united fight on the issue.

SAD senior leader Prem Singh Chandumajra was also of the view that riparian laws need to be followed in water allocation to Punjab.“Nothing short of riparian principle would be acceptable as the basis for a solution to the issue of waters of all three Punjab rivers. The party also demanded the deletion of Clause 5 of the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act-2004 as it violates the Riparian Principle,” he said.

“SAD has made supreme sacrifices and launched major Morchas to secure Punjab’s right on the waters of its rivers on the basis of the Riparian Principle under which non-Riparian State like Rajasthan and Haryana have no right on even a single drop from the waters from Punjab rivers. It is unfortunate that in the past, some parties, notably the Congress opposed the SAD on the issue. But we feel vindicated that today finally, all political parties have accepted the correctness and constitutional and legal soundness of the Akali demand,” he said.

He also expressed satisfaction over “SAD’s success in getting the Chief Minister to agree to convene a special session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha to state that no exception would be made to the Riparian Principle in the final settlement of the River Waters dispute and to consider deletion of Clause 5 from the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act”.

“We wanted the all party meet to reject the Clause 5 of the Punjab Termination of Agreements of Act today itself as it constitutes an exception in so far as it violates the Riparian Principle and should therefore be deleted in the Special Session of the Punjab Legislative Assembly to be called for the purpose.

Although the final resolution of the all party meet did not include our demand for deletion of that Clause, but we were able to get the other parties to agree to consider it during the special session of the Vidhan Sabha. We will insist on its deletion in the special session,” he said adding that AAP did not support our demand for the deletion of this clause.

Chandumajra also urged the Chief Minister to demand royalty for waters already given from Punjab’s rivers to Haryana and Rajasthan. “They have been using our waters against all constitutional and legal norms, precedents and principles. There are strong precedents supporting Punjab’s demand for royalty from Rajasthan and Haryana,” he said.

BREAK WHEAT-PADDY CYCLE, ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION: BJP

Former Minister and senior BJP leader Madan Mohan Mittal stressed on the importance of breaking the paddy-wheat cycle and ensuring diversification, along with regeneration of ground water, to boost the income of Punjab’s farmers, who were reeling under major debts despite their contribution to the nation’s food security.

Mittal, who thanked the Chief Minister for bringing all parties on one platform on the critical issue, also agreed with the State Government’s stand for minimum support price (MSP) support by the Centre for crop diversification.

LEFT PARTIES WANT LONGOWAL ACCORD TO BE FOLLOWED

Left parties, including Communist Party of India (CPI) represented by Bant Brar, and Communist Party-Marxist (CPM) represented by Sukhwinder Singh Sekhon, demanded that the Longowal accord should be followed in the distribution of water. CPM’s Sekhon was of the view that Swaminathan Commission report should be implemented in toto in the interest of the farmers.

STOP FREE POWER FOR TUBEWELLS, PROMOTE RAINWATER HARVESTING: TMC

Trinamool Congress’ Manjit Singh maintained that to prevent water wastage, the State Government should stop giving free power for tubewells, besides promoting rainwater harvesting along with sewage treatment to conserve groundwater. He suggested that the Government should give 100 percent subsidy for construction of composite pits for recharge of water.

TMC leader said that his party was with the State Government on saving water, especially through crop diversification.

BSP’s Jasbir Singh Garhi asserted that Punjab had always been discriminated against by the Central Government, thus denying its due water share.

NCP’s Swaran Singh also batted for the reassessment of water levels to ensure that Punjab is not cheated out of its due.

SHOW COLLECTIVE WILL, LEAVE EGOS TO SAVE PUNJAB: JAKHAR

Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, in his concluding remarks, urged all parties to show collective will, leaving their egos aside in order to save Punjab. He suggested that an all-party delegation to meet the Prime Minister with a mercy petition, given that people would start dying unless the problem is resolved at the earliest.

“NOT INVITED” BAINS BROTHERS PROTEST OUTSODE VENUE

Not invited for the all-party meeting on water issues, the Lok Insaaf Party’s (LIP) staged a protest dharna outside the venue of the meeting. LIP MLAs Simrajeet Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains, popularly known as Bains Brothers, staged a protest against the State Government, especially the Chief Minister, for not inviting them for the crucial meeting where all other parties, including NCP, BSP, CPI, CPM — which even do not have any MLA — have been invited. Later clarifying, the Chief Minister said that the Bains brothers had not been invited to the meeting as only political parties, recognized by the Election Commission, had been included in the list of invitees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong--sad--bjp--aap-join-hands-to-save-punjab-waters.html
61,24-1-20,ALL-PARTY DELEGATION TO MEET PM Modi,"Welcoming positive and constructive suggestions given by leaders of all the parties, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said that the State Government would seek time from the Prime Minister to take an all-party delegation to represent Punjab’s case.

“The internationally accepted riparian principles have been ignored in the distribution of water in India,” he pointed out, stressing the need to correct the same.

He also announced that the State Government would hold such all-party meetings every six months to discuss important issues related to Punjab.

Terming the water problem a vital issue of concern to the whole of Punjab, and not just to his Government or the Congress party, the Chief Minister pointed out that water had emerged as a global issue in view of the climate change and melting glaciers.

“Cities are predicted to go under water across the world,” he noted, adding that while that “might not happen in our time, we owe it to the future generations to find a solution”.

The meeting had been convened to discuss the issue threadbare and arrive at a consensus to facilitate the formulation of a cohesive and long-term policy, he said.

Expressing concern over the depleting groundwater table, the Chief Minister observed that the level in Punjab rivers had reduced from 17 MAF, as listed by the Eradi Commission, to less than 13 MAF now.

“State Government has been pressing the Prime Minister to form a fresh Commission to assess the current water levels in Punjab’s three rivers. This is imperative in view of the changed situation,” he said after the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-party-delegation-to-meet-pm-modi.html
62,24-1-20,"Khattar will now look after CID dept, squabble ends","Ending days of speculation and squabble between Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Home Minister Anil Vij over the control of CID, the state government late on Wednesday night brought a notification divesting Vij of the department, which will now be handled by the CM.

A Haryana government statement said, ""Governor of Haryana, on the advice of the chief minister, has allocated some new portfolios to the chief minister and to two ministers. As per a notification issued by the chief secretary, the portfolios of the Criminal Investigation Department, and the departments of Personnel and Training and of Raj Bhawan Affairs have been allocated to the chief minister, Manohar Lal, in addition to his existing portfolios, with immediate effect,"" the statement said.

Apart from this, the portfolio of Elections has been allocated to Transport Minister Mool Chand Sharma while the portfolio of Art and Cultural Affairs, hitherto allocated to Sharma, has been allocated to Education Minister Kanwar Pal, in addition to their existing portfolios.

""Thus, the home minister, Anil Vij, will cease to hold the portfolio of Criminal Investigation Department and the transport minister, Mool Chand Sharma, will cease to hold the portfolio of Art and Cultural Affairs,"" the statement, issued at midnight said.

The development came after the Bharatiya Janata Party officially said the differences between Khattar and Vij over the CID's control have been resolved. Party in-charge of Haryana, Anil Jain on Wednesday said the issue has been resolved. He said the chief minister is the head of the government and he can keep whatever departments he wants to have. Vij had placed the demand that state CID chief Anil Rao, who is an ADGP-rank officer, be replaced with Shrikant Jadhav, another senior IPS officer, after charging the former with ""disobedience and negligent behaviour in official duty"".

Rising tensions between the minister and the state CID chief had triggered a tug-of-war between Vij and the chief minister over the control of the department. Khattar recently said the CID remained under the chief minister's control during the terms of Bansi Lal and Devi Lal, an assertion that appeared to counter the home minister''s claim over the department.

After the CID was taken away from him, a sobre Vij on Thursday said he has always maintained that the chief minister is supreme and can take away or divide any department, hours after he was stripped of the charge of CID. He refused to comment on the matter any further.

GOVT ONLY SQUABBLING ON DEPARTMENT, ALLEGES HOODA

After Home Minister Anil Vij was stripped of the charge of CID, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday hit out at the Khattar-led BJP-JJP government, saying it was doing no work except ""squabbling over"" who controls which department. ""Three months have passed, but this government has failed to come out with a Common Minimum Programme...there are burning issues facing farmers, economy, law and order, unemployment rate at 28 per cent is the highest in the country, but this government is paying no attention towards these and is squabbling over who controls which department and is busy in ordering transfers of officials,"" the Leader of the Opposition told a news conference here.

He was asked to comment on Vij being stripped of the charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which will now be handled by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Replying to another question, he said it was up to Vij, who had once said that ""CID is like the Home Department's eyes and ears"".",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/khattar-will-now-look-after-cid-dept--squabble-ends.html

“Bose was much disciplined and sacrificed immense for the Country. He sacrificed all his happiness for the independent of the Country and chose hardest way of life and also proved his mettle. In an attempt to get early independent Bose established Azad Hind Fauz and given slogan of ‘Give Blood I will Provide Independent’ (Tum Mujhe Khoon Do Mai Tumhe Azadi Dunga).

This is not new to celebrate 123rd birth anniversary of Bose, such kind of occasions have been celebrated at Congress Bhawan since past,” he added.

Paying tribute to Bose, Youth Congress State president, Kumar Gaurav said that Subhash Chandra Bose was the most energetic and youthful leader of the Country during independent movement, who sacrificed his all happiness for the independence of the Country.

69,24-1-20,"Schools defy Executive order, remain open on Government Holiday","Defying the directive of the government and the District Administration to declare holiday on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary on Thursday, several private schools – including some renowned institutions such as the Delhi Public School, DAV Gandhinagar, DAV Kapil Dev and Bridgeford Public School – remained open on Thursday.

Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray, in a tweet on Wednesday, said, “All schools of Ranchi to remain closed tomorrow on 23rd January 2020 as the day has been declared a public holiday by the Jharkhand CMO.”

However, only a few schools took the directive seriously. Most of the ICSE schools, including St. Xavier’s Doranda and Sacred Heart School Hulhundu, declared a holiday on Thursday on account of Subash Chandra Bose Jayanti. The schools that did not declare a holiday had their own reasons. Some said that the directive did not mention anything about private schools, while many were unwilling to reschedule examinations that were supposed to be conducted on Thursday.

“The directive from the District Administration did not specify anything about private schools. Also, many students had their exams on Thursday, and closing the school might have disturbed the exam schedule,” said Principal of DPS Ranchi, Ram Singh. The decision of whether a school has to have classes or not on a given day is usually taken independently by the school authority, he added.

Ranchi DC Rai Mahimapat Ray, however, said that most of the schools in Ranchi remained closed on Thursday. The administration cannot force schools to declare holiday, he added. “Most of the schools remained closed today. Some schools had exams and some had other reasons to stay open,” he said, refusing to comment on whether the Administration would take any action against the schools that defied the directive or not.

The directive assumes significance as it came directly from the Chief, who on Tuesday announced that January 23 will be public holiday in Jharkhand on account of the birth anniversary of Subhash Chandra Bose.

Interestingly, the date was removed from the list of public holidays in Jharkhand for five years – from 2015 to 2019 – during a former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government. The Gomoh railway station in Jharkhand has been named after Subash Chandra Bose as he made his great escape from the railway station by catching the Howrah-Kalka Mail during the British rule in India.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/schools-defy-executive-order--remain-open-on-government-holiday.html

74,24-1-20,Candid Notes,"Cover up

Eager to improve ranking of the provisional state capital Dehradun in the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2020- the city got a dismal but deserving 384th position in the sanitation rankings of cities last year- the overzealous officials of Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) are engaged in a massive cover up exercise to hide the perpetually dirty places of the city. In this endeavour, the MCD has erected green sheets along the major roads around unauthorised garbage disposal sites to obstruct the view of the survey team which is supposed to land in the city soon. The smart Babus of the corporation have also come up with an ingenious way of covering their inefficiency by setting up strategically placed billboards along the river bridges in the city. These publicity materials are serving the purpose of hiding the river banks which have become dark underbellies of the city. The myopic planners have converted these once perennial rivers with clean water into garbage choked drains carrying the filth of the city. Travelling over the busy Rispana Bridge on Haridwar road, the eyesore of the illegal taxi stand right on the river bed is not visible these days thanks to the hoardings asking people to give positive feedback on sanitation ranking. Keep your fingers crossed for this year’s ranking.

Fighting fit

Chief Minister TSR surprised everyone with his physical fitness and agility during a badminton match in Dehradun recently. Teaming up with the DG police, law and order, Ashok Kumar, the CM notched up victories over his rivals in two back to back matches. One can understand the psychological condition and innate fear of the lesser mortals taking on the duo of CM and DG of police even in a friendly contest but those who had witnessed the encounters were all praise for athleticism shown by the CM in these matches. TSR has remained a fitness freak during his entire political career taking out time for an adipose tissue burning early morning jog or sweating it out on a badminton court. On the political front also the CM is having a very good time with firm control over things. He is blessed with a situation where there is no one who can be termed as his potential challenger as of now. With Uttarakhand slated to go for assembly elections two years from now, it would be interesting to observe his manoeuvres on the political field.

Stressed secretaries

Hassled by the overbearing attitude, undue demands and brusque behaviour of the other half of a minister in the Himalayan state, the Babus deputed as personal secretary of the minister prefer to call it quits rather than continuing with the plum assignment. It is learnt that as many as six PSs have left the job and sought refuge in other departments in last two and half years. The spouse has always created problems for the minister in the past with some issues finding space in newspapers and given ammunition to the opposition to attack the government. The most prominent of them being the kidney scam that rocked the assembly last year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-01-24.html
75,24-1-20,CM directs depts to present plan for tackling migration,"Special schemes focused on mitigating migration should be implemented in the selected blocks of the State. A migration mitigation fund should also be set up and in a month all departments should present the work plan for mitigating migration.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said this chairing a meeting on migration from the rural areas of the State at the secretariat here on Thursday.

Rawat said that special focus should be laid on the border areas of the State. Schemes to be prepared for such areas should be flexible. Attempt should be made to ensure that as many locals as possible are encouraged to live in the border areas. This is also vital from the strategic point of view, he said.

Rawat further said that the names of women should also be registered in land documents. Stating that the proportion of woman population is higher in mountain villages, he said that schemes implemented in the villages should be centered on women. Stressing on registering the names of women in land documents, he said that this will enable them to receive loans for agriculture, animal husbandry, self-employment and other aspects easily. The revenue department should made necessary provision for this, he added.

The CM further directed the Tourism department to prepare the eco-tourism policy at the earliest. The forest and tourism departments should work in coordination for eco-tourism. Stating that home-stay should be linked to other tourism activities and the market, he said that training in hospitality should be facilitated for those involved in home-stays.

The tourism department should prepare a mobile phone application providing district-wise information about wildlife, flora, tourist spots, treks, hotels, home-stays and other relevant information.

Pointing at the need for resolving the shortage of field staff in rural mountainous areas, Rawat said that special focus will have to be laid on drinking water availability. Stating that cultivation of off-season vegetables, fishery, goat-rearing and floriculture can also play an important role in doubling the income of farmers, he stressed on the need for adopting a cluster based approach.

In the villages most affected by migration, the education, health, energy and other linear departments should conduct gap analysis. Gaps found anywhere should be resolved on a priority basis, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-directs-depts-to-present-plan-for-tackling-migration.html

In the State complete lawlessness is prevalent as illegal liquor, mining mafia and transport mafia is active still no action is taken against them. The Congressmen in collusion with officials are encroaching government lands, alleged Lunawat.

The event held in collaboration with PRSI Bhubaneswar focused on the theme titled “Public relations in the evolving technological landscape”.

In today’s world, social media platforms like Twitter are becoming an integral part of press releases. Rather than directly going to a person, tweets are now used as quotes. Contents are being repurposed. Press releases are becoming multimedia releases. In the near future, Artificial Intelligence will take over mundane jobs. News anchors may be replaced in the future by robots working on AI. Creative jobs however will stand the test of time. Creativity is difficult to replicate artificially, so a person who is creative will be in demand.

Reliance Jio Infocomm VP Rohit Dubey said, “Technology is an enabler not subservience. Public Relation is a constant learning process with young people at the forefront. It is a vast and dynamic subject. The arrival of big ticket investments has led to a boom in public relations.”

A PR person has to overcome the negatives and act as a bridge between the people and the government or a company. Talking about the skills required in public relations, Aditya Birla Group AVP Corp Shashank Pattnaik said, “If you can keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut, then you are an excellent public relations person,”

Nalco DGM Ashutosh Rath said, “90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years. The rise of big data coupled with artificial intelligence will allow people to understand public emotions better.”

Associated with IIMC Dhenkanal for over twenty years, Prof Subir Ghosh said nowadays, public relation is a 24X7 process.

91,24-1-20,Eerie of silence prevails at village,"An utter silence prevailed in the Burugulikera village on Thursday. A day after seven dead bodies of tribals who were killed after protests against Pathalgadi, the West Singhbhum police have increased security arrangements in the district. The villagers were killed allegedly by pathalgadi supporters of the same village, in the Burugulikera forest under Gudri police station area in West Singhbhum. Police and CRPF are camping in affected village.

Sources informed that the police have decided to ensure strict vigil and deploy additional security forces in the fringe areas of the district.

“Security has been beefed up in the area and they were keeping strict vigil on movement of the villagers too.

We are frisking commuters in the bordering areas. At some places common people are also being interrogated by police and paramilitary force on suspicion. Forces have been deployed in strategic locations,” said a police official.

A villager said that CM Hemant Soren personally met the villagers and said that people's security is his top-most priority .Nobody has the right to take law into their hands. We know that SIT has already constituted.

“When we met CM he assured that Jharkhand is not only a state for him but a family. Necessary directives have been given to police for preventing such incidents in future, he said.

Those killed have been identified as James Burh, Jawra Burh, Lomba Burh, Koje Topno, Etwa Burh, Nirmal Burh and Bobas Lomga, all residents of Burugulikera village.

Police are however claiming that though prima-facie it appears to be fight between pro-pathalgadi and anti-pathalgadi supporters but they are also looking into personal diapute between two groups one led by current Up-mukhiya (deputy mukhiya) James Burh and another led by Raisingh Burh husband of former mukhiya Mukta Horo.

“Initial probe suggests that it was a fallout of dispute between two groups. The group whose members were killed had attacked and ransacked house of Raisingh Burh on January 16. A meeting was called by the gram sabha on January 19 (Sunday) where there was uproar and group owing allegiance to Raisingh Burh started beating James Burh and his men. It was only yesterday that we got some information from the village market about killing of the villagers and started search operation,” said West Singhbhum SP Inderjeet Mahatha.

Villagers pulled down Pathalgadi plaque at Chitramu village in Khunti India on Thursday July 20, 2018 The pathalgadi movement has its origin in a resistance movement by tribals during British rule.

92,24-1-20,Violence grips Lohardaga after attack on pro-CAA rally,"Lohardaga simmered in tension on Thursday after stone-pelting on a rally taken out in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) triggered violence, which snowballed into a conflagration. Subsequent arson, vandalism and clashes between two groups reportedly caused injuries to at least 50 people, local sources said.

Various right wing organizations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and some wings of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had taken out the rally in support of the CAA on Thursday morning in Lohardaga town, about 60 Kilometers west of Capital Ranchi. The peaceful rally reportedly turned hostile after stones were pelted by anti-CAA protestors and some locals at Amlatoli Chowk, police said.

Several vehicles and shops were set ablaze and the police had to resort to firing in the air in order to control the situation. Lohardaga Superintendent of Police Priyadarshi Alok and other top cops of the district rushed to the spot on Thursday afternoon to pacify the crowd. Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been imposed in the district, which prohibits assembly of more than four people within the periphery of the district, police said.

“Sufficient forces have been deployed in the district to prevent any further incidents of clashes. Some of our policemen have sustained injuries while trying to disperse the crowd,” said Additional Director General (Operations), Murari Lal Meena. “I want to assure that strict action will be taken against all the individuals who have taken law in hand and were involved in sparking the violence,” he added.

Lohardaga turned into a fortress by Thursday afternoon and several hundred security personnel, including Rapid Action Force and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), were deployed across the district to prevent further damage to property and life in clashes. Local sources said that the situation was tensed in the affected areas even on Thursday late evening and people preferred staying indoors.

The Lohardaga clashes come as the first ever incident of violence related to the CAA in Jharkhand. While the protests gained momentum in the national capital and parts of Uttar Pradesh soon after the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was passed by the Rajya Sabha on December 11, Jharkhand did not witness any incident of violent protests. On December 23, a tripartite alliance of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD0 dethroned a former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government here.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad took a dig at the ruling JMM-led Govt here over the violence, claiming that the police did not stop the crowd from attacking the participants of the rally. The official Twitter handle of the VHP on Thursday tweeted, “Members of a particular community pelted stones and threw petrol bombs on CAA supporters in Lohardaga. They set ablaze houses and targeted women.”

A video featuring a bodyguard of the Lohardaga SP went viral on social media on Thursday. In the video, the bodyguard said that the stone pelting started from a particular colony and injured several policemen.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/violence-grips-lohardaga-after-attack-on-pro-caa-rally.html
93,24-1-20,UT Admn decides to submit alternatives to Tribune flyover,"With the Punjab and Haryana High Court order, virtually putting brakes on Tribune Flyover project, the Chandigarh Administration has now decided to submit “best alternative options” to the Court in place of the ambitious project.

In its report to be submitted to the High Court next month, the Administration will apprize the Court about “best alternatives options” suggested during public hearing and by UT Urban Planning Department.

During the public hearing held in December last year, city based architects had come up with several proposals including improving the design of Tribune Chowk roundabout, diverting the traffic which has no business with Chandigarh via bypass or ring road, combination of underpass and overpass, dedicated bus or auto drop offs and lane driving, the use of timers at light points, recalibration/optimisation of timing/dynamic timing (to prevent clogging of vehicles at the roundabout and prevent empty green lights) among others.Instead of the contentious flyover project, the UT Urban Planning Department had earlier suggested that alternative routes or bypasses from Industrial Area, Phase –II for right turning cars and buses towards ISBT, Sector 43 may be explored. Apart from this, provision of lane markings, directional arrows, intersection controlled markings and bus boxes were recommended.

Only a day before at the meeting of Apex Committee for coordination of tricity held under Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator VP Singh Badnore here, the Haryana Government had also asked the Administration to explore alternatives to alleviate congestion at Tribune Chowk instead of going for a flyover project.

At the meeting, when the UT Administration pushed for approval from neighboring State Governments on Tribune flyover project, the Punjab Government clearly stated that the Tribune flyover does not fall under its jurisdiction and they will not comment on it while Haryana Government had asked Administration to explore alternatives such as installing Traffic Lights at the junction instead of constructing a flyover.

“In its report to be submitted to the High Court, the UT Administration will give details about the alternative options that could be executed in place of Tribune flyover project to reduce traffic congestion at the junction,” said a senior officer of UT Administration.

He said that the Administration is preparing the report after exploring all the alternatives suggested during the public hearing and other meetings.The foundation stone of flyover project was laid by Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator VP Singh Badnore last year.Notably, the Administration had faced severe criticism from the denizens during the public hearing held for the proposed Tribune Flyover project in December last year.Large number of people had turned up at the public hearing with alternative suggestions and even, presentations to oppose the flyover project, which is stated to impact the city scape and heritage considerations besides resulting in cutting of more than 400 trees.

The High Court (HC)?had in November last year stayed the transplanting and axing of 473 trees for the Tribune flyover project, on an NGO’s plea. The Court, while observing that the project is being implemented in violation of Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, had put the stay on cutting of trees for the project, virtually putting brakes on the project. The UT Administration had then submitted in the Court, to hold a public hearing on the project. The Court was told that after examining the project and holding public hearing, the Administration will submit a report in this regard.

According to the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, over bridges or flyovers are not recommended to be constructed in entire city of Chandigarh due to heritage considerations, since they impact the visual city scape, and cause inconvenience to the pedestrians.

To alleviate the traffic congestion at the Tribune Chowk, the master plan had infact recommended construction of underpass, as proposed in the RITES (Rail India Technical And Economic Services) report.

However, the construction of the flyover and underpass at Tribune Chowk was later proposed for making traffic steady and smooth at the most busy junction of the city- Tribune Chowk, where there is the highest concentration of vehicular traffic.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-admn-decides-to-submit-alternatives-to-tribune-flyover.html

100,24-1-20,"Shaheen Bagh is mini Pak, many mini-Pak in Delhi: BJP’s Kapil","Former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader-turned BJP candidate from Model Town Assembly constituency, Kapil Mishra, termed the ongoing protest against the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh as mini Pakistan while his senior party colleagues dubbed Shaheen Bagh “shame bagh” and likened the protesters to anarchists.

In a series of provocative tweets, the BJP's candidate from Model Town also said Pakistani rioters have taken over the streets of Delhi. He made no specific mention of the movement against the CAA but sharply attacked the protest at Shaheen Bagh and other places in the city.

""Pakistan has made its entry in Shaheen Bagh. Many mini Pakistans are being formed in Delhi. Indian law is not not being followed in Shaheen Bagh, Chandbagh, Indralok,"" Mishra tweeted.

""Pakistan rioters have encroached on the roads of Delhi (Pakistan ki entry Shaheen Bagh mein ho chuki hain. Delhi mein chhote chhote Pakistan Banaye ja rahe hain. Shaheen Bagh, Chand Bagh, Indralok mein desk ka kanoon nahi mana jaa raha hain. Pakistani dangayiyo ka Delhi ki sadko pe kabza),"" he tweeted.

Later, at a Press conference, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra slammed the ruling party over the Shaheen Bagh protest, saying that the anarchist stands with anarchist.

""Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has given a statement that he stands with Shaheen Bagh. I want to say anarchists stands with anarchists...At Shaheen Bagh, grand confusion is being spread (about CAA),"" Patra said.

Patra alleged that AAP leaders are inciting violence in the national Capital.""Being the Chief Minister of Delhi, why didn't Kejriwal and Sisodia go to Shaheen Bagh to appeal protestors to call off their protest and not to abuse the Prime Minister? They (AAP) are doing politics of appeasement,"" the BJP spokesperson said.

Patra sought to know why the Chief Minister doesn't see the problems of residents living near Shaheen Bagh and listed Sarita Vihar, Jasola and Madangir Khadar. ""Ambulances don't go to these areas due to protests against the CAA and people have been facing a lot of problems,"" the BJP leader said.

Hitting hard at the AAP, Vijay Goel, senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP said that the AAP is running away from its responsibilities. ""Why haven't AAP leaders gone to Shaheen Bagh yet?...Shaheen Bagh has become Shame Bagh,"" said Goel. He also said the CAA does not take away anyone's citizenship rights.

""Some people are sitting in protest against CAA but not a single Congress leader has condemned it, that is their character...,"" said BJP President J P Nadda at a public meeting in Palam.

Poddar said that after attaining independence, the challenge before India was to convert its agro-based economy into an industry-based economy in line with the then global scenario.

By supporting cooperation in the establishment of HEC, Russia had agreed to be an integral friend of India. Then the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru called HEC the temple of modern India. Poddar was addressing the first Ganga-Volga Dialogue of Civilization held at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi.

The script for organizing the Ganga-Volga Dialogue of Civilization between India and Russia was prepared during the summit meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018.

It is a matter of pride for Jharkhand that in the first Ganga-Volga Dialogue of Civilization, Poddar, who was representing Jharkhand in the Upper House of the country, was entrusted with the responsibility of admission.

Poddar underlined the cultural connections between India and Russia, referring to the popularity of Indian films in Russia and the craze for Russian ballet dance in India. He said that Russia also has a strong tradition of Indian studies.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Cultural Center, Moscow (JNCC) at the Indian Embassy in Russia maintains close cooperation with major Russian institutions.

The Philosophy Institute of Moscow has a Mahatma Gandhi Chair on Indian Philosophy. About 20 Russian institutions, including major universities and schools, regularly teach Hindi to about 1500 Russian students.

Apart from Hindi, Indian languages such as Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Urdu, Sanskrit and Pali are taught in Russian institutions. Russians have a great interest in Indian dance, music, yoga and Ayurveda, he said.

Poddar said that the Government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, has tried to strengthen Indo-Russian relations more and more in the last 5 years.

112,24-1-20,Locals yearn for basic amenities,"The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) promises to install CCTVs and free WiFi in Delhi, have failed to cut ice with the residents of Chhatarpur Assembly constituency, which was formed in 2008.

Besides the swanky farmhouses and the posh South Delhi localities that surround the area, people in this constituency crave for better roads, sewerage, water and electricity supply and decongestion. Prior to 2008, it was part of the Mehrauli Assembly constituency. It comprises largely of rural populace and immigrants living in unauthorised colonies.

The Chhatarpur constituency comprises of Saidulajab, Neb Sarai, Maidan Garh, Rajpur Khurd, Fatehpur Beri, Jonapur, Sultan Pur, Ghitorni, Aya Nagar, Dera Village, Bhatti Mines, Mangla Puri, Satbari, Chandan Hulla, Shahurpur and Asola and there are about 1,24,073 eligible voters in this constituency. BJP, AAP and Congress has won this constituency one times each out of the three Delhi elections.

The Pioneer visited the Chhatarpur constituency and found the water logging and pathetic sewerage system plague certain pockets in there and the roads are also maze of uneven tarred stretches. Security for women is another major area of concern, according to residents.

The constituency also lacks infrastructure such as schools and colleges. The fight this time in the constituency is between Satish Lohia of the Congress, Brahm Singh Tanwar from the BJP and Kartar Singh of the AAP.

In 2008, Balram Tanwar was the first elected Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Chhatarpur. In 2013, he was defeated by the BJP's Brahm Singh Tanwar. In 2015 the seat came in basket of Kartar Singh of AAP. This time Congress has fielded Lohia, who will play key role in dividing and grabbing the vote bank of the BJP and AAP candidates.

""Here in Chhatarpur, there is a direct fight between BJP and AAP candidate. Both being local and from Gujjar community, the rural votes are divided as most of the villages in constituency are of Gujjars followed by Jats. The urban areas will play key role in candidate win,"" said Nathu Singh, former pradhan, Maidangarhi village in Chhatarpur area.

""There are developmental works going on and sewerage lines are being developed but the work started two month before the elections dates were announced. There are a lot of works to be done in constituency especially there is need to develop a sewerage system in the area. We hope the next MLA from our constituency will take it up on priority. There are several dark spots in the area and women safety is a big concern,"" said Rahul Singh, a proprietor in Chhatarpur enclave phase-II.

Majority of the Muslims living were cross with the AAP candidate and alleged that he did not even showed his face after winning 2015 election but they said that they will vote for AAP not any other party.

""Though Kartar Singh had not visited in our area but we will vote him as we expect he would bring some changes in constituency. We don't want BJP candidate to win as whenever he wins crime graph in this area increases,"" said a woman, who does not wished to be named and resident of Dhan Mill in the constituency.

""The roads are in bad condition here and there has been no development works in villages. Still there are several places in the area where water is stagnated and this stagnant water is inviting diseases. We believe to vote a candidate who promises to resolve our issues on a strict note,"" said Sangram Singh, a lawyer and resident of Chhatarpur.

""There are always long queues of traffic at traffic signal on 100 feet road in Chhatarpur. For last one decade not a single process has been initiated to ease traffic movement. This not the only place, the entire stretch from Chhatarpur Metro Station to Fatehpur Beri during the day remains choked. Traffic moves in snail pace and during office hours it takes around half hour to cover a kilometer. Who should be held responsible?

However, he was said to have been taken off the hook at the behest of his then boss and SSP despite an FIR being registered in connection with the incident, sources said.

In 1992, Singh had allegedly sold the drugs seizedfrom smugglers and the police department had suspended him and recommended his dismissal from service. However, an Inspector General of the Jammu & Kashmir police had saved him from adverse departmental action, sources said.

They said about six serving senior police officers are under the scanner of the probe agencies for their suspected collusion with Singh.

Meanwhile, the NIA on Thursday produced Singh before a designated court in Jammu that granted his 15-day NIA custody along with four other accused in the case.

“Today, five arrested accused namely Davinder Singh, Syed Naveed Mushtaq Shah, Irfan Shafi Mir, Rafi Ahmad Rather and Syed Irfan Ahmad in case RC-1/2020/NIA/Jammu, were produced before the NIA Special Court, Jammu. The Court has granted 15 days’ custody of the accused to NIA till February 6, 2020,” the NIA said in a statement.

A Congress office bearer said Rahul's address in Jaipur will focus on the youth and students who are facing problems because of lack of jobs and rising unemployment due to the prevailing economic situation in the country. The public rally comes ahead of the Union budget scheduled to be presented on February 1.

Party sources said the former Congress chief also intends to address a rally in Madhya Pradesh, where he will focus on issues confronting the farmers, tribals and rural workers. Further, he is likely to address a meeting of small and medium industrialists, traders and professionals at Mumbai, the party leaders said. Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi is likely to join her brother Rahul in any one of them to address the rally.

Senior party leader P Chidambaram said, ""Anyone who has closely observed the events of the last two years knows that democracy has been eroded and democratic institutions have been debilitated those who are in power are the real 'tukde tukde' gang.""

""The world is alarmed by the direction INDIA is taking. Every patriotic INDIAN should be alarmed too,"" he said on Twitter.

For his part, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said it is natural that every proud Indian will deeply feel hurt and pained on finding that India has slipped 10 ranks from 41 to 51 on the Democracy Index which is computed by a well-known renowned and a very objectively known entity.

The index for India should be rising as it is one of those few countries who have solid democracy, he said, adding that is the first time since 2006 when it has declined to this figure.

""This is a red-flag which should remind us every minute of our existence that Diminishing Democracy is what we have to be eternally vigilant against. This is our proud heritage, it is our proudest possession.

We can't allow it to dilute or diminish even by one millimetre,"" he told reporters. Singhvi said democracy has been vibrant, alive and kicking in a big measure only in India, unlike in several other colonial countries. He said that one parameter was of fear.

""Is there not fear palpable in this country? Whether within the ruling party or outside it, whether it is because of misuse of government's power and agencies or of snooping and surveillance. I don't think

The Shiv Sena and BJP contested the State Assembly polls together in October last year, but parted ways following disagreement over sharing the chief ministerial post for two- and-half years on rotational basis. The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress then came together and formed government in the state after long deliberations, notwithstanding the Sena’s aggressive Hindutva ideology.

Referring to it, Pawar, at an event organised by the NCP’s minority cell, recalled that no step was being taken (at that time) in the state for three-four weeks (by the Shiv Sena-BJP) towards Government formation.

Pawar said suggestions were invited about a possible tie-up with the Shiv Sena from people in Maharashtra as well as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi.

“We were told on behalf of the minorities that if you want to take Shiv Sena along, you can do so, but keep the BJP away.

In fact, the State Government without making necessary amendment in the act had stopped the pension citing the reason that it would only be continued after physical verification.

Meanwhile, through notification in the state gazette the State Government has now ended the pension to the detainees and their family members.

125,24-1-20,Cong suffering from mental bankruptcy: Nadda,"Newly elected BJP national president JP Nadda on Thursday slammed the Congress for opposing the CAA, saying the leadership of the party was suffering from “mental bankruptcy” and dared Rahul Gandhi to “speak even ten lines” on the amended law.

“The Congress has lost all hopes. Its leadership is suffering from ‘manasik diwaliyapan’ (mental bankruptcy). The statements issued by the party in the last eight months reflect that they are intended to help Pakistan,” he said.

Daring Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to “speak even ten lines” on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Nadda said the Congress was provoking Muslims.

“If he (Rahul) speaks even ten lines on CAA, then we will acknowledge him,” he said.

The BJP chief said there was no need to be afraid of the CAA as it was the law of the people and accused the Congress of conspiring to fan riots in the state and the country.

“Congress leaders have supported those who spread violence. The party is upset and their leaders have given statements in the language of Pakistan,” he said.

Seeking to allay “apprehensions created by the Congress” that minority community members will lose their citizenship under the new law, the BJP chief said, “The CAA is to give citizenship and not to snatch it. Those who do not know anything about the law are misguiding the people.”

Nadda was addressing a public meeting here in support of the amended law three days after taking over the reins from Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

The 59-year-old leader from Himachal Pradesh was elected as BJP’s 11th president on Monday after he emerged as the only nominee in the fray.

In an apparent reference to the leaders of the BSP and the SP, he said, “These days Dalit leaders are opposing the CAA. These Dalit leaders and the Congress hardly know anything about the CAA and are only spreading canards to mislead people.”

Nadda said the political innings of the two parties was over and they have understood that times have changed and the country is marching rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in his address said that in a democracy, everyone has the right to speak in a democratic way but those who cause chaos should not be under any kind of illusion as the government has a solution to every problem.

“The Government will recover the losses from those who damaged public property,” he said. He said protesters who destroyed public property on the signal of PFI and SIMI have now realised that their assets will be confiscated.”Now, these people are trying to ruin the atmosphere by using their women and children as a shield,” he said, adding that previous governments used to plead with miscreants.

Stressing that opposition parties have created their vote banks by focussing on conflicts between communities, Adityanath said ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, all such issues have been resolved.

Therefore, the opposition parties “are trying to spread confusion”, he said. “The Opposition is upset with the abrogation of Article 370. They are speaking the language of Pakistan,” he added.

The Chief Minister further said, “The CAA is connected with India’s heritage. It has been the tradition of India to protect the people who come here for shelter. The CAA is a law for granting citizenship not for taking citizenship away. The opposition must understand its reality.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-suffering-from-mental-bankruptcy--nadda.html

The UDP executive met here and debated at length on the issue of CAA and the Inner Line Permit, according to its general secretary Jemino Mawthoh.

He said the UDP opposed the CAA in principle. We are opposing it because we dont see any rationale here. Let us wait for the wisdom of the Supreme Court to make its interpretation in this regard.

When CAA was passed, it was a wakeup call for the States of N-E and for the people of Meghalaya. Although this issue is a common one for the North East and the Centres approach is fragmented, all the states in the region must work together to find a solution against illegal immigration from the neighbouring countries and influx of non-indigenous people, Mawthoh told journalists after the meeting.

He said, We have been battling the issues of influx and illegal immigration for the last four decades now. This is the right time for the North East states to come up with something which is oncrete for the protection and safeguard of the indigenous people.

While 97 per cent of Meghlaya is exempted (scheduled areas) from the purview of the CAA, the MDA had pressed for total exemption of the entire state from the purview of the Act.

The MDA had adopted a resolution last month to urge the Centre to implement the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system after it was announced for Manipur to protect the indigenous people of the state.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/act-wake-up-call-for-n-e-states--udp.html
127,24-1-20,"PM fulfilling ‘anti-Muslim agenda’ of Jana Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha: Gowda","JD(S) patriarch HD Deve Gowda on Thursday called on secular regional parties and Congress to fight against the “divisive policies” of the Central Government like the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens with a Common Minimum Programme.

The former Prime Minister also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of fulfilling the “long standing anti-Muslim agenda” of Jana Sangh and Hindu Mahasabha, and leading the country to the margins of danger.

Gowda said that during these trying times, regional parties and the Congress still believing in secular principles have to fight with a CMP “to avert the disaster that may explode anytime.”

It was a matter left for bigger leaders to decide, but the JD(S), being a small party, should be ready to fight these acts at any level and be ready to go to jail if such a situation arose, he said, addressing a JD(S) convention here.

Alleging that attempts were being made to treat Muslims as second grade citizens of the country, he accused Modi of “fulfilling the nearly 70-year-old anti Muslim agenda” of the Jana Sangh and Hindu Mahasabha, after his party won over 300 seats in the Lok Sabha in the 2019 parliamentary polls.

Pointing to nationwide agitations, he said “this government has led the country to the margins of danger...”

Noting that Congress and JD(S) as “secular parties”, had formed a coalition Government in Karnataka that eventually collapsed, the regional party’s national President said he would not discuss who was right or wrong and reasons for the Government to fall. “But somewhere we have stumbled,” he said. “How the BJP Government was formed in Karnataka, how long will it survive, where did we stumble...Let’s not discuss about it.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-fulfilling----anti-muslim-agenda----of-jana-sangh--hindu-mahasabha--gowda.html

He said there was no need to to get “perturbed” by such warnings. “Their countdown has started and that is why they are ranting,” Chaudhary said.

Ghulam Hassan Mir and Mohammad Dilawar Mir, both former ministers, also demanded the restoration of broadband services to mediapersons and traders besides compensation to those involved in the agriculture and horticulture sectors.

“The country is celebrating the Republic Day (January 26) and the tradition has been the release of some detainees. Even some convicted persons used to get relief in the country on the occasion,” they said.

“People are in preventive detention and it would be good if all of them, including the former chief ministers, are released as a goodwill gesture,” Hassan, who is the president of the Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Party Nationalist, told reporters here.

He said some of the people, who are lodged in jails outside the Union Territory, should be brought back if their detention is imperative on security reasons.

The duo, who was part of a group of former ministers and legislators led by Altaf Bukhari who met the Lt Governor G C Murmu early this month, also batted for the restoration of broadband services to mediapersons and businessmen.

“At a time when the country is celebrating the Republic Day, the people of Jammu and Kashmir should be freed from the curb. We want to live a normal life,” Hassan said.

Referring to their meeting with the Lt Governor on January 7, Hassan said the delegation submitted a memorandum on socio-political and economic interests of people.

“After our meeting, we noticed some positive headway on some of our demands like the release of some political leaders and the youth lodged in outside jails,” he said.

“The restoration of the Internet is the demand from both regions of Kashmir and Jammu and it should be made fully functional,” he said, adding reports of the restoration of the facility in Kashmir is not a reality.

The leaders also asked the Union government to tell the positives that have emerged following the scrapping of the special status of J-K in August last year.

In response to a question on the week-long public outreach programme by the BJP, he said, “We should not feel obsessed with it. If they have come on a visit, it is good and they will themselves see the ground situation. The question will be raised what they have done after their visit.”

On the possibility of assembly elections, he said it is premature to talk about it at the moment because the assembly seats have to be increased in accordance with the reorganisation act.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kashmiri-leaders-seek-release-of-political-detainees-on-r-day.html

His comments on the two issues comes a day ahead of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's maiden visit to India after he assumed power in January last year following a sweeping electoral victory.

Lago said over 15 agreements will be signed during the Brazilian president's visit, including one on the investment protection and facilitation treaty.

""These (Citizenship (Amendment) Act and Kashmir situation) are two internal issues of India that obviously we are following with great interest.

Naturally, in the conversations probably the Indian government will bring elements about this but we see this very clearly as internal questions of India,"" he said.

""India being such a dynamic democracy with such fantastic institutions and civil society, we know that with this a very open society, you will discuss and you (will) go ahead with solutions for these challenges,"" the Brazilian envoy said.

His remarks comes days after envoys of 15 countries, including the US, visited the Kashmir valley where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as military top brass.

Brazilian envoy Lago was also scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir, however, he had backed out because of his preoccupation here.

Brazilian President Bolsonaro will on Friday begin a four-day visit to India, primarily as the chief guest on Republic Day and also to explore ways to boost trade ties at a time both the large economies are hit by slowdowns.

On whether the slowdown of the Indian economy was a matter of concern, the Brazilian envoy said it was not as India will probably grow at above five per cent.

""We are struggling to grow at 2 per cent. We are the country that has been facing more difficult times.

We had two years of recession and two years of very low growth, but we have a very good perspective of growing above 2 per cent this year,"" Lago asserted.

133,24-1-20,Bru voters to be deleted from Mizoram electoral roll,"Names of more than 11,000 Bru community people living in relief camps in Tripura will be deleted from voters’ list of their homeland Mizoram, following an agreement that allows the tribals to permanently settle in Tripura, a senior official said on Thursday.

Thousands of Bru community people have been living in relief camps in Tripura since 1997. They had fled Mizoram to reach the neighbouring state because of ethnic clashes. By now, the total number of these internally displaced people has risen to around 34,000.

The process of deletion of Bru voters from the state voters’ list is likely to be undertaken once the relief camps are closed down, Mizoram Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ahish Kudran told PTI.

“The action regarding deletion of names of the Bru voters will be taken probably during the next roll revision following provisions of the Representation of the People Act and taking approval from the Election Commission,” he said.

There were a total of 12,081 Bru voters in six relief camps in Tripura in the Lok Sabha polls in April last year. Only 33.54 per cent of those voters exercised their franchise at 15 polling booths set up exclusively for them at a village on the Mizoram-Tripura border. Kundra said the exact number of Bru voters could not be determined now as a section of them have returned to Mizoram during the final and ninth round repatriation in October after the last roll revision.

He expressed hope that the Bru voters, who did not return to Mizoram before the quadripartite agreement signed on January 16, would be included in Tripura’s electoral role.

The pact signed by representatives of the Brus, the central, Tripura and Mizoram governments in New Delhi allows these tribal people to permanently settle in Tripura.

The agreement was signed one-and-a-half months after the latest initiative to send the Bru refugees back to Mizoram failed. Of the targeted 4,447 families, Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb last week said only 350 families could be repatriated.

Deb said it will take at least six months to resettle the 34,000 odd members of the community who are living in Tripura for 23 years.

The Brus are staying in six camps at Kanchanpur and Panisagar sub-divisions of North Tripura district. They get free ration and a cash dole from the Centre.

The vexed Bru issue started from September, 1997, following demands of a separate autonomous district council by carving out areas of western Mizoram adjoining Bangladesh and Tripura.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bru-voters-to-be-deleted-from-mizoram-electoral-roll.html

Addressing his party workers at a State MNS convention held at the NESCO grounds at Goregaon in north Mumbai, Raj said: “Like other countries, India should also become very strict in enforcing immigration laws. We may be in inconvenienced a bit, but it is okay. Mind you, our country is sitting on a volcano or live bombs. We have no idea what will happen when. Things like CAA and NRC will happen. But, the Centre’s top priority should be to throw out illegal Muslim immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh. For the purpose, I will extend my full support to the Union Government”.

Raj said that he had received some “explosive information” which he would pass onto Union Home Minister Amit Shah and state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “I do not know about other states. But, there are some places in Maharashtra moulvis from different go there. We do not know what they do there.

I have not changed my religion. If some people try to undermine Marathi, I will go after them. Similarly, if someone tries to undermine Hindu religion, he would not retaliate”.

Raj said that he would support all the honest Muslims in the country. “Muslims like late President Abdul Kalam, former test cricketer Zahir Khan and lyricist Javed Akthar are ours. I am not opposed to Muslims practising their religion quietly. But, why do the Muslims need to use loudspeakers at Masjids while offering Namaz.

151,24-1-20,WEF unveils new internet security principles to help protect up to 1bn users,"The World Economic Forum on Thursday announced new internet security principles, developed by a group of leading ISPs and multilateral organisations, to help protect up to one billion users.

Unveiling the new initiative here at its 50th annual meeting, the WEF said BT, Deutsche Telekom, Du Telecom, Europol, Global Cyber Alliance, Internet Society, Korea Telecom, Proximus, Saudi Telcom, Singtel, Telstra and ITU endorse these new principles combatting high-volume cyberattacks, protecting up to one billion consumers in 180 countries.

While certain cyberattacks focus on specific organisations, the majority target the largest number of internet users possible. Such attacks are often relatively easy for cybercriminals to undertake and can cause serious harm.

The impact of indiscriminate malicious activity online can be significant and carries an estimated global price tag of USD 6 trillion in 2021, the WEF said. The new principles ask ISPs to protect consumers by default from widespread cyberattacks and act collectively with peers to identify and respond to known threats.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/wef-unveils-new-internet-security-principles-to-help--protect-up-to-1bn-users.html

Air India has been in the red for long and the government is now in the process of finalising the contours for its disinvestment.

Responding to a query about proposed disinvestment of Air India, BPCL and other companies, Goyal said in the first term, the Government had inherited an economy which was in pretty terrible shape.

Steps were taken to put the economy back in shape and if the government had looked at divesting these jewels, it would not have got a great value.

He was talking at a session on ‘Strategic Outlook: India’ at the WEF 2020 here.

“If I weren’t a minister today, I would be bidding for Air India. It has some of the best bilaterals the world over... A well managed and efficient Air India with lot more good aircraft put in using these bilaterals is nothing short of a gold mine to my mind,” Goyal said.

153,24-1-20,"If CAA is upheld, it would be end of secularism: Digvijaya","Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said on Thursday that if the Supreme Court held the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as constitutional, it would be the “last nail in the coffin of secularism”. The Muslim community in the country was living in “fear” and looking up to the Supreme Court before which the constitutionality of the law has been challenged, Singh said here.

“Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of our country, which has been spoiled by (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi-ji and (Union home minister) Amit Shah-ji,” he told reporters here.

“Digvijaya Singh is being dubbed as pro-Muslim. I am neither pro-Hindu nor pro-Muslim. I am pro-Indian,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.

“Muslims are (living) in fear....They are disappointed with the system, political parties and police. Their only ray of hope is the judiciary,” Singh said.

“They (Muslims) are waiting for the verdict of Supreme Court on the unconstitutional CAA,” he said.

“If they (the SC) uphold the Modi-Shah government's decision considering this unconstitutional law as constitutional, it will be the last nail in the coffin of secularism,” the veteran Congress leader said.

Singh also said that the anti-CAA movement was now “out of our hands” and being run “entirely by women and children”.

He also questioned the need for bringing in the CAA when the Union government was already empowered to grant citizenship through a certain procedure.

The CAA grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who migrated to India fleeing religious persecution.

“This law has been brought to threaten and frighten the Muslims,” Singh alleged.

The Congress leader also asked why Jammu and Kashmir police officer Devendra Singh, arrested while allegedly accompanying a terrorist, was not booked for “treason”.

“In the eyes of the BJP, he (Devendra Singh) was not anti-national, but Digvijaya was,” he quipped.

“I want to ask Amit Shah why he handed over the probe against Devendra Singh to the National Investigation Agency,” Singh said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/if-caa-is-upheld--it-would-be-end-of-secularism--digvijaya.html
154,24-1-20,Saibaba birthplace row: Pathri residents to approach court,"Residents of Pathri in Parbhani district on Thursday decided to approach court to get legal sanctity to their claim that 19th century saint Saibaba was born in their village.

Members of the Sai Janmabhoomi Pathri Sansthan said they will file a petition in the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court with evidence to prove that Saibaba was born in Pathri.

A controversy has erupted over the purported birthplace of the revered saint, 102 years after he took ‘samadhi’ in Shirdi. Some residents claimed that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had retracted his statement on Pathri being Saibaba’s birthplace under pressure from the Shirdi temple trust.

MLC and president of the action committee, Babajani Durrani, said Pathri residents will move court on the issue.

“Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Jadhav had met Thackeray to seek his appointment for meeting Pathri residents but it was denied and we were told not to take the controversy any further,” Durrani told PTI.

“We have decided to go for legal procedure to resolve this issue and won’t be meeting Thackeray. A team of advocates will visit Pathri and we will file a petition in the court next week,” he said.

“We won’t mind if the Government grant for Pathri doesn’t come but we will never give up our claim that Pathri is the birthplace of Saibaba,” he said.

The Sena on Tuesday said Thackeray should not be blamed for the “uncalled for” controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba as nobody can tell whether the 19th century saint was actually born in Shirdi.

Noting that the Shirdi Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth over ` 2,600 crore out of which social works are done, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ had said Shirdi became rich because of the saint, and none can snatch away the richness of the town where he died.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/saibaba-birthplace-row--pathri-residents-to-approach-court.html
155,24-1-20,Karnataka Govt: Have taken steps to ban outfits involved in anti-social activities,"The Karnataka Government on Thursday said it has taken necessary steps to ban organisations involved in anti-social activities and has sent the required information to the Centre in this regard.

Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwathnarayantold reporters in Mysuru that ‘merciless action’ would be taken against such outfits and they would also be banned.

“To ban them we have sent justification to the central government and have taken necessary steps in this regard and we will continue to take necessary steps.

Their roots have now spread. So systematically we will take legal action against them and thereby enforce control,” he added. Recently state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had said that steps had been initiated for legal action and banning organisations like Popular Front of India (PFI) which are allegedly involved in anti-social and terror-related activities in Karnataka.

The state government has directed police and authorities concerned to gather information on activities of such organisations so that the required inputs could be sent to the Centre seeking the ban, Bommai had said, as he made it clear that outfits involved in such activities and which keep changing their names were under the scanner.

The statements have come in the backdrop of the recent arrests of terror suspects from Karnataka and weeks after the Uttar Pradesh police sought a ban on the PFI.

Targeting the previous Congress government in the state, Ashwathnarayan said it was because of their encouragement that anti-social organizations had grown to such an extent that now consider themselves beyond the law.

“The previous governments that allowed them to grow are responsible. Instead of reining them in, they withdrew cases against them, allowing and supporting them to grow, he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/karnataka-govt----have-taken-steps-to-ban-outfits-involved-in-anti-social-activities.html

Ram Sethu is a chain of limestone shoals between coasts of India and Sri Lanka. According to the epic Ramayana, the Ram Sethu bridge was built by the ‘Vanara army’ to rescue Sita, who was kidnapped by Ravana.

A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde took note of the submissions of Swamy that his interim application be listed for urgent hearing for declaring the Sethu a national heritage monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. “You please mention this after three months. We will entertain this then,” the bench which also comprised justices SA Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna said.

The BJP leader submitted that he has already won the first round of the litigation in which the Centre accepted the existence of Ram Sethu. He further said the union minister concerned had called a meeting in 2017 to consider his demand to declare the Sethu as a national heritage monument but subsequently nothing happened.

The top court referred to pendency of several cases before it and asked Swamy to mention his plea after three months for an urgent hearing.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices S A Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna was told by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the plea of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) be taken up and the directions issued in 2014 in the Shatrughan Chauhan case, which was convict-centric, be modified and be made victim-centric. “You argue this when your (MHA’s) petition comes up for hearing,” the bench told Mehta who was arguing on behalf of Uttar Pradesh government to oppose the review of two death row convicts.

A bench, meanwhile, reserved its verdict on the review pleas of woman and her lover, both natives of Amroha in UP, for killing seven members of her family including parents, two brothers and their wives and strangulating her 10-month-old nephew in 2008.

The MHA plea said: “All the guidelines provided... Are accused-centric.

158,24-1-20,Activist lodges complaint with CBI against illegal toll collection,"Pravin Wategaonkar and Sanjay Shirodkar have lodged a complaint with the CBI, Mumbai, against a private road toll collection company, a special purpose vehicle promoted among others by M/s Reliance Infrastructure and JTEG, China Consortium and Axis Bank had illegally collected Rs 1,780 crore from the user of Pune-Satara Highway during the last six years.

In their complaint lodged with the CBI on Wednesday, Wategaonkar – who is a Thane-based RTI activist -- and Shirodkar – an activist from Pune, alleged that M/s P.S. Toll Road Pvt. Ltd, Special Purpose Vehicle promoted by various companies was – as per the contract — was to complete construction of the six-laning of 140 km Pune-Satara Highway in 30 months from October 1, 2010 to March 31, 2013.

“The construction is still incomplete. NHAI had specifically rejected request for longer construction period of 3.5 years instead of 2.5 yrs in the pre-bid meeting. Completion of six laning in 2.5 yrs was therefore essence of the contract,” the complaint stated.

According to the complainants, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways ( MORTH) had on December 16, 2013 issued amended rules governing levy of toll on National Highways and prohibited collection of user fees/ toll on Highways where Six-laning was delayed beyond the scheduled completion dates.

In case of Pune Satara, six laning was scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2013 and taking into account permissible extension solely due to default on part of NHAI, by another nine months i.e. December 31, 2013.

“ P.S.Toll Road Pvt Limited had no authority in view of amended rules to collect user fees since January 1, 2014 without completing construction of six laning. Extensions granted by NHAI to construction schedule are in violation of bidding terms and amount to favoring concessionaire,” Wategaonkar alleged.

“User fees/ toll collected since Last 6 years is illegal, mala fide and amounts to cheating vehicle users on Pune-Satara Highway by M/s P.S. Toll Road. Toll Revenue of about Rs 1,780 crore has been illegally collected in the last six years,” the two activists alleged.

Another allegation that the complainants have made is in respect of fund diversion of toll collected, in violation of contract, by concessionaire of about Rs 225 crore upto March 2012 until detected by CAG in March- July 2014.

With the aid of escrow bank Axis Bank and investment of the same in Reliance liquid Mutual Funds.

This attracts section 409 of IPC among others, alleged Complainants. “The 100 page complaint is based on bid documents, CAG report and documents obtained under RTI Act over last more than a year,” the two activists said.

The two activists have lodged the complaint with the CBII, Mumbai against M/s P.S. Toll Road Pvt. Ltd for offences u/s 405, 409, 420 read with 34, 120(B) of IPC, Criminal Misconduct of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

He also said around 1,000 development projects have been completed in the UT in the last 18 months and an equal number would be completed soon.

“There have been certain apprehensions around the domicile rights of the people of Jammu & Kashmir (after the abrogation of Article 370 provisions in August last year). Keeping in view the interest of the UT, protection of land and jobs for the locals would be ensured subject to certain exceptions,” Murmu said. Participating in a public outreach programme of the Centre along with Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Parshottam Rupala at Miran Sahib here, the Lt Governor reiterated the government's commitment for implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment to strengthen the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in J&K.

He also informed that the Government is relooking at the reservation policy so that no section of society is left behind.

Speaking here at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Summit 2020, Nadella said it also needs to be ensured that the huge data being used with consent is for the good of the society. During a conversation with WEF Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab, Nadella also favoured a debate on CEO pay and all kinds of remuneration, including return on capital.

Asked what was his recipe for doing good and at the same time doing well as the most valuable company in the world, Nadella said, “It comes down to having that core business design: when you do well, the world around you does well.” “People and institutions are all part of our society, so if you don’t think about the broader systems, it’s not stable,” he added. “The question ultimately goes back to what is the market saying and what is society saying?”

Referring to the book ‘The Narrow Corridor’, he said you have to find what works, so no one loses out. It is in the long-term interest of the shareholders that we do the right thing by the stakeholders, he emphasised. “CEOs in today’s world have more to do to communicate that stakeholder capitalism is for the shareholders’ long-term benefit,” Nadella said.

He said there are four interconnected components needed for the world to collectively achieve more this decade — power broad economic growth through tech intensity; ensure that this economic growth is inclusive; build trust in technology and its use; and commit to a sustainable future.

Asked about a possible bifurcation of economy and tech between China and the US, Nadella said, “Every country cares about their national security, I would urge us to think about what should happen.” “If we should ‘consciously decouple’, all we will do is increase the overall transactional costs of our economy. “The last 30-year period has been an amazing period of market access, but we need to grow up because the world is more complicated,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/data-privacy-must-be-seen-as-a-human-right--says-nadella.html

Sources had said market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to call for a forensic audit of books of Infosys as it continues to probe whistleblower allegations of alleged financial irregularities at the company.

Earlier this month, Infosys had said its audit committee had found no evidence of financial impropriety or executive misconduct, virtually giving a clean chit to CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy who had been accused by anonymous whistleblowers.

""The company has not received any request from Sebi to conduct further audits as reported by media on January 23, 2020,"" Infosys said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

It added that as disclosed previously, the company had received letters from regulatory authorities seeking information on the anonymous whistleblower investigation.

164,24-1-20,Democrats face risks and limits in Trump’s impeachment trial,"The challenge is becoming increasingly clear for House Democrats prosecuting President Donald Trump’s impeachment case as the Senate convenes for a second day of arguments in the landmark trial.

No matter how overwhelming the evidence confronting Trump, it becomes less compelling when presented again and again, day after day, as Democrats try to convince not just fidgety senators but an American public deeply divided over the Republican president in an election year.

The team led by Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of House Intelligence Committee, constructed a gripping account of Trump’s political pressure on Ukraine and attempt to cover up the “corrupt scheme” central to the charges.

But the limits are apparent. Prosecutors must rely on the same loops of videotaped testimony — ambassadors, national security officials and even the president himself — after Trump’s GOP Senate allies blocked new witnesses.

Democrats were once reluctant to take on impeachment during anelection year but are marching toward a decision by the Senate that the American public also will judge.

“We’re trying this case to two juries — the Senate and the American people,” Schiff acknowledged Wednesday ahead of opening arguments.

“The American people are watching. The American people are listening. And they do have an open mind.”

Trump blasted the proceedings in a Thursday morning tweet, declaring them the “Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!”

House Democrats impeached Trump last month, arguing he abused his office by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden while withholding crucial military aid.

They also charged him with obstructing Congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to testify in the House probe.

Republicans have defended Trump’s actions as appropriate and cast the process as a politically motivated effort to weaken the president in the midst of his reelection campaign.

Campaigning in Iowa, Biden stood by the effort to remove Trump from office.

“People ask the question, ‘Isn’t the president going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this?’ Yes, probably. But Congress has no choice,” he said. Senators must cast their votes and “live with that in history.” Each side has 24 hours over three days to present their case. After the House prosecutors finish Friday, the president’s lawyers will follow. They are expected to take only Sunday off and push into next week.

Then there will be 16 hours for senators, who must sit quietly at their desks, no speeches or cellphones, to ask written question, and another four hours for deliberations.

“There’s a lot of things I’d like to rebut,” said Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow at the Capitol, “and we will rebut.”

On the first day of opening arguments, Schiff appealed to senators not to be “cynical” about politics, but to draw on the intent of the nation’s Founding Fathers in providing the remedy of impeachment and removal.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/democrats-face-risks-and-limits-in-trump---s-impeachment-trial.html
165,24-1-20,Impeachment trial not ready for broadcast prime time,"The first night of arguments in favor of President Donald Trump’s impeachment before the US Senate was judged not ready for prime time by many of the nation’s television executives.

ABC, CBS and NBC all stuck with regularly scheduled programs like “Chicago Med,” “Criminal Minds” and “Modern Family” Wednesday evening instead of showing the House managers’ evening session at the impeachment trial. That lasted about two hours, 15 minutes.

CNN and MSNBC carried the trial in full. Fox News Channel, after showing Rep. Adam Schiff speak for about a half hour, interrupted for a story about a child support case involving former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, and never returned.

Even two PBS stations in the New York area showed science programming and “Antiques Roadshow” instead of the trial Wednesday evening. PBS said it gave its local stations the option to show the trial or not.

The calls Wednesday night are significant because if the top networks decided not to pre-empt programming on the first full night the case against Trump was laid out, chances are they won’t reverse course later unless the unexpected happens.

166,24-1-20,Vietnam confirms two cases of SARS-like coronavirus,"Two Chinese nationals in Vietnam have tested positive for the SARS-like coronavirus and are being treated in hospital, officials said on Thursday.

A Chinese man living in Ho Chi Minh City was infected by his father who travelled to Vietnam on January 13 from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.

The father was hospitalised on January 17 with a high fever, days before his son showed symptoms, health officials said.

Both were quarantined and tested positive for coronavirus, a new infection that has already killed 17 people in China and infected more than 570.

“The patients have shown signs of good recovery, (their) fever has reduced and they can eat now,” Doctor Nguyen Ngoc Sang said Thursday at a meeting at Ho Chi Minh City’s Cho Ray hospital.

Vietnam’s deputy health minister urged all precautions to avoid any further spread.

“We should immediately test any suspected cases so that we can detect (the disease) quicker. We don’t want it to spread to the public,” Nguyen Truong Son said at the meeting attended by reporters.

Vietnam shares a long porous border with China and welcomes millions of visitors a year from its northern neighbour.

Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and the United States have all reported confirmed cases of the new virus after it first emerged in China on December 31.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/vietnam-confirms-two-cases-of-sars-like-coronavirus.html
167,24-1-20,US expects UK trade deal ‘this year’: Mnuchin,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said a post-Brexit trade deal between the United States and Britain was a top priority and he expected such an agreement by the end of the year.

The top US economic official made his comments before heading to London to lay out ways the two countries could reach a quick accord after the UK leaves the EU on January 31.

Responding to Mnuchin’s remarks, the spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to offer a timetable.

“Both sides have been clear in public that they want to agree an ambitious free trade agreement as quickly as possible,” the spokesman said.

“Once we have left the EU in just over a week’s time we’ll be free to start having discussions with countries around the world including the US,” he added.

Mnuchin’s UK counterpart, Sajid Javid, will embark on trade talks with both the EU and the US, in the hope of sparing the British economy any short or medium-term shocks of Brexit.

Javid told the US “they wanted to accomplish both these deals in 2020. That’s obviously an aggressive timeline,” Mnuchin said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

A UK-US deal “is an absolute priority for President (Donald) Trump and we expect to complete that with them this year, which we think will be great for them and great for us,” he added.

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross insisted the UK and US would have an easier time striking the deal than the EU, given close existing ties.

“There are far fewer issues between the UK and US than there are between either of us and the EU because our economies are both very similar,” Ross said.

Stressing financial services, Ross underlined “there’s already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-expects-uk-trade-deal----this-year-----mnuchin.html
168,24-1-20,Indian economy poised to take off: Goyal,"Asserting that the Indian economy is well-poised to take off, Union minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said there is a lot of enthusiasm for making investments in the country.

Speaking at a session at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit here, the Commerce and Industry Minister also said the government will hold discussions with Britain and European Union on free trade agreements. Britain is set to leave the European Union by end of January.

“... Things have once again started showing an uptrend... Economy is well poised to take off from here,” Goyal said.

According to him, the enthusiasm to make investments in India is infectious. At least four or five companies have said that more than 50 per cent of their total workforce would operate out of India in the coming years. Some of them are big names, he noted.

On RCEP, Goyal said it was an “unbalanced trade agreement, which was really not fulfilling the guiding principles on which RCEP started about eight years ago, therefore India chose not to participate in it”.

Out of the RCEP countries India already has bilateral trade agreements with ASEAN 10 with Japan and Korea, we are close to concluding negotiations with Australia which we have restarted now and in the next 6 to 8 months we are can close a bilateral trade partnership with Australia, he said.

“RCEP was effectively becoming a free trade agreement between China and India. I don’t think India is ready to engage unless we see open government, better transparency, regulatory practices being followed, and a greater market access for Indian goods and services on a reciprocal basis,” he said.

Speaking at a session on ‘Strategic Outlook: India’ at the WEF 2020 here, Goyal said “trade negotiations are very complex issues. You do not negotiate trade with deadlines and in a hurry”.

Asked about the credit crunch in the Indian economy, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said he believes the credit market will be back to stability and normalcy soon.

“There has been a series of steps... Bank recapitalisation has happened, PSU banks, which control about 60 per cent of the assets in the country are returning to profits...”, he said.

He added the course correction that was required has happened and banks are much more cautious than what we were earlier. He further stressed that “we are ready to lend”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-economy-poised-to-take-off--goyal.html
169,24-1-20,India Inc expecting Budget to lower personal I-T rates,"India Inc is banking on the budget to see a reduction in personal income tax to revive the sagging consumption demand after getting the biggest tax break by way of a steep reduction in corporate tax rates, says a pre-budget survey.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will increase the income tax exemption limit from Rs 2.5 lakh per annum currently, majority of respondents surveyed by tax consultancy firm KPMG opined.

The majority of respondents also feel that the government in the forthcoming Budget to be unveiled on February 1 will increase the standard deduction and give more incentives for housing loans. The Government had slashed corporate tax rates to 25 per cent for old companies and to 15 per cent for new companies provided they are ready to forego all the existing exemptions.

Though the move was hailed by many as a booster dose to revive growth it has belied the expectation as growth has since then fallen to more than six-year low of 4.5 per cent in the September quarter from 5 per cent in the previous quarter. What more the advance estimate last week has pegged the full-year real GDP growth at 5 per cent while the nominal GDP growth at a 48-year low of 7.5 per cent, down from the budget estimate of 13 per cent.

Also, most of the old-generation companies have decided to draw from the existing incentives and not to switch to the new tax regime. However, in the pre-budget survey involving 215 companies by KPMG India this month, more than half of the respondents plan to opt for the lower tax regime of 22 per cent by giving up available incentives from next fiscal.

A majority of respondents also believe that the tax rate for foreign companies should also be reduced in light of tax cuts for domestic companies.

A further stimulus by way of personal tax cuts is also anticipated. “Majority anticipate the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals will be increased. They also expect an increase in the income limit at which the maximum marginal rate of 30 per cent kicks in. If implemented, this can help spur consumer demand by complementing the interest rate cuts delivered since last year,” says the survey.

A majority of the respondents also believe that the finance minister will not introduce an inheritance tax. This is in line with the overall expectation, that there exists a need to provide a fiscal stimulus by reducing taxes on individuals.

About 50 per cent of the respondents expect tax holiday for exports available to SEZ units to be extended to units set up beyond March 2020.

Dispute resolution continues to be an area of concern for most companies with almost half of them believing that the approach of taxmen to tax disputes are not in line with international norms.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-inc-expecting-budget-to-lower-personal-i-t-rates.html

172,24-1-20,"DoT orders no coercive action on defaulting Airtel, Voda-Idea","On a day when the Supreme Court-mandated deadline for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to pay Rs 88,624 crore in past dues ended, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Thursday decided not to take coercive action against defaulters during pendency of their appeals in the apex court for relaxations in the order.

While Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea did not pay the dues, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio paid Rs 195 crore to clear all outstanding against it, official sources said.

Parallelly, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the Rs 3-lakh crore sought by the DoT from non-telecom PSUs, such as GAIL, Oil India Ltd and PowerGrid, was a result of “communication gap” as these firms are not liable to pay any dues following the Supreme Court’s October 24 ruling that non-telecom revenues of telecom firms should be included for considering payments of Government dues.

OIL and GAIL, which were not a party to the litigation that led to the October 24 order, filed clarificatory applications in the Supreme Court.

Following the October 24 order, the DoT had sought Rs 1.47 lakh crore from Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and 13 other telecom companies. Parallelly, it raised a demand of Rs 1.72 lakh crore from gas utility GAIL India Ltd, Rs 48,000 crore from Oil India Ltd, Rs 40,000 crore from PowerGrid, Rs 15,019 crore from Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and a few more demands on firms such as RailTel.

Official sources said the director of the licensing finance policy (LFP) wing has issued a direction that departments concerned should not take any coercive action, until further orders, against the licensees in case they fail to comply with the Supreme Court order.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, whose review petitions against the October 24 order was rejected by the Supreme Court last week, communicated to the DoT that they will not pay the dues by the deadline and will instead away for the outcome of the subsequent modification petition filed seeking relaxation in payments, they said.

The petition is listed for hearing in the Supreme Court next week. Tata Communications, in which the government holds 26.12 per stake, has also made no provision for the DoT’s demand of Rs 6,633 crore. “We are in discussion with the telecom ministry. We had given them our reply (on the demand raised),” Pradhan told reporters here. “Possibly because of a communication gap, the Government of India’s one department has raised such demand on PSUs under another government department.”

He said parallel to discussions with the DoT, the Supreme Court has been approached on the issue.

The government’s demand from such companies increased many times more than their net worth and the Centre asked them to go to the Supreme Court against such dues.

While Oil India Ltd filed a clarificatory/modificatory petition on Wednesday, GAIL approached the apex court on Thursday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/dot-orders-no-coercive-action-on-defaulting-airtel--voda-idea.html

178,24-1-20,Nature’s pill,"If you think the words healthy and tasty are diametrically opposed to each other, Fig@Museo will make you change your mind, says Shambhavi Suri

It’s a warm winter afternoon. The sun is shining bright. The birds chirp in the distance. The plants rustle as the wind blows through them. The ambience, filled with rustic wooden chairs and tables and green plants around me, seems to be the perfect setting for a lunch date with myself. Fig@Museo in Gurugram lets you sink in the warmth of mother nature and reconnect with yourself as easily as a phone connects with the home WiFi. Located in Asia’s largest photography museum, there are some elements of both cosy and chic in the café. While one can enjoy the cosyness and relish the aroma of the bakery indoors, the outdoor seating makes for a fresh atmosphere, perfect for ambling conversations during a winter date.

Jumping to grabbing something to sip on to, I order two smoothies — Kale and avocado, and Wild berry (vegan, no dairy). While the former seems to match with the greenery around me, the latter derives its hue from the red anthuriums. Well, the taste turns out to be quite similar to their colour comparisons too. The kale and avocado smoothie is leafy in its texture but absolutely refreshing and delicious. The wild berries smoothie is sweet and sour, that leaves a perfect tanginess on my tastebuds. Though sweeter than the former, there can’t be any probable comparison between both.

While I am still relishing the fresh smoothies, the Chipotle chicken soft taco makes its way to my table. The tacos, served in a thin ceramic plate that resembles the colour of soil, are filled with the chipotle chicken while the dollops of sour cream and guacamole round it off. One bite into the taco and I realise that its shell is very soft and gets pulled apart very easily. Even though the sweetness as well as the sourness of the tomatoes come through very well, I wish the tacos would have been crispier. While the chipotle sauce makes for some spiciness, towards the end, the sour cream, doing its job perfectly, cools off this roller-coaster of flavours. Another plate of the vegetarian tacos is served. These tacos replicate the taste of the chipotle chicken ones, the only difference being that the meat is replaced with kidney beans here. These are sweet and satisfying.

The next dish arrives and turns out to be probably one of the healthiest breakfast dishes and also a trendsetter. It is the avocado toast or as they call it, Trio tartines. A toasty and crunchy sourdough bread is the base of the dish. It is topped with a thick layer of hass avocado and garnished with goat cheese and sun-dried cherry tomatoes. The combination tastes as heavenly as it sounds. It begins from the crunchiness of the sourdough toast paired with the creaminess of mashed avocado and ends with the sweet and tart taste of the tomatoes. I must say, it is earthy and lip-smackingly delicious. The dish is such that I could savour it for an entire lifetime.

Next up is the Quinoa, roasted potato and poached beetroot salad (gluten-free). The salad, almost replicating all the elements found in a garden, tastes amazing. The topping of pumpkin seeds and a pinch of lemon olive oil make all the difference, giving it a more refreshing taste.

For the main course, I order the Pumpkin massaman curry and the Thai krpao (gluten-free). The former is a vegetarian curry filled with roasted pumpkin and boiled potatoes. It has flavours of peanut and red chilli, which also give it a vibrant orange colour. Served with jasmine rice on the side, this luscious, thick gravy is nutty and a little spicy but makes sure that it leaves you wanting for more.

The Thai krpao is a non-vegetarian curry made with Thai basil chicken in soy and jaggery sauce, which lends it a velvet, dark brown texture. And like any other Thai dish, this curry too is spicy. The jaggery’s sweetness is felt towards the end, relieving the tastebuds of all the spices. Undoubtedly, the two are the tastiest and healthiest meals of the day. And I can’t draw a comparison between them. They’re equally comforting!

However, there is always room for some dessert. To end the healthiest meal on an even healthier note, the Bailey’s Tiramisu (gluten-free) is served. I can’t figure out whether it is the Bailey’s that is adding to its taste (and my excitement) or the dish completely replicates the flavour of the traditional tiramisu. It This is even though the savoiardi (low density, dry, egg-based, sweet sponge biscuit) is gluten-free.

179,24-1-20,Ditch that extra bite,"Here are some ways of sticking to healthy food resolutions

For many of us, January is all about giving things up: Maybe we’re going to stop eating meat and embrace a plant-based diet. Or we’re ready to kick excess sugar to the curb after a holiday season awash in sweets. Or we’re committed to avoiding fast food.

Starting the year with noble goals for eating well is a modern rite of passage. But it’s just as common to ditch those grand plans within a few weeks. This year, how can we do it right? If we’re pledging to make better food choices, which strategies can help us stick with them?

Start small

The consensus among experts is clear: It’s tempting to begin with dramatic gestures, but the key to lasting change is setting goals that are small enough we won’t scrap them by Valentine’s Day.

Manageable, measurable goals can create long-term change, says Leila Azarbad, associate professor of psychology at North Central College in Naperville, Illinois. When people set lofty goals, they can get discouraged after a couple weeks. “Our self-efficacy, that belief in our own ability, tanks. And that’s a huge predictor: If you don’t feel confident in your ability to make the change, you’re going to discontinue trying,” she says.

Picture this, says Dana White, a sports dietitian and clinical associate professor at Quinnipiac University: You want to lose 20 pounds and you know that every afternoon you visit the office vending machine for a snack to boost your energy. So begin packing a healthy afternoon snack — not something punitive, but something healthier that you’ll enjoy — and have that instead of a vending machine candy bar.

It’s a measurable, specific change that won’t be unpleasant. And if it eliminates 200 calories, that shift will make a difference over the coming weeks and months. Once that new behaviour is in place, you can add another small but meaningful change.

The same thinking works if you’re eliminating animal products: Rather than going cold turkey (cold tofu?), begin by replacing one dinner per week with a vegetarian meal. Plan it for a night when you won’t be rushed and can make an appealing recipe, or budget for going out once a week to a vegetarian restaurant.

Then track that change for three weeks, says Anna Baker, assistant professor of psychology at Bucknell University, who researches the connection between behavioral factors such as self-management and health outcomes.

“You hear that it takes 21 days to create habit. There’s debate about whether it’s 21 exactly, but you need a certain amount of time of continuing to do something before it becomes a habit. Once you do kind of get used to that change and you’re doing it regularly, then you can add in another thing,” Baker says.

If you make that one good shift for three weeks, congratulate yourself. Then maintain that behaviour and add another small change, like drinking more water.

It’s tempting to try making a half-dozen changes all at once, White says. But by focusing on individual, small, unhealthy behaviours and “really identifying what the triggers are that lead to those behaviors,” she says, people “can have a tremendous amount of success without torturing themselves.”

Be patient

If your goal is to lose 20 pounds, for example, it really will take four or five months — and it should, says Alex Montoye, assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Alma College in Alma, Michigan.

Losing a pound a week is “really the maximum sustainable weight loss,” Montoye says. Much as it surprises people, “2 pounds a week is pretty extreme.”

So aim to lose 5 pounds over the next six weeks through small behavioral shifts, and measure your behavior along the way. Apps and fitness trackers can help, as can a notebook where you list what you’ve eaten.

Researchers have found “that we are notoriously bad at estimating how many calories we’re taking in,” Azarbad says. “We tend to underestimate what we’re eating, because we forget. When we’re cooking, we taste the pasta sauce a few times and those are calories. Or we walk past our colleague’s desk and they had a jar of M&M’s and we took a few, but those add up. That can be the difference between you losing a pound a week and you not.”

Don’t be too hard on yourself

Accept that mistakes are a normal part of building a new habit. If you know an event is coming up where you’ll want to divert from your eating goals, accept that you may slip a bit then. Aim for “consistency, not perfection,” says Baker. “You have to plan in advance that you’re going to screw up. We’re not perfect.”

Enlist friends

Lastly, “tell everybody you know that you’re doing this because social support is huge,” Azarbad says. “If you’re going out to eat and they know you’re trying to change your diet, they can help choose a restaurant that will accommodate you,” she says.

And the need to save face may keep you on track. “Once you put it out there on social media and you tell everybody that ‘I’m going to do this. I’m going to lose 10 pounds by spring break, you feel that people are watching,” Azarbad says. “We don’t want other people to see us fail.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ditch-that-extra-bite-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/ditch-that-extra-bite.html

181,24-1-20,Yet to decide when to hang up boots: Chhetri,"n Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri on Thursday made it clear that he is yet to decide when to hang up his boots though he did not have many games left for the country.

The 35-year-old Chhetri recently said that he did not have too many games left to play with the national side and that is the reason why he won’t set himself any long-term goals going forward.

“I am on the other side of my career. I have already played 112 games for my country and I am not going to play 250 games. That is what I meant that I do not have many games left. I do not know when I am going to stop but I love this game,” Chhetri, said.

Chhetri, the second highest international goal-scorer among active players after Cristiano Ronadlo said, “I feel really energetic. So I will keep going as much as possible. But the fact is, I am on other side of my career and not going to play 100 games more for my country. So, whatever it is, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, I don’t know how many, but as many as I can, I will give my best,” he said.

He also said that Indian football was going in the right direction but there was a long way to go.

“We have improved a little bit and have to go a long way. I think everyone who is involved with it, corporate houses, players, coaches, government, AIFF, fans, media have to come together and put the best foot forward to take it to a different level. We are going in the right direction, but the goal is far. We have to work really hard,” he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/yet-to-decide-when-to-hang-up-boots--chhetri.html
182,24-1-20,Indian TT teams a win away from Olympics,"n Indian men and women are just one win away from securing their maiden qualification for Olympics, following their contrasting victories against Luxembourg and Sweden respectively in the Team Qualifier here on Wednesday.

India’s men’s highest ranked player G Sathiyan took some time adjusting to the pimpled rubber of Luka Mladenovic but other than that it was a straight forward tie for the fifth seeds who play 11th seeds Slovenia in the all-important round of 16 clash today.

A quarterfinal finish guarantees qualification for the Tokyo Olympics. India has never qualified as a team in Olympic history, limiting its participation to individual events.

Sharath Kamal and Harmeet Desai got India off to a winning start, beating Gilles Michely and Eric Glod 11-9, 16-14, 116 in the opening doubles.

In the subsequent singles, world number 30 Sathiyan lost the first two games against Mladenovic before fighting back to prevail 8-11, 9-11, 11-3, 13-11, 11-6.

Veteran Sharath, ranked 33, conceded a game to Glod but eventually won 11-3, 11-3, 12-14, 11-5 to complete a 3-0 victory.

The seedings suggest that India are a much better side than Slovenia but Sharath said it will be 50-50 contest.

“They have a pretty balanced team,” he said, referring to the presence of 40th ranked Darko Jorgic and 62nd ranked Bojan Tokic in the Slovenian camp.

Slovenia beat Iran 3-1 in their round of 32 match.

Like the men, the Indian women too are a win away from creating history. The 17th seeds pipped 11th seeds Sweden 3-2 after Archana Kamath saved a match point to beat Linda Bergstrom in the fifth and deciding rubber. She won 11-8, 8-11, 9-11, 11-7, 13-11.

However, the foundation of the memorable victory was laid by top-ranked Indian Manika Batra, who won both her singles, beating Bergstrom and Christina Kallberg 3-1 and 3-2 respectively.

The Indians will have to produce something special if they are to down a much stronger Romania in the pre-quarterfinals.

Manika, ranked at 61, is the sole Indian in the top-100 while Romania boast of 19th ranked Bernadette Szocs and 31st ranked Elizabeta Samara.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-tt-teams-a-win-away-from-olympics.html

The January 3 killing has led Iraq’s parliament to call for the ouster of US troops, but there are many lingering questions over whether Iran will be able to capitalize on the sentiment.

An early test will be a “million-man” demonstration against the American presence, called for by influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and scheduled for Friday.

It is not clear whether the protesters will try to recreate a New Year’s Eve attack on the US Embassy compound in Baghdad by Iran-supported militias in the wake of US airstrikes that killed 25 militiamen along the border with Syria.

188,24-1-20,Three US firefighters killed in Australia water bomber crash,"A large water-bombing plane crashed while fighting fires southwest of Sydney on Thursday, killing all three US crew on board, Australian officials said.

New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said authorities lost contact with the Canada-owned C-130 Hercules aircraft, which was operating in the Snowy Monaro region, shortly before 1:30 pm (0230 GMT) Thursday.

Fitzsimmons said all three people killed in the crash were residents of the United States, one of several countries that have sent crews of specialist firefighters to help battle Australia’s devastating bushfires.

“Our hearts are with all those that are suffering what is the loss of three remarkable, well-respected crew that have invested so many decades of their life into firefighting and fire management,” he said.

The incident brought the death toll in Australia’s bushfires to at least 32 since the crisis began in September.

The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but Fitzsimmons had said earlier in the day that high winds were making flying the big tankers “very difficult”.

Canadian firm Coulson Aviation, which owned the plane, grounded operations of its other large air tankers fighting fires in New South Wales and Victoria states “pending review” of the aircraft, Fitzsimmons said.

Initial reports suggested a “large fireball” was caused when the plane “impacted heavily with the ground”, he said.

“We’ve got a number of firefighters and a number of crew that are in the area and working to contain and work around the fire,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/three-us-firefighters-killed-in-australia-water-bomber-crash.html
189,24-1-20,Saving the Lion King,"From shooting during monsoon to following certain rules and regulations of not entering the restricted areas, producer and director Upma Bhatnagar tells Ayushi Sharma that wildlife filming demands a lot of patience, perseverance and attention

Can you recall the newsflash of 1994 when approximately 30 per cent of the lions living in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, died from an outbreak of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV)? The virus, which is normally associated with dogs, wasn’t till then thought of as deadly enough to threaten big cats until epidemic history among other species in sanctuaries suggested otherwise. In 2018, the disease broke out in India killing Asiatic lions in the Gir forest sanctuary in Gujarat. It became an alarming concern for conservationists. Filmmaker and executive producer of Optimum Television, Upma Bhatnagar will take viewers to the forefront of India’s battle with the deadly virus through her 10-part series, The Lion Kingdom. The epidemic threatened to wipe out the last of the surviving Asiatic lions in the world living in the wilds of the Gir National Park.

The Lion Kingdom is a story of how the forest department of Gir National Park worked round the clock to try and save the king of the jungle while battling heavy rains and flooding and dealing with a sudden increase in the number of crocodiles in the area. Not only will the audience get to witness the functioning of the veterinarian hospital in Gir but they will also get to marvel at the transformation of Gir during the monsoon as this is the first time ever the national park has been filmed during the rains. Upma discusses the highlights of her latest series.

What drove you to the world of wildlife? How did you conceptualise the series?

It was the most serious alarm not only in Gir but in India’s entire conservation history since independence. At stake was the existence of an entire species of Asiatic lions that does not exist anywhere else in the world. When I heard scientists and conservationists expressing fears that the Indian lion may not be able to come out of this crisis, I was really worried. Gir is very special to me. This is where I had filmed my first TV series, The Lion Queens of India. I enjoy a special bond with the land, its people and its majestic animals.

We spoke with Discovery India who sensed the gravity of the situation and gave us their full creative and logistic support. Early in 2019, we started our research. We wanted to film during the monsoon and usually the forest department does not permit shoots at that time as it is almost impossible to conduct safaris. Gir is closed from June to October. But we managed to get through despite the outbreak of the disease. The series features renowned veterinary surgeon Steve Leonard as the host. He has worked with other species and he knows how the lions were treated in Tanzania.

How did the virus come to India?

A major way diseases mutate is by jumping between species. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and the H1N1 Swine Flu... all jumped from animal to animal before crossing into humans. Similarly, there is a chain of other species in between. Domestic dogs living in areas surrounding the national park were responsible for the continued presence of the disease. It is transmitted through the air and infected body secretions. The symptoms generally include a high fever, inflammation of the eyes and nose and coughing. Now that they know that something like this can happen, they are taking measures to vaccinate the cattle around the area. Healthy lions from the Gir forests were also shifted to an alternative location. Shots of CDV vaccine were also imported from the US. They regularly monitored the moves of lions.

Does filming in proximity with the animals in the jungle disturb them? What were the rules and regulations that you had to follow?

I have been filming wildlife for a decade now and yes, we are not supposed to disturb the animals. There are certain rules that as a filmmaker I must follow. The first one is that you are not supposed to go very near to their respective habitats. We never go beyond the restricted area. As a result, it gets difficult to capture the animals but thanks to technological advancements, we have various types of camera lenses — wide angle, zoom, telephoto and many such. It gets easier to get all the close up shots without disturbing them. For instance, if they are roaming around in groups or the cubs are headed to play, we use long lenses to capture their everyday activities. We are told to not make too much of noise, otherwise it would scare them.

What were the on-ground challenges and how difficult was it to manage the crew members?

The biggest challenge was that we were shooting during the monsoon. The rain poured thrice a day and the cameras’ visibility was heavily affected. It’s not always necessary that animals (lions) would come out of their dens during heavy rainfall. Our filming equipment were very expensive so we didn’t want it to get wet or damaged because of rain. We could get wet but not the equipment, of course (laughs).

I am lucky that I have a young crew of camera persons. The toughest thing about wildlife filming is that you have to get up at very odd hours because the best time to shoot is either early morning or evening, before the sun goes down. During the day, it gets difficult because the animals are usually resting. No movement can be seen. Wildlife filming is very demanding in that sense. It takes a lot from your soul. There have been so many days when we were just waiting for the rains to stop so that we could start shooting. As a producer, you start worrying about your crew, the project that you started but then suddenly one day, you get the perfect shots. There are never any fixed schedules, so it requires a lot of patience, attention and hard work. I am really thankful for the support and cooperation from my team.

What are the ground realities in national parks that lead to the extinction of various species? What can a common man do to help in conservation?

The biggest challenge in India is the shrinking habitat for our wildlife because India is growing at such a fast pace. You want your conservation efforts to become a success story and you are also happy to see the increasing number of particular species but then the question is — where is the space? Our country has history, mythology, culture, and everything has taught us to be tolerant of other living beings. We would not deliberately want to harm the wildlife but when conflict happens, it’s basically learning to co-exist with it, which our ancestors have done fantastically so far. We need to make corridors for animals so that they can have safe passages.

As a filmmaker, I can raise awareness among the common public and tell them what are the challenges that they face. We need to start inculcating certain values in the young generation and let them know about the wonderful forest diversity that India has.

Can you share some of your anecdotes?

We were shooting with a specific tribe, so we got to know them well. Over a period of time, we were following a lioness who had just given birth to cubs. And there were other male lions who wanted to take over the area. The lioness tried very hard to hide her cubs and keep the place safe but eventually the cubs were killed. That was a heart breaking moment for all of us. We couldn’t do anything about it as we could not interfere with the ways of the habitat. Such incidents always stay with you.

190,24-1-20,Seven for CR7 against Roma,"Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri complimented Cristiano Ronaldo’s mother as the Portuguese star extended his scoring streak in a 3-1 win over Roma to advance to the Italian Cup semi-finals on Wednesday.

The Portuguese star picked up a Gonzalo Higuain cross after 26 minutes, finishing off from an angle in the Allianz Stadium.

It was the 34-year-old’s 12th goal in eight consecutive games in which he has played in all competitions for the Turin giants but his first in the Italian Cup.

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has also scored seven goals in four matches played in 2020. “I believe that the compliments should be made to his mother,” said Sarri of Ronaldo who has now scored in 15 different club competitions throughout his career.

“He is in super form physically. In terms of explosiveness he is doing well, he takes great care of the details.

“It is difficult to improve on an individual level. We are talking about one of the greatest of all time and I would like to help him win a sixth Ballon d’Or.

Rodrigo Bentancur added a second goal after 38 minutes with defender Leonardo Bonucci nodding in a third just before the break.

Cengiz Under pulled a goal back for Roma five minutes after the break, rifling in from a distance with the ball hitting the crossbar and bouncing in off goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon in the Juventus goal.

Buffon denied Alessandro Florenzi and Aleksandar Kolorav to keep Juventus on course in the competition they have won 13 times.

193,24-1-20,Handling pressure will be key in T20 WC: Harmanpreet,"The Indian women’s cricket captain Harmanpreet Kaur in her pre-departure press conference for T20 World Cup on Thursday said handling pressure would be crucial in the upcoming ICC Women’s tournament in Australia, something that her side couldn’t do in the last two global showpieces.

India made a semi-final exit from the last T20 World Cup and in the previous ODI World Cup, they had finished as runners-up.

“We were quite close in the last two World Cups, the only thing is we have to keep in mind how to handle pressure in the tournaments, last two World Cups we lacked in handling pressure,” Harmanpreet said.

“This time we want to enjoy rather than taking more pressure on ourselves, thinking that it is a big tournament. We have to avoid thinking like that and focus on giving our best,” she added.

The 30-year-old batswoman, who has played 104 T20s, said the team needs focus on enhancing skills instead of thinking about the pressure of being at a big stage.

“Last few World Cups, we put ourselves under too much pressure of playing in a big tournament. This time rather thinking that we are going for a big tournament, we just want to focus on our skills, how we should play and how to make the team win,” she said.

“That will be very important for us and when we focus on these things, we (will) produce better results,” she added.

She counted spin bowling as one of the strengths of her team.

“...They always give us breakthroughs. So I am looking forward to how our spinners perform there (in Australia) and see what they do for the team,” said the skipper.

India will, in all likelihood, open with the experienced Smriti Mandhana and young Shafali Verma and according to Harmanpreet, the duo will have a crucial role to play.

“They both (Smriti and Shafali) are very important for the team and they always give their best...The first six overs are going to be important for us.

“Good start is important for the team and whenever they get a good start, we never look back. They both have very big role to play,” she said.

Asked what will be her message for new players like Shafali and the 16-year-old Richa Ghosh, Harmanpreet said they would be encouraged to play their natural game.

“...Don’t take any pressure because if we play freely without any pressure, you will give your 100 per cent,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/handling-pressure-will-be-key-in-t20-wc--harmanpreet.html
194,24-1-20,Root facing ‘good selection headache’,"England captain Joe Root on Thursday was looking forward to the prospect of two of the world’s fastest bowlers operating on a pace-friendly pitch in the fourth and final Test against South Africa, starting at the Wanderers today.

Root said Jofra Archer had bowled with “good pace” in practice on Wednesday after recovering from an elbow injury which kept him out of the second and third Tests — both of which England won.

He said that if Archer had no lingering signs of injury or soreness, England would have a “really good selection headache”.

Mark Wood startled several of the South African batsmen in the third Test in Port Elizabeth, bowling bouncers at around 150kmh.

Archer is also among the world’s small club of 150kmh bowlers.

“It would be nice to see how they go together,” said Root. “I think they would be a relentless barrage of pace which is exciting, especially on a surface such as you typically get here at the Wanderers.”

He also said that it would be “a very big achievement” if England could complete a series win.

Meanwhile, South African skipper Faf du Plessis said his side needed to dig deep to salvage a series draw.

“How strong are we mentally in this last hurdle? We know where we have been a little bit poor in our game plans,” he said.

Du Plessis said Temba Bavuma would replace Zubayr Hamza in the XI, but there would also be a change in the batting order, with Rassie van der Dussen moving up to number three, the position filled by Hamza in the first three Tests.

He is also hoping that Vernon Philander, who will retire from international cricket after the match, would finish his Test career “with the storybook ending he deserves” on a pitch where he has done well in the past.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/root-facing----good-selection-headache---.html
195,24-1-20,Pak need Malik & Hafeez’s experience,"Pakistan’s T20 skipper Babar Azam has defended the decision to recall veterans Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez, saying the experienced duo’s presence will help the team in its pursuit of retaining the number one spot in the shortest format.

Desperate to hold on to its numero uno status in T20 rankings, Pakistan has recalled Malik and Hafeez in the team for the three-match series against Bangladesh.

“I felt that we needed these two (Malik, Hafeez) seniors. They were part of the number one team last year,” he said.

“I gave my opinion to the selectors and they heard me. Their presence will help me and the team. I will learn from them on captaincy as well,” Babar added.

The 25-year-old batsman also said Pakistan is under no pressure in the series against Bangladesh, especially after the thrashing in last T20 series against Sri Lanka at home.

“No there is no pressure for us because what is done is done but we will not try to repeat the same mistakes we did against the Lankans,” Babar said.

He made it clear that they were not taking Bangladesh lightly.

“Bangladesh have a good combination of youngsters and seniors and it will be a good competitive series. Their players have the advantage of having come here fresh out of the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League),” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pak-need-malik---hafeez---s-experience.html
196,24-1-20,Lakmal sets up Sri Lanka win,"Suranga Lakmal took four for 27 to set up Sri Lanka for a 10-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first Test on Thursday.

Resuming on 30 without loss and needing 157 to make Sri Lanka bat again, Zimbabwe recovered from the loss of three early wickets to Lakmal to reach lunch at 120 for three.

The tall pace bowler struck again immediately after, removing Brendan Taylor for 38, and Zimbabwe slumped to 170 all out, losing their last seven wickets for 50.

Sri Lanka needed just 14 to win and the openers Oshada Fernando and Dimuth Karunaratne knocked off the runs in three overs.

All the three former India internationals have confirmed that they are offering their candidature for a place in the selection committee. The last date for applying is today, January 24.

The other two confirmed applicants are former junior selector Pritam Gandhe and current junior selection committee member Gyanendra Pandey but both have completed their four-year tenure in one committee and are unlikely to be considered as per Lodha norms.

It is understood that among applicants, the “senior most Test cap” will become the chairman and if Sivaramkrishnan gets the nod, he will be the senior-most having made his Test debut in 1983 (vs West Indies in Antigua) as a 17-year-old.

The BCCI will be replacing MSK Prasad (South Zone) and Gagan Khoda (Central Zone) from the current committee.

Former junior chairman of selectors Venkatesh Prasad and former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar could also throw their hat in the ring, which will make it an interesting three-way battle for the chairman’s position.

198,24-1-20,Neymar sets final showdown,"Neymar set up the first two goals with curling set pieces as Paris Saint-Germain won their French League Cup semi-final 3-0 away to Reims on a chilly Wednesday night.

PSG will face Lyon, who beat Lille on penalties on Tuesday, in the final at the Stade de France on April 4.

This was PSG’s second cup match in three days and coach Thomas Tuchel continued to shuffle his squad.

Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who were unused substitutes as PSG won in the French Cup at Lorient on Sunday, started while Mauro Icardi and Angel di Maria who began that game, shivered on the bench on a below-freezing evening in Champagne country. Neymar set up the first goal for his fellow Brazilian Marquinhos, another star brought back after a coach-enforced rest, after nine minutes.

Marquinhos, playing in central defence and as captain, raced in to meet an outswinging Neymar corner.

He outleaped the static Reims defenders and his powerful downward header had rebounded into the roof of the net before goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic could get close to it. After 31 minutes, Neymar again aimed for Marquinhos with an in swinging free kick.

When the centre-back missed the ball it caught the man marking him, Alaixys Romao, by surprise and he nodded it toward goal where fullback Ghislain Konan sliced the ball into his own net.

Neymar, who produced a combative display, and Mbappe, booked for a late handball, played the full 90 minutes even though the game was settled by the 77th minute.

After 73 minutes, Reims midfielder Marshall Munetsi received a straight red card for scything down Marco Verratti.

Four minutes later, substitute Nianzou Kouassi forced a rebound over the line to put PSG, eliminated in the quarter-finals last year, three up and sure of a place in the final.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/neymar-sets-final-showdown.html
199,24-1-20,Third division scare,"n La Liga’s heavyweights were both given a scare by third tier opponents in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday as Barcelona needed two late goals to beat Ibiza and Real Madrid dug deep for victory over Unionistas de Salamanca.

Barca sit 44 places ahead of Ibiza and Madrid 56 above Unionistas but the lowly duo both came close to extraordinary upsets, only for Ibiza to lose 2-1 and Unionistas 3-1 in front of their jubilant home fans.

With Lionel Messi rested and not even on the bench, Antoine Griezmann proved the saviour for Barcelona, scoring twice in the second half, including a 94th-minute winner, after Pep Caballe had given the hosts a fairytale lead at Can Misses.

“Scoring gave them confidence,” said Barca coach Quique Setien. “We were a bit sloppy, we gave the ball away and that gave them life. It wasn’t easy.”

Discomfort was more fleeting for Madrid, who conceded an equaliser in the second half following a brilliant run and finish from Unionistas’ Alvaro Romero, only to restore their advantage five minutes later.

Juan Gongora turned the ball into his own net after Gareth Bale, back from injury and illness, scored his first goal for his club since September 1.

Bale’s celebrations were notably muted and he had to go off in the second half.

“He sprained his ankle a little,” said coach Zinedine Zidane. “I don’t think it’s much but tomorrow we’ll see.”

At the end, Unionistas fans were waving their scarves with pride just as Ibiza’s supporters had applauded their team off, even though Griezmann had dashed their hopes just moments before.

200,24-1-20,‘Embarrassed' Utd suffer fresh woe,"Manchester United were labelled an “embarrassment” as pressure mounted on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following Burnley’s shock 2-0 victory, while Tottenham boosted their top four prospects with a 2-1 win over Norwich on Wednesday.

Solskjaer’s side suffered a third defeat in their last four Premier League games to put the United boss’s job security back under the microscope.

Burnley’s first top-flight win at Old Trafford since 1962, secured by Chris Wood’s 39th minute opener and a Jay Rodriguez thunderbolt after the break, exposed the flaws in a lacklustre United side who have made their worst start to a season since 1989-90.

The majority of Old Trafford was on its feet when chants of “stand up if you hate Glazers” echoed around the ground in reference to United’s owners.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was also subjected to many other abusive chants, while those few fans who remained in the stadium booed Solskjaer and his players at full-time.

Former United defender Rio Ferdinand, a Premier League and Champions League winner with the club, slammed the performance and called for the US-based Glazer family to take action to stop the rot.

“I can’t defend this,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “These young kids now in schools around the country, they are not going to be wearing Manchester United shirts.

“Fans are walking out after 84 minutes! It’s an embarrassment. People at the top need to look and see this and make changes, put a plan in place that people can sit there and see where we are going now. I don’t see it.”

Fifth placed United are six points behind fourth placed Chelsea as they battle to qualify for next season’s Champions League via a top four finish.

Solskjaer admitted United had only themselves to blame, but he claimed the youngsters in his side deserved some patience.

“The boys have given everything they’ve got. They are experiencing this period for the first time in their lives, some of them,” he said.

“Of course I’m going to back them. I’m going to be here to help them get through this. When you’re at Man United there’s always going to be criticism.

“We can’t do anything but hold our hands up and say ‘this isn’t good enough for this club’. Of course we’re disappointed in the points tally and performances, we’re still fifth in the table.”

Tottenham needed a late winner from Son Heung-min to snap a four-game winless streak in the league and breathe new life into their push for a top-four spot.

Alli ends drought

Dele Alli’s opener had ended a three-game run without even scoring in the league for sixth placed Spurs before Teemu Pukki’s penalty 20 minutes from time for bottom-of-the-table Norwich.

South Korea forward Son’s stooping header 11 minutes from time hauled Jose Mourinho’s men within six points of Chelsea.

Elsewhere, Ayoze Perez scored twice as third placed Leicester ended their two-match winless league run with a 4-1 victory over West Ham that was marred by an injury to their leading scorer Jamie Vardy.

Vardy limped off just before half-time at the King Power Stadium with his side 1-0 ahead thanks to Harvey Barnes’ 24th-minute opener, with the winger then setting up Ricardo Pereira to fire home the second in added time.

Five minutes after the interval, Wilfred Ndidi was adjudged to have bundled Sebastien Haller over in the area and Mark Noble scored from the penalty spot.

However, Leicester earned a debatable penalty of their own when Kelechi Iheanacho was deemed to have been brought down by Angelo Ogbonna and Perez made no mistake from 12 yards.

The former Newcastle player then swept home his side’s fourth goal to lift them back within three points of second-placed Manchester City.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---embarrassed--utd-suffer-fresh-woe.html
201,24-1-20,Sania exits with calf injury,"Sania Mirza’s first Grand Slam outing after maternity leave ended with an early exit as the Indian ace retired mid-way into her women’s doubles first-round match due to a calf injury.

Sania and her Ukrainian partner Nadiia Kichenok, who came into the major after winning the doubles title at the Hobart International, were trailing 2-6, 0-1 against the Chinese team of Xinyun Han and Lin Zhu when the Indian called it quits.

Sania has injured her leg during practice. Her right calf strapped heavily, Sania struggled to move freely on the court. It also affected her serve.

Kichenok was also struggling at the net, often missing easy put-away volleys.

Serving at 2-4, Sania was broken by the Chinese and they served out the set easily.

The Indian took a medial timeout after the first set. Soon after, the Indo-Ukrainian pair was broken in the first game of the second set and Sania found it difficult to continue.

Sania had also pulled out of the mixed doubles event, forcing compatriot Rohan Bopanna to pair with Kichenok.

Also representing India in the mixed doubles is veteran Leander Paes, who has teamed up with Jelena Ostapenko, who had won 2017 French Open.

202,24-1-20,Rafa triumphs,"Rafael Nadal and Nick Kyrgios reached the Australian Open third round on Thursday after the weather-disrupted tournament faced a new challenge: dirty rain which left courts muddy and unplayable.

After a day of clean-up operations and delays, Australia’s Kyrgios fought his way past Frenchman Gilles Simon in four sets and Wimbledon champion Simona Halep stamped her class with a win over Britain’s Harriet Dart.

Nadal, a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 winner over Argentina’s Federico Delbonis, miscued a shot that hit a ballgirl in the head, but he melted hearts when he apologised and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

“I was so scared for her, honestly,” the 19-time Grand Slam winner said. “The ball was quick and straight on the head. She’s a very brave girl.”

Kyrgios, increasingly popular with home fans after his fundraising efforts for Australia’s bushfire crisis, was cruising at two sets up when he dropped the third set and with it, his composure.

But just when it looked like he would suffer one of his trademark implosions, he rallied for a 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 victory.

“I definitely lost my way a little bit... but I decided to refocus,” Kyrgios said of his mini-meltdown in the third set. “I could have gone to a very dark place in the fourth set but I put it away.”

Kyrgios and Nadal stay on course for a fourth-round clash and the next instalment in their grudge match after the Aussie hit back at criticism from the “super salty” Spaniard last year.

Their victories followed a day of upheaval caused by the dirty rain, the latest weather problem at a tournament which has contended with bushfire smoke, heavy downpours and strong wind.

Rain mixed with a dust storm coated the Melbourne Park facilities in a fine layer of mud which took hours to clean and made many outside courts temporarily unusable.

'I was freaking out'

As action resumed Alexander Zverev, another man who has a running feud with Kyrgios, showed signs of a return to form as he downed Egor Gerasimov 7-6 (7/5), 6-4, 7-5.

The German seventh seed has been practising up to seven hours a day after a winless ATP Cup and the hard work paid off as he safely reached the third round.

“Definitely much better than the ATP Cup. Now in the third round, I’m very happy about that,” said the 22-year-old, who beat Italy’s Marco Cecchinato in round one.

However, fifth seed Dominic Thiem had a scare as he was taken to five sets by Australia’s 140th-ranked Alex Bolt before recovering his composure to win 6-2, 5-7, 6-7 (5/7), 6-1, 6-2.

“It was all of a sudden a really tight third set that shouldn’t happen. That’s why I was freaking out inside and also outside today,” said the two-time French Open finalist.

A nosebleed was one of Daniil Medvedev’s biggest challenges in his win over Spanish qualifier Pedro Martinez, while Gael Monfils, who injured his racquet hand playing computer games before the tournament, downed Ivo Karlovic.

In the women’s draw Halep beat Dart 6-2, 6-4, while Belinda Bencic knocked out former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko — she was playing despite the sudden death of her father this month.

Two-time Major winner Garbine Muguruza, who scaled Mount Kilimanjaro in the off-season as she searches for a return to form, dispatched home hope Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rafa-triumphs.html
203,24-1-20,No revenge in mind against ‘nice guys’,"The loss still rankles him but Virat Kohli on Thursday said he can’t really bring himself to think of revenge when India take on New Zealand for the first time after the Kiwis sent his side packing from the ODI World Cup last year.

The Black Caps defeated pre-tournament favourites India by 18 runs in the semifinals of the showpiece in England and today’s tour-opening T20I is the first clash between the two sides since then. Kohli has spoken repeatedly about how devastating the loss was for him personally.

“Even if you want to think of revenge, these guys are so nice you cannot get into that zone,” said Kohli at the pre-match press conference.

“We get along really well with these guys and it’s all about being competitive on the field. As I said in England, they are probably one side that has set the example for teams to play international cricket,” he reasoned.

Williamson and his men had drawn effusive praise for their grace in the aftermath of a heartbreaking World Cup final loss to England, a game that was decided on boundary count after scores were tied.

“It is not about any kind of revenge — it is two quality sides playing good cricket. It is a challenge to beat New Zealand here and we are totally up for it,” Kohli said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-revenge-in-mind-against----nice-guys---.html
204,24-1-20,India U-19 side look for hat-trick,"Already through to the quarterfinals after two resounding wins on the trot, defending champions India will be keen to maintain their unbeaten run when they face New Zealand in the final Group A tie of the ICC U-19 World Cup here today.

India, who are atop their group with four points, had cruised to a 90-run victory over Sri Lanka in their opening encounter before outclassing debutants Japan by 10 wickets withe disciplined bowling effort. The Priyam Garg-led side will start as favourites against New Zealand.

New Zealand, on the other hand, were unlucky to share a point with Japan after their match was washed out in Potchefstroom last week. However, they managed to clinch a late winner against Sri Lanka and book a place in the last eight.

New Zealand, who had finished eighth on home soil in 2018, will be looking to follow a similar trajectory as their senior counterparts, who reached the finals of the men’s World Cup last year, in this edition of the U-19 showpiece.

Having won the warm up matches against Zimbabwe and Afghanistan and the quadrangular series, the Indian team would not want to lose the rhythm at any cost.

In their previous outing, India leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (4/5) took four wickets while pacers Kartik Tyagi (3/10) and Akash Singh (2/11) shared five scalps among themselves to help the four-time champions bundle out Japan for 41.

Also on the batting front, Jaiswal (59), Garg (56) and wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel (52 not out) impressed with half centuries against Sri Lanka while Tilak Varma (46) and Siddhesh Veer (44 not out) also provided useful contributions.

However, the Indian team is yet to be tested against a strong opposition.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-u-19-side-look-for-hat-trick.html
205,24-1-20,Black & Blue,"Upbeat India take on injury-struck Kiwis as build-up to T20 World Cup continues

Preparations for the World Cup on top of their agenda, India will take on an injury-hit New Zealand in a rare five-match T20 International series starting today during which seam-friendly wickets would be a major challenge for the visitors.

Unlike most overseas tours, this will be a quick start for the Indian team. The team arrived in Auckland on Tuesday and Thursday was when they hit the nets ahead of the tour-opening game.

On the plus side, this hectic schedule helps the team management maintain consistency in team selection as they continue experimenting across the available squad in a World Cup year.

Despite injury issues to key white-ball personnel like Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Deepak Chahar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar this past home season, the bench strength has come across adequate and raring to go for challenges ahead.

It begins at the top where KL Rahul has stepped up as a key part of India’s white-ball plans.

Skipper Virat Kohli dropped hints that Rahul’s newfound confidence in his dual role as batsman-keeper has given vital options to the team.

According to Kohli, Rahul will continue to keep wickets in both ODIs and T20Is, but will open in the shortest format while returning to the middle-order in the 50-over format.

It could mean that Prithvi Shaw is being primed for an ODI debut and a potential pairing with Rohit when the three-match series begins on February 5.

The skipper also indicated a change in middle order plans. With Rahul keeping wickets, the fit-again Rishabh Pant could lose his spot in the playing eleven.

Manish Pandey is expected to play as the fifth specialist batsman and Shreyas Iyer will regain his spot at number four.

Pandey, Iyer and Pant batted together in the nets on Thursday, while Sanju Samson hung around, only to pad up later on. The Kerala batsman didn’t seem to be in contention for the first T20I.

Pant and Pandey could both fit into the playing eleven should India opt for five bowlers and leave out the sixth option in Shivam Dube. Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja are the other two all-round options.

The Yuzvendra Chahal-Kuldeep Yadav combination is yet to play a game together since the 2019 ODI World Cup, and it remains to be seen if things will change in this aspect.

In the pace department, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah are assured starters, while the toss-up will be between Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini.

New Zealand had beaten India 2-1 in the T20I series last year. The Black Caps also won 2-1 in the T20I series during their Sri Lankan tour, and then drew 2-2 at home against England in a five-match series.

Despite the recent good record in the shortest format, there is a downbeat mood in the hosts’ dressing room thanks to the 3-0 shellacking received in Australia over the past month.

It hasn’t helped matters that the disappointing loss to their trans-Tasman rivals has raised questions about Kane Williamson’s future as captain.

For the moment, New Zealand’s leading batsman is happy to lead the side across all formats, but his position is up for review after the shattering defeat to Australia.

As always, they have a dearth of all-rounders to choose from but need to balance with pickings in the pace department, which is missing the services of Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson owing to injuries.

It remains to be seen if the Black Caps opt for two spinners in Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner given the really short boundaries at Eden Park, venue for the first two T20Is.

206,24-1-20,Pulwama encounter: Slain terrorist identified as 'most wanted' JeM member from Pakistan,"The terrorist, who was killed in a gunfight with security forces in Pulwama district on Wednesday, was identified as a Pakistani national affiliated with proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit, a senior police officer said on Friday, adding the ultra operated in militancy-infested south Kashmir under code names ""Abu Saifullah"" and ""Abu Qasim"".

The officer said the slain terrorist was wanted in connection with the abduction and killing of two civilians and threatening special police officers (SPOs) and non-local labourers to leave the Valley.

A close associate of JeM self-styled chief commander Qari Yasir of Pakistan, who was killed in an encounter with security forces in Kupwara district in July 2013, Abu Saifullah was trapped along with his local associate during a search and cordon operation at Zaintrag village in the Awantipora area of Pulwama on Tuesday morning, he said.

The operation, which was launched on a specific information, turned into a gunfight when the hiding terrorists opened fire on the joint search parties of police, 50 Rashtriya Rifles and 185 Battalion of the CRPF, the officer said.

The heavy firing by the terrorists resulted in grievous bullet injuries to Sepoy Rahul Ranswal of the Rashtriya Rifles and SPO Shahbaz Ahmad of local police, who were evacuated to the Army's 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar but both succumbed to injuries there, he said.

During the process of evacuation of the injured jawans, the terrorists fled the cordon area, the officer said, adding they were tracked down in the forest area of Nagander village, which is about one Kilometer away from the encounter site of Zantrag, next day resulting in a fresh encounter. The ""most wanted"" terrorist, Abu Saifullah, was killed there.

However, his other associate managed to escape and a hunt is on to neutralise him, the officer said.

""Abu Saifullah has been active in Tral and the Khrew area of Awantipora for more than one-and-a-half years and was a close associate of slain JeM chief Qari Yasir. He was involved in the abduction and killing of two civilians – Abdul Qadeer Kohli and Manzoor Ahmad Kohli – and injuring a shopkeeper, Naseer Ahmad Ganie, last year,"" he said.

Saifullah was also wanted in a case related to pasting of posters wherein the SPOs were threatened to leave their jobs and non-local labourers were asked to leave the valley, the officer said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pulwama-encounter--slain-terrorist-identified-as--most-wanted--jem-member-from-pakistan-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pulwama-encounter--slain-terrorist-identified-as--most-wanted--jem-member-from-pakistan.html

Maharashtra minister and NCP's chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said party leaders cannot be scared off with such a move.

The party's fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah will continue, he asserted.

Malik said Pawar, a Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister, had 'Y' category security cover in the national capital.

The security personnel deployed at Pawar's residence at 6 Janpath in the national capital stopped reporting at the bungalow since January 20 and there was no prior intimation from the government about it, he added.

""This is a kind of vendetta politics. They think NCP leaders will be deterred by this. It is their misconception. ""The fight against Modi and Shah will continue,"" the Minority Affairs Minister said.

His party and ministerial colleague Jayant Patil also slammed the BJP and linked the alleged move of the Centre to the saffron outfit losing power in Maharashtra.

""From by-lanes to Delhi, the BJP has taken it to heart the change of power in Maharashtra. Therefore, the BJP is behaving with vengeance.

""This is detrimental to the democracy!"" tweeted Patil, the state NCP president who is also the water resources minister.

The 79-year-old NCP president enjoys 'Z+' category protection in Maharashtra, where his party is a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government.

Pawar had played the lead role in crafting the three- party ruling coalition in Maharashtra in November last year. The Congress is the third constituent of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pawar-s-security-at-delhi-home--withdrawn--by-centre--ncp-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pawar-s-security-at-delhi-home--withdrawn--by-centre--ncp.html

Georgia's Ivan Cheparinov, Kyrsa Leandro (Argentina), Vasif Durarbayli (Azerbaijan), Pier Luigi Basso (Italy) and Maksim Chigaev (Russia) are ahead of the field with three points after the third round on Thursday.

There were surprises in store on a day when power failure for over an hour affected play, as the top-seed Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (world No.7) was held to a draw by French GM Jules Moussard. He is bunched together with several others on 2.5 points.

Second seed Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France outclassed Tal Baron of Israel to take his tally to 2.5 points.

215,24-1-20,Serena Williams stunned by Wang Qiang at Australian Open,"Serena Williams' bid to win a 24th Grand Slam title has been falling short with losses in finals. At this Australian Open, she didn't make it nearly that far.

Serving only so-so, failing to convert all but one of her break chances and missing groundstrokes with alarming regularity, Williams stunningly exited in the third round at Melbourne Park, beaten 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 by 27th-seeded Wang Qiang of China on Friday.

Williams was broken in the final game, fittingly ending things with a backhand into the net. That was her 27th unforced error on the backhand side, part of a total of 56 miscues. Wang made only 20.

Williams owns seven trophies from the year's first major championship and this was her earliest defeat there since also bowing out in the third round all the way back in 2006.

Here is just one measure of how unexpected this result was: The only other time these two women faced each other came at the U.S. Open last September -- the only Slam quarterfinal appearance of Wang's career -- and Williams needed all of 44 minutes to dominate her way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory. The total points were 50 to 15.

Wang quickly surpassed those game and point totals Friday, thanks in large part to nearly flawless play in the first set.

She saved all four break points she faced in that set, accumulated 10 winners and made just five unforced errors. Wang picked up the lone break she needed at love with an easy forehand putaway winner that made it 5-4.

Soon enough, Williams was sailing a backhand return long to cede the set. Wang quickly went up in the second, too, and already was ahead by a break at 4-2 when she was a point away from earning another.

But Williams -- so tough at the toughest moments for so many years -- steadied herself there to hold and get within 4-3. There was still work to do, though, and when Wang served for the victory at 5-4 in the second, Williams came through.

She was 0 for 5 on break points until then but the sixth time was the charm. On the point of the match, with both players slugging away from the baseline, it was Williams who did what it took to take it, smacking a cross-court forehand winner out of Wang's reach on the 24th stroke.

Williams raised both arms and looked at her guest box in the stands, where her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, and husband, Alexis Ohanian, rose to their feet to celebrate. All that did was prolong things, though. Eventually, Williams' comeback fell short.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/serena-williams-stunned-by-wang-qiang-at-australian-open-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-williams-stunned-by-wang-qiang-at-australian-open.html
216,24-1-20,"Sena questions Centre on democracy ranking drop, economic woes","The Shiv Sena on Friday said there have been attempts to muzzle dissenting voices and this is one of the reasons for India slipping in the 2019 Democracy Index's global ranking.

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ""Saamana"" said a slowdown in economy gives rise to unrest and instability, and this was getting reflected in the prevailing situation in the country.

""Now (after an economic slowdown) there is a slide in (India's) global democracy index ranking,"" the Marathi daily said.

India slipped 10 places to 51st position in the 2019 Democracy Index's global ranking, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit, which cited ""erosion of civil liberties"" in the country as the primary cause for the downtrend. The EIU report was released earlier this week.

Citing issues like scrapping of Article 370, that provided special status to Jammu and Kashmir, new citizenship law CAA and the proposed NRC, measures which have witnessed protests, the paper said the country had witnessed a churning in the last one year.

""There have been protests and attempts to muzzle dissenting voices. Those who showed sympathy with JNU students (attacked by goons) were put in the dock and were made to look like an accused.

""This is the reason India slipped to 51st position in the Democracy Index, the editorial said and wondered if the ruling party at the Centre and its supporters accept the current situation.

""Even if the government rejects the (EIU) report, does the ruling party have an answer as to why the country was witnessing a slide, from economic field to democracy (ranking)?"" the Sena, a former ally of the BJP, asked.

The Sena publication said if the government thinks the country was doing well (on economic front), ""why is it asking the RBI for money""? apparently referring to the Centre's decision last year to seek Rs 1.76 lakh crore from reserves of the apex bank.

It is good to have a goal of making India a five trillion dollar economy (by 2024), but the GDP is not likely to grow by even 5 per cent in the current fiscal year, the party said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena-questions-centre-on-democracy-ranking-drop--economic-woes-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sena-questions-centre-on-democracy-ranking-drop--economic-woes.html

Opposition parties have been attacking the AAP-led Delhi government for giving ""freebies"" ahead of polls after it announced schemes like free bus rides for women and 200 units of free electricity.

""Freebies, in limited dose, are good for economy. It makes more money available to poor, hence boosts demand. However, it should be done in such limits so that no extra taxes have to be imposed and it does not lead to budget deficits,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet.

""I am happy you saw some CCTV cameras. A few days back you said there was not a single camera. Take out some time we will show you our schools also.

221,24-1-20,"India berates Pak for spewing venom, false narrative on Kashmir","Brushing aside Prime Minister Imran Khan’s plea for global intervention to prevent a showdown between “two nuclear armed” nations, New Delhi on Thursday rejected President Donald Trump’s offer of “ help” to resolve the matter insisting that Kashmir issue was a bilateral issue.

India also asked Pakistan to take verifiable action against terror groups active there and blamed it for “spewing venom and false narratives” in the United Nations, saying it takes to hate speech like ‘a fish takes to water” on the Kashmir issue.

Addressing the media along with the Pakistan Prime Minister in Davos on Tuesday, Trump said the US was watching the developments related to Kashmir “very closely” and repeated his offer to “help” resolve the matter.

Reacting to Khan’s call to the global community, the External Affairs Ministry Spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Pakistan efforts would be better spent in taking verifiable action against terror groups on its territory than trying to “distract” the global community.

In an interview on the sidelines of the Davos meet, Imran Khan had urged international powers — including the UN and the US — to help de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan before things get to a point of no return.

“You cannot have two nuclear-armed countries even contemplating a conflict,” he said, claiming that there was every possibility of India trying to raise tensions at the border to “divert attention from domestic issues” such as protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA). Among the demands made by the Pakistan Prime Minister was the positioning of a UN Military Observer Group along the Line of Control (LoC) between the two countries.

Meanwhile, India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu, slammed Pakistan for “spewing venom and false narratives” of monumental proportions in the United Nations.

He said it (Pakistan) takes to hate speech like a “fish takes to water’ and “obfuscates” the international community from the truth as Islamabad yet again raked up the Kashmir issue at the world body.

Pakistan has repeatedly brought up the Kashmir issue at various UN platforms in a bid to internationalise it but has failed to get any support. Last week, Islamabad failed in its efforts to get any traction from the membership of the UN Security Council when its ‘all-weather ally’ China made another pitch to raise the issue in the 15-nation Council. There was consensus among the rest of the Council members that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

Speaking at a session of the General Assembly on ‘Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization’ on Wednesday in New York, Naidu said Pakistan “indulges in confabulations and obfuscates the international community from the truth” instead of putting an end to the “bellicose and vitriolic diatribe” and taking steps to restore normal ties.

“Just like a fish takes to water, one delegation has again taken to hate speech. Every time this delegation speaks, it spews venom and false narratives of monumental proportions.

“It’s extremely surprising that a country that has completely decimated its minority population talks about protecting minorities. Pakistan’s practice of using false pretenses to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. Pakistan needs to reflect that there are no takers for its false rhetoric and should get down to the normal business of diplomacy,” Naidu said.

The Indian response came after Saad Ahmed Warraich, Counsellor at Pakistan mission to the UN, raised the issue of Jammu & Kashmir in his remarks during the session.

In New Delhi, the External Affairs Ministry spokesperson said regarding the Pakistan Prime Minister’s plea, “his remarks suggest that he is desperate and rapidly losing hope. The global community can now see through their double standards. While they pretend to be victims of terrorism on the one hand, they foster extremists who spread terrorism in India and other countries on the other,” he said.

Kumar also said Pakistan’s attempts to create an “alarmist situation” in Kashmir have failed miserably. “Our position on Kashmir has been clear and consistent through the years. These are bilateral issues that need to be discussed between India and Pakistan, and there is no role for a third party in this situation,” he said, adding that Imran Khan should resolve issues in “his own country” before looking elsewhere.

These observations came after Trump’s offer to mediate during his meeting with the Pakistan Prime Minister in Davos on Tuesday. Kumar said there is no role for any third party in the Kashmir issue which has to be resolved bilaterally with Pakistan and the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment for engagement. He also maintained that the World Economic Forum was not an appropriate platform to discuss such issues.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-berates-pak-for-spewing-venom--false-narrative-on-kashmir.html

The Chief Minister also expressed his strong displeasure and objection over Varma, a national general secretary of the party, sharing on the social media a letter wherein he had made mention of the Chief Minister having expressed apprehensions “in private” about the BJP’s “divisive” agenda.

“He is a learned man for whom I have a lot of respect even if he may not have similar sentiments for me.

But is it proper to share such things in public and not on a party forum? What if I start sharing what he said to me in public?” Nitish told reporters in Patna.

On Varma’s repeated demands for “ideological clarity”, Nitish said, “The JD(U)’s stand is very clear...He is free to go wherever he likes”.

On his part, the JD(U) general secretary said he will decide his next course of action depending on the reply from party president Nitish Kumar to his letter and asserted that he will continue to speak “what he believes is for the good of the country and the party”.

Varma reacted after Nitish snubbed him saying he is free to go wherever he wants and slammed him for raising his concerns over the party’s stand on a host of citizenship measures of the Modi Government.

“I have not received a reply. Depending on the reply from the party president or its absence I will decide on my course of action. I will continue to speak what I believe is right, what is for the good of the country and the party,” the former Rajya Sabha member said.

The former diplomat has distanced himself from the JD(U) over its support to the amended citizenship law and the national population register exercise, as he has often claimed that these measures along with the national citizenship register, which is on the BJP’s agenda, are divisive for the country.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nitish-dares-pavan-varma-to-quit-party-for-rebelling-against-jd-u--bjp-tie-up.html
223,24-1-20,"Kejriwal seeks votes for feats, Shah calls him liar number 1","Both campaign in Matiala Assembly seat

With Delhi Assembly elections just 16 days away, ruling AAP and the BJP stepped on the gas to woo the voters. Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were in Matiala Assembly constituency on Thursday to drum up support for their candidates.

Kejriwal held roadshows in Uttam Nagar and Vikaspuri areas while Shah held roadshows in Uttam Nagar, Palam and Nagloi Jat.

Kejriwal, atop an open yellow coloured jeep, waved to the public and shook hands with them as his roadshow passed from the narrow lanes of Matiala, Uttam Nagar and Vikaspuri. He was accompanied by the MLAs of the three areas.

While Kejriwal sought vote for the good works of the Government, the Union Home Minister launched a tirade on AAP chief and said if a competition to make false promises is held in the country, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will win the first prize.

He also alleged that the AAP leader had forgotten the promises he had made to the people of Delhi. “If there is a competition in the country of making false promises, Kejriwal would definitely get the first prize. I have come to remind you that you forgot the promises you made, but neither the people of Delhi nor BJP workers have forgotten,” said the Union Home Minister while addressing a public meeting in West Delhi’s Matiala constituency ahead of the Assembly polls on February 8.

“You became CM with the help of Anna Hazare but couldn’t bring a law for Lokpal and when Modi ji brought it you didn’t implement it here,” he said.

For four and a half years the Chief Minister kept saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not let him work so development could not be done in Delhi, Shah said.

“Now, you (Kejriwal) are saying that you developed Delhi in five years so ‘lage raho Kejriwal’,” he added.

Earlier in the day, hundreds of AAP supporters holding placards in support of various schemes of the Government, including free healthcare, electricity and water, surrounded party national convener Kejriwal during his roadshow held in Matiala and Kalkaji Assembly constituency on Thursday.

The AAP supporters danced to the tune of ‘Lage Raho Kejriwal’ (the party’s anthem). Kejriwal, atop an open yellow coloured jeep, waved to the public and shook hands with them as his roadshow moved through the narrow lanes of the Matiala Assembly. He was accompanied by Matiala MLA Gulab Singh Yadav.

“Mass gathering in Kalkaji Assembly constituency. We get strength after seeing such enthusiasm among people for the Aam Aadmi Party,” he tweeted in Hindi.

Meena Devi, a 48-year-old housewife was standing out of his home in the same constituency and seemed very ecstatic after waiving to Kejriwal and being waived back by the Chief Minister.

“AAP chief has done all the work we expected him to do in last five years. He has built schools, constructed mohalla clinics and laid pipe lines in our area to ensure 24 hours uninterrupted water supply. I will vote for the party as it has worked more than any party I have seen,” she said.

Rahul Bansal, who runs a glossary shop in the area said, “I am a BJP supporter but I will be voting for the AAP on the name of development and providing succor to people by ensuring free electricity, water and health care.”

In the last phase of campaigning, Kejriwal will hold eight ‘Town Hall’ sessions at different locations of Delhi and will also carry out regular roadshows in different Assembly constituencies.

Delhi Assembly polls will be held on February 8 and the counting of votes will take place on February 11.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kejriwal-seeks-votes-for-feats--shah-calls-him-liar-number-1-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kejriwal-seeks-votes-for-feats--shah-calls-him-liar-number-1.html

On Thursday, the embassy hosted Republic day reception in which Chinese officials and members of Beijing-based diplomatic community took part.

Vice Foreign Minister and China's former ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui was the Chief Guest at the reception.

Addressing the gathering, Indian ambassador to China Vikram Misri said that 2020 is an important year for the bilateral ties as it marks the 70th year of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

""It is worth noting that India was one of the first non-socialist countries to recognise the People's Republic of China (PRC). This is an important opportunity to review our journey and set new goals together,"" he said.

The second informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held at Chennai last year was highly successful and productive, Misri said.

It provided new impetus for the growth of the India-China relations across the political, military economic and trade, cultural and people-to-people relations, he said.

A broader and deeper relations between the two countries can enable to serve as a factor of stability in a complex and evolving world, the Indian envoy said.

225,24-1-20,Nepal invites PM Modi for Sagarmatha dialogue,"Nepal has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the first Sagarmatha Sambaad forum to be held here in April to deliberate on the most prominent issues of global, regional and national significance, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said on Friday.

The first edition of the ‘Sagarmatha Sambaad' is scheduled to be held from April 2 to 4 on the theme ""Climate Change, Mountains and the Future of Humanity,"" he told a group of visiting Indian reporters.

""We have invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and are awaiting the confirmation,"" Gyawali said.

He said leaders of all SAARC countries, including Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, have been invited and Nepal would be happy to host all the regional leaders so that they can have discussions amongst themselves on the challenges facing the region.

The Sambaad (dialogue) is named after the world's tallest mountain Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) which is also a symbol of friendship, Gyawali said.

Gyawali said the main objectives of the first edition of the Sambad are to forge a common consensus among countries on the impending climate crisis and encourage political leaders to mobilise their political willpower to tackle its menace.

It also hopes to create awareness among participants and the world about the direct relation that exists between the climate change and mountain ecology.

Nepal has the icy peaks of some of the world's highest mountains.

The dialogue would make an effort to promote and demonstrate its resolve to make it a welcoming ground for all stakeholders for impartial, transparent, open discussion and free flow of thoughts and ideas, officials said.

To be held every biennially, the Sambaad hopes to draw global leaders, including heads of state/government, parliamentarians, policy makers, leaders from the inter-governmental organisations, the private sector, the civil society, think tanks, women and the media to discuss on the ways of cooperation, exchange of ideas and sharing of experiences on prominent global issues.

The member states of SAARC are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In the last three years, India has been distancing itself from the SAARC, citing security challenge facing the region from terror networks based in Pakistan, which is also a member of the grouping.

The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu. The 2016 SAARC summit was to be held in Islamabad. But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit due to ""prevailing circumstances"".

The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate in the Islamabad meet.

SAARC summits are usually held biennially and hosted by member states in alphabetical order.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nepal-invites-pm-modi-for-sagarmatha-dialogue-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/nepal-invites-pm-modi-for-sagarmatha-dialogue.html

227,24-1-20,"Gut bacteria linked to risk of obesity, PCOS in teens: Study","Teens with ""unhealthy"" gut bacteria may face a higher risk of obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), according to a study which may lead to earlier diagnosis of the chronic diseases.

PCOS, a hormone disorder characterised by high levels of the male hormone testosterone in women's blood, can cause acne, excess hair growth, and irregular periods, and affects 6-18 per cent of women of reproductive age globally, the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, noted.

Women and teen girls with PCOS may also experience side effects beyond infertility and menstrual irregularities, like psychological issues including anxiety and depression that continue well beyond fertile age, the study said.

""We found that in adolescents with PCOS and obesity, the bacterial profile (microbiome) from stool has more 'unhealthy' bacteria compared to teens without PCOS,"" said Melanie Cree Green, the study's co-author from Children's Hospital Colorado in the US.

""The unhealthy bacteria is related to higher testosterone concentrations, and markers of metabolic complications,"" Green added.

Analysing the stool samples of 58 teens with obesity, the scientists found that the community of thousands of bacterial species living in the guts of girls with PCOS are altered compared to those in teens without the condition.

According to the scientists, these girls had more ""unhealthy"" bacteria in their stool samples which was related to higher testosterone levels, and other markers of metabolic syndrome like higher blood pressure, liver inflammation, and elevated levels of the fat molecules triglycerides.

""The gut microbiome may play a role in PCOS and its related metabolic complications, and these changes can be found in teenagers who are early in the course of the condition,"" Green said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gut-bacteria-linked-to-risk-of-obesity--pcos-in-teens--study-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/gut-bacteria-linked-to-risk-of-obesity--pcos-in-teens--study.html

229,24-1-20,Fee hike: HC seeks JNU stand on plea challenging IHA decision amending Hostel Manual,"The Delhi High Court on Friday said JNU students, who have not yet registered for the new academic year, may do so under the old hostel manual as it sought response of the University on the plea of JNU Students Union challenging the decision to amend the hostel manual.

A bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdher also issued notices to MHRD and UGC which were impleaded in the matter.

The plea, filed by JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh and other office bearers Saket Moon, Satish Chandra Yadav and Md Danish, challenged the minutes of the Inter Hostel Administration (IHA) issued on October 28, last year, jurisdiction of the High Level Committee constituted on November 24 and recommendations made by it.

The petition had sought directions to quash the Draft Hostel Manual ""illegally approved by the IHA as the decisions taken by the IHA are malafide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the students"".

It claimed the decisions to bring about amendments in the hostel manual are contrary to provisions of the JNU Act, 1966, Statutes, Ordinances and the Hostel Manual.

""The amendments include reducing JNUSU representation in IHA, increased rates as applicable to hostel residents and also brought amendments to clauses of the Hostel Manual adversely affecting reserved category students in the University,"" the plea had submitted.

Earlier, the rent was Rs 10 and Rs 20 for double and single-occupancy rooms respectively.

The rent for all students, including those with Junior Research Fellowship, Senior Research Fellowship and other equivalent scholarships or fellowships, for single and double-seater rooms has been hiked to Rs 600 and Rs 300 per month.

The rent for Below Poverty Line (BPL) category students for double and single-seater rooms has been increased to Rs 150 and Rs 300 per month respectively.

Earlier, there was no utility and service charge, but now the university will charge BPL students Rs 500 and other students Rs 1,000 for the same.

The petition in the high court had also challenged the minutes of IHA Meeting which states that mess services sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10 per cent every academic year.

Contending that hike in the hostel fees would direct impact the future of students, the plea sought directions restraining the varsity from taking any actions which would give effect to the draft hostel manual.

It had also sought directions to restrain the university from registering students for the new term on the basis of the new fee structure through its circular for registration in Winter Semester-2020.

The Executive Council of JNU showed total ""non application of mind"" while creating a 'Below Poverty Line' students, the plea had said.

""It is submitted that the criteria of 'Below Poverty Line' has not been provided in the Draft Hostel Manual. In fact, there is no clarity on the categorization required by the BPL and how the University has the requisite data to apply the BPL category to admitted students. No clarity has been even provided in the amended IHA on this issue,"" it had said.

The students body had said that JNUSU is a necessary invitee member of various committees set up under the JNU Act, 1966 and its representatives were entitled to be a part of the IHA Committee meeting to discuss the Draft Hostel Manual.

""JNUSU wrote a letter dated December 27, 19 to JNU Vice Chancellor to take cognizance of the situation and initiating dialogue.

230,24-1-20,Congress hits out at Vijayvargiya on 'poha' remark,"The Congress has hit out at senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya on his remarks on labourers eating 'poha' while working at his residence who he said looked like illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

The Congress said ""this is the real face of the government which is watching your eating habits.""

Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev said ""The statement made by Vijayvargiyaji, we condemn it. How has he connected the food habits of a construction worker to his nationality and termed him as infiltrator? We have consistently said that conducting a census in India is not a new phenomenon, yes there is mention of the NPR in the citizenship rules but that has a context which makes the entire exercise suspicious at this point of time.""

""This is the reason why people are afraid of the NPR, if the NPR happens then what will happen nobody can assume and this is the reason why people have no trust in the government as the NPR lead to profiling of people and it is not like a census,"" said Dev.

The controversy erupted Vijayvargiya claimed that labourers who recently carried out construction work at his Indore house could be Bangladeshis as they had ""strange"" eating habits. And what's that? Eating only 'poha' (flattened rice).

""When a new room was being added at my house recently, I found eating habits of some of the workers 'strange' as they were eating only 'poha' (flattened rice)"", he said.

He added, ""I suspected these workers were residents of Bangladesh. Two days after I became suspicious, they stopped working at my house. I have not filed any police complaint yet. I only mentioned this incident to warn people.""

Speaking at a seminar, he connected it to internal security of India. ""Whenever I go out, six armed security personnel follow me. What is happening in this country? Will outside people enter and spread so much terror?"" Vijayvargiya asked.

Meanwhile, this has sparked off a massive debate on Twitter with many users pointing out that eating 'poha' cannot be a yardstick for debating someone's nationality.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/congress-hits-out-at-vijayvargiya-on--poha--remark-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/congress-hits-out-at-vijayvargiya-on--poha--remark.html
231,24-1-20,Peaceful stirs aid democracy: PranabPeaceful stirs aid democracy: Pranab,"Ex-Prez deftly avoids naming CAA, but says protesters’ belief in Constitution is heartening

Weighing in on the ongoing protests across the country, former President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have “gripped” the country will once again help deepening India’s democratic roots.

Addressing the first Sukumar Sen Memorial lecture series at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra on Thursday, former President said the last few months have witnessed people, particularly the youth, come out on the streets in large numbers to voice their views on issues “which in their view are important”.

“Indian democracy has been tested time and again. Consensus is the lifeblood of democracy. Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent. Their assertion and belief in the Constitution of India is particularly heartening to see,” he said.

While Mukherjee did not name the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, in his address, his remarks, particularly his reference to belief of the youth in upholding the Constitution of India, have come against the backdrop of protests against the CAA.

Incidentally, at several places protesters, mainly youths, grabbed headlines by simply reading the Preamble of the Constitution.

The Modi Government has faced several protests during its second term across the country on issues such as CAA/ NRC/NPR, abrogation of Article 370, and Triple Talaq.

Mukherjee’s daughter Sharmistha Mukherjee, a Congress leader, has supported the ongoing protests against the CAA and she was detained.

This is not the first time that he has spoken out on issues of national importance. Mukherjee had raked up a major controversy by visiting the RSS headquarters in Nagpur two years ago. At that time even people within his own party, the Congress,

criticised him for showing proximity to the ruling BJP at the Centre.

On December 19 last year, speaking at the second Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture at the India Foundation, Mukherjee had cautioned against a “majoritarian Government” against the backdrop of pan-India protests against the CAA.

“A numerical majority in the elections only gives a political party the right to form a stable Government and not a majoritarian one. A numerical majority in elections gives you the right to make a stable government. The lack of popular majority forbids you from (becoming) a majoritarian government. That is the message and essence of our parliamentary democracy,” Mukherjee said. The former President also pointed out that while people have given “strong majorities” to various parties since 1952, not a single one has been elected with over 50 per cent vote.

Similarly, delivering Rajendra Mathur Memorial Lecture, organised annually by the Editors Guild of India in December last year, Mukherjee had emphasised that a democracy without a free press is like a “blank piece of paper”.

“Selective, orchestrated, one-sided, out of context, or motivated reporting and display, aimed at pushing the partisan agendas of one group or the other cannot or should not ever be the nature and character of journalism,” he had said.

In October last year, Mukherjee pressed on the importance of dialogue in a democracy while delivering the North East Institute of Advanced Studies Foundation Day lecture in memory of Justice (Retd) KN Saikia in Guwahati, Assam. Mukherjee stated that the soul of India resides in pluralism and celebration of its diversity.

“India’s nationhood is not one language, one religion, one enemy. It is the ‘perennial universalism’ of 1.3 billion people who use more than 122 languages and 1,600 dialects in their everyday lives, practice seven major religions, belong to three major ethnic groups — Caucasians, Mongoloids, and Dravidians live under one system, one flag and one identity of being Indian or bhartiya and have no enemies. That is what makes Bharat a diverse and united nation,” he stated.

At the Thursday function, the former President said the Election Commission has served its purpose well and any attempt at its denigration will amount to denigrating the electoral process. “People’s mandate is sacrosanct and its sanctity supreme. Onus of ensuring this lies with the Election Commission. They must do so & put any speculations to rest,” he said.

In his opening remarks, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said, “Election Commission of India is indebted to Mukherjee for kindly agreeing to deliver the First Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture. There could not be a harmonious combination of theme and the speaker for this evening - a savant and a rajrishi.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/peaceful-stirs-aid-democracy--pranabpeaceful-stirs-aid-democracy--pranab-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/peaceful-stirs-aid-democracy--pranabpeaceful-stirs-aid-democracy--pranab.html
232,24-1-20,"Jail readies noose, Nirbhaya convicts’ lawyer plans delay","With nine days left for their execution, the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape case are yet to inform the Tihar jail authorities about when they want to meet their families for the last time or whom they want to will their assets and the money that they have earned during their incarceration.

Delhi Prisons authorities have begun preparations for the execution of the four convicts on February 1 and have contracted Pawan, the hangman from Meerut who would be paid Rs 15,000 for each hanging.

Meanwhile, the counsel for the convicts, AP Singh told The Pioneer that options are there before him as Akshay Singh and Pawan Gupta’s curative petitions are yet to be filed before the Supreme Court. Once the petitions are filed, the hanging will be stayed till the petitions are decided.

The four convicts, Vinay Shrama (26), Akshay Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar (32) and Pawan Gupta (25), who are lodged in separate cells of Jail No 3 where the execution will take place, are scheduled to be hanged at 6 am on February 1, in case they fail to file the curative petition.

According to AP Singh, Pawan and Akshay still have options to file curative petitions in the Supreme Court. Pawan and Akshay are yet to request for the “Presidential pardon”.

A petition of Pawan claiming to be juvenile at the time of crime was rejected by the Supreme Court recently but the advocate said Pawan is still left with option to move a curative petition in the Supreme Court. The lawyer also claimed that Akshay is also left with option to file curative petition.

Meanwhile, a senior jail official while elaborating about the procedure before executing death-row convicts said after the death warrants were issued, the convicts were asked when they would like to meet their respective families for the last time and if so, who all do they wish to meet. But none of them have responded yet.

The official said the convicts were also asked if they would want to prepare their will, but they have not responded yet. “The families of all the four convicts are allowed to meet them twice a week but the last date of meeting has not been fixed because they still have not responded,” he said.

“Dummy execution of the four death-row convicts was performed in the prison last week. The officials recorded the weights of the convicts and then prepared the dummies accordingly with sacks filled with debris and stones,” a senior jail official said.

The execution will take place in Jail No 3, the official said, adding that the Uttar Pradesh Prison authority has confirmed that Pawan jallad from Meerut will be sent to hang the four convicts.

All the four are likely to hanged simultaneously.

The jail authorities were also holding conversations with them on a daily basis to ensure that they were in a good mental state, the official said.

On Wednesday, in a plea filed by the Centre before the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Home Affairs said heinous crime convicts are taking the judicial process for a ride. They demanded fixing a seven-day deadline for execution of condemned prisoners after issuance of black warrant, amid the delay in the hanging of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape-murder case.

On January 18, following a Delhi High Court direction to take necessary action against the counsel for Nirbhaya convict, Pawan, the Bar Council of Delhi has issued notice to Advocate AP Singh.

The High Court had passed the direction while dismissing Pawan’s plea to establish that he was a juvenile at the time of the commission of offence.

A Single Judge Bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait had concluded that the plea was filed only to delay the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape case. The matter was thereafter placed before the Bar Council of Delhi which issued a notice to AP Singh.

The 23-year-old paramedic student Nirbhaya was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Ram Singh, one of the six accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jail-readies-noose--nirbhaya-convicts----lawyer-plans-delay.html
233,24-1-20,Coronavirus locks down 5 Chinese cities,"In rare move, Wuhan among five cities sealed to contain infection

China on Thursday locked down five cities, including Wuhan, suspending all public transport in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus that has infected over 630 people and left 17 others dead, dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year.

On Thursday evening, Chinese officials announced suspension of public transport in five cities — Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang and Wuhan in Hubei province — official media reported.

Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out. Nationwide, a total of 17 people have died, all of them in and around Wuhan. The victims’ average age was 73, with the oldest 89 and the youngest 48. So far 631 cases have been confirmed in 25 provincial-level regions in the country.

The Government has sealed Wuhan and Huanggang, a prefecture level city with over 7.4 million people, in an unprecedented effort to curb the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. The other three cities too have substantial population. From 10 am on Thursday, all public transportation, including city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance coaches in Wuhan were suspended, and outbound channels at airports and railway stations closed until further notice. The city officials have asked people in both the cities not to leave.

Wuhan is a major transportation hub and home to many universities.

The Wuhan lockdown is a cause of concern for Indian students who still remained there. The city has about 700 Indian students, majority of them studying medicine. However, most of the students have apparently left for home for the holidays.

As concerns grew over their safety, the Indian Embassy on Thursday opened helplines and established contacts with the concerned Chinese officials to ensure food and other supplies for those who remained in the city.

In new disclosure, Chinese officials on Thursday confirmed fresh cases of coronavirus in people who did not even travel to Wuhan recently. The National Health Commission also reported increasing number of cases with no exposure to Wuhan’s Hunan seafood wholesale market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. The cases without confirmed exposure to the market have been found overseas.

The virus, which a doctor in Wuhan told BBC is spreading at an alarming rate, has dampened the Chinese New Year celebrations beginning Friday.

Chinese all over the world formally bid goodbye to the year of the pig and welcome the year of rat on Friday. The Chinese government has given week long holiday.

In view of virus scare, several cities including Beijing have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival.

Large cultural activities during spring festival in Beijing such as temple fairs were cancelled to prevent the spread of the virus, state-run Global Times reported.

An official statement said that Beijing’s sprawling imperial palace ‘Forbidden City’ will close on Saturday until further notice to “avoid cross-infection caused by the gathering of people”.

A Chinese government announcement said citizens in Wuhan and Huanggang should not leave without specific reasons.

As medical consumable such as surgical masks, protective clothing and disinfectant are running short, the Red Cross Society of China’s Wuhan branch opened a 24-hour hotline to receive donated emergency stocks.

All residents in the province have been ordered to wear masks.

“Staff of state organs, enterprises and institutions shall wear masks at work, and operators of public venues should set up eye-catching signs to request residents to put on masks before entering,” said a notice issued by the Wuhan municipal government.

“Those who disregard the warning will be punished according to relevant laws and regulations,” it added.

Many local residents are busy purchasing food and daily necessities for the festival, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

According to the provincial commerce department, the Hubei province will strengthen the monitoring of grain, oil, meat, eggs and vegetables, increase stocks during the spring festival holiday to ensure stable supply, and intensify environmental sanitation control.

Hubei Province has alone reported 444 cases of coronavirus infections. All 17 deaths were reported from the province. Among the confirmed cases, 399 patients are receiving treatment in hospitals, with 71 in severe condition and 24 in critical condition, said Yang Yunyan, vice governor of the province.

Confirmed cases have also been reported from several regions including Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as in the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday extended to Thursday its emergency talks on whether the coronavirus outbreak in China constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

Lauding China’s immediate detecting and sharing of the sequencing of the virus, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus believed that those actions will “minimize the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.” PTI",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-locks-down-5-chinese-cities-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/coronavirus-locks-down-5-chinese-cities.html

Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets in the area. Police said people should avoid the area, but no evacuation has been ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders were checking on residents of nearby homes.

Several people told Houston TV station KHOU that the explosion was so loud, they thought a bomb had gone off or that a vehicle had crashed into their homes. At one man's home about 1/4 mile (0.4 kilometers) away, glass doors were shattered, ceilings were cracked, and the lid of his toilet was even torn off, the station reported.

Southeast Texas has seen a series of explosions in recent years up and down the Texas Gulf Coast, which is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter-in-place advisory for three hours.

In December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/houston-building-explosion-shakes-city--scatters-debris-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/houston-building-explosion-shakes-city--scatters-debris.html
238,24-1-20,China deploys military medics to combat coronavirus outbreak,"China has deployed its military medics to help to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which claimed 26 lives so far and led to the isolation of millions of people in the country, state media reported on Friday.

As many as 40 military medical officers have already started work in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.

The central military command has ordered medical staff to help civilian doctors and nurses, the state-run China Central Television (CCTV) reported.

The decision to deploy military doctors also comes in the backdrop of a growing apprehension among doctors and medical staff over the threat posed by the virus to their lives as during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis in 2003, medical staff suffered major casualties.

The death toll in China's deadly coronavirus has climbed to 26 with confirmed cases rising sharply to 881 in the country.

With the virus spreading fast in the country and the world, China has locked down 13 cities, including Wuhan, suspending all public transport in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus, dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year.

Chinese and American researchers are working together to develop a vaccine against the deadly new strain of coronavirus, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

The collaboration is taking place amid a growing international debate about whether it came from snakes or bats.

At present, there is no cure for the virus which has pneumonia-like symptoms and is contagious among humans.

Experts from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, the University of Texas, the non-profit New York Blood Centre and Fudan University in Shanghai are collaborating on the project, Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor College's National School of Tropical Medicine told state news agency Xinhua.

""(Vaccine) development is not a fast process, and it's not clear whether we would have a vaccine ready to use before this current epidemic ends,"" Hotez said.

Officials have told hospitals to quarantine any suspected patients and their close contacts.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus a global public health emergency, despite China's climbing death toll.

The virus had spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-deploys-military-medics-to-combat-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-deploys-military-medics-to-combat-coronavirus-outbreak.html
239,24-1-20,Projects shelved to save Chambal ecology,"The Centre has put on hold the Madhya Pradesh Government’s proposal for laying of freshwater pipe and construction of inland wells in the Chambal river citing threat to endangered species such as crocodiles, gharials, turtles and dolphins found in the region.

The project was red-flagged by the State Chief Wildlife Warden due to threat to the river ecology and wildlife, but it was cleared by the State board for wildlife.

In a recent meeting, the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (SC-NBWL) noted that the proposal required diversion of 1.267 hectares from the National Chambal Sanctuary for the construction of intake well in the Chambal river and for laying of drinking water pipeline to meet the demand of the locals from Sheopar district.

The members also noted that the State Chief Wildlife Warden didn’t clear the proposal on the ground that construction of intake well is in close proximity of the habitat of crocodile, gharial, Indian skimmers, turtle and dolphin.

The board also took cognisance of the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) past stand that the minimum flow required to sustain the ideal habitat for gharial in Chambal river is 151-165 m3/sec and for the dolphin 266.42 - 289.67 m3/sec. But in December 2017 when the Dehradun-based agency again monitored the discharge of the Chambal river, it found the flow had receded to 67 m3 /sec.

“So taking water from the Chambal river will affect the wildlife adversely in the long run for sustaining viable population of critically endangered schedule I species,” the NBWL said.

In 2011, the SC-NBWL had said that no new projects would be considered for withdrawing water from the Chambal river which is already witnessing receding water flow.

A report prepared by a team led by the Superintendent, National Chambal Sanctuary, Sheopur which inspected the site on July 4, 2019 too had red-flagged the project. It pointed out that the construction might affect the nesting sites of gharial, turtle and mugger which are almost 800 to 1,000 metres upstream from the proposed location of the intake well.

After deliberation, the SC-NBWL decided to defer the proposal asking the State Government to explore alternative source of water following sustainable goal objectives.

Welcoming the Centre’s move to put on hold the project, wildlife scientist from the WII, SA Hussain, said the region is very important site for the critically endangered Schedule I species like gharial, Batagur turtle, Indian skimmer. He also pointed out the region also teems with national acquatic animal Gangetic dolphin, State fish Golden Mahasheer, most of these being critically endangered schedule I species.

There are other sources of water like Tigra reservoir and Quawari river in the region, which can be utilised to meet the water need of the people, he suggested.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/projects-shelved-to-save-chambal-ecology-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/projects-shelved-to-save-chambal-ecology.html

Villeneuve had directed the criticially-acclaimed 2017 feature ""Blade Runner 2049"", which was a follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1982's cult classic ""Blade Runner"".

The director said he has a problem with the term ""sequel"" and if decides to go back to the franchise, the new movie would be ""disconnected"" from its predecessors.

""The problem is have is the word ‘sequel'. I think cinema needs original stories. But if you ask me if I'd like to revisit this universe in a different way, I can say yes,"" Villeneuve told Empire magazine.

""It would need to be a project on its own. Something disconnected from both other movies. A detective noir story set in the future... I wake up sometimes in the night dreaming about it,"" he added.

242,24-1-20,Novelty inspires me: Ayushmann Khurrana,"Known for portraying ordinary men - often flawed and insecure - with almost no one character being similar to the other, Ayushmann Khuranna says novelty of any kind inspires him.

""Novelty inspires me, any kind, any shape or form. It could be the first attempt in Hindi cinema. That inspires me.

""Any person living a mundane life, 9 to 5, and still motivated to live, that inspires me, because as an artist you have a very vibrant life. You live a different character each day,"" Khurrana said during an interaction at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet on Thursday.

Khurrana, whose next film 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' based on homosexuality is slated to hit the theatres on February 21, said he has prepared for each of his vastly diverse roles by being with the milieu and also banked on his exposure to Hindi theatre as also the convent education he received.

""The idea is to be one with the milieu, get grasp of the colloquial jargons, twangs, and India is a country where every ten kilometres, the dialect changes.

""I am glad that I have done Hindi theatre, Hindi public speaking, though I was convent educated. So that made me quite a linguist. That exposure was quite early in life,"" he said during the session at the iconic Victoria Memorial Hall premises.

From essaying the role a sperm donor in his debut film Vicky Donor, to depicting a man with erectile dysfunction in 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan', or a blind pianist in the 2018 thriller 'Andhadhun', Khurrana has been hailed as having ""cornered the market when it comes to playing flawed, insecure men with confidence issues"".

The films, generally set in small towns amid middle class environs, have time and again dealt with taboo subjects, and are sprinkled with liberal doses of wit, humour and comic situations. The much feted actor says all of these are essential for the movies of his genre.

""By default these characters are set in middle class, small towns. That's where the conflict is there. In urban centres, like Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata they are receptive to taboo subjects. So where is the conflict then?

""In the middle class society, we're like the flag bearers of morality, that's where the humour emanates, when you are stuck in that conventional dogma. And we are not trying to make people laugh as the situation is funny. For the male lead or the main lead, it is tragic,"" he said.

As for the upcoming film, Khurrana says he has a lot of friends who are part of the LGBTQ (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and queers) community. ""And it's a journey. I am learning every minute"".

The 35 year old actor gave credit to the audience for receiving well his films themed on progressive subjects.

""The choices I am making are going down well with the audience. Audience is also evolving and receiving well these subjects which are progressive.

""Earlier these used to be for art house cinema stuff. But now these middle of the road cinemas - a great collaboration of content and commerce - are evoking good responses,"" he said.

'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' would be another case study, the actor says, calling it the first film dealing with homosexuality in the realm of the commercial Hindi cinema.

""In parallel or arthouse cinema we have seen films dealing with homosexaulity. But those were the films catering to the converted. The audience watching these films are within the LGBT community already.

""We want to reach out to people, who are averse to homosexuality. This is the first Hindi mainstream commercial film in India based on homosexuality. We hope it will at least usher in the conversation and have a discussion on LGBTQ,"" Khurrana added.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/novelty-inspires-me--ayushmann-khurrana-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/novelty-inspires-me--ayushmann-khurrana.html

The new sanctions come three weeks after the US killing of the Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani in a missile strike that Washington claimed was preemptive.

The US Treasury identified four entities -- two based in Hong Kong, one in Shanghai and another in Dubai -- saying they had together transferred ""hundreds of millions of dollars' worth"" of exports from the National Iranian Oil Company, thereby helping finance the Quds Force.

""Iran's petrochemical and petroleum sectors are a primary source of funding for the Iranian regime's global terrorist activities and enable its persistent use of violence against its own people,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

Washington has recently also targeted other Iranian entities in the commodities, including metals companies and oil companies accused of supporting the Revolutionary Guards.

245,24-1-20,Trump invites Netanyahu to US for peace plan talks,"US Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main election rival to Washington next week to discuss Donald Trump's long-awaited Middle East peace plan.

The White House said the talks would take place on Tuesday.

""President Trump asked me to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House next week to discuss regional issues, as well as the prospect of peace here in the Holy Land"", Pence said.

Netanyahu told Pence: ""I think that the president is seeking to give Israel the peace and security it deserves,"" adding that he ""gladly"" accepted the invitation.

""Thank you for what your administration does every day... We have no better friend than President Trump,"" he said at the meeting at the US embassy in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders have however dismissed the US peace initiative as one-sided.

They say it fails to address their wish to end Israeli occupation and the expansion, encouraged by Netanyahu, of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land.

On Thursday the Palestinian Authority reiterated its rejection of the US peace plan.

""We stress once again our categorical rejection of the American decisions,"" a spokesman for Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas said in a statement.

Trump has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis, including formalising US recognition of the divided city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.

His concept for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is believed to revolve around encouraging massive economic investment.

As caretaker premier Netanyahu faces new elections on March 2. Both he and the White House agreed that his main rival, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, will attend the Washington meeting.

Pence said Gantz, Israel's former army chief, had accepted the invitation. Trump, whose team has long been working on the outlines of such a plan, has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history.

After many postponements, Trump's peace initiative to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was expected in the autumn, after inconclusive elections were held in September.

Netanyahu said: ""With such friends in the White House ... We should get as broad a consensus as possible around the efforts to achieve security and peace for the state of Israel.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-invites-netanyahu-to-us-for-peace-plan-talks-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-invites-netanyahu-to-us-for-peace-plan-talks.html
246,24-1-20,'Sopranos' actress Sciorra tells Weinstein trial: 'He raped me',"""The Sopranos"" actress Annabella Sciorra fought back tears as she told a court Thursday that being raped by Harvey Weinstein left her feeling like she was having ""a seizure"" and caused her to self-harm.

In an emotional testimony at Weinstein's trial, Sciorra described him barging into her New York apartment late at night in the early 1990s and attacking her while she was wearing a nightgown.

""It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake in a way that was very unusual. I didn't really even know what was happening,"" the 59-year-old said.

Sciorra faced the jury as she held her hands above her head and clasped her wrists to demonstrate how Weinstein, then three times her weight, held her down on her bed and sexually assaulted her.

""He got on top of me and he raped me,"" she said, under questioning by lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon.

""He put his penis inside of my vagina and he raped me,"" repeated Sciorra, the first of Weinstein's accusers to take the stand in proceedings seen as key to the #MeToo movement.

Weinstein, 67, avoided eye contact and gestured towards one of his lawyers as Sciorra told the New York state court that the former film producer then performed oral sex on her.

""I didn't have very much fight left inside me at this point. My body just shut down,"" said Sciorra, wearing a navy blue dress with long sleeves.

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping actress Jessica Mann. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.

Sciorra, best known for her role as Gloria Trillo in American mob drama ""The Sopranos,"" gave evidence to support the prosecution's case that Weinstein was a career sexual predator.

Her allegation is too old to be included on the charge sheet but the charge of predatory sexual assault, which carries possible life imprisonment, requires prosecutors to prove he sexually assaulted at least two people.

Sciorra said the alleged attack occurred in the plush Manhattan neighborhood of Gramercy Park in the winter of 1993-94 after Weinstein dropped her off at home following a business dinner at a restaurant.

It left her traumatized and withdrawn and she started drinking heavily and began cutting herself afterwards, Sciorra testified.

""I would have blood on my fingers and my hands,"" she recounted. Sciorra said she did not go public with the allegations until The New Yorker magazine published her account in October 2017 because she was ""afraid for her life.""

She told Weinstein's trial she never reported the alleged incident to police because she was confused that it had been allegedly perpetrated by someone she knew.

""I would say I felt at the time that rape was something that happened in a back alleyway in a dark place by somebody you didn't know,"" she said.

Sciorra added that when she later confronted Weinstein about the incident he became angry and threatening.

She tried to avoid him out of fear but he would track her down, including to a hotel room at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, she testified.

""When I opened the door the defendant was in his underwear with a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other,"" Sciorra said.

During cross-examination, lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno challenged Sciorra on the ""vague"" timeline of the alleged attack.

She also questioned Sciorra as to why she did not tell friends or her building's doorman about the attack afterwards.

""At the time, I didn't understand that that was rape,"" said Sciorra.

Rotunno accused Sciorra of providing inconsistent information about the exact location of the apartment as well.

""You're a professional actress, correct?"" Rotunno said to Sciorra.

""As part of that job Ms. Sciorra, you pretend to be someone you're not. Is that fair to say?"" she asked.

""No,"" replied Sciorra.

247,24-1-20,Death toll in China's coronavirus climbs to 25 with 830 confirmed cases,"The death toll in China's alarmingly new coronavirus afflictions has climbed to 25 with confirmed cases rising sharply to 830, the Chinese health authorities said on Friday.

The pneumonia situation had resulted in 25 deaths, including 24 in central China's Hubei province and one in north China's Hebei, the National Health Commission said.

By Thursday, 830 confirmed cases of pneumonia, caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), had been reported in 29 provincial-level regions in the country, it said.

A total of 1,072 suspected cases have been reported in 20 provincial-level regions, according to the National Health Commission.

As the virus spread in the country and the world, China on Thursday locked down five cities, including Wuhan, suspending all public transport in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus, dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year.

On Thursday evening, Chinese officials announced suspension of public transport in five cities - Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang and Wuhan in Hubei province, official media reported.

Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out.

According to the health commission in northern Hebei province, which borders Beijing, an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus died on January 22.

The victims' average age was 73, with the oldest 89 and the youngest 48. So far 631 cases have been confirmed in 25 provincial-level regions in the country.

The Wuhan lockdown is a cause of concern for Indian students who still remained there. The city has about 700 Indian students, majority of them studying medicine. However, most of the students have apparently left for home for holidays.

As concerns grew over their safety, the Indian Embassy on Thursday opened helplines and established contacts with the concerned Chinese officials to ensure food and other supplies for those who remained in the city.

In new disclosure, Chinese officials on Thursday confirmed fresh cases of coronavirus in people who did not even travel to Wuhan recently.

The National Health Commission also reported increasing number of cases with no exposure to Wuhan's Hunan seafood wholesale market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. The cases without confirmed exposure to the market have been found overseas.

The virus, which a doctor in Wuhan told BBC is spreading at an alarming rate, has dampened the Chinese New Year celebrations beginning Friday.

Chinese all over the world formally bid goodbye to the year of the pig and welcome the year of rat on Friday and welcomed the year of Rat. The Chinese government has given week long holiday.

In view of virus scare, several cities including Beijing have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival.

248,24-1-20,Trump 'should be removed': impeachment trial,"Lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff called dramatically for the Senate to remove President Donald Trump from office Thursday, saying the US leader cannot be trusted to put the country's interests ahead of his own.

""The American people deserve a president they can count on, to put their interest first,"" said Schiff.

His impassioned words capped a long day in which Democrats detailed Trump's illicit scheme to pressure Ukraine to help his 2020 reelection campaign.

""You know, you can't trust this president to do what is right for this country. You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump,"" Schiff added.

""He'll do it now. He's done it before. He'll do it for the next several months. He'll do it in the election if he's allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed."" ""Because right matters. And truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.""

As the 100 senators sat as jurors and millions of Americans watched on television, House impeachment managers mustered scores of videos, internal documents and extensive witness testimony to lay out a strong case that the US leader abused his powers.

Schiff's prosecution team detailed how Trump flagrantly undertook last year to force Kiev to help him tarnish his possible 2020 reelection rival, former vice president Joe Biden.

""President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit,"" House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler told the chamber.

""Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,"" Nadler said.

""The president has repeatedly, flagrantly, violated his oath... The president's conduct is wrong. It is illegal. And it is dangerous.""

Over nine hours the Democrats methodically dismantled Republican claims that Trump did nothing wrong.

They left few doubts that Trump's sole motivation in secretly freezing aid to Ukraine last July was to force Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce one investigation into Biden and a second into an unsupported story that Kiev helped Democrats in the 2016 election.

To puncture a key White House argument that the US constitution requires a specific crime to remove a president, they played old videos in which two of Trump's closest defenders, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and storied criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, said that abuse of power itself is a clear impeachable offense.

And they detailed the extensive role of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the scheme to pressure Zelensky, even while US intelligence and diplomatic chiefs disagreed with it.

""Donald Trump chose Rudy Giuliani over his own intelligence agencies. He chose Rudy Giuliani over his own national security advisors... That makes him dangerous to our country,"" said Schiff, who leads the House Intelligence Committee.

Yet, three days into arguments into the historic trial, there were few signs that any of the Republican majority that Trump commands in the Senate would buy into the evidence and turn against him.

""What we heard from the managers yesterday, the day before, it is the same thing, day after day after day,"" said Republican Senator John Barrasso.

""We're hearing the same things over and over,"" said Trump attorney Jay Sekulow. ""We will be putting on vigorous defense of both facts and rebutting what they've said.""

At the White House, Trump unleashed a barrage of tweets attacking the process as ""loaded with lies and misrepresentations."" ""Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!"" he tweeted Democratic prosecutors will complete their arguments Friday with a focus on the second impeachment charge, obstruction of Congress, before Trump's legal team holds the floor in his defense for three days.

Democrats are hoping their arguments will at least persuade some Republicans, who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, to support their call to issue subpoenas next week for four top current and former Trump aides to testify, and for internal White House records about the Ukraine affair.

But all indications were that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in coordination with the White House, will seek to stifle witness requests and bring the trial to a close with a vote to acquit Trump by the end of next week.

Both Trump and McConnell said early this week that the White House could claim executive privilege to refuse the subpoenas, forcing a court challenge that could prolong the case well into February.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump--should-be-removed---impeachment-trial-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump--should-be-removed---impeachment-trial.html

""Salman sir just asked me if I would like to do the film. I said yes. There is a reason why I chose to do the film, besides the fact that it had Salman sir and it was directed by Prabhu Dheva sir. It has to do with the story and my character,"" Disha told PTI.

In Ali Abbas Zafar's ""Bharat"", Disha played young Salman's love interest. Their on-screen chemistry and song 'Slow Motion' was a hit.

Disha said, while she enjoys acting opposite Salman, she finds his aura intimidating. ""He is a star. He has this aura around him. But he is very sweet. I respect him a lot. I am still intimidated working with him. During 'Bharat' I was not intimidated on-screen but off-screen I was. In my mind I was. But you have to keep everything aside when the director says action, after the cut I was intimidated again,"" she added.

Also starring Randeep Hooda and Jackie Shroff, ""Radhe..."" will release on Eid this year.

Disha is currently gearing up for her next movie, ""Malang"", in which she features alongside Aditya Roy Kapur, Anil Kapoor and Kunal Kemmu.

The film is scheduled to be released on February 7.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/signed--radhe--for-story-and-my-character--disha-patani-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/signed--radhe--for-story-and-my-character--disha-patani.html

254,24-1-20,Amazon asks judge to block Microsoft from Pentagon project,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), the retail giant's Cloud arm, has asked a US judge to force a stay of work on Microsoft's $10 billion Cloud contract until the court can rule on Amazon's protest over the Pentagon awarding JEDI to Microsoft.

Amazon had sought 'preliminary injunction' from the court to temporarily block Microsoft from starting work on the billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project.

In a statement shared with Fast Company, an AWS spokesperson said that it is common practice to stay contract performance while a protest is pending.

""It's important that the numerous evaluation errors and blatant political interference that impacted the JEDI award decision be reviewed. AWS is absolutely committed to supporting the DoD's modernisation efforts and to an expeditious legal process that resolves this matter as quickly as possible,' the spokesperson added.

Amazon filed a motion asking a federal judge to block Microsoft from working on any substantive tasks for the JEDI project while the court considers the matter. The motion makes good on Amazon's previous pledge to try to pause work on the contract while the legal challenge is underway.

Amazon last year filed a suit with the US Court of Federal Claims contesting the decision.

""AWS is absolutely committed to supporting the Department of Defense (DoD's) modernisation efforts and to an expeditious legal process that resolves this matter as quickly as possible,"" the AWS spokesperson said.

Microsoft is set to start its work on JEDI Cloud contract from February 11.

The US government in October awarded the much-anticipated $10 billion Cloud contract for Pentagon to Microsoft.

In its complaint against the government decision, Amazon alleged Trump abused his position to put ""improper pressure"" on decision-makers for personal gains and show his hatred towards Bezos who owns The Washington Post.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/amazon-asks-judge-to-block-microsoft-from-pentagon-project-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/amazon-asks-judge-to-block-microsoft-from-pentagon-project.html

256,24-1-20,5 in first T20 against India,"Colin Munro and skipper Kane Williamson smashed quickfire half-centuries as New Zealand made good use of the short boundaries at Eden Park to post 203 for five in the opening T20 against India here on Friday.

Munro scored 59 off 42 balls, including six fours and two sixes, while Williamson hit four fours and four sixes in his 26-ball 51-run innings as the Black Caps' made good use of the peculiar Eden Park shape to pile on the runs.

Ross Taylor too smacked 54 not out off 27 balls as Indian bowlers suffered from the onslaught. Only Jasprit Bumrah (1-31) put in a good shift with clever change of pace and control.

This was after India won the toss and opted to bowl. The visitors went with a six-bowler configuration including all-rounders Shivam Dube and Ravindra Jadeja. Yuzvendra Chahal replaced Kuldeep Yadav, while Shardul Thakur was picked ahead of Navdeen Saini. Rishabh Pant was dropped.

New Zealand quickly got off the blocks with openers Munro and Martin Guptill (30 off 19 balls) putting on 68-0 in the power play. It was the highest power play score for New Zealand against India in T20Is (previous best 66-0 in 2019).

Shardul Thakur (1-44) and Mohammed Shami (0-53) proved to be expensive in their opening spells. India were forced to use as many as six bowlers in the first eight overs.

Dube (1-24) got the breakthrough with Rohit Sharma catching smartly to dismiss Guptill. It brought Williamson to the crease and the onslaught continued as he put on 36 off 24 balls with Munro.

The latter reached his half-century off 36 balls before holing out off Thakur. India quickly got a second wicket in the space of four balls with Ravindra Jadeja (1-18) dismissing Colin de Grandhomme (0).

New Zealand, at 117-3 in the 13th over, were placed awkwardly but Williamson and Taylor put on 61 off 28 balls to completely decimate the Indian bowling in the second half of their innings.

Taylor smashed three fours and three sixes, taking 22 runs off Shami in the 16th over, as he raced to a 25-ball half-century. It was his first T20I half-century in six years.

Williamson too completed his half-century off 25 balls. Their 50-run partnership had come off just 24 balls before Williamson was dismissed off Chahal (1-32).

Taylor then applied the finishing touches as New Zealand breached 200 in the final over.

Worryingly for India, Bumrah rolled over his left ankle in the 20th over during follow-through and was down in pain. But he recovered sufficiently to deliver the last four deliveries.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-zealand-post-203-5-against-india-in-first-t20i-2020-01-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/new-zealand-smash-203-5-in-first-t20-against-india.html
257,24-1-20,"1st T20I: Iyer fireworks, Rahul onslaught give India six-wicket win over New Zealand","The immensely talented Shreyas Iyer enhanced his reputation of a finisher with a scintillating 29-ball-58 as India crushed New Zealand by six wickets in a high-scoring first T20 International here on Friday.

Iyer built on KL Rahul's (56 off 27 balls) blazing start and Virat Kohli's useful 45 off 32 balls as India made short work of a 204-run target, knocking it off with an over to spare.

Credit should be given to Indian bowlers for restricting New Zealand towards the end considering the dimensions of the Eden Park.

Earlier, Colin Munro and Kane Williamson had smashed quick-fire half-centuries as New Zealand scored 203-5.

In pursuit of 204, India lost Rohit Sharma (7) early in the second over as he played one too many shots in a bid to go after spinner Mitchell Santner (1-50).

Rahul and Kohli then took charge of the innings with an 80-run partnership coming off only 47 balls. The duo launched a good array of strokes with seven fours and four sixes between them as New Zealand struggled to contain the runs.

India crossed 100 in the ninth over thanks to their whirlwind partnership, albeit both had chances. Rahul survived a mix-up as New Zealand failed to hit the stumps twice, and then Ish Sodhi dropped a sitter off Kohli.

Continuing his fine form, Rahul notched up his half-century off 23 balls while Kohli fell short of his landmark by just five runs. Together, they provided the base for India's middle order to finish the chase.

The Black Caps roared back into contention with a double blow. First, Rahul was out caught off Sodhi in the 10th over and then seven balls later, Martin Guptill pulled off a screamer at deep mid wicket to send back Kohli.

India lost their set batsmen for six runs and their ploy to send Shivam Dube (13) up the order only had limited success. Dube and Iyer added 21 runs to provide some acceleration, before the all-rounder was Sodhi's second dismissal of the night.

Iyer then took charge of proceedings as he smacked five fours and three sixes to propel India to victory. He added 50 off 29 balls with Manish Pandey, who hit 14 not out off 12 balls with a six.

It was an immaculate display by the young batsman who showed the benefits of reaping experience batting in the middle order and perhaps answering India's questions regarding the number four situation.

This was after Munro, Williamson and Ross Taylor (54 not out off 27 balls) made the Indian bowlers suffer. Jasprit Bumrah (1-31) put in a good shift with clever change of pace and control.

Also Yuzvendra Chahal (1/32 in 4 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (1/18 in 2 overs) kept a check on the run-flow during the back-end.

Munro scored 59 off 42 balls, including six fours and two sixes, while Williamson hit four fours and four sixes in his 26-ball 51-run innings as the Black Caps' made good use of the peculiar Eden Park shape to pile on the runs.
