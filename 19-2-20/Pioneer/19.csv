0,19-2-20,Use AI to fight pandemics,"The Coronavirus outbreak has called into question the ability of governments in predicting, containing and even preventing epidemics. AI and big data can be the answer

In 2019, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board said that the world was not prepared for the next big pandemic, which could potentially spread between continents in 36 hours and kill up to 80 million people. It pointed out that the climate crisis, global migration and humanitarian conflicts were all breeding grounds for newer outbreaks. The Coronavirus took us by surprise, simultaneously pointing out that systems of the past decade might not be effective in tackling challenges that are taking novel shapes and forms. With one of the largest populations and widening socio-economic divides, India is vulnerable to contagions. Experts claim that this susceptibility hasn’t changed much in the last 100 years, when India was one of the countries worst hit by the Spanish Influenza in 1918. We have been struggling to contain influenza and encephalitis outbreaks for the last four decades. There is a pressing need to overhaul how we respond to outbreaks, both globally and in India, keeping technology at the centre. Coronavirus’ example itself shows that it was two Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled enterprises, BlueDot and Metabiota, that provided the key and life-saving insights into the containment of this viral eruption. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), BlueDot sifts through and analyses over 10,000 articles in 65 languages, including foreign news reports, plants and animal disease networks and official proclamations, to issue warnings. It was able to catch and warn about the impending outbreak days before the official announcement was made. Similarly, Metabiota applied AI to the used travel itineraries and flight patterns to determine the likely spread of the disease. It was accurate insofar as it predicted that South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand had the highest risk of the viral outbreak.

AI for comprehensive disease surveillance: As epidemics spread in phases from introduction to amplification and finally contained transmission, the response and sequence of interventions flow accordingly. Even before diseases erupt, a public health system attempts to anticipate new and re-emerging disease through early detection. Thereafter, the response strategy changes to containment, control and mitigation, followed by re-focus on eradication. Creating a technology-based intervention into pandemic management also needs to consider the response strategies commensurate with the stage of epidemical evolution.

However, technologies have a critical and more successful role to play in some phases of the response cycle as opposed to others. One such is prediction and early warnings, for which integrated disease surveillance programmes exist both in the public and private sectors. These surveillance strategies include Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) and Risk Modelling. EBS systems use unstructured data from multiple sources like internet, official reports, social media and so on, to detect and trace the evidence of an emerging threat and overlay it with traditional surveillance systems to issue public health warnings and formulate mitigation strategies. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), and HealthMap, an automated electronic information system, are EBS tools that use NLP, text processing algorithms and Machine Learning (ML). These can increase the speed of identifying signs, filtering information, enhance capacity for consuming information and increase accuracy manifold.

The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), Medical Information System (MedISys) and Pattern-based Understanding and Learning System (PULS) are similar EBS tools. These systems are proving absolutely essential in disseminating information at breakneck speed, characterising transmissibility patterns, contagiousness, illnesses and deaths caused by the pathogen, aiding quicker emergency response. Risk modelling uses statistical tools to characterise and identify factors in populations or individuals that enhance their vulnerabilities to contracting a particular disease. Overlaying this data with open source internet data and climate data accounting for presence, distribution and movement of pathogens can help identify correlations that were invisible to us before. For example, in China, the cases of hand, foot and mouth disease in children were best predicted by AI models that utilised data on weekly temperature and precipitation as well as data on disease-related queries from the Chinese Baidu search engine.

Compared to these, India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) uses manual surveillance, where data on some 24 epidemic-prone diseases is collected on a weekly basis at the primary health centre level and reported upwards. Whenever there is a rising trend of illnesses in any area, it is investigated by the Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to diagnose and control the outbreak. This system is slow and doesn’t use any risk modelling for predictions. A study by the Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad in 2016 pointed out that this procedure suffered a time lag from anything between three to 64 days.

The Media Scanning and Verification Cell of the IDSP was established in 2008 for early warning signals through media reports. However, this activity is limited to manually scanning newspapers/electronic media. Some technologically-adept States use Google alerts to automate the process. Needless to say, State media verification cells are unable to exhaustively scan all media sources with the swiftness that’s needed to respond to outbreaks. The Health Ministry is piloting an Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) that can enable near real-time data reporting and hopes to apply modelling and GIS tools to enhance the IDSP. There exists immense scope for integrating emerging technologies within the IHIP platform. But at present these discussions are nascent.

Focussing on holistic pandemic management: While most technology applications in pandemic response are limited to surveillance, there is a dire need to identify intervention areas in overall pandemic management. AI can not only help us predict where the disease might be travelling to, but it can also offer insights into how people take up health services during emergencies. Accounting for health-seeking behaviours in designing response strategies can substantially boost effectiveness and success of responses.

Learning from behavioural data, ML models can identify less obvious patterns in human behaviour and disease transmission, which could enable a targetted response. This is called infodemiology, where you can integrate internet data into public health informatics to examine individual health-seeking patterns during emergencies. Google Trends Data as well as more-specific Google Dengue Trends have also been used by researchers to develop a holistic understanding of behavioural aspects of citizen response to pandemics. Such insights can be used to determine where health services are imperative to be delivered in times of shortages that mandate trade-offs. In a more mature system, one would also be able to determine if an individual or a group of people is likely to change its location, go out and seek formal assistance, or if they will adhere to treatment routines — all insights that can help authorities make better decisions.

AI-assisted genomics research is slowly emerging to be a game changer in the rapid development of treatments and vaccines for contemporary infections. Baidu has developed an algorithm that can significantly speed up RNA structure prediction and subsequently unlock the key to the virus. Developing models that can match patterns embedded in the viral genomes to their animal host and vectors that carry the virus can be a breakthrough in narrowing the search for diseases. This can lead to early interventions in controlling disease upsurge or preventing their emergence altogether.

Building blocks for AI in pandemic response: Building a comprehensive and accurate surveillance system requires massive amounts of quality data from different sources. Meteorological data, for instance, needs to be overlaid with vector-movements and population mobility data to accurately identify hotspots for outbreaks. This requires Government departments coming together in mission-mode and pooling their data into one consolidated programme. It also requires AI-enabled technologies to be integrated into existing workflows for pandemic management and creation of new protocols with adequate capacity-building, so its benefits can flow to all levels.

As pandemics are not constrained by national boundaries, a global surveillance system is imperative, something where multilaterals like the WHO and international foundations can play a catalytic role. Nations need to be propelled to make disease information public and if possible move towards interoperable surveillance networks that can communicate with their global counterparts.

Can AI fight the next Coronavirus is a question up for debate. But it can bolster our capacity to respond substantially, especially in disease pre-emption, design of accurate interventions and in some cases with more research investment, even prevention of outbreaks.

Therefore, in a fight against outbreaks — one that the global community is not winning — channelising the power of data through AI can be the perfect weapon. Coronavirus and the swiftness that AI-enabled solutions showed here were necessary proof of the concept to incentivise greater resources and collaborations in AI-assisted outbreak management. Now it is upon governments and multilaterals to lead the way in mobilising AI against the next virus.

1,19-2-20,Total debt likely to 28.8 per cent of SGDP in 2020-21,"The debt burden on the state government is mounting and the total debt on it from different sources is likely to be over Rs 5.16 lakh crore by the end of next fiscal 2020-21. The budget size of 2020-21 at Rs 5.12 lakh crore is a little less than the debt burden. The total debt of the state, however, came down from 29.6 percent of State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) in 2017-18 and is estimated to be 28.8 per cent in 2020-21.

With a debt burden of over Rs 5.16 lakh crore, every resident of UP has a debt of Rs 22,442 on their head.

“The debt per person in the state during the 2019-20 fiscal is estimated to be Rs 20,702 as the total debt burden would be little over Rs 4.76 lakh crores,’’ Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said while tabling the budget for 2020-21 in the Assembly on Tuesday.

The total debt burden does not include borrowings from banks and financial institutions by PSUs like UP Power Corporation, UP Housing and Development Board and Urban Development authorities. The state government is the guarantor against the borrowings by the PSUs.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in his post-budget press, said that the government has strictly adhered to financial discipline and norms under FRBM (Financial Responsibility and Budget Management Act ) and kept fiscal deficit under 3 per cent of SGDP.

In 2018-19, the debt per person was around Rs 19,239 with a total loan of Rs 4.42 lakh crore and was around Rs 18,476 in 2017-18, when the total debt on the state was Rs 4,064 lakh crore.

Thus, after BJP took over in 2017 and with infrastructure development being focused within a year, each citizen’s debt rose by Rs 1,676.

With a population touching 230 million, the state’s debt burden was hovering around 28 per cent to 30 per cent of the State Gross Domestic Product (GSDP).

Of the total fresh borrowings by the state government during 2020-21, the highest would be market borrowing at Rs 32,346 crore, 18.1per cent of the total loans. The UP government was also expecting loan of Rs 11,815 crore from the Centre, Rs 19,368 crore from financial institutions and Rs 42,277 crore from power bonds.

As per budget statistics, total receipts of the state are estimated at Rs 5,0055 lakh crore, of which 33 per cent would come from state taxes, 30.4 per cent from state share in Central taxes and 14.4 per cent from Central assistance. It will also collect 13.1 per cent of revenue from public loans.

With a total expenditure of Rs 5.12 lakh crore, the highest 37.1 per cent will be spent for payment of wages, pension and allowances to government employees and aided educational institutions and pension. The state will also spend a little over 16 per cent for repayment of loan, while 16.1 per cent will be spent on capital expenditure. The government will also pay 3.3 per cent of its expenditure on subsidy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/total-debt-likely----to-28-8-per-cent-of----sgdp-in-2020-21.html
2,19-2-20,Budget focuses on employment of youths: Yogi,"After the budget for 2020-21 was presented in the UP Assembly on Tuesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said it focuses on employment of youths and centres will be opened in each district for self-employment programmes.

The government had earlier launched apprenticeship scheme for educated youths, enabling them for self-employment. The Chief Minister said that the 2020-21 budget will play a major role in achieving the goal of making the state a one trillion US dollar economy to meet the target of India aspiring for a US 5-trillion economy.

Addressing the post-budget presser, Yogi said that a number of schemes were already in place for youths and the government launched scheme for every educated unemployed.

A provision was also made in the budget to boost employment in every district to enhance overall development of the state. Yogi said that his government’s first budget had focused on the farm sector, the second on promoting infrastructure & industrial development, the third for women empowerment, and the focus of the fourth budget is on development of youths by enabling them for self-employment with an aim to unleash the potential of Uttar Pradesh.

The Chief Minister said that arrangements have also been made in the budget to strengthen education in the state. There are provisions to set up Atal University in Lucknow for medical education and for modernisation of UP Police.

Yogi said that by next year, the governemnt will be able to carry forward the work of setting up a medical college in all 75 districts of the state, which will be built either by the state or in PPP mode.

The CM said that only 12 medical colleges were established between 1947 and 2016 in Uttar Pradesh but in the last three years, the proces of opening 28 new medical colleges was underway.

Yogi said that every investor of the world wanted to invest in UP and the state received proposals for investment of Rs 50,000 crore in the recently concluded Defence Expo-2020.

The CM further said that Purvanchal Expressway will be opened for public by the end of 2020 and the foundation of Bundelkhand Expressway will be laid this month.

Funds have been allocated for Ganga Expressway linking Meerut with Prayagraj and efforts will be made to lay the foundation of Ganga Expressway by the end of this year.

Yogi said that the budget focuses on higher education to make UP as the focal point of education, and thus the government is setting up new universities in Saharanpur, Azamgarh, and Aligarh besides setting up Atal Medical University in Lucknow. Budgetary provisions have been made for National Law University and Ayush University.

The Chief Minister said that keeping in view the farmers of the state, provisions have been made for sharecroppers in the budget and Kisan Insurance will also be provided to them.

He said that the government’s priority is to address the problem of potable water in Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions. Besides, a provision has also been made for maintenance of cow sheds for stray cattle and to set up new cow shelters.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/budget-focuses----on-employment----of-youths--yogi.html
3,19-2-20,10% job quota for economically weaker section in general category,"With an aim to provide relief to economically weaker section among general category, the state government has decided to extend 10 per cent reservation in government jobs for those entitled with retrospective effect from February 11, 2019. It was announced after a cabinet meeting in Lucknow on Tuesday.

A government source said that a bill will be brought during the ongoing Budget session and will be made an act after being promulgated by the Governor.

“The Government of India has made an Act under which poor among general category were entitled to 10 per cent reservation in state-run educational institutions. The state government extended the same in such institutions from February 18, 2019. Now, the government has decided to provide reservation benefits to the poor among general category in jobs,” an official said.

“As per guidelines, any person whose annual family income (including agriculture and wages) is less than Rs 8 lakh will be entitled for this benefit. Those people or families who own 5 acre or more farm land, 1000 ft or more residential land or have a house measuring 200 yards in municipal area will not be entitled for this benefit,” the official said.

In another decision, the government made an amendment to UP Krishi Mandi Parishad Act, wherein cess for charitable organisations was increased from 2 to 4 per cent. This was done to ensure better upkeep of stray cattle. The organisations willing to take care of stray cattle will be benefitted,” the official said.

The state cabinet also approved a decision to improve infrastructure in office of Police Commissioner in Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida) and instructed Noida Development Authority to provide Rs 76.96 lakh.

In another decision, the government amended Rajya Sampati Act allowing chairmen for different state-run corporations and different organisations, advisors and vice-chairmen of different organisations for government accommodation.

The government also approved Rs 28460.53 lakh for construction of a paediatric (children’s) ward in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, and allotted Rs 17,537.42 lakh as scholarship money for students of Backward caste.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/10--job-quota-for----economically-weaker----section-in-general----category.html
4,19-2-20,Six killed in mishap on Lucknow-Agra Expressway,"Within 24 hours of seven van occupants being charred to death in a mishap on Taj Expressway, six more were killed and several others injured when their SUV was hit by a Bihar government bus on Lucknow-Agra Expressway in the wee hours of Tuesday.

As per reports, the SUV heading to Agra from Lucknow was knocked by a Bihar-bound bus which jumped the divider coming from the opposite direction in Bilhaur police station area in Bangarmau. The police said that the bus driver lost control of the vehicle. The bus carrying 40 passengers from Ghaziabad first hit the SUV and then hurtled down the service lane.

While all five occupants of the SUV died on the spot, the bus driver also died and around 15 bus passengers were injured.

Those in the SUV were identified as Sunni (35), Mukesh (40), Ram Shanker (45), Surjeet (33). The bus driver was yet to be identified. The SUV was registered in the name of Sunita Singh of Delhi.

The police said that the impact was such that even after air bags of the SUV opened, the occupants could not be saved. The injured were rushed to hospital by highway police.

Meanwhile, in Basti, a leading cloth merchant of Gorakhpur, his wife and another person were killed while the couple’s son was injured in a mishap on Monday night.

Prem Jalan of Basharatpur in Gorakhpur was returning with his wife Vidya and son Rishabh from Lucknow in a car on Monday night. While they were crossing Baburhawa hamlet in Basti, a motorcyclist going ahead suddenly applied brakes. As a result, Prem lost control of the car which hit the motorcyclist before plouging into a tractor-trolley.

The injured were rushed to a hospital where Prem Jalan, his wife Vidya and the motorcyclist, identified as Ranjeet of Basti, were declared dead.

The couple were preparing for a grand birthday bash of Rishabh on February 22 and Prem Jalan had also uploaded a post on social media wishing his son in advance. Prem’s elder daughter Nandani is an undergradutae student in New Delhi.

In another accident, two persons were killed while half-a-dozen others injured in Mainpuri early Tuesday morning. Rajneesh aka Amit (32) of Dhamiyapur in Mainpuri used to work in Gurugram. On Monday night, he left in a car with his kin to reach Mainpuri.

The car was being driven by Amit’s cousin Abhisekh (27). Around 3:30 am on Tuesday, while they were passing through Sanjay College on Delhi-Agra highway, the car rammed into a tanker. Amit and Abhisekh’s wife Priyanka (25) died while Abhisek, his son Yuvraj (2), daughter Ashunka (5), kin Asha and Asha’s son Anil were injured.

6,19-2-20,Global economic scenario is changing fast: CM,"Former Deputy Chairman of the erstwhilePlanning Commission, MS Ahluwalia, stressed the need for considering rewriting the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in the changing contexts in view of the increasing financial needs and fiscal limitations of States. There is a need for enacting a law for public-private partnership to overcome the budget constraints for socially important economic infrastructure projects, he added. He was addressing a workshop organised by the Finance Department on the subject of “Alternative Finance for Projects” at the local Minto Hall here on Tuesday.

Addressing the workshop, the Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that the global economic scenario is changing rapidly. Therefore, the financial institutions and the Governments also need to change their thought-process. He said that in a vast country like India that has largest society of aspirational youth, increased budget resources are required to fulfill their ambitions. He said that it is becoming challenging to mobilise financial resources for the changed and constantly changing India and its States.

Therefore, banks, State Governments and private sector institutions need to adopt the change. He laid stress on deviating from the process of conventional budget making process and working on alternative processes and innovative ideas. He said that it has become necessary to focus attention on the economic activities that generate jobs. The Chief Minister said that the budget resources mobilisation of many countries is excellent even without laws like fiscal responsibility and budget management. He said that there is a reduction of Rs 14,000 crores in Madhya Pradesh's share in the Union Budget. He emphasised on having a new vision and fresh approach to managing budget resources and improving governance.

Ahluwalia said that designing projects, making budget provisions for them and completing them within available resources is a common practice across the world. The fact is that governments have limited financial resources for ambitious projects. The Governments have many tasks, responsibilities, priorities and social obligations apart from economic infrastructure projects. There are many challenges in completing them simultaneously.

As a result, the speed of projects slows down and they start lagging behind. He said that there is a need to think beyond the conventional approach of depending on budgetary resources. In such a situation, States look towards the private sector for assistance. The private sector is fearful of risks and threats while the governments are bound by the welfare principles beyond the loss and profit. Both have their limitations.

Therefore, there is a need for a law to work in cooperation between the two.

Ahluwalia said that instead of managing finances for large economic infrastructural projects, the system of providing guarantee by the state should also be considered.

The Governments should assume the role of a friend in managing the financial risks for the projects. For example, in order to deal with the ill effects of climate change, infrastructure projects of economic importance should be given a guarantee. These may include irrigation and water conservation projects. He said that considering the density of forest resources, Madhya Pradesh can raise budget resources on its basis. This process can also be adopted for sector-specific dedicated infrastructure projects.

Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot gave welcome address. The Chief Secretary SR Mohanty said that Madhya Pradesh is not new to innovative practice of mobilising budget resources.

The BOT road projects and Rogi Kalyan Samitis for hospital management are the best examples.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/global-economic-scenario-is-changing-fast--cm.html
7,19-2-20,‘Letter of intent signed for ensuring child rights’,"Devi Ahilya VishwaVidyalaya, Indore and UNICEF signed a letter of intent to work together on child rights and move forward for inclusion of child rights in media studies and its curriculum. It will work with students and media professionals to increase media discourse on child rights with focus on nutrition, new born care, child protection and immunisation.

This was signed on Tuesday at the office of Vice Chancellor of DAVV Prof Renu Jain, who thanked UNICEF for this partnership and said that this will go long way in promoting children issues and contribute in social development. She said University students and departments will move forward to include child rights, and also get our students to do projects on children as part of their field work.

Anil Sharma, Registrar of DAVV and Michael Juma, Chief UNICEF Madhya Pradesh jointly signed the letter of Intent. Michael Juma, Chief UNICEF Madhya Pradesh said that 'This strategic partnership between DAVV University and UNICEF provides an enabling platform for not only initiating child rights course at the school of media studies, but also provides a structured framework for mutual collaboration in research, result based management, knowledge management, evidence generation, evaluation and process documentation in pursuit to advance child rights.

It also aims at creating a pool of human resources cadre with vast knowledge of the UN Convention on child rights and their practical application.

Dr Sonali Nargunde, Head of Department of School of Journalism and Mass communication, Anil Gulati Communication Specialist, UNICEF, Sujan Sarkar, Planning Monitoring Officer UNICEF were also present at the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---letter-of-intent-signed-for-ensuring-child-rights---.html
8,19-2-20,What lies ahead for social sector,"As India will be home to the largest working population in the world by 2030, health and education are key areas it must focus on

At the start of the new decade, the much-awaited Budget 2020-21 set the tone for the year ahead. With the core themes of “Aspirational India”, “Economic Development” and “Caring Society”, health and education feature as cross-cutting elements, critical for driving inclusive growth. As a prelude to the New Education Policy, the Budget had some key announcements on higher education, in particular. First, leveraging the triple helix model of innovation and ensuring greater university-Government-industry linkage, 150 institutes will initiate apprenticeship-embedded courses by next year. As India stands at the threshold of the fourth Industrial Revolution, this move will facilitate the generation of a skilled workforce, ready to be absorbed by the industry.

Second, in a novel step to promote greater access, the Budget also announced that the top 100 institutes in the National Institute Ranking Framework will launch exclusive online education programmes. Third, diversifying the options for further study, it proposes the establishment of a National Forensic University, offering courses on niche aspects such as cyber-forensics. While these are steps in the right direction, we must be cognisant of the sheer scale of the education ecosystem. India has around 25 crore children in over 15 lakh schools, while at the higher education level there are about 3.7 crore students in 41,000 institutes. To ensure the delivery of quality education across this landscape, an emphasis on early childhood education and foundational learning is critical. Beyond the Budget, we need a nationwide call to action for a sustained effort on knowledge enhancement to enable foundational learning for all. Further, while the financial allocation to education has increased by 4.7 per cent, it falls short of the recommended level of investment at six per cent of the GDP. Opening up the sector to External Commercial Borrowings and Foreign Direct Investment may serve as an avenue for increased spending in it. Any enhancement in expenditure, of course, must be targetted at driving improvements in quality education, in sync with the need to shift the policy focus away from input and access metrics.

On health, the Budget provides an additional Rs 69,000 crore. However, there is still some way to go before the 2017 National Health Policy’s (NHP’s) goal of raising public health spending to 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2024-25, is achieved. Of course States, too, need to ramp up spending on health as they account for 64.4 per cent of the total Government health expenditure.

A key Budget announcement was setting up of hospitals in Tier- 2 and Tier-3 cities in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode to boost the supply of health services under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, through a viability gap funding mechanism. The scheme has been fairly successful since its launch in September 2018, reaching out to over 80 lakh patients across more than 20,000 hospitals. Although the budgetary allocation for Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs), the second pillar of Ayushman Bharat, has not been enhanced, it is crucial that these Centres are operationalised in a timely manner, providing screening for non-communicable diseases in addition to reproductive, maternal and child health interventions.

Focussing on human resources is critical, not just for the health sector but also for the broader economy, given the sector’s significant job-creation potential. Recognising the shortfall of medical personnel, the Budget emphasises the need for attaching medical colleges to district hospitals in PPP mode.

Furthermore, a push was made on integrating Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Ayushman Bharat. AI can offer an unbiased second opinion on diagnosis, treatment modalities, potential risks and predicted outcomes as well as enable health personnel to identify dormant signs of diseases. The announcement of a national-level scheme to map India’s genetic landscape is another crucial move given that the answer to many diseases and their treatment, at least partly, lies in our genes. On social determinants of health, the Budget increased the allocation for nutrition-related programmes by 25 per cent and also committed to implementing the necessary steps for sustaining behaviour change in sanitation and focussing on waste management.

Overall, Budget 2020-21 included some noteworthy announcements for social sectors. However, there is much more that needs to be done if India is to truly harness the potential of its human capital for boosting economic growth. As India will be home to the largest working population in the world by 2030, health and education are key for reaping the benefits of the much talked about demographic dividend. Of course, the Union Budget is only one instrument for achieving this and much of the action, in terms of increased spending on social sectors as well as quality implementation at scale, lies in States, thus necessitating ongoing coordination between the Centre and States.

9,19-2-20,Don’t write the Congress off yet,"It was an umbrella party at one time giving space to all shades of opinions and ideologies — the Right, Left and the Centre — and despite many splits it has survived so far. So there is no reason why it cannot do so in the future

Many people are writing off the 135-year-old Congress Party after its dismal performance in the just-concluded Delhi Assembly elections. This is because the grand old party has suffered one setback after the other since 2014, though there were some good patches in between. Now, critical questions are being raised over its survival that need to be answered by Congressmen. This is not the first time that the party is facing such a crisis. In its long history, the Congress has been written off many times by its opponents. However, every time it rose like a phoenix from the ashes and came back to power.

The slide began in 1967 when the party lost many States. After the 1969 split, Indira Gandhi emerged successful in the 1971 mid-term poll. However, after the defeat of Indira in 1977, the party was written off. But it rallied again in 1980 and continued to rule till 1989. After VP Singh challenged Rajiv Gandhi in 1989, there were apprehensions about the Congress’ survival but in 1991 the party came back to power at the head of a coalition, though it could not retain power for long.

In 1998, Sonia Gandhi took over the Congress amid panic in the party that it would perish. When no one expected the Sonia-led Congress to succeed, she formed the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and captured power in 2004. After 10 years of the UPA’s rule, the party faced its worst-ever humiliation when it got just 44 seats in 2014 and 52 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Now, once again, the Congress is being written off. No doubt the party is going through one of its worst existential and leadership crises right now. Thankfully, the Congress has always performed well in States where regional strongmen were given the job of handling the elections. The Maharashtra and Haryana polls proved this fact in recent times. That said, is that enough for the party to remain relevant? From ruling the Centre and a majority of States in the ‘60s and ‘70s, the Congress has now been pushed into a corner with its governments in a measly five States. When the Narendra Modi Government stormed to power in 2014, many thought that the Congress would eventually recover but it has only declined further as it had failed to gauge the mood of the public and turn it into electoral success. Last year’s electoral victories in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh apart, the Congress has witnessed gradual decay in its State units in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi. Today, the Congress is ruthlessly criticised and mocked because of its determination to cling to the Nehru-Gandhi family.

The BJP has vowed to create a “Congress-mukt Bharat” but an Opposition is not bad, even for the ruling party in a democracy, as the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to say. One party rule is not what our founding fathers visualised. Some analysts argue that the collapse of the Congress as a national alternative to the BJP creates a political vacuum. It is not as if there is no base for the Congress despite the slide, as it is the only party, apart from the BJP, with a national presence. Even in its worst defeat the Congress managed to get 19.6 per cent of the national vote; about 117 million people voted for it in 2019. It must build on this base.

The decline of the Congress is of its own making. Its dependence on one family, its high command and coterie culture, loss of connect with grassroot workers, lack of an organisational structure, poor communication skills, disconnect with the aspirations of voters and living in its past glory, have all led to its downfall. Moreover, the BJP has emerged as an alternative to the Congress at the national level, while in some States the regional satraps have usurped the Congress’ space. Since the party refuses to move out from under the shadow of the Gandhis, it is for the family to fill the leadership vacuum and fight to get back its political space. They must find the right formula to do this, fast.

It is too soon to write an obituary of the Congress. The grand old party is like an ancient banyan tree. Its roots are deep and in many States. All that the Congress needs is a charismatic leader and a vote catcher who could reinvent and revive the party. Did not the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reinvent the Labour party and called it the New Labour?

It is time the Congress wakes up, defines its ideology, strengthens State units, faces the challenge of regionalism and reclaims its lost space. It was an umbrella party at one time giving space to all shades of opinions and ideologies — the Right, Left and the Centre — and despite many splits it has survived so far. So there is no reason why it cannot do so in the future.

10,19-2-20,"Now, a green fund","The Finance Commission must be lauded for including forest cover in the mix for allocation of tax resources. States must respect this and do their bit in conserving it

One of the keys to improving Centre-State relations and ensuring development is even-handed and judicious distribution of tax revenue and other forms of earning between the federal and State Governments. The Finance Commission of India is a unique constitutional body that is periodically set up under Article 280 of the Constitution to define financial relations between the Central and State Governments. It lays down a set of principles that determines the method and formula for the distribution of tax proceeds between both Governments.

A majority of the taxes such as Customs duty, income tax, service tax and Central excise are collected by the Centre. States were given the mandate to provide economic and social services to the people. They are empowered to levy income tax on agricultural earnings, professional tax, value added tax (VAT), State excise duty, land revenue and stamp duty. Hence, the Finance Commission was created to address issues of vertical and horizontal imbalances of federal finances in India.

The 15th Finance Commission, which was established to decide on the devolution of taxes and other receipts to the Centre and States for the next five years beginning April 2020, submitted its recommendations before the Central Government last December. The Commission used the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations and for the first time, in addition to income distance, population and area and forest cover, it used two additional factors — demographic performance and tax effort — to determine the tax pool of States.

The Commisson’s usage of the 2011 population figures gave rise to considerable controversies. While the 14th Finance Commission had taken the 1971 census as the base with a weightage of 17.5 per cent and assigned a weightage of 10 per cent to the 2011 population figures, the present one has kept the weightage of 2011 population at 15 per cent and has given additional 12.5 per cent to demographic performance. The use of 2011 data has benefitted some States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while others have been disadvantaged.

Most States in southern India, except Tamil Nadu, feel that they are suffering because of their policy of population control. They believe they will get a smaller share of the pie if the population dispensation is applied. However, according to the Economic Survey, 2016, inter-State labour mobility averaged 5-6.5 million people between 2001 and 2011, yielding an inter-State migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million. Apart from the southern States, Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab and West Bengal, too, saw a dip in population compared to the 1971 census. The 15th Finance Commission was critical of the Union and State Governments’ tendency to finance spending through off-budget borrowings, too. On this front, it called upon both to phase out off-budget liabilities.

Irrespective of the surrounding controversies, the Commission made it clear that it wants to play a key role in fostering sustainable development. It must be noted that the 14th Commission had accepted it as a criterion to determine the share of taxes to various States. This is why “forest cover” was assigned 7.5 per cent weightage. The 15th Finance Commission sought to raise the area cover to 10 per cent in order to reward States that have “provided ecological services” to the country.

However, it is distressing that none of the States has been liberal in granting funds to the forest department commensurate to the contribution the forests have made in getting funds. The enhancement of funds to States — from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent — if implemented, can go a long way in protecting the country’s ecological frontiers. This can also lead to the economic well-being of the people and the country and help consolidate forest resources as well.

The importance of the maintenance of forest-like buildings and roads was first recognised by the 13th Finance Commission, which earmarked Rs 1,000 crore and called upon the States to manage ecology, environment and climate change, consistent with sustainable development. This fund was kept at the disposal of the Government of India and was released to States on a project basis. This helped a great deal in maintaining forests across the country.

However, the actual spending on forests by States, after the 14th Finance Commission grants, has not been very encouraging when compared to the intention of the criterion to strengthen forest cover base. The State of Forest Report 2019 released by the Forest Survey of India recorded a marginal increase of 5,188 sq km in total forest and tree cover in the country. However, it gave a dismal picture in tribal areas (where the forest cover has gone down by 741 sq km). With regard to the disappearance of higher girth class trees in forests due to poor regeneration and protection, the report, if examined critically, indicates the urgent need to spend money on natural forests. Yet another important issue that needs to be dealt with is to address the concern of States, which have less forest cover. We need to step up efforts to cover more areas through agroforestry, farm forestry, block plantations, urban and peri-urban forestry among other efforts.

Efficient fiscal management goals of the Commission cannot be achieved unless we have an effective monitoring system in place. The 15th Finance Commission should follow the pattern of the 13th Finance Commission, which recommend inter alia that a portion of the divisible pool of tax within the forest criterion should be retained with the Government of India to be sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance and Environment, Forest and Climate Change, for the maintenance of forests.

It would be appropriate to ensure third-party monitoring of the use of the grant to States so that misuse or arbitrary or unauthorised use of the funds can be checked. Further, for monitoring and evaluation of the works undertaken through the Finance Commission Awards, States should opt for certification of forests. This can help promote sustainable forest management and at the same time provide space for international markets for procurement of forest products.

Further, the Commission should put a complete ban on the freebie culture of politicians, who are more interested in votebank politics. If need be, it must ask the Government to amend the Constitution. The Prime Minister must think about curbing the freebie culture sooner than later. At the same time, the Election Commission must ensure political consensus on this. A group of retired forest officers had sought time from the Chairman of the Finance Commission to submit a memorandum on these issues so that the Commission’s own recommendations lead to desired effects on the country’s economy and on conservation of forests, water and bio-diversity. A forest governance policy must pay attention to the multiple ways in which our green cover is valuable.

11,19-2-20,Message of Shaheen Bagh,"SC appoints mediators for shifting women-led protests on the CAA. Should the Govt not have done this instead?

In the end, the executive abdicated its responsibility and left it to the judiciary to tackle civil unrest in the country that has risen in opposition to its new profile-linked citizenship law. And the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court, had to intervene to settle the issue of moving protesters at Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of a relentless people’s struggle against a law that violates the Constitutional spirit of equality of all religions. Addressing a clutch of petitions against the protesters that were pushed in a surrogate manner, the court did not denounce their stance and upheld what it has before, that citizens have a democratic right to disagree and be heard. But considering the sit-in on a public road had stretched to over two months and was obstructing traffic and public convenience, the court said that the protest site should be relocated to avert a crisis. Yet it did not pare the protesters down with dictated choices of sites but sent in mediators to work out a deal. The Shaheen Bagh women, who have never refused a dialogue, had gone public with their desire to meet the Home Minister and Prime Minister, but it was the Government which did not honour the rules of civil engagement and instead demonised them as enemies of the State. Had it indeed mastered statecraft, it could have made a virtue of the negotiations, used them for explanatory propaganda on the new law and avoided a conflagration that ultimately burnt it badly. Now as many Shaheen Baghs and dissent movements have erupted across the country, will the Government squander away its political mandate as an administrator or create new binaries for electoral politics? Will it be a reconciler of diversity or just the interpreter of societal maladies?

There is nothing wrong with the BJP Government justifying its ideological pitch but when in governance, it cannot be seen as abetting a civil war. Particularly when the women-led protest at Shaheen Bagh swiftly turned into civil society’s spontaneous combustion and powered the Opposition. Primarily because the women of Shaheen Bagh had taken a high moral ground when they started out, reading the Preamble and positing themselves as citizens who shouldn’t be defined by exclusion as opposed to the establishment’s determination to brand them anti-Hindu. As all religions made common cause with them, the BJP turned them into a test case of nationalism, lionising them with its intolerance. So what began as an anti-establishment forum was needlessly elevated to a referendum on whether minority intrusion can disrupt a majority lives — in this case, blockade-hit Delhiites — on whether there was a mini-Pakistan that needs to be surgically cut out from the heart of the city. Clearly, the BJP is solely responsible for terming every democratic disagreement as a treacherous feat, even making its core voter deeply uncomfortable. Yes, the women blocked traffic because that’s the only way they could make people sit up but it was the BJP which gave shelf life to the sit-in, prolonging it for intended political gains, adamant in rejecting overtures and scoring a self-goal by weaponising it for the Delhi Assembly elections. Even the women pointed out that their protest was not a civic issue but a national one and, therefore, were unconcerned about the buzz around them. The Delhi voter, in the end, chose a “doing” Government rather than a “blaming” one. Had the BJP been smart, it could have attempted reconciliation talks. Considering the city-state’s law and order is a Central subject, it could have worked around the traffic mess. By engaging with the women, it would have not only demonstrated seriousness of intent, it could have been seen as an expert negotiator, one who attempted to clear misconceptions around the CAA. Clearly, the Government’s mishandling of Shaheen Bagh has blown up in its face and compelled it to eat humble pie. The Prime Minister had to clarify that CAA “does not affect Indian Muslims” and that there was no talk of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) yet. Home Minister Amit Shah had to simmer down on NRC after declaring in Parliament that every infiltrator would be thrown out and even admit that aggressive and polarising rhetoric had cost the BJP the Delhi election. It’s a different matter though that the National Population Register (NPR) can be used to harvest profile-based data still, something that the civil protest movements are now questioning, too. This has forced the Government to concede that respondents wouldn’t be needed to show any papers. It is in this sense that the Shaheen Bagh protests have been successful compared to other protests before; they have forced a systemic reaction. And with mini protests acquiring gale force, the Modi Government can no longer afford to be in a victim or petitioner mode. It cannot be a denier anymore, it has to seize the discourse. Or be horribly out of sync with what India wants.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/message-of-shaheen-bagh-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/message-of-shaheen-bagh.html
12,19-2-20,Too little to charge,"Let’s not get excited by the discovery of lithium reserves. They are not enough to fuel India’s electric ambitions

The discovery of an estimated reserve of 14,000 tonnes of lithium ore in Mandya, 100 km from Bengaluru, has gotten several people excited. Rightly so, because this metal is one of the key components for Lithium-Ion batteries and is a crucial building block for electric vehicles, which many believe, will be the future of India, indeed for global mobility. But there’s no need to get overly excited about this. In terms of reserves, it is less than half a per cent of the total deposits found in Chile, which along with Bolivia, holds some of the world’s largest stocks of this key material. By some estimates, India will need over a million tonnes of lithium ore in the next two decades to ensure half its vehicle fleet is able to drive on electric vehicle battery. So, 14,000 tonnes of lithium ore cannot even power the electric vehicles that will be needed in Bengaluru and its suburbs alone. This discovery should, however, be used as an opportunity to further mineral exploration. Low on reserves, we have to import minerals and metals worth billions of dollars — crude oil to gold — from nations across the world. We have to become more pro-active in tapping deposits and maximising their potential. This small finding should spur Indian companies and the Government to look for other key resources for the future like rare-earth metals — a sector where China commands a near-global monopoly.

India should also carefully evaluate technologies that can be used to power the future. In mobility, this could involve discussions around hydrogen-based fuel-cell technologies that are less dependent on lithium resources. While hydrogen extraction technologies are currently expensive and energy negative, the dramatic lowering of unit costs of solar and wind energy can allow for sufficient hydrogen generation, which can also use the existing fuel-retail system. India should not become beholden to another set of resource-rich countries. Policy-makers have to be extremely careful about which path the country will take. They must not give in to half-baked ideas by motivated parties. Our bureaucrats and politicians must be very careful and make serious considerations about India’s future because their decisions will decide which path the country will take and the impact it will have in the next five or six decades. We cannot afford to lose more decades as we have already wasted the first two this millennium.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/too-little-to-charge-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/too-little-to-charge.html
13,19-2-20,"Hero MotoCorp unveils new products, announces Rs 10,000 crore investments","Later this year, Hero MotoCorp will unveil the 100 millionth motorcycle to leave one of their production lines. In the 35 years since the Munjal-promoted group has been producing two-wheelers, first in collaboration with Japanese major Honda and then by themselves since 2011, they will become the fastest manufacturer to reach this milestone.

But as questions hover around the future viability of the company as it finds itself with a global technology partner unlike their Indian rivals, Bajaj and TVS, the Chairman and promoter of the company, Pawan Munjal wanted to showcase the future with a display of Hero’s technological and product development competence at their Centre for Innovation and Technology (CIT) established at Kukas, outside Jaipur.

Hero, which skipped the Auto Expo earlier this month also used the opportunity to launch their latest products that all adhere to the upcoming BS-6 emission norms. As the company has seen increased competition over the years and declining sales of their bestsellers, they also launched the new Glamour 125 and Passion Pro as well as showcasing the Xtreme 160R road racer in the fast growing 150-200cc category.

The company wants to regain their leadership position in these segments where Bajaj, TVS and their erstwhile partner Honda dominates. Speaking to The Pioneer, Munjal also mentioned that Hero could look at potential partnerships with either Indian or global ‘frenemy’ companies going forward, and that he was not terribly concerned about the move to electric vehicles, “we are a large investor in Ather Energy, India’s leading electric two-wheeler company with a 31 per cent stake in the company, and we have been helping the company grow. The scooters might not have a ‘Hero’ but that does not mean that Hero is not seriously looking at this area. Our major issue with the Government’s initial plan to move to all-electric vehicles by 2025, which it wisely reconsidered was that the entire infrastructure would be disrupted, from sales channels to mechanics.

The industry could have shifted, but the government has to remember the contribution the automotive industry makes to the Indian economy and think accordingly.” He added that Hero was looking at electric and hybrid technologies for two-wheelers as early as 2012 even before the modern shift to such technologies, “we are a leader in this space in India, just because we do not have a product right now should not be something to be worried about.”

Munjal also said that Hero would invest over Rs 10,000 crore in new plants, research and development and market development over the next five to seven years in order to maintain its leadership. “When we started our solo journey in 2011 we had just 100 engineers doing basic product development in Dharuhera, three plants and exported products to just four countries. Today, we have one of the most advanced R&D centres in the two-wheeler world in Kukas with over 1,000 engineers, products have just started rolling out of our eighth plant in Andhra Pradesh and we have two global factories in Bangladesh and Colombia and we are present in over 40 countries globally. I’m sure our next 100 million will happen a lot faster than our first 100 million.”",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hero-motocorp-unveils-new-products--announces-rs-10-000-crore-investments-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/hero-motocorp-unveils-new-products--announces-rs-10-000-crore-investments.html

17,19-2-20,Suggestions of MLAs to be incorporated in Budget: Haryana CM,"Ahead of Budget Session scheduled from February 19, Haryana Legislators on Tuesday gave their suggestions and inputs on Budget 2020-21 during the ongoing pre-Budget consultation meeting in Panchkula.

While the ruling party MLAs expressed gratitude to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for organising pre-Budget meeting to incorporate their suggestions in the Budget, the opposition Legislators were apparently not much impressed by the idea, especially at a stage when the Budget must have been given final shape.

Taking to reporters, Khattar said, “We consulted different stakeholders including those associated with industry, service sector, agriculture, real estate, women and MPs. During pre-Budget consultation meeting, MLAs have given their suggestions by rising above party lines. We assured them that their viable suggestions would be incorporated in the State Budget.”

Asked about the common minimum programme (CMP) of the BJP-JJP coalition Government, Khattar said both the parties had promised the people through their manifestoes during election and those common would be implemented. ""Some of them have already been implemented. There will be no budget for common minimum programme"", he said.

Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda who was present in the meeting said he attended attended the pre-budget meeting but did not give any suggestion on State’s budget as the current Government has not presented any economic survey. ""I do not know about fund allocation to various departments. I do not know State’s economic condition. Under such circumstances, how can I give my suggestions on State Budget?” he asked.

Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar said that the Government has limited budget so suggestions are needed to draft a good Budget. Legislators’ suggestions would be incorporated, he said, hoping that the Government would increase its Budget on education.

Haryana Minister Banwari Lal said that he suggested the Government to increase Budget for OBC/SC. Money given to the people under Awas Yojana should also be doubled. Steps should be taken to prevent scholarship scam, he said.

Health Minister Anil Vij said that around 50 suggestions for health department were received from MLAs during pre-budget consultation meeting.

Narnaund JJP MLA Ram Kumar Gautam said, “I suggested the Government to increase the pension of elders. JJP had promised to increase the pension of elders upto Rs 5100. If the Government cannot immediately increase the pension to Rs 5100 then they should increase it by Rs 1, 000 annually. People would have faith in our announcement.”

Jagbir Singh Malik, Congress MLA from Gohana said that in place of setting up new hospitals, the existing hospitals should be modernised. There has been shortage of specialist doctors in BPS Govt. Medical College, Khanpur Kalan. Earlier, around 4000 patients were being treated at OPD of this hospital but due to poor infrastructure and shortage of specialist doctors, only 400 or 500 patients are being treated here on daily basis.

Geeta Bhukkal Congress MLA from Jhajjar said that she suggested the Government to allocate maximum funds on education, health and medical education. In absence of proper infrastructure and specialist doctors, the district civil hospital of the State has become referral centre for the people of the State. “We have suggested the Government now during pre-budget consultation meeting. Let’s see what Government does on our suggestions. We will expose them during budget discussion in the Vidhan Sabha if suggestions are not incorporated,” she added.

Naina Singh Chautala, JJP MLA from Dabwali said that she suggested the Government to give special attention on girls’ education, their empowerment as well as providing them with transport facilities among others.

Ranbir Singh Gangwa, BJP MLA and Deputy Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha said MLAs cutting across party lines gave their suggestions. According to the schedule prepared for consultation with the MLAs, during three days of pre-Budget meeting, discussion on agriculture, education, health, urban local bodies, the social sector and infrastructure development among others will be held. Legislators gave suggestions on agriculture sector and how to double farmers’ income among others. The MLAs have been given a chance to give constructive ideas to better the performance in all above sectors during pre-budget meeting.

Yamuna Nagar BJP MLA Ghanshyam Dass Arora said, “I suggested the Government to take steps for promoting organic farming. As many parts of the State face shortage of water, water harvesting should be promoted. Soil health card scheme should be executed effectively. Farmers should be educated and encouraged to avoid using pesticide"".

Tohana JJP MLA Devender Singh Babli said that along with farming, farmers should be encouraged for horticulture, vegetable cultivation and animal husbandry. Combined farming should be promoted. Storage capacity should be enhanced in the State apart from increasing Agriculture budget in this current annual budget.

BJP MLA from Indri Ram Kumar Kashyap said, “I suggested the Government to promote organic farming. Excess use of pesticide invites number of diseases and people become victim of it. Such meeting would help the Government to draft healthy Budget for the people of the State.”

Ellenabad MLA and senior INLD leader Abhay Chautala alleged that Government is not serious about the pre-budget discussion and it was a mere formality. He alleged that Budget book has questioned the need of organsing pre-Budget meeting. ""By organising this, Government is misleading the people and the opposition parties would expose the Government on this issue,"" he said, adding that Government should encourage research and innovation in State Universities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/suggestions-of-mlas-to-be-incorporated-in-budget--haryana-cm.html
18,19-2-20,Punjab seeks policy to check foodgrain damage,"Underlining that Punjab is not able to bear the annual loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore due to damage to food grains, the State Government on Tuesday urged the Centre to come up with an effective policy to check the same.

At the same time, the State Punjab Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has also appealed to the Union Minister of State of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Dadarao Danve to enhance the storage capacity in the State.

Ashu made the demands during his meeting with the Union Minister, who is on two-day visit to the State.

Strongly taking up the issue of shortage of food grains storage capacity in Punjab, Ashu said that although Punjab has been the food bowl of our country for the last several decades, the responsibility of managing storage of procured food grains is also meted by the State.

“Due to limited resources, Punjab is unable to increase the storage capacity on their own and the Union Government should assist the State Government in this regard,” he said while appealing to the Union Minister that the Centre should formulate a nationwide effective policy in this regard so that the food grains produced in agrarian state of Punjab do not get damaged.

Ashu said that Punjab not only grows food grains, but they are also asked to manage their storage for up to three years, whereas food grains are not stored in Rajasthan for more than three months.

“If the Union Government formulates a policy, food grains from Punjab can be stored in states such as Rajasthan or others,” said Ashu while advocated the sale of food grains from Punjab to countries such as Afghanistan or some other South Asian countries.

He said that for lifting of food grains, special permission is granted for only 10-12 goods trains daily, which should be increased to at least 20.

He also demanded that under the Private Entrepreneur Guarantee (PEG) scheme, approvals for construction of godowns, with at least 20 lakh metric tonnes capacity, should be granted.

About the State’s current storage situation, Ashu said that around 95 lakh metric tonne of food grains from previous years are being stored in the State, out of which around 36 lakh metric tonne is lying in open storage and around 60 lakh metric tonnes is stored in godowns.

He said that adding to it, around 130 lakh metric tonnes of wheat is expected to arrive in mandis in April 2020, and Punjab would be unable to store such massive inflow of food grains due to shortage of storage capacity.

Appreciating Punjab model of public distribution system (PDS), the Union Minister Danve said that if food grains are distributed to the beneficiaries for a collective period of six months in entire country, the problem of storage as well as damage of food grains would be resolved automatically.

“With the adoption of this system, 600 lakh tonne of food grains can reach the households in one go and the beneficiaries would be benefitted to a large extent. He also showed keen interest in implementing the Punjab model of PDS in entire country.

PUNJAB TO GET 31 SILOS SOON FOR SCIENTIFIC STORAGE OF FOODGRAINS

Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Patil Danve on Tuesday said that in order to prevent wastage of foodgrains in traditional storage system, the Government has planned to construct 31 silos in Punjab for proper scientific storage of food grains.

Danve, who was at Sangrur to inspect the godowns of Food Corporation of India (FCI) and review the public distribution system of food grains, said that the process for the identification of suitable sites has been initiated and soon construction of new silos will be started.

He said that silo structures follows a scientific method of storing grains where stored grain is kept dry and aired so as to prevent fungal and insect attacks for much longer time period as compared to traditional methods.

Earlier, during his meeting with Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in Ludhiana, Danve said that 21 sites for this purpose have already been shortlisted, whereas the remaining sites would also be finalized shortly.

Danve said that it would check the problem of storage to a large extent. He also assured that he would take up all problems related to Punjab with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-seeks-policy-to-check-foodgrain-damage.html

In separate communiqués to the Speaker, the legislators had alleged that they were denied rooms in the A block of Punjab Bhawan in Delhi and were being accommodated in the B block, and dubbed it as their “disrespect”, while demanding that the matter should be placed before the privileges committee.

They alleged that the rooms in A block were permanently blocked for the top government bureaucrats. But as per the protocol, the legislators are above the Chief Secretary. The MLAs also alleged that the officers and officials were not picking their phone calls.

Taking serious note, the Speaker has asked the officers to explain under what rules they have denied room in A block to the MLAs, while also asking them to furnish details regarding under which category the MLAs and bureaucrats have been placed.

The Speaker has also directed the officials concerned to bring along the entire record of room booking till date. The speaker has also questioned the officials concerned about why they did not attend to the MLAs’ phone calls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mlas-want-rooms-in-a-block-of-punjab-bhawan.html
31,19-2-20,22 fresh CCTV cameras to come up at Tatanagar railway station,"In a move to further improve the security level at the railway station, Tatanagar railway management is in the process of installing additional 22 CCTV cameras. The additional surveillance cameras will be installed at the railway parking, newly set-up overbridge and at some other points which are away from the range of the existing cameras.

According to authorities, there are in all 103 CCTV cameras installed well across the Tatanagar station, 48 of them installed there since the year 2014, aimed at reducing the criminal incidents like pickpocket, chain and mobile snatching, luggage lifting and assault considerably.

Revealing about the move, railway protection force (RPF), inspector, Tatanagar, MK Sahoo said that there are in all 103 CCTV cameras at the premises of the Tatanagar station.

“ CCTVs play key role in controlling the crime rate. Though the 103 surveillance cameras, including four PTZ (Pan-tilt-Zoom) cameras at various strategic locations, two sites, the railway parking and the newly set up overbridge are not being covered. This is the reason that we have recommended for 22 additional cameras to be installed at the Tatanagar station,” said Sahoo.

The RPF inspector pointed out that there are half-a-dozen CCTV cameras already installed at the railway parking area but those cameras belong to the parking contractor who has installed them in view of warding off any quarrel between the parking staff and the vehicle owners.

The RPF inspector said that the CCTV cameras are installed by the Signal and Light department of the railway and the recommendations for the additional 22 surveillance cameras were made after the RPF which maintains

the security aspects at the railway station carried out a meticulous survey.

“Tatanagar Railway authorities are using CCTV cameras installed at the station premises to help crack down on crime. The CCTV footages recently led railway police to arrest two chain-snatchers while they were trying to snatch gold-chain from a lady passenger. Thanks to a growing network of security cameras, railway is using a new strategy to fight crime. No doubt the security cameras give extra eyes on the system and add an important layer to security efforts. More such CCTV cameras must be installed at other places places to curb crime,” said UK Srivastava, a senior functionary of Chotanagpur Passengers Association.

Tatanagar railway station, located on the Howrah-Mumbai main line, witnesses 45 pairs of express, mail and passenger trains, serving as many as 60,000 passengers daily. Most of the long distance and high profile trains including Bhubaneshwar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Howrah-Mumbai Duronto Express and Puri-New Delhi Purushottam Superast Express usually halt in platform no. 2,3 4 and 5.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/22-fresh-cctv-cameras-to-come-up-at-tatanagar-railway-station.html

Also known as Shivaratri, the festival celebrates the convergence of Shiva and Shakti on the Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi of Hindu calendar month Maagha. Women observe fast and offer prayers both to Lord Shiva and Parvati to seek a blissful married life.

Among the many legends associated with Maha Shivratri are marriage of Shiva and Shakti and Ganga’s descent from the heavens to the earth. Maha Shivratri also marks the night when Lord Shiva performed the ‘Tandava” dance.

Devotees offer Bael or golden apple to Lord Shiva and chant the sacred Panchakshara mantra dedicated to Lord Om Namah Shivaya on this day, which is celebrated across India.

All visitors will be frisked at both Fadlugora and Makulakocha. The devotees will have to pass through metal detectors. They will not be allowed to carry matchsticks, tyres, firearms and other inflammable items.

Dalma range official said two generator sets have been requisitioned to temporarily install lights on the route.

Shivratri fetches revenues for Ranchi wildlife division, which looks after the Dalma reserve. Devotees are charged Rs 2 each for visiting the temple. There are separate charges for vehicles.

Over 50,000 devotees, mostly from steel city Jamshedpur, Chandil, Ghatshila and surrounding areas, and villages dotting the NH-33, on the auspicious occasion participate in it. CFL bulbs will be used along the stretch.

34,19-2-20,Finance Minister inaugurates Oasis Fertility,"Finance Minister Dr Rameshwar Oraon inaugurated Oasis Fertility here on Tuesday in the presence of noted Gynaecologist Dr Shobha Chakraverty and other eminent guests.

Talking on the occasion of the launch of Oasis Fertility Dr Durga G Rao, Co- Founder and Medical Director of Oasis Fertility stated, “One of the main reasons for starting a Fertility Centre in Ranchi is just not giving another option for the infertile couple but to give an evidence based ethical transparent and protocol based treatments to the couple. We at Oasis strongly follow the clinical protocols and algorithm coupled with cutting edge, latest technology in treating the patient thereby ensuring a higher success rates”

Adding to this Dr Durga also stressed on the fact about the timing of decision to visit a fertility centre is of utmost importance. “Many couples delay the start of treatment, it is of utmost importance that the couple who have already crossed 30 and have not conceived naturally after trying for year, they need to take help of Assisted Reproductive Technologies, the sooner the better for best clinical outcomes,” he added.

Dr Krishna Chaitanya – Scientific Head and Clinical Embryologist of Oasis Fertility said, “In India the general notion or myth is that infertility clinics are meant only for treating women, the entire male infertility gamut is just ignored. According to Journal of Reproductive Sciences “Male factor” infertility is seen as an alteration in sperm concentration and/or motility and/or morphology in at least one sample of two sperm analyzes, collected 1 and 4 weeks apart, in India, nearly 50 per cent of infertility is related to the reproductive anomalies or disorders in the male. Hence it is important that the male infertility is evaluated completely when a couple come forward for fertility treatment.”

Dr Sarbjaya Singh — Clinical Head and Fertility Specialist at Oasis Fertility commented, “Lifestyle changes have gone from bad to worse, and include increasing age at marriage, increasing number of working women who delay pregnancy, rising alcohol and tobacco consumption, sedentary lifestyle coupled with fast food consumption, and disturbing levels of obesity. More educated women are more likely to postpone marriages and childbirth. They are also likely to opt for smaller family size as they are busy with their careers and work commitments.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/finance-minister-inaugurates-oasis-fertility.html

Secretary of the Nature Conservation Society DS Srivastava, who by virtue of his being secretary of the NGO Nature Conservation Society is on the panel of the Jharkhand State Wild Life Board said, “I fail to understand as to what stopped chief wildlife warden Jharkhand PK Verma to come rushing in the National Park Betla in the wake of this death of the tigress.”

“It is Tuesday afternoon and the tigress was found lying dead on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday as on Sunday. The tigress was cremated after all post death protocol observed in all seriousness.” said Srivastava. Srivastava said, “The chief wild life warden has not come here, which goes to suggest that even the death of a tigress has not caused any stir in the high echelon of the forest environment & climate change department in the State.”

Asked whether he was in the directorate tiger project Daltonganj today and what transpired between the tiger project field director and him to which he said, “Yes, I was there and I had a talk with the field director YK Das and when I raised this issue as to what made chief wild life warden not inspecting the place and getting abreast of the entire details related from the first sighting of the tigress gone dead to its cremation to which Das told me that he (Das) is here as his representative.”

Ranger Betla Prem Prasad has categorically said that the tigress died due to the fight she had with the bison as she was aged more than 16 years and her teeth power was also in great decay. Sources said the PTR officials must come out with every bit of the pre death, death and post death situations of the tigress to stem more such whispers.

Srivastava said, “The energy that PTR officials is pooling in right now is to prove that the construction of more than 90 towers built earlier in the core and the buffer divisions of this tiger reserve turned out to be too bad for the wild life here and the regime of the officials when these towers so came up be questioned, quizzed and then regime’s officials be dragged in this.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ghost-of-dead-tigress-haunts-ptr.html
38,19-2-20,UT administration decides to table draft parking policy,"The proposals of allowing stilt parking at ground floor, parking tariff as per congestion factor, strict parking norms in residential areas, among others in the draft parking policy of Chandigarh have become the bone of contention between various Departments of UT Administration.

Failing to reach a unanimous decision on various proposals in the draft parking policy, the UT Administration has now decided to table the policy in a meeting of UT Administrator’s Advisory Council.

The decision was taken after the directions of Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore to take suggestions from the members of Advisory Council on parking policy.

The policy, aimed at addressing parking woes of the city residents, proposed stilt parking at ground floor within the permissible ground coverage, FAR (floor area ratio) and height of the building.

Recommendation in the policy also include plying of staff buses by companies with more than 50 employees, provision of two cars to be parked inside the house, two main gates to be permitted along accessible road in the front boundary wall of the residential buildings, dedicated high frequency bus service on three major roads of the city, parking tariff as per congestion factor, removal of boundary wall of marla houses to accommodate more vehicles.

“The proposal of stilt parking remains a contentious issue as the FAR has to be increased for its implementation.

39,19-2-20,Babulal Marandi pledges to strengthen party at grassroot levels,"Jharkhand’s first Chief Minister Babulal Marandi, who joined the BJP at a function attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other senior State BJP leaders on Tuesday reached the BJP office after 14 years. The BJP and erstwhile Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) workers gave a rousing welcome to Marandi. Senior BJP leaders, including party State general secretary, Deepak Prakash, former State president Ravindra Rai, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo, State secretary Subodh Singh Guddu and others were at party office to welcome Marandi.

Marandi, who headed Jharkhand Vikas Morcha till the merger of party with BJP on Monday, reached the party office at 12.30 noon.

As his white coloured Volvo car reached BJP office the BJP and JVM supporters raised slogans in support of Marandi and BJP. Marandi talking to media persons said, “I was to go to Giridih to meet people of my constituency. But, I decided to visit BJP office so as to meet old friends in the party.”

Marandi also shared his experience in BJP when he was in Saffron party 14 years back. Marandi on the occasion once again reiterated his commitment to strengthen the party at grass root level assuring that his door will be open for workers.

He said, “If I am in Ranchi I will definitely visit party office and will be available to party workers.” The former chief minister said that when he left BJP in 2006 the party office was functioning from smaller office, but now the BJP office is much bigger.

Interestingly, the party office in which Marandi reached after 14 years, the foundation stone of the office of laid by Marandi. He also had lunch with party leaders in office before leaving for Giridih.

Marandi, an affable, suave and soft in nature politician has been a loyalist of RSS and due to his closeness with RSS the BJP since 2006 was working to bring back Marandi to BJP fold.

Sources said Marandi is likely to get Leader of Opposition post in Assembly. At the time when three senior BJP State leaders including outing Chief Minister Raghubar Das, former Speaker Dinesh Oroan and State BJP president Laxman Gilua losing the election, there was speculation that either Chandreshwar Prasad Singh (CP Singh) or Neelkanth Singh Munda having vast experience in party and House could be made as Leader of Opposition (LoP), but during the three day long special session of Jharkhand Assembly the LoP chair remained vacant.

Marandi likely to get leader of opposition post also gain importance as on Monday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah also indicated that Marandi along with two other former Chief Ministers Raghubar Das and Arjun Munda will lead the party in State. Also, BJP national president JP Nadda on Tuesday appointed Muralidhar Rao BJP national general-secretary was appointed as observer for appointment of BJP leader of Opposition in House.

Marandi is a former RSS leader who resigned from his job as a teacher to work for the organisation. In 2000, he became the first chief minister of newly created state of Jharkhand. But, he had to resign in 2003 and Arjun Munda became the chief minister. In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State. In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/babulal-marandi-pledges-to-strengthen-party-at-grassroot-levels.html
40,19-2-20,Lawyers boycott work,"Judicial works were disrupted in Jharkhand on Monday as lawyers across the State abstained from attending courts to register their protest against the alleged attack on the president of District Bar Association, Daltonganj district by a senior judge of the local court.

Due to lawyers’ strike, work at district courts and High Court was stuck as lawyers abstained from attending courts. The strike call was given by State Bar Council after the alleged assault of Satyendra Nath Tiwari ‘Nehru’ president of Daltonganj Bar Association by Daltonganj District Session Judge Pankaj Kumar surfaced. The lawyers had called the strike as incidents of assault on lawyers have gone up in Court in past few months.

Notably, following the incident the Jharkhand State Bar Council (JSBC) had on Monday called an emergency meeting and condemned the attack in premises.

The Jharkhand State Bar Council to probe the incident has constituted four member committee comprising Abdul Kalam Rashidi, Hemant Kumar Shikarwar, Kundan Prakashan and Rinku Bagat to Daltonganj to inquire into the matter and submit a report. The committee on Tuesday visited Daltonganj and enquired about the incident. Hemant Kumar Shikarwar talking said, “The committee members visited the incident site and came to know that such incidents had happened. The committee members also talked to Daltonganj Bar Council members and both the

parties Satyendra Nath Tiwari and district and session judge Pankaj Kumar.”

Shikarwar said, “The committee will submit the confidential report to Jharkhand State Bar Council.” The committee members also talked to some eyewitness in the incident.

Meanwhile, the lawyers have also demanded safety and security as lawyers have been receiving threat regularly. On last Thursday a bomb explosion took place at a Lucknow court. The explosion took place in the Lucknow collectorate in Hazratganj, near the district magistrate’s office and barely a kilometre from the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. One person has been seriously injured while two others have received minor injuries.

Meanwhile, the Registrar General of Jharkhand High Court had asked registrar (establishment) of High Court to conduct an enquiry on the incident.

However, the clients faced difficulties due to strike call of lawyers. Manoj Kumar, who is having a land dispute case on Tuesday, reached Jharkhand High Court from Chatra but as no work was done he had to return. Manoj said, “I was unaware about lawyers’ strike. Had my lawyers would had inform me prior I would have saved my time and money.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lawyers-boycott-work.html
41,19-2-20,"Unhindered, Ranchi’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’ completes 1 month","The scene outside Ranchi’s Haj House has been reminiscent of New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh since January 19 — the day when a few hundred women of the Muslim community decided to stage a protest here against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Cut to February 18, exactly a month since the protest began, the place has a huge canopy that provides shade to the protesting women, a kitchen where meals are prepared, and a dedicated

office where the organisers of the protest answer queries of mediapersons.

The strength of protestors here has grown manifold in the past one month. Right from young children, to school going women and middle-aged homemakers to college students — women from different age brackets and walks of life have garnered the courage and motivation to become a part of the protests and aggressively campaign against the CAA.

Ghazala, a 60-year-old woman who has been a part of the protest since day 1, said that the protest is unlikely to mellow down. “Most of the women here do not even know how to read and write. How does the Government expect that they would get documents to prove their nationality? We are spreading awareness among these women about their constitutional rights, and I am sure that they are determined to fight for a better country,” she said.

Ladle Khan, a member of the Islamia Committee and one of the organisers of the protest, said that the protest has grown immensely in the past one month. “A few hundred women started the protest. And today, thousands of women from across Jharkhand are supporting them,” he said. “The Government has to withdraw the unconstitutional CAA, only then will this protest end,” he added.

Ranchi has witnessed several peaceful protests against CAA and NRC since the results of the 2019 Assembly elections were out. Several members of the Muslim community and student organisations took out protest rallies on Mahatma Gandhi Road in the first week of January and raised concern over the implementation of the controversial law. To counter the impact of the protests and spread awareness about NRC and CAA, BJP launched a statewide campaign here last month. As a part of the campaign, BJP leaders are visiting different parts of the State and clearing the misconceptions about the laws. On January 13, the BJP took out rallies across the State and also formed a human chain in favour of the NRC and CAA.

The Rajya Sabha gave its nod to the CAA on December 11. The CAA intends to allow Indian citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and Buddhists from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan assuming religious persecution to be a reason for their migration to India. The opposition parties, however, are seeing the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as a conspiracy to marginalise the Muslim community.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/unhindered--ranchi---s----shaheen-bagh----completes-1-month.html

44,19-2-20,Airport expansion plan awaits Cabinet nod,"The expansion plan of Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi over a 301 acre Government land is likely to be tabled in the Cabinet soon, airport officials said on Thursday. The largest airport in Jharkhand is likely to extend its runway, increase the length of basic strip and construct an isolation bay on the extra land that will be allotted to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) once the Cabinet gives its nod to the expansion plans, they added.

Airport Director Vinod Sharma on Thursday said that the Birsa Munda Airport at present has a 75 meter basic strip, which is the minimum length required for any airport. The length of the basic strip, he said, will be increased to 140 meters once the expansion plan is approved. “The draft has been prepared and we are waiting for the Cabinet’s approval. Things will start taking shape only after the Cabinet takes its decision,” Sharma said.

He added that there were a few mandatory parameters, which the airport needs to fulfill. One of the parameters, he said, was a secluded isolation bay. In case there is a threat of bomb being planted in a flight, it is taken to the isolation bay, which has to be away from the rest of the bays for safety reasons. “Right now, we do have an isolation bay, but it is not at a secluded area,” said the Airport Director.

The Airport Advisory Committee (AAC) recently decided to use funds from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) treasury of the airport to rehabilitate the villagers, who had lost land due to construction and expansion of the airport and beautify the villages surrounding the airport.

The Birsa Munda Airport is fast growing in terms of connectivity with other cities. The largest airport in Jharkhand already has 30 flights connecting Ranchi to important cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The airport also has an international bay, but is yet to get any international flights.

45,19-2-20,HC issues bailable warrant against Central Transport under-secretary,"The High Court of Uttarakhand has issued a bailable warrant against the Central Transport under secretary. The official has been directed to appear in the court at 10:15 AM on February 24 while the Nainital senior superintendent of police has been directed to ensure implementation of the court’s orders.

The warrant was issued by the division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice RC Khulbe due to the failure of the under-secretary to appear in the court on Tuesday as directed by the high court in a public interest litigation filed by the roadways employees union.

It will be recalled that the Uttarakhand roadways employees union had filed a PIL in the high court stating that the state government was planning to impose ESMA on them which was against the rules. The union had also contended that the government was forcing them to go on strike. The government and transport corporation are neither regularising the workers nor paying them salaries regularly even while they were yet to receive their overtime dues of the past four years.

The petitioner had also stated that while the state government owes Rs 86 crore to the corporation, the Uttar Pradesh transport corporation is to clear dues to the Uttarakhand transport corporation amounting to Rs 700 crore.

If the government and corporation get these dues cleared, the problems of the union members and the state’s transport corporation would get resolved, the union members have contended.

It is pertinent to mention here that in the past, the counsel for the centre had informed the court that the dispute between the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh had been resolved.

The court had sought a copy of the said agreement reached between the two states. However, the centre has not provided the said copy yet in the court.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-issues-bailable-warrant-against-central-transport-under-secretary.html

47,19-2-20,Huge revenue setback for U’khand,"The excise department of Uttarakhand is fighting a losing battle on revenue targets in the current financial year. Out of the targeted Rs 3180 Crores for the year 2019-20, the department’s revenue collections are expected to fall short at least by Rs 500 Crore this year.

Unconcerned by this shortfall, the state government is continuing to increase the revenue targets from sale of liquor and it is expected that the target for next financial year would be around Rs 3600 Crore. In the financial year 2018-19 also the excise department was not able to achieve the targeted revenue of Rs 3000 Crore as the collections fell short by about Rs 200 Crore.

The excise commissioner, Sushil Kumar said that the department is trying hard to achieve targets. He seemed confident of achieving last year’s collection. The commissioner added that he has convened a meeting of the officials of the department on February 20 to discuss the issue.

One of the major reasons for the shortfall in revenue collections is the fact that the department was not able to allot 131 shops in the state. In the excise policy, the department offered a premium of 20 percent on the price of last to the existing shop owners for the year 2019-20. The owners of as many as 234 liquor shop owners out of total 626 shops in the state refused to operate the shops due to high licence fee and surcharge.

A beleaguered department was forced to offer these shops at 35 percent below the fixed base price. This sop too failed to attract buyers of as many as 131 shops in the state.

The experts are citing exorbitant price of liquor in the state as another reason for the revenue shortfall.

They point out that high price of liquor spawns smuggling from neighbouring states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh where the liquor is much cheaper than Uttarakhand. Even as the excise department is struggling to meet the high revenue targets, the Uttarakhand government is pressing hard to extract more revenue from excise. It is worth mentioning here that the excise and mining are two major revenue earners for the Himalayan state.

The government’s emphasis on the excise revenue contradicts the official stand of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat who on many occasions has said that dependence on liquor revenue should be reduced and the state should develop alternative sources of earnings.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/huge-revenue-setback-for-u---khand.html

He stressed that no leadership change in the state government is about to happen, adding that such rumours are being spread as part of a deep conspiracy.

It is pertinent to mention here that recently, there were reports in some media outlets speculating about impending change in the state government’s leadership. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat would be replaced by another senior party leader soon, such reports had claimed.

However, the BJP state president put a stop to such speculation on Tuesday, stressing that no change in the leadership is going to happen in the state. The state government under chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat is performing well and will complete its term in office, he added. “The rumours being spread about impending leadership change in Uttarakhand are totally baseless and do not contain an iota of truth. Such rumours were spread as part of a deep conspiracy.

Those involved in this conspiracy do not want development in the state. They don’t want action being taken against corruption to continue with the state government adopting a zero tolerance stance,” said the BJP state president.

Bhagat further said that the Congress is itself in deep trouble and ridden by factionalism. However, its leaders are attempting to spread misconceptions by talking of political problems in the BJP. The Congress has totally lost its ground in Uttarakhand and its leaders are searching for a base among the people. However, due to its negative attitude and actions, the Congress is going to drop down to zero in Uttarakhand too. On the other hand, the BJP is going to create history in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections too by winning from more seats than in the previous elections, said Bhagat. He further said that the BJP government and organisation in the state are committed to move ahead on the developmental path, working to fulfill the responsibility of meeting the promises made to the people.

“Have you ever visited a jail in Odisha. I have learnt from one of my brothers (judges) that they (inmates) take turns to sleep there. There is an international treaty which guarantees that there should be minimum place to sleep in jails. The condition is so terrible there,” a member of a Bench of Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph said on Monday.

The court observed this while it was hearing a petition filed by a man seeking bail in a case lodged under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The petitioner’s counsel told the court that allegation against the man is that he had slapped his mother. He said the petitioner is 20 years old and has been in jail for over 400 days, due to which his studies have been affected.

The counsel appearing for the State said the lawyers’ strike in district courts is over and the petitioner can move there for bail after statement of the complainant is recorded.

He said the Orissa High Court, while refusing to grant bail to the petitioner, had noted that there was a threat perception to the complainant.

The petitioner’s counsel countered this and said there is no threat perception to the complainant.

The apex court then posted the matter for next hearing after one month while taking note of the submissions advanced by the State’s counsel that the statement of the complainant would be recorded by the concerned trial court within a month.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---odisha-jails----situation----terrible----as-inmates-take-turns-to-sleep---.html

67,19-2-20,Movie on Sai’s link in double murder soon,"A story of sensational double murder allegedly masterminded by expelled BJD leader and former MLA Anup Sai would soon hit the silver screen.

Odia filmmaker Sridhar Martha would produce the film titled as ‘Mayabini’ under the banner of Range Royal Cine Lab. The producer made the announcement and released a flick of the movie here on Tuesday. However, he did not divulge further details like the star cast and the director for the project.

The production house had recently made the movie ‘Patnagarh’ based on the true incident of the Patnagarh wedding gift blast. Martha had debuted in the Odia film industry as a producer with ‘Katha Deli Matha Chuin’ .

Recently, the Chhattisgarh police arrested ex-Brajrajnagar MLA Anup Sai for murdering a woman and her daughter in 2016. The police claimed that Sai had an illicit relationship with deceased Kalpana Das (32), who was a divorcee and had a 14-year-old daughter, Babli, for quite a long time. Sai had purchased a flat at Sundarpada in Bhubaneswar and the mother-daughter duo was staying in the flat from 2011 to 2016. When Kalpana started insisting on him to marry her and demanded a share from his property, Sai plotted to kill her.

On the fateful day, Sai took both Kalpana and Babli to a forest on the way to Raigarh in Chhattisgarh. He bludgeoned both of them to death with an iron rod and later ran a vehicle over them several times to mutilate the bodies beyond recognition in an attempt to erase evidence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/movie-on-sai---s-link-in-double-murder-soon.html
68,19-2-20,Rs 36 crore submitted in property tax at MCD,"A total of about Rs 36 crore has been submitted by around 44,000 people as property tax in the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) till February 18. The property tax collected by the corporation so far has already risen by more than Rs 10 crore compared to the total amount collected in the previous year.

While talking to The Pioneer, the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly said, “In recent days, the collection of the property tax is an average of around Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh per day and the total collection till now is about Rs 36 crore.”

He added that so far, about 44,000 people have submitted the property tax in MCD and hopefully the number of taxpayers will increase by the next month.

About organising the property tax camps across the city, Painuly said that for now there is no plan of

organising any kind of camp regarding the property tax because there is no such need at the moment.

“People are paying taxes in the MCD campus and besides, the facility of paying tax is also available through online mode and in fact, many people are paying the property tax online.

However, if councillors or citizens in any particular area request MCD to organise a camp, it would certainly be taken under consideration,” he said.

This year the property tax collection by MCD broke all the past records with more than one crore being collected during a single day. Last year, the total collection was only about Rs 25 crore but this year it is expected to be over Rs 50 crore by the end of March.

Penalty will be imposed on those persons who fail to pay the property tax before March 31.

It is pertinent to mention here that MCD has extended the period of rebate of 20 per cent twice this year, once in January for one month and then in February for five days till February 20.

The considerable collection of property tax is one of the reasons for extending the period of rebate consecutively for two months.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rs-36-crore-submitted-in-property-tax-at-mcd.html

The Khariar Tehsildar issued the document of ROR to Dhanmati in the presence of his brother Premananda Majhi of Dharamsagar village, who worked tirelessly for last one year to force the revenue authority cancel the registration and mutation.

Dhanmati got the hint of the illegal transaction, when a notice was served to her by the Tehsildar, Khariar for a mutation case.

When he started inquiring the whereabouts of Jharbandh Majhi through RTI, he came to know that, no one in this name existed in Sunabeda.

""We lodged a complaint with the registration authority to stop the mutation, but they didn't,"" revealed Parmanand.

Notably, the students have resorted to a stir in the new department after there was a plan to wind it up. Three years back, the students had taken admission in the ‘Medical Physics’ course where radiation study is an important component. But the course could not run smoothly due to the negligence of the then VC and course coordinator.

It was alleged that by just downloading a course from net, Prof CR Tripathy, the then VC and the course coordinator, had opened it hurriedly for the sole intention of taking credit. The preliminary permission from the Atomic Energy Research Centre (AERC) was not taken then. At the same time, there was neither basic infrastructure in the university for the particular course nor teachers.

Hence, the university decided to close the department. They further decided to refund the excess fees taken from the students since it was a self financing course.

But after the regular VC had gone on leave, the students again reiterated their demand for degree in Medical Physics and even went to the extent of heckling the in-charge VC Prof AK Dasmahapatra.

However, Collector of Sambalpur Subham Saxena called a meeting where it was decided that the students could get the required practical training in the Acharya Harihar Cancer Research Institute at Cuttack, particularly on the subject of ‘Radiation.’ A professor from the Physics Department of the university would go soon to Cuttack to explore the possibility, said sources.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/meet-discusses-s---pur-varsity-students----woes.html

88,19-2-20,Scenic Kapilash hills gear up for Shivaratri,"The Shiv Temple on the scenic hill ranges of Kapilash in Dhenkanal district has geared up to celebrate the Maha Sivaratri and Jagara Mela on February 21.

While the holy book Ishan Samhita claims the Sivalinga had appeared there before the Vedic Age, a legend has it that Lord Siva appeared at the Kapilash hill after being pleased with the severe penance of King Saudasha. Ever since, Kapilash has been counted as one of the famous Shaivite hubs across the country.

On the Maha Sivaratri, Lord Chandra Sekhar is worshipped with Sodasha Upachara and Rudradrabhiseka. Amidst blowing of conch and Turi and ululations, the Mahadeepa is raised onto the temple top. Lord Chandrasekhar is awakened from his cosmic sleep.

Being adorned with Nagavarana Vesha, Lord Chandra Sekhar meets Lord Narayana which is called as the Harihara Bheta.

A priest said that apart from being adorned with Banarashi Patta and valuable ornaments, the Linga and Shakthi are covered with Bel leaf, Gayasa and Champa flowers made of gold. The entire hill range appears like a galaxy as countless devotees seat the entire night by illuminating their earthen lamps (Deepa).

The temple history reveals that Ganga Vansi King Langula Narasingha Dev had constructed the 60feet high temple of Lord Chandra Sekhar in 1246. Earlier, Ganga Vansi prince Ananga Bhima Dev had surrendered before the Lord at Kapilash to be released from the sin of Bramhahatya (killing a Brahmin), being directed by Lord Jagannath in a divine dream. But at that time, the prince traced the self emerged Siva Linga being covered with leaves and he named the Lord as Sikhareswara.

Later, the Kasi Biswanath temple, Narayan temple, Jagamohan, Manikaranika Kunda, Papanasini Kunda, Japa Mandapa and twelve curved roads to the temple were constructed by the royal family of Dhenkanal. Reportedly, the 1,352 steps were constructed with public donation to climb the hill range. The idol of Lord Narayan has been so designed that a perennial spring flows from nail of its right foot.

Besides, Jugabdhi Purana written by Santh Balaram Das, describes that Lord Rama during his 14 years of exile had stayed at hills of Sapta Sajya and Kapilash for a few days along with Laxmana and Sita. The existence of a cave on the hill top named as Sitanka Entudisala, an idol of the monk Balmiki and a pile of stones called as Deba Sabha support the belief.

The absence of crow in the entire hill range is still a mystery. Even though a number of poisonous snakes move in the hill, curiously only two have died so far in Kapilash due to snake bite and that too due to wrath of the Lord. It is said one died in snake bite for allegedly consuming onion with the Lord’s prasad and another for an attempt to molest a female devotee.

The State Government has spent Rs 23 lakh during the year 2017-18 for Kapilash to promote tourism potentiality of the place. A zoo at the foot hill has not yet been developed fully. However, a science park attracts the tourists and picnickers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scenic-kapilash-hills-gear-up-for-shivaratri.html

91,19-2-20,Light showers expected in last week of Feb,"With the sun gradually moving towards the Equator from the Tropic of Capricorn, a slight change in the weather is being experienced across Jharkhand. As the sun will shift closer to the Equator, the southern parts of the State will become warmer. This movement of the sun is what regulates the temperature which will now continue to rise.

On February 19 and February 20 there will be dry weather across Jharkhand while a slight change in the weather will be observed from the evening of February 20. On February 21, isolated places in north west parts of Jharkhand will have light to moderate rainfall. From February 22 to February 24 isolates places in northern and central parts of the State are likely to receive some showers.

“These showers are the effect of an induced western disturbance which is present in the upper levels of the troposphere. There is also a convergence of the south westerly winds with the westerly and north westerly winds in the lower troposphere. The western disturbance and the wind convergence together will be the cause of the light showers and the cloudy weather,” said Deputy Director, MET Centre Ranchi, Abhishek Anand.

This weather is likely to be clear from February 25 onwards. The minimum temperature is expected to rise from February 20 onwards and could be around 15 to 16 degree Celsius.

The dance drama on Amrapali marked fourth day of 38th foundation anniversary being organised at Bharat Bhavan.

Known to have an extraordinary charm and grace, Amrapali was a famous dancer of ancient India who lived in 500BC and later followed Lord Buddha's teachings. Fantastically choreographed by a Kathak maestro V Anuradha Singh, the dance drama was wondrously performed by Singh along with her troupe.

Amrapali was a wonderful dancer and also very beautiful. On different stages, Amrapali performs pure Kathak in Raga Malhar.

Through beautiful moves of Kathak Amrapali and King Ajatshatru’s love was depicted. While going for hunting Amrapali met King Ajatshatru of Magadh. After a meeting both fell in love with each other.

Ajatshatru wants to marry Amrapali. He attacked Vaishali to conquer Amrapali, but though he was victorious, she refused to go with him to Magadh. She was in a state of shock as she saw her own people dying in the war. She explained her motherland was greater than any other love and at the end the audience saw Amrapali turning into a saint.

Singh evolved a refined, sophisticated style in pure classical form, based on fast speeds, swift turns, mind thrilling footwork, delicacy of movements and impressive expressions while she was narrating the story. With enchanting stage presence she has earned acclamation for intense and sensitive dance presentations. Rhythmic understanding, ability to extemporize with speedy rhythms and preserving pure Kathak classical style made her act even more enjoyable.

The troupe performed different forms of Kathak. The performance was a beautiful blend of Bandish, Sufism, Tarana and chakras.

105,19-2-20,Tribal groups on war-footing for Sarna Code,"Several hundred members of the tribal community from Jharkhand staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on Tuesday demanding a separate Sarna Code in the 2021 census — a move that is expected to give Sarna-following tribals a separate religious identity. A similar protest was also staged outside the Raj Bhawan in Ranchi on Tuesday by members of different tribal rights groups here.

Munna Toppo, a member of Jai Adivasi Central Committee, another tribal rights body, was one of the protestors at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday. He said that the protests saw participation of tribal men and women from across the country, including places like Andaman & Nicobar, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand. “When Sikhs and Jains can have a code in the Census, why can’t we? Our population is much higher than theirs and we have been asking for a separate code for several decades now,” said Toppo, adding that the Government at the Centre should at least listen to their demands and take actions accordingly.

Another tribal rights activist from Jharkhand, Arbind Oraon, who participated in the protests at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday said, “Tribals from across the country gathered here to press for the inclusion of a tribal column in the Census. Around 1200 tribal men and women participated in the protest.” Oraon, who happens to be the co-convener of a conglomerate constituted especially for the purpose, said that members of tribal communities in Meghalaya and Assam also joined the protests in the national capital.

Bablu Munda, president of Kendriya Sarna Samiti, a tribal rights group that actively participated in the protests, said that the tribal community in Jharkhand has been pressing for a Sarna Code since decades, but no Government has ever bothered to pay heed to their demands. “After several years of no interest shown by any Government, former Chief Minister Raghubar Das had assured that he will speak to the Centre about our demands. But his Government was toppled before he could take any initiative regarding our issues,” Munda said.

Das had raised the demand of various tribal outfits for a separate Sarna Code at the Assembly here. He had also said on a number of occasions that his Government will press for a separate Sarna Code if he is voted to power again. However, the tripartite alliance of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) toppled his Government and Das could not even win from his seat, Jamshedpur East.

Sarna followers are nature worshippers, who do not consider themselves Hindus and have been fighting for a separate religious identity in India. Lakhs of tribesmen who were born in Sarna-following families got converted to Christianity over the past century after the advent of the missionaries, claim tribal gurus. These tribesmen have also been at loggerheads with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) over being tagged as Hindus by the saffron outfit.

A major tribal movement for a separate religious identity has been boiling in Jharkhand and neighbouring states for the past couple of years. In 2014, thousands of Sarna followers handed over a memorandum to then Union minister P Chidambaram and demanded recognition of Sarna as a separate religion. The crusaders back then had also staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, but their pleas went unheeded. In 2015, about 30,000 tribesmen held a nationwide campaign for the same.

The Sarna followers fall in the category of ‘other religious practices’ in the Census. According to the 2011 Census, tribals form 26.2 per cent of the total population of 3.29 crore in Jharkhand. Organisations campaigning for a Sarna Code claim that out of the total tribal population here, hardly 10 per cent follow Christianity and the remaining follow the Sarna Dharm (religion).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tribal-groups-on-war-footing-for-sarna-code.html

However, Jamia students had denied that they were involved in the violence and had alleged police brutality.

On Monday, a Delhi court directed the police to file a status report on whether it was investigating the officers who had allegedly barged into JMI and lathi-charged students. The court has also sought an overall status report from the Delhi Police on the ongoing investigation in the case related to the violence near the university campus during the protest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-team-visits-jamia-library----damaged----during-police-action.html

112,19-2-20,"No more PGDM, MBA courses at one go","The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) — the technical and management education regulator — on Tuesday said the Government or private universities will no longer be able to offer both PGDM and MBA courses simultaneously and will have to choose either of the two.

The AICTE, under the HRD Ministry, said Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) courses can be run by standalone institutions, which are neither universities nor affiliated to any university, similar to the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).

“Over a period of time, deemed to be universities have added PGDM course under the banner of ‘Management Programme’ in contravention of norms. According to the AICTE Regulations, 2020, conducting PGDM and MBA courses in the same institution is not permissible,” a senior AICTE official said.

“Central, State and private universities and institutions deemed to be universities, which are running PGDM and MBA courses under the banner of management programme, are requested to convert all courses into MBA completely and comply with the AICTE norms,” he added.

According to the regulations, institutions affiliated to universities have the option of either converting all PGDM courses into corresponding MBA courses with respective university affiliation or vice-versa and run those under a separate standalone institute. The new Government rule is aimed at protecting students from misleading claims.

There are a total of 3,000 institutes offering MBA programmes through universities, or deemed to universities or autonomous institutions and a total of about 350 of them are offering PGDM course with most of them having a combined offer for both the courses simultaneously.

“Conducting PGDM and MBA courses in the same institution is not permissible… central/state/private universities and institutions deemed to be universities which are running PGDM programme concurrently with MBA under the banner of management programme are requested to convert PGDM courses as MBA completely and comply with the AICTE norms forthwith,” says the AICTE circular following a Council meet last week.

“An institute cannot run both PGDM & MBA programmes simultaneously,” the circular added. As senior AICTE officials said the move is also aimed at eliminating the confusion caused by institutes running Master’s as well as diploma programmes.

According to AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabuddhe, the institutes offering a good MBA would at times also introduce a diploma course in management and that the diploma course was often inferior in quality.

“In that case students would sign up under the impression that an institute offering a good MBA course would excel at PGDM as well. A lot of confusion was caused by institutes running both programmes simultaneously and thus we are now doing a course correction which benefits the Business programmes,” Sahasrabuddhe added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-more-pgdm--mba-courses-at-one-go.html

114,19-2-20,PWD to construct 4 FOBs,"Witnessing an unending traffic congestion due to 'no space for the pedestrians' crossing and safety, the Public Works Department (PWD) is planning to construct four Foot over Bridges (FOBs) across the heavily congested Aurobindo Marg at Adchini village, Police Training School (PTS), opposite Tuberculosis (TB) hospital and Hauz Khas Enclave near Padmini enclave to streamline the pedestrian traffic.

According to the PWD officials, the FOB on these areas was one of the long pending demanding of Delhi Traffic Police and the public because the route had no facilities for pedestrian crossing and safety. ""The pedestrians were often seen hopping and jumping and risking their lives. Many incidents have happened on this stretch and also the rate of traffic mishaps on this stretch is on the higher side.""

The PWD has also floated tenders for the constructions of four FOBs and the estimated cost of these pedestrian crossings are pegged at Rs 11.45 crores. The Aurobindo Marg connects Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) road and is known as one of the heavily congested stretch/route across the national capital.

Officials also added that the FOBs will be equipped staircases and lifts as well and will be installed with modern techniques and facilities such as automatic LED light fittings, shelters, ramp facility for physically disabled and suitable for all weather conditions.

A Delhi Traffic Police official said, ""The area is among the heavily congested areas in the national capital. Due to lack of facilities for pedestrian crossings, the red lights and intersections of the Aurobindo Marg witness heavy pedestrian traffic which often results in traffic snarls and its cascading effects are felt on other connecting radial and arterial roads.""

""The stretch falls on the Mehruali-Badarpur (MB) road, where nearly more than lakhs of vehicles use this stretch on a daily basis. Further, there are some bottlenecks on this stretch but we hope once the FoBs become functional, the problem will be solved. Also once the constructions will be completed, the traffic police will execute a plan for the smooth flow of traffic on this stretch and it will be made stretch signal free,"" added the official.

""The PWD should also take interest on the proposal of traffic police to construct a FOB at Rohtak Road National Highway (NH) -10. The stretch has been identified as highly accident prone zones due to lack of crossing facility for pedestrian safety.""

When Speaker Surjya Narayan Patro said giving a reply to any issue is a collective responsibility of Ministers and any one of them can give a reply, BJP members staged the walkout first and their Congress counterparts moved out of House a few minutes later.

In his reply, Minister Behera expressed grief over the deaths and said the deaths and injuries would not have occurred if the driver had not driven the vehicle in an area not permissible for such high buses. The driver has been arrested and his licence has been cancelled.

Families of deceased would be given Rs 2 lakh from the CMRF and Rs 4 lakh by the Energy Department. He assured the House that adequate steps would be taken to ensure that no such incidents occur in future.

Energy Minister Dibya Shankar Mishra too expressed grief and told the House that steps have been initiated for lifting up low-hanging electric line wires to avert such mishaps in future.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---steps-on-to-avert-golanthara-like-mishaps---.html

120,19-2-20,EC makes fresh push for electoral reforms with Law Ministry,"In a fresh bid to push the electoral reforms pending with the Centre, the Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday met the Legislative Department of Ministry of Law and Justice officials.

In a meeting with Legislative Secretary G Narayan Raju, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and Election Commissioners Ashok Lavasa and Sushil Chandra discussed the pending issues, including were linking voter ID with Aadhaar, allowing multiple registration windows to a new voter and ensuring gender neutral rights for ‘service voter’, paid news and false affidavit as electoral offence/corrupt practice; print media and social media intermediaries to be covered under Section 126 of the RP Act 1951. As many as over 40 recommendations for electoral reforms are pending with the Centre.

Sources said linking voter ID with Aadhaar to weed out duplications and misrepresentations from the electoral rolls. Aadhaar linkage and voter authentication are also considered critical to the commission’s plans to work towards electronic, internet-based voting and for giving ‘remote’ voting rights to domestic migrant workers.

Earlier, in a letter to the Law Ministry, the Commission had recently proposed that provisions of the Representation of the People Act be amended to allow EC seek Aadhaar numbers of those applying to be voters and those who are already part of the electoral rolls, sources in the poll panel explained. Accepting the proposal to give it legal backing to collect Aadhaar data, the Law Ministry is learnt to have asked the poll panel to ensure that the data is protected at multiple levels. The EC recently listed out steps to protect the data from possible leaks.

After the meeting, CEC Sunil Arora Arora mentioned that there are more than 40 different proposals of electoral reforms which are pending since long and Commission is at present discussing some of these proposals. “Commission would like to have such meetings with Legislative Department at regular intervals to pursue all such pending proposals” he said. According to EC, the Legislative Secretary assured that the ministry is already examining these proposals.

According to EC, another pending issue is to amend Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.In discussions held until December 2019, the EC had assured that privacy and data safety-related concerns will be addressed. It is now waiting for the government to move the amendment to the Cabinet for approval.

One of these is a proposed amendment to Section 14(b) of the RPA, 1951, which looks at registration for first-time voters as they turn 18 years of age. Currently, only those who turn 18 by January 1of that year are registered as voters.

EC had recommended, way back in 2013, that to ensure that no 18-year-old is denied voting rights, registration should be permitted any day of the year. The law ministry had then suggested only two dates: January 1and July 1. The poll panel is expected to seek multiple registration dates now.

Another recommendation involves amendments to Section 20(6) of the Act to allow the husband of a female officer to be registered as a service voter where she holds office. The EC has also asked the Government to make bribery during poll period a cognisable offence.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ec-makes-fresh-push-for-electoral-reforms-with-law-ministry.html
121,19-2-20,"Cong stages walkout, accuses Govt of turning Karnataka into a police State","Accusing the ruling BJP of turning Karnataka into a ‘police State’ by filing false cases against political opponents and those opposing its “divisive politics”, the Opposition Congress on Tuesday walked out of the Assembly as the Speaker did not accept their demand for an immediate discussion on the issue.

Making a preliminary submission to the Chair to allow his adjournment motion on the ""collapse"" oflaw and order in the state, Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Siddaramaiah charged the Government with having a ""demon instinct"" in suppressing opponents.

After hearing his preliminary submission, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri ruled that a discussion will be held on the topic at 3 PM on Wednesday, but under a different rule.

However, Congress legislators insisted that the discussion be allowed immediately as otherwise it would dilute the issue. As the Chair did not concede their demand, they staged a walk out, threatening to boycott proceedings.

During his preliminary submission, Siddaramaiah alleged that the law and order in the state had completely collapsed as the government has failed to manage it.

Siddaramaiah pointed out that the Governor's address to the joint sitting of the state legislature on Monday did not mention the state-wide anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests and the one in which two people died in Mangaluru in December. By discussing the issue, ""it is our duty to instill confidence among the affected people as we have come here with their mandate, representing them"", he said

123,19-2-20,"No let-up in Elgaar rift, Cong vents out anti-CAA, NPR, NRC stand","With no let-up in the ongoing tug of war between the ruling Shiv Sena and its allies over Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to let NIA investigate the Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad Elgaar Parishad case, the Congress on Tuesday opened a new front by coming out openly against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

On a day when Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena came out in support of the CAA, extended conditional support to the NPR and voiced his opposition to the NRC, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president and party minister in the MVA Cabinet Bal Saheb Thorat formally opposed CAA, NRC and NPR. “The Congress party's stand regarding #CAA #NRC #NPR is very clear and we are opposed to it. The Congress party is opposed to anything that causes discrimination in the society. We will convince our alliance partners on the same,” he tweeted.

For the first time, Uddhav spelt out the Shiv Sena‘s stand on CAA, NRC and NPR. “CAA and NRC are two different subjects. NPR is a third subject. There is nothing to worry about in CAA. NRC has not come and it will not be implemented. If it (NRC) is implemented, it will not affect just Muslims, but it will also affect Hindus, Adivasasis and other deprived sections of the society,” Uddhav tweeted.

In another tweet on NPR, Uddhav said: “NPR is more of a census. But, still I will have a look at the questions in the data collection form. But, I do not there is impediment in NPR. Because, the census takes place once in ten years”.

The NCP has also serious reservations about NPR. After a meeting of NCP ministers convened by party chief Sharad Pawar, the party spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik had said on Monday: “Before devising the strategy on NPR, we -- MVA partners -- will jointly study the questions in the NPR and views of the non-BJP governments. Because some irrelevant and un-called for information is being sought by the Centre as part of the data collection. The NCP is opposed to the date of birth and place of birth of parents and grandparents,” Malik said.

Both the NCP and Congress have urged the chief minister to convene a meeting of the l4eaders of the parties to devise a common strategy on NPR, CAA and NRC.

In a related development, the chief minister’s decision to let the NIA to investigate the Elgaar Parishad case continued be a bone of the contention between the ruling Shiv Sena and its allies in the MVA government.

Uddhav, who has come in for a flak from both the NCP and Congress for his ad hoc decision to let the NIA to investigate Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad Elgaar Parishad case e, sought to clarify his position. “Elghar Parsihad conspiracy and Bhima-Koregaon violence are two different cases. As far as the Bhima-Koregaon case is concerned, it concerns Dalits. I have not given this case to the NIA. I would like to clarify that I will not let injustice to happen to the Dalits”.

However, there was some ambiguity in the NCP’s stand on Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad Elgaar Parishad case. On one hand, like Uddhav, Pawar also said that Elgaar Parishad and Bhima-Koregaon were two different cases. “The CM has powers to hand over the case to the NIA. There was no alternative but to hand over the case tothe NIA, “ Pawar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-let-up-in-elgaar-rift--cong-vents-out-anti-caa--npr--nrc-stand.html

The Centre is very liberal in investing in infrastructure to eliminate service backlogs of northeast with special emphasis on rural areas, Mukhi said at the inaugural session of North East Infrastructure Development Conclave, organised by the CII-North East, here.

A well-planned infrastructure enables established businesses to expand their production levels and encourage small businesses to enter the market and as such, both Central and state governments are making concerted efforts to put in place a robust infrastructure for physical connectivity in the areas of air, water, internet and land transport, he said.

He said the Union budget has allocated funds for laying new tracks and doubling of railway lines in the northeast region, the governor said.

Electrification of railway lines under the Northeast Frontier Railways was also going on and by 2022 the three states of Mizoram, Manipur and Sikkim will be connected by railways, he added.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has also conceived of extensive national highway projects to give a boost to the region's physical connectivity.

The governor also highlighted the measures being undertaken in northeast for bringing the region closer to the rest of the country with 12 airports in the region being operative and the Guwahati Airport being revamped with a new state of the art terminus.

Moreover, a seamless digital connectivity has been in use in the region by liberalising its cyber space with India and Bangladesh signing an agreement for using unspent bandwidth available at Bangladesh's Cox Bazar in Chittagong to bring in a revolution not only in the northeast but also in some mainland states, he said.

Assam is nurtured by two great rivers--the Brahmaputra and Barak and both along with their many tributaries have huge potential for river transport, tourism and industry.

He also said that inland waterways in Assam received a boost during the last five years.

There was an urgent need for strengthening the physical infrastructure of Assam as it was the largest among the eight northeastern states, with a population of 33 million and area of 78 thousand square kilometre, the governor said.

In the face of growing urban population and rising urban infrastructural needs, solutions like planning newer modes of transportation systems especially for congested areas has become the need of the hour, he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/infrastructure-is-a-catalyst-for-development--guv.html

128,19-2-20,Cong slams Govt for hiding data,"Accusing the BJP Government in Gujarat of trying to “hide poverty” by constructing a wall in Ahmedabad ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit there later this month, the Congress on Tuesday charged the Government with hiding data, including that of “lowest” consumption levels in 40 years, and asked it to make it public in order to find solutions to problems plaguing the economy.

Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said playing ‘hide and seek’ has become the favourite game of the BJP Government as it is concealing data pertaining to GDP numbers, inflation, unemployment and “now lowest ever consumption”.

“Favourite game of the BJP Government is hide and seek. Hide farmer suicide statistics. Hide unemployment figures. Hide the truth of demonetisation. Hide real GDP figures. Hide poverty behind the ‘wall’. And now hide the lowest consumption in 40 years,” he said, adding the Government has “launched a war” against all sections of society, including women, students and farmers.

Vallabh alleged that 16 out of 23 sectors in manufacturing are in poor condition, but the Government continues to be in a denial mode. “We ask the Government that data should not be hidden, but made public so it can be discussed as India is capable of battling all odds,” he said.

“Those talking about the Gujarat model are now building walls to hide the poverty there. If a disease is to be treated, you have to accept that it is there in the first place. But BJP does not accept its failures,” he said while taking a dig at the BJP Government over reports of construction of a wall in Ahmedabad to allegedly hide a slum in Ahmedabad.

The Congress leader said the country has had the lowest growth in last nine years and this will definitely reduce savings as well, because inflation is 7.95 per cent. “BJP’s favourite rating agency Moody’s has projected India’s growth estimate for 2020 to be 5.4 per cent, against the Government’s claim of showing 6 to 6.5 per cent growth in the year,” he said.

Vallabh said poverty increases when consumption is low and claimed that UNDP data for 2005-2015 shows that during this period the highest eradication of poverty (271 million people) has taken place in the country and the credit for this goes to MNREGA.

AICC chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said country live in times where GDP is measured in tons, Citizen rights in volts, Nationalism in decibels, Poverty in height and length of the wall. “This is BJP’s ‘New India’!,” Surjewala said on Twitter.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-slams-govt-for-hiding-data.html

This comes a day after a batch of about 200 people were discharged from the ITBP facility, which housed a total of 406 people, including seven Maldivians.

So far, 302 people out of total 406, have left the ITBP centre after being declared free of novel corona virus by the doctors.

The rest of the inmates will be released by Wednesday morning, ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said. All those who were discharged have been provided with conveyance till airport, railway stations, or bus stands.

Among those who will leave the facility on Wednesday include a few families. All released persons were advised to remain self isolated for the next 14 days at their respective places, Pandey said.

They were also advised the dos and don’ts during the period. A team of doctors and other staff are taking care of the smooth departure of the remaining people with due procedures and protocols.

A total of 650 people were brought back from Wuhan in China on February 1 and 2 in two 747 Boeing Air India aircraft after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China. While 406 of these were sent to the ITBP facility, the rest were quarantined at an Army centre in Haryana’s Manesar.

Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong on Tuesday asserted that China has put in place multi-level control and prevention mechanisms and will win the battle against coronavirus.

He added that the outbreak has not been able to impact the strong fundamentals of China’s strong economy.

The envoy said China has allocated RMB 80 billion to contain the disease and the Government has sufficient resources and policy tools to cope with economic fluctuations following the epidemic. At the same time, he said that virus is a “borderless and a common threat to everyone in the world” and joint efforts are required to combat it.

The envoy also appreciated India for extending solidarity and expressing readiness to assist China to deal with the epidemic, but stressed that there should not be any restrictions on trade and movement of people between the two neighbours.

He said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases outside Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, is coming down.

“China has full confidence that it will win the battle against coronavirus epidemic,” he told reporters.

The top court said they are large birds and it is difficult for them to maneuver due to the high-tension power lines which obstruct their flight paths.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) shared the concern of the court and said there is no other option but to lay power cables underground to protect the great Indian bustard (GIB) and lesser florican (LF).

A Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant asked senior advocate Manish Singhvi, appearing for the Rajasthan Government, to take instructions from the competent authority for laying of cables underground.

“It appears that one of the dangers is the presence of power lines, which obstruct the flight path of the of GIB. It is well known that the GIB is a larger bird and it is difficult for it to maneuver easily in its flight. One of the solutions suggested to avoid any collision in its flight path is that the over-head wires be laid down underground”.

It asked Singhvi to take instructions within two weeks and apprise the court about the manner in which the power lines could be laid down underground.

At the outset, the top court said the State Government can look into modifying the contract of private companies for laying down the cables underground.

“This is a larger bird which fly in a particular direction. To avoid power lines coming in the direction of flight path of the bird, it would be appropriate if they are laid down underground. Necessary changes can be made in the contract with the private companies for laying down underground cables,” the bench said.

With regard to LF, the top court said it is not disputed that the bird is also endangered and disturbed largely by the power generation plants.

The top court said if the Rajasthan Government faces any problem, then the court can pass necessary directions.

Additional Solicitor General ANS Nadkarni, appearing for MoEF said a team of the ministry and other wildlife experts have visited Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and it is evident from their findings that underground cable is the only solution.

Advocates Sugandha Yadav, Shatadru Chakraborty and Sonia Dube, appearing for Petitioner MK Ranjitsinh — a retired IAS officer, said that they have prepared terms of reference for the top court appointed panel, which could be looked into for conservation for GIB and LF.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-comes-to-rescue--of-indian-bustard---lesser-florican.html

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has given in-principle nod for upgrading the sanctuary to the tiger reserve.

The State Government has already given approval for its upgradation and now it will have to notify the area to make the region inviolate for the endangered big cats.

As the adjoining tiger habitats — Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) in Karnataka and Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) in Tamil Nadu has been acting as an effective source sink landscape, increasing the density of big cats and their prey in MM Hills, which itself has a resident tigers, the NTCA approval plugs the patch and forms a contiguous landscape of 3,000 sq km of wildlife habitat.

In addition to connecting BRT, through the Edyaralli-Doddasampige elephant corridor, MM Hills also spread over 906 sq km area connects the Bannerghatta National Park.

This is one of the largest landscapes in the country for the conservation of tigers, elephants and other large and wide-ranging mammalian species. The move will go a long way in ensuring protection to the endangered species.

MM Hills will be the sixth tiger reserve in the state and the 51st in the country.

“Based on the confluence of the Eastern and Western ghats, the sanctuary is contiguous with both BRT Tiger Reserve on the western side and Satyamangalam Reserve in Tamil Nadu on the southern side. As per the All India Tiger Estimation, 2018, this area is spread over 907 sqkm and has 15 tigers,” said a senior NTCA official.

He said that in-principle approval has been given, Now the State Government will have to notify the area that will make it official home of the big cats.

Although the number of species present may be less compared to Bandipur or Nagarhole, it is extremely diverse. Biologically, it is an important repository for the future, what with the herbivorous population increasing. There is scope for the expansion of tiger population, added forest officials. Besides being home to tigers, leopards, sloth bears and elephants, the sanctuary also has dholes, antelopes, grizzled giant squirrels and honey badgers.

As per the recent tiger census, Karnataka has 524 big cats. Declaring the MM Hills as tiger reserve will ensure young big cats to have their new territory.

However, the Government has tough task ahead given that there are about 49 forest villages and 94 revenue villages on the peripheries of the sanctuary which will have to be relocated by the officials to make the area inviolate for the big cats.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mahadeshwara-sanctuary-to-be-tiger-reserve.html

Heatwave is considered when maximum temperature of a station is 40 degree Celsius or more for plains and 30 degree Celsius or less for Hilly regions.

According to IMD, maximum temperature in Mumbai is expected around 38 or 39 degree Celsius in the next two days.

Besides, Palakkad topped the temperature charts in Kerala with a maximum of 37.1 degrees Celsius in February. Kerala, once known for its moderate and comfortable climate where people never had to bother about the extreme weather conditions occurring in other parts of the country, is now bearing the brunt of climate change.

This temperature rise is in line with a trend emerging over the last few years when the south-western-most State, and the gateway of the monsoon, heats up well before others and even setting up heatwaves. February has already seen maximum temperatures going well past the 30 degrees Celsius mark at many places in coastal areas.

According to Dr Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist of IMD, a fresh Western Disturbance expected in the hills around February 19 due to which there may be clouding in Delhi for the next three days. Due to this, temperature in Hilly areas and plain are expected to lower for two-three days. This will also lead to rainfalls in isolated places in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttrakhand, Eastern UP, Eastern Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab is expected to get rainfalls from February 20-22. The wind is also going to change during this period from cool northwesterly to warm southwesterly.”At times one does feel the heat as the day temperature during this period tends to rise by 2-4 degrees Celsius due to warm southwesterly winds taking over cool Northwesterly winds. It usually happens when a Cyclonic Circulation forms in the hot and dry Rajasthan region,” Srivastava added.

As per the advisory issued by the IMD, heat wave occurs mostly over an interior plain area when dry and warmer air is transported in a region with clear skies and hence maximum isolation during the summer season.

“Heatwave impacts rural and urban areas, natural habitats like forests, water resources, poultry and a range of sectors like agriculture, health, power etc, Though there is no universally acceptable or uniform definition for a heatwave, they are understood to be periods of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs during the pre-monsoon (April to June) summer season. In India heatwaves typically occur between March to June, and in some rare cases even extend till July. Heatwaves are more frequent over the Indo-Gangetic plains of India,” the IMD said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/severe-summer-in-store-this-yr--imd.html

136,19-2-20,Total debt likely to be 28.8% of State GDP in 2020-21,"The debt burden on the State Government is mounting and the total debt on it from different sources is likely to be over `5.16 lakh crore by the end of next fiscal 2020-21.

The budget size of 2020-21 at `5.12 lakh crore is a little less than the debt burden. The total debt of the state, however, came down from 29.6 per cent of State

Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) in 2017-18 and is estimated to be 28.8 per cent in 2020-21.

With a debt burden of over `5.16 lakh crore, every resident of UP has a debt of `22,442 on their head.

“The debt per person in the state during the 2019-20 fiscal is estimated to be `20,702 as the total debt burden would be little over ` 4.76 lakh crores,’’ Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said while tabling the budget for 2020-21 in the Assembly on Tuesday.

The total debt

burden does not include borrowings from banks and financial institutions by PSUs like UP Power Corporation, UP Housing and Development Board and Urban Development

authorities. The State Government is the guarantor against

the borrowings by the PSUs.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in his post-budget press, said that the Government has strictly adhered to financial discipline and norms under FRBM (Financial Responsibility and Budget Management Act ) and kept fiscal deficit under 3 per cent of SGDP.

In 2018-19, the debt per person was around` 19,239 with a total loan of `4.42 lakh crore and was around Rs 18,476 in 2017-18, when the total debt on the state was Rs 4,064 lakh crore.

Thus, after BJP took over in 2017 and with infrastructure development being focused within a year, each citizen’s debt rose by Rs 1,676.

With a population touching 230 million, the state’s debt burden was hovering around 28 per cent to 30 per cent of the State Gross Domestic Product (GSDP).

Of the total fresh borrowings by the state government during 2020-21, the highest would be market borrowing at Rs 32,346 crore, 18.1per cent of the total loans. The UP government was also expecting loan of Rs 11,815 crore from the Centre, Rs 19,368 crore from financial institutions and Rs 42,277 crore from power bonds.

As per budget statistics, total receipts of the state are estimated at Rs 5,0055 lakh crore, of which 33 per cent would come from state taxes, 30.4 per cent from state share in Central taxes and 14.4 per cent from Central assistance. It will also collect 13.1 per cent of revenue from public loans.

With a total expenditure of Rs 5.12 lakh crore, the highest 37.1 per cent will be spent for payment of wages, pension and allowances to government employees and aided educational institutions and pension. The state will also spend a little over 16 per cent for repayment of loan, while 16.1 per cent will be spent on capital expenditure.

138,19-2-20,Madras HC restrains Muslim body from organising Assembly siege,"The Madras High Court on Tuesday restrained a body of Muslim outfits from going ahead with its proposed agitation to lay siege to the Tamil Nadu Assembly pressing their demand for a House resolution against CAA, NRC and NPR.

A bench of justices M Sathyanaraya and R Hemalatha granted the interim injunction till March 11, restraining the the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations and its allied associations from holding the agitation, proposed for Wednesday.

Passing the interim order on a PIL which sought to forebear the police from granting permission to the agitation, the bench posted the matter to March 12 for further hearing.

The court made it clear that it was not expressing any opinion on the Citizenship Amendment Act, or the National Register of Citizens or the National Population Register.

The siege protest has been called to bring pressure on the AIADMK Govt to adopt a resolution in the assembly opposing the CAA as had been done by several non-BJP ruled states.

An attempt by opposition DMK to move an anti-CAA resolution in the assembly during the session has failed with Speaker P Dhanapal disallowing a notice for it, saying the matter was sub-judice, apparent reference to petitions challenging the amended act in the Supreme Court.

The first phase of the budget session of the state assembly is on till February 20. Earlier, state Additional Advocate General SR Rajagopoal told the court that any application seeking police permission for protest should be made five days prior, but in this case, the federation had moved the police only on Monday for the agitation proposed on Wednesday.

He also submitted that prohibitory orders under Section 41 of the Madras City Police Act have been imposed banning any kind of agitation or demonstration in the city for a period of 15 days commencing from February 13.

Petitioner Varaki, a journalist, contended if the assembly siege was allowed and a large number of protesters permitted to gather near the Secretariat, there would be complete collapse of the normal functioning of the state government.

Referring to continuing agitations, including the latest stir in a north Chennai localilty, by various organisations opposing the CAA and other measures, he alleged innocent public were being incited to join such protests and create problems by spreading rumours.

Besides, some leaders of the organisations were also delivering inciting and intimidating speeches, even going to the extent of issuing threat to the lives of the PM and the Union Home Minister, he submitted.

On Monday, when a mention was made before the first bench, comprising Chief Justice AP Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad, seeking urgent hearing of the matter it directed him to file the public interest litigation and said it would take it up on Tuesday.

However, when the petitioner's counsel sought urgent hearing of the matter before the bench headed by Justice Sathyanaraya on Tuesday, it initially declined to hear the plea and said let it come through the normal course.

However, senior counsel N L Raja for the petitioner appeared before the bench later and pleaded that it be taken up as the agitation was planned for Wednesday and the public will be affected.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/madras-hc-restrains-muslim-body-from-organising-assembly-siege.html

141,19-2-20,GRSE delivers 4th anti-submarine warfare corvette to Navy,"Defence PSU Garden ReachShipbuilders and Engineers Ltd (GRSE) on Tuesday delivered its fourth anti-submarine warfare stealth corvette to the Indian Navy, an official said.

Kavaratti was the last in the series of four anti- Submarine Warfare Corvettes (ASWC) built by Kolkata-based GRSE under Project 28, he said.

The first three ships of the series - INS Kamorta, INS Kadmatt and INS Kiltan -were delivered earlier, and form an integral part of Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy, the GRSE official said.

They have been engaged in several overseas operations and international maritime exhibitions in Malaysia, Singapore and other countries, the official said.

Project 28, approved in 2003, is a class of anti- submarine warship corvettes currently in service with the Indian Navy. The corvettes are named after islands in the Lakshadweep archipelago.

With 90 per cent indigenous content, the P-28 class ships are equipped to fight in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare conditions and featured the integration of a host of weapons and sensors.

These ASW corvettes have catapulted the Indian Navy into the elite club of countries that have built stealth ships, the GRSE official said, adding that the stealth features make the ships almost invisible to the enemy, both above and below the sea surface.

The corvettes - designed as an extremely versatile ASW platform capable of neutralising enemy submarines with indigenous weapons like torpedoes and rocket launchers -- are equally effective in the littorals and deep oceans, the official said.

Capable of attaining a maximum speed of 25 knots, the ship has a length of 109 metres and width of 12.8 metres, he said, adding that it has an endurance of over 3400 nautical miles (NM) at 18-knot speed, and can accommodate 17 officers and 106 sailors.

There had been much speculation that the Budget could be delayed after the 39-year-old son-in-law of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy replaced Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid following his shock resignation on February 13.

He told the BBC: “The guy’s only been in place for a few days. Let’s give him a few days to decide on the date.”

153,19-2-20,RBI Governor says no reason to doubt Govt will meet fiscal deficit targets,"Throwing his weight behind Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget numbers, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that there is no reason to doubt that the government will be able to cut fiscal deficit to 3.5 per cent of the GDP in the fiscal beginning April 1.

In an interview with PTI, Das said the government has remained within the limits set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Committee for the budget deficit.

The government missed deficit target for the third year in a row, pushing shortfall to 3.8 per cent of the GDP in the current fiscal as compared to 3.3 per cent previously planned. The fiscal deficit target for the coming fiscal year starting April 1, has been fixed at 3.5 per cent.

The fiscal deficit is the shortfall in a government’s income compared with its spending. It essentially means that the government is spending beyond its means.

“With regard to the fiscal management of the government, the government has remained within the recommendations FRBM committee,” Das said. “So, therefore, the excess fiscal deficit has been restricted to 0.5 per cent. The government has adhered to that and a large part of the financing of fiscal deficit next year will come from small savings.”

The FRBM committee headed by N K Singh had recommended fiscal deficit to be cut to 2.8 per cent in 2020-21 fiscal and to 2.5 per cent by FY2023.

The panel had suggested an “escape clause” in case of overriding consideration of national security, acts of war, calamities of national proportion and collapse of agriculture severely affecting farm output and incomes. Under this, a deviation from the stipulated fiscal deficit target can be taken but not in excess of 0.5 percentage points in a year.

Das said there is no reason to doubt that the fiscal deficit for the next year would be met.

“There is no reason for anyone to doubt that number. The Budget has been presented just about a fortnight ago,” he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-governor-says-no-reason-to-doubt-govt-will-meet-fiscal-deficit-targets.html

162,19-2-20,India Inc to dole out 9.1% salary hike in 2020: Report,"Companies in India are projected to dole out an average salary hike of 9.1 per cent this year, the highest level in the Asia Pacific region, as they look for key talent and niche skills, says a report.

However, the quantum is lower than 9.3 per cent increase seen in 2019 and also the lowest in a decade.

Leading HR consultancy Aon's annual salary hike survey released on Tuesday also showed that around 39 per cent of the companies surveyed are expected to give as much as 10 per cent increase in pay.

The results are based on responses from over 1,000 organisations spread across more than 20 industries.

In the Asia-Pacific region, India is expected to dole out the highest salary hike at 9.1 per cent, followed by China at 6.3 per cent this year. For India, the previous lowest quantum of hike was 6.6 per cent in 2009, as per Aon. As per the survey, Philippines is anticipated to see a salary rise of 5.8 per cent, followed by Malaysia (5.3 per cent), Singapore (3.8 per cent) and Australia (3.1 per cent) in 2020.

""Despite economic challenges in 2019, organisations in India are taking a positive view. Pay increases in India continue to be the highest in the region,"" Tzeitel Fernandes, Partner (Rewards Solutions) at Aon told reporters here.

A big reason for India's higher salary increase, as compared to other growing economies, is the high inflation rate and the war for key talent and niche skills, Fernandes noted.

In 2019, companies in India gave an average pay increase of 9.3 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in the economy compared to 2018, the survey said.

According to the survey, 39 per cent firms are expected to raise the salary over 10 per cent while 42 per cent would go for an increase between 8-10 per cent.

In the manufacturing segment, pharmaceuticals is expected to give the highest salary hike followed by FMCG and chemicals, among others.

E-commerce and professional services businesses are expected to give double-digit salary increase this year in the services sector.

""We see a reduction in the differences between pay increases across industries, with 85 per cent of the organisations projecting between 7-11 per cent, a sign of maturing business ecosystems.

163,19-2-20,Irdai says ‘yet to get' proposal from LIC on IPO,"Insurance watchdog Irdai is yet to get any proposal from life insurance behemoth LIC on an initial public offering but feels a listing is better from a governance perspective, chairman SC Khuntia said on Tuesday. He also said that there is nothing for the life insurance industry to worry for the time being with regard to government's move on certain income tax exemptions as the alternative to invest still exists.

Khuntia also asked insurance companies to ""weed out"" loss-making products and concentrate only on the better paying ones. On the IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India announced in the budget, he said, ""LIC proposal has not yet come"".

""Any company which goes public there will be better corporate governance and better disclosure,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event of actuaries here.

On being asked if LIC's business will need any restructuring before IPO, Khuntia said that work on the same is being carried out by the government. He said it is a good idea for every insurance company to list and the Insurance Regulation and Development Authority of India (Irdai) will nudge entities to go for the same. It is, however, not making it mandatory to list because smaller companies are yet to achieve the scale for going public, Khuntia said, adding that ideally a company should achieve sufficient scale to list within ten years of its existence.

He said the practice of annual product review needs to be carried out in full seriousness by the players and pitched for a weeding out of the loss making ones.

""I would like to encourage companies to weed out products which are not selling and simply adding to the number, then they will be able to manage those products well,"" he said, adding that the plea was made at a meeting with chief executives recently.

When pointed out about practices where industry players are compromising on financials in the health insurance segment while signing on to group schemes, Khuntia said the Irdai wants players to be sustainable, where they don't create losses nor do they earn excess profits.

He, however, said that Irdai will not intervene on the pricing front but will limit itself to pointing out concerns to the players and issue notices if necessary. Khuntia went public with his disappointment at the low growth levels of the life and general insurance segments despite the under penetration in India. General insurance grew at 14 per cent last year as against its potential to grow at 17-18 per cent, while the life insurance segment grew only at 10 per cent as against the 12-13 per cent potential, he said.

Terming the actuaries as the conscience keepers of the insurance industry, Khuntia asked the Institute of Actuaries of India to take more efforts to increase the number, adding that inherent skill sets in mathematics and software make Indians very amenable to the stream. He said India has only 460 actuaries for a population of 1.30 billion, while the US has 37,000 actuaries despite having less than a third of Indian population.

Khuntia said only LIC has undertaken efforts on micro-insurance and exhorted others to fasten up on the same given the needs in India.

Changing dynamics, including climate change and also aspects like the corona virus outbreak, present newer challenges before the industry and the actuaries will rise up to the same. Khuntia said he is also trying to revive the loss prevention efforts like the now defunct loss prevention society for general insurance, explaining that a reduction in losses can bring down premium costs for policyholders and also make more people embrace insurance.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/irdai-says----yet-to-get--proposal-from-lic-on-ipo.html

Netanyahu is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust under a number of cases in which he is alleged to have accepted lavish gifts from billionaire friends and exchanged regulatory favors for more positive media coverage.

In a brief statement, the court said Netanyahu is expected to attend the initial hearing.

Israel will hold parliamentary elections on March 2, its third vote in less than a year.

167,19-2-20,"Bloomberg makes debate stage, facing Dem rivals for 1st time","Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has qualified for the upcoming Democratic presidential debate, marking the first time he’ll stand alongside the rivals he has so far avoided by bypassing the early voting states and using his personal fortune to define himself through television ads.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published on Tuesday shows Bloomberg with 19 per cent support nationally in the Democratic nominating contest.

The former New York City mayor, who launched his presidential campaign in November, will appear in Wednesday’s debate in Las Vegas alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Fellow billionaire and philanthropist Tom Steyer is still hoping to qualify.

Bloomberg’s campaign said that it was seeing “a groundswell of support across the country” and that qualifying for Wednesday’s debate “is the latest sign that Mike’s plan and ability to defeat Donald Trump is resonating with more Americans.”

“Mike is looking forward to joining the other Democratic candidates on stage and making the case for why he’s the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump and unite the country,” Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement.

The Democratic National Committee recently changed its rules for how a candidate qualifies for the debate, opening the door for Bloomberg to be on stage and drawing the ire of some candidates who dropped out of the race for failing to make prior stages.

The candidates were previously required to receive a certain number of campaign contributions to qualify, but Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated USD 60 billion, is not taking donations.

The prime-time event will be a stark departure from Bloomberg’s highly choreographed campaign. He’s poured more than USD 300 million into television advertising, a way to define himself for voters without facing criticism. While he’s campaigned in more than two dozen states, he does not take questions from voters and delivers a standard stump speech that lasts less than 15 minutes, often reading from a teleprompter.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/bloomberg-makes-debate-stage--facing-dem-rivals-for-1st-time.html
168,19-2-20,Iran sentences alleged US spies to up to 10 yrs in prison,"Iran sentenced eight environmental activists, including an Iranian who reportedly also has British and American citizenship, to prison sentences ranging from four to 10 years on charges of spying for the United States and acting against Iran’s national security, the judiciary said on Tuesday.

According to the judiciary spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, an appeals court issued the final verdicts.

Two of the activists, Morad Tahbaz and Niloufar Bayani, got 10 years each and were ordered to return the money they allegedly received from the U.S. Government for their services.

Tahbaz is an Iranian who also holds U.S. And British citizenship. Iran does not recognize dual or multiple nationalities, meaning Iranians it detains cannot receive consular assistance from their other countries.

In most cases, dual nationals have faced secret charges in closed-door hearings before Iran’s Revolutionary Court, which handles cases involving alleged attempts to overthrow the government.

Esmaili, the judiciary spokesman, said two other activists, Houman Jokar and Taher Ghadirian, each got eight-year sentences for allegedly “collaborating with the hostile government of America.” Another three of the activists, Sam Rajabi, Sepideh Kashan Doust and Amirhossein Khaleghi Hamidi, were sentenced to six years in prison each. The eighth activist, Abdolreza Kouhpayeh, got four years. All the activists were arrested in early 2018.

A ninth activist who was arrested at the time, Kavous Seyed Emami, an Iranian-Canadian naional, died while in custody under disputed circumstances in February 2018.

“The election commission... Declares Mr Ashraf Ghani, who has won 50.64 per cent of the votes, as the president of Afghanistan,” election commission chief Hawa Alam Nuristani told a press conference in Kabul.

“May God help him in serving the people of Afghanistan... I also pray that peace comes to our country,” she added. The results had been delayed for nearly five months after allegations of vote-rigging from Ghani’s main rival, Afghanistan’s Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, forced a recount.

The delay left Afghanistan facing a political crisis just as the US seeks a deal with the Taliban which would allow it to withdraw troops in return for various security guarantees and a promise that the militants would hold peace talks with the Afghan government.

If all goes well, then Ghani is likely to be the man sitting across from the Taliban at the negotiating table in a bid to chart Afghanistan’s future.

179,19-2-20,Maduro says not afraid of military combat in Venezuela,"President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he is “not afraid of military combat,” accusing his US counterpart Donald Trump of plotting to invade Venezuela with the support of regional allies.

“We don’t want war; we don’t want violence; we don’t want terrorism, but we are not afraid of military combat and we are going to guarantee peace,” said Maduro in a televised speech, surrounded by the armed forces high command.

“Donald Trump was convinced that it is easy to get into Venezuela,” said the socialist leader, accusing the US of having assembled a “mercenary force” to invade.

The US is one of more than 50 countries that have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president after Maduro’s 2018 re-election was widely denounced as rigged.

Maduro, however, still enjoys the support of Turkey, Russia, China and Cuba.

He also said there were groups of military “deserters” training in neighboring Colombia to “enter silently and attack military units.” Military exercises were carried out over the weekend, Maduro added, in response to alleged attack plans orchestrated by the US, Colombia and Brazil.

According to official figures, some 2.4 million soldiers and members of the civilian militia were deployed throughout the country. The practices were carried out “based on real threats, not imagined ones,” said defense minister General Vladimir Padrino, who was seated next to Maduro during the president’s speech. Trump vowed to “smash” Maduro’s rule in his annual State of the Union address to Congress, which was also attended by Guaido, earlier this month.

Trump branded Maduro as a “tyrant” during his speech and called Guaido the “legitimate president of Venezuela.” After returning from a three-week international tour, Guaido said a change of Government in his country was “inevitable.” On Sunday, he said the military had the opportunity to make the change less “traumatic.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/maduro-says-not-afraid-of-military-combat-in-venezuela.html

184,19-2-20,Proper strategy is key,"With less than two months left for JEE Mains exam, FIITJEE expert Ramesh Batlish shares tips for last-minute prep

The first phase for admissions to BE/BTech(Paper-I) and BArch/BPlanning (Paper-II) was held between January 6-9, 2020 and the second phase will be held between April 5-11, April 2020. Students have the option to appear in one or both phases. The result will however consider the students' performance in the best of the two phases.

Clearing JEE (Main) is not difficult. Systematic approach towards its preparation will help. The JEE (Main) consists of CBSE syllabus of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and some common topics from Classes XI and XII of State Boards. About 25% questions in the exam are easy, 50% are average and 25% are difficult. The cut-off for JEE (Main) is generally around 65%..

TIPS FOR Physics

Mechanics is one topic that is considered less scoring by most experts. However, this is also the topic that forms the major portion. This topic can’t be neglected.

One must try to concentrate on other scoring topics to ensure a better performance, for example Optics, Electricity and Magnetism.

Kinematics and particle dynamics are important topics of Mechanics that make regular appearances.

Refer to past years’ papers, and sample test papers to understand what to expect when you have started solving advanced level problems.

According to the general trends, Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism are the most important topics in terms of the number of questions asked in JEE of previous years. Vector is one concept that students commonly encounter in dealing with any of these topics, so effort must be taken to understand it properly.

In the decreasing order of the marks they carry are listed different topics of Physics according to their appearance in previous year’s papers.

Thermodynamics is important from the terms of Physics and Chemistry so concentrate on that as well.

TIPS FOR Math

Previous JEE papers suggest that in more attention should be paid to Chapters like Vectors and 3-D than Probability or Indefinite integration as Vectors and 3-D offers very less scope to examiner, as far as variety in questions is concerned. One more chapter is Complex Number, from which every year 2-3 problems are asked. Hence mastering complex numbers, vectors, 3-D and Definite integral must be on top priority.

Keeping in mind the trend of last years’ paper all topics had been covered with more importance given to topics of Algebra, Calculus and Co-ordinate Geometry.

To tackle questions from Co-ordinate Geometry all aspects and the results of Algebraic Calculations of properties of conics must be known.

In chapters of Calculus like Functions, Application of derivatives one can fetch easy marks if graphical approach is adopted.

Trigonometry though having less weightage must not be ignored as it is scoring. One must grasp all important formulae in Trigonometry. This is a scoring topic in Mathematics.

Chapters like Mathematical Reasoning / Determinants/ Statistics/ Mathematical Induction must also be covered to fetch some quick marks as the questions from this chapter are relatively simple.

Refer to past years’ JEE Main papers, and sample test papers to get familiar.

TIPS FOR Chemistry

Conceptual clarity, application skills and awareness to the prescribed syllabus should be the focus.

Practice the most relevant questions daily to develop speed. Pay special attention to topics like Mole concept, Chemical Equilibrium and Electrochemistry.

Take a careful and patient approach for Organic Chemistry giving attention to the topics like Stereochemistry, GOC (General Organic Chemistry) and Functional Group Analysis.

In Inorganic chemistry most of the questions which are asked are conceptual, concerned with structures, processes and applications. Special attention is a must to the topics like Chemical Bonding and Coordination Chemistry.

Special attention should be given to the topics like Biomolecules, Chemistry in everyday life andEnvironmental chemistry.

Special attention to NCERTshould be given as JEE Main is completely NCERT based in Chemistry.

Special attention should be given to the topic Drinking Water. One should try to learn the Threshold Limits for the various ions in drinking water.

Attempt theoretical questions first and then questions which require calculation. It is advisable to avoid numerical questions in the first 10 or 15 minutes of the exam.

Dos

Attempt easy questions first.

Choose sections that have less risk and more gain.

Carefully scroll through the entire question paper in the first five minutes.

Keep a check on time while attempting the paper

Attempt all numerical based type questions as there is no negative marking.

185,19-2-20,‘New learning space with digital education,"There is room for improvement in data-driven decision-making across campuses, says Dr Kulneet Suri

Data and big data have been buzzwords for the last several years. Universities are making great progress when it comes to using data to help with retention and student success. However, there is still much room for improvement to take advantage of data-driven decision-making across the entire campus.

For instance, data can be used to determine if classrooms are being utilised optimally before new construction projects are kicked off. It can and should be used to determine if aging computer labs should be renewed or transformed into something that is more useful to the university. Efforts like these can not only streamline campus operations, but also ensure that we are making most of the resources we have in the service of teaching and learning.

Another area where data can be used more is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data. Historically, GIS data has primarily been used in sciences. But that same data could be analysed in practically any class on a college campus. Think history, political science, criminal justice, urban planning — there is so much data out there, and we can all do a better job of using it.

The future of any innovation in teaching and learning is almost always a combination of all of the following: Academic discipline, pedagogy, learning environment, data and educational technology. And data-informed research and formative evaluation is the key to avoiding just chasing shiny new objects on the one hand and just staying with what we've always done on the other. The foundational blocks for making any headway in analytics, particularly learning analytics, are:

Institutional (rather than vendor) ownership of data generated by teaching and learning activity.

Transparency of data models created through our data (rather than being proprietary).

Data and integration standards.

YouTube began in February 2005, and 12 years later, Wikipedia reports a billion hours of content watched on the platform each day. The sheer volume of educational video creates challenges for faculty in creating new content, as well as finding and reusing content. During the busy academic semesters, faculty do not have time to watch, curate and clip videos! The cognitive overload of video use can be significant, leading us to look for specialised collections like Ted Talks and Khan Academy. Harvard’s DART initiative is one recent effort to try to help faculty and instructional designers make full use of open access assets created for edX MOOCs.

As we increase dependence on instructional videos, we also need to focus on issues of accessibility for people with a range of needs. Digital education is generating new learning opportunities as students engage in online, digital environments and as faculty change educational practices through the use of hybrid courses, personalised instruction, new collaboration models and a wide array of innovative, engaging learning strategies. A 21st Century view of learner success requires students to not only be thoughtful consumers of digital content, but effective and collaborative creators of digital media, demonstrating competencies and communicating ideas through dynamic storytelling, data visualisation and content curation.

As instructors create assignments and develop rubrics for assessing new forms of student work across academic disciplines, faculty and students would benefit from access to new collaborative spaces with the technology and consulting expertise to successfully complete media-rich assignments and projects. One example at Oregon State is in general biology courses, where senior instructors Lesley Blair and Mark Lavery infuse their own lectures with media-rich components and have their students include their own media elements in assignments and social media postings.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---new-learning-space-with-digital-education.html
186,19-2-20,MindIT,"Gone are the days of authoritative and impolite bossism of 70s and 90s. In 21st Century if you want to be accepted and appreciated by your employees you need to put extra effort. No one likes a rude boss or leader or one who doesn't care and listen to. Your team would be attracted to you if you show a little kindness.

Respect: The most important is giving respect. The trade of respect is well defined by nature. You will get respect only, when you give it. Respect people for what they do. Doesn't matter what level they are, they are doing their best in their abilities to perform for whatever job is assigned to them. By showing a little respect to all you deal with, you command unfathomable power, which makes you the real leader.

Lead: Everything rises and falls on leadership so if you're going to create that atmosphere of kindness in your company, your acts of kindness should be seen and not just heard. Try to avoid jokes you know people would get sensitive to, jokes about things like gender, religion and politics would offend a section of the team, you don't want to burn your bridges before you're even midway.

Accept criticism: You may not be right all the time, it's possible that while handling management and other responsibilities in your work you may miss it at some point. So you should welcome criticism.

To be a favourite boss and leader it is important to understand the importance of other people's thoughts and adopt the ability to shift our preconceived notions to the side so we can offer acceptance in response to their thoughts even if they are against us. It is an imperative step in the direction of becoming a leader

Encourage learning: Make it clear that you understand that very few people get it right on their first day or week or month and that you're ready to work with them so they can improve. Try to avoid fatal mistakes by delegating key tasks to proven employees but also get others going for the low hanging fruits so they can build on their confidence.

Promote workplace friendships: If you're that boss that's improving relationships in the office, people would love you. But workplace friendships can get toxic without control, so you shouldn't get it wrong at the beginning.

Pair people with overlapping skills. So if you need work done on your website, don't pair two people with huge egos. Treat every member of your team equally, so these partnerships should be a way to help those lacking in specific skills. And again don't force it, if it's not working, try reshuffling, it's okay to tweak things until you get it right.

Don't put them in the spot: Try to avoid public criticism as much as you can. Work with employees that are not taking the right decisions, help them improve delivery at work. Putting any of your employees on the spot can force them into trying to prove you wrong. And sometimes they try too hard and make more mistakes.

Don't force it: Everyone hates forced friendships because most of them don't just work out. Yes, you should be kind to your employees but if it doesn't flow naturally, it'll be rebuffed. Being professional and exhibiting leadership should be your stance in the early days of this relationship building. Remember it's not your job to be the cool boss but a good relationship with your staff rubs off on your company

Be honest and humble: Don't make promises you can't keep. Employees may have different views on the path they think the company should do but it's up to you to ensure you don't raise their hopes unnecessarily. If there are answers you need to think about, do that, you should be in a composed state when chatting.

191,19-2-20,Numbers matter,"Data science and machine learning offer several opportunities. Kunal Jain shares tips that can help to make it a lucrative option

Technology is changing at a pace that multiple industries are ripe for disruption. What was relevant and sought after a few years ago, is no longer in vogue. Ask a Digital Marketeer, a banker or for that matter a professional in any industry — would they be relevant if they did not learn new things for the last five years?

In a lot of scenarios — having experience is actually going against you. Try saying that you have seven years of experience in NET/Java/software testing and see what opportunities do you get. Now say that you are in your final year of graduation, have a good understanding of machine learning and have been winning data science competitions for a year — you will see floodgates of opportunities open.

The point is that the field for creating impact after graduation has never been this flat before.

Also there has been a slew of new technologies which have become mainstream in the last five years. blockchain, data science, Internet of Devices (IoT), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), reusable space vehicles, new programming languages, new programming frameworks — all of these have come up in the last five years.

So one can’t ask for experience beyond a few years, if one want to hire a lot of people and make fast progress. Among all of these, data science and machine learning probably hold the most number of opportunities as things see today. Data science is now a horizontal impacting multiple industries — banking, telecom, ecommerce and oil & gas. So, it is no surprise that most of the graduates coming out today look up to building careers in data science.

Having said that, a lot of them do not make a meaningful effort in learning and applying the subject. Hence, it is still a very small percentage of people coming out today — who get opportunities in data science. But, with the right preparation and application — there is no limit to the kind of opportunity you can get and the kind of impact you can create.

So, how does one prepare for a data science career as a person graduating soon? Here are some handy tips.

Start learning about data science and programming as soon as you can. It does not matter which stream you are in. As long as you have good quant skills, love problem solving and have a lot of curiosity — you are a good fit with data science roles. Start by learning python, basics of statistics and linear algebra. Once you have done that — you can move ahead with learning data science algorithms and processes.

Apply what you learn. Data science is actually an Applied Science and what better way to stake your claim than showing some applications. You not only learn how to solve problems using these tools and techniques, but also differentiate your resume from all those wanting to do data science but not putting in efforts in the direction. Participate in practice problems on Analytics Vidhya or Kaggle to start with. Once you are comfortable, participate in a few hackathons and data science competitions. You can also pick up open data sets in the area of your interest to create projects and solve problems.

Participate in data science communities and look for mentors. There are some thriving data science communities today in India. Join these communities, interact with data science professionals through meetups, webinars, slack channels and find a few mentors to guide you for the rest of your career.

As long as you have a few years to learn, you can start devoting a few hours daily and build up the momentum over time. If that is not the case and you have placements coming up in the next 3 - 6 months, you will need to put in more effort to cover up for the expectations. There is no dearth of resources available — only time! So make sure you devote high quality time and you can cover the ground.

Remember — you can't really ask for a better time to graduate!

193,19-2-20,For a holistic future,"Business management courses help students to think innovatively. They also help prepare them for unexpected situations that might arise in a business, says Dr Adya Sharma

Business can be characterised as all types of exchange, trading of merchandise and enterprises with the aim of generating profits. But business must be firmly entwined with morals. People, organisations and Governments are consistently broiled with charting out policies pertaining to what is best for an economy and for the development of capital. They are constantly on the lookout to avoid any situation like inflations or recession.

The job of the people in management is characterised by these standards of what is best for individuals and what is best for the organisation, and this requires the ability to understand human conduct and in turn, setting up a compelling style of an initiative.

So, in a world that is heavily relying on the right personnel to execute the right orders, what does a degree in management teach?

What you may discover in a business degree covers an expansive scope of subjects, for example, financial aspects, accounting and innovative strategies that prepare individuals for a plethora of situations. A business degree may begin with learning the pertinent ideas in these fields, to guarantee there will be no critical holes when beginning a vocation. In later years, obligatory modules can be clubbed with specific territories of study, for instance, organisation law or buyer conduct.

It is important that managerial aspirants learn from their own firsthand experience, and hence emphasis on experiential learning as an integral part of curriculum is important.

The course also rather offers one the chance to expand one’s innovative edges. Aside from the theoretical knowledge on subjects, which are pivotal, one will likewise be prepared for unexpected situations that might arise in a business. Even if one has to consider turning an idea into a startup, the educational programme has been designed in a way that every perspective can be checked out.

The best management education cultivates citizenship through a broad-based education that also covers humanities and social sciences.

The potential outcomes for a business graduate are practically innumerable. Positions as an investment banker or a financial regulator might be engaging, however, individuals must be aware of the high-pressure nature of such jobs. Individuals can also work in retail management where major FMCG companies can open doors for individuals with a degree in business management.

The more enterprising students can find success by building their own business without any degree of study. But the lofty expectation to know everything, find funding, and the knowledge to fight the ever-changing business landscape can happen only through a degree in business management.

People who pursue Business Management are also offered a tremendous pay package right from their placements. The degree also additionally allows one to work in various administrative situations in different associations. In this way, with the steady interest of the board, one can develop themselves in their profession significantly.

Management programmes are designed to help in improving one’s holistic abilities. Under this programme, students are made to take a shot at different situations, understand different scenarios and compose projects so that they can confront realistic business scenarios. At the point where every job requires one to be a pioneer, these qualities will be especially significant.

Having a range of abilities relating to business management can help anyone with a rewarding vocation. Getting admission to business management, one can start right after they finish Class XII, as an undergrad programme, or after graduation. There are numerous specialisations that one can decide on, in the center of their profession.

194,19-2-20,It’s all in the name,"Name number is the most important and significant number among the three — name number, psychic number, destiny number. The name number is important for each and every person because the influence of one’s name number, unlike one’s psychic and destiny numbers, continues even after one leaves one’s body.

Your name is the first gift you receive after birth, and it was chosen specifically for you. Your full name is an element in your numerology chart that is explored in depth by finding the various arithmetic factors within it and utilising them as elements of their own.

The name number plays a key role in one’s social life and marriage. This is the reason it was popular to add the family name to the maiden name after marriage. Adding the family name to the maiden name creates harmony with the husband in the family name. It is generally believed but may not be 100 per cent true.

One should always remember that for integration of a new pattern, it takes minimum two-six months (it will take threemonths, if the age of person is between 22-42, it will take two months, if the age is below 21 and five-six months if the age of the person is above 42). The results will be better and faster, if the person is called by a new name more frequently, so as to get its best effects.

If any change is made in the spelling of a name of a person, though the pattern of sound waves in the water in the body remaining the same, then it will take minimum six months to integrate with the body. In such cases whatever the spelling of new name is changed, its integration with the body and subconscious mind will depend upon how frequently the spelling of the name are written or communicated with the people and in the social media.

More and more we start writing the new name with the new spelling, faster the effect will be. If you just change the spelling and remain silent and do not use it frequently, it will never give any effect. The effect is directly proportionate to the frequency with which the new name or its spellings are used. Once after the change you start observing the change in your behaviour, peace of mind then you should think that this new name is vibrating positively with you and the new planet, which is formed start vibrating with your date of birth and results will become positive.

You should go on writing your name with the new addition of alphabet, at least twenty to thirty thousand times on a piece of paper for about ten minutes every day. This will improve vibration of name and the person can perform better.

196,19-2-20,Can’t wait to get Virat out: Boult,"There are no half measures for fit-again New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult who is ready to challenge India captain Virat Kohli on his return to international cricket during the two-Test series starting here on Friday.

Boult was out of action for the past six weeks due to a fracture on his right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia and missed out on the limited-overs leg of the India series.

Back for the traditional format, the left-arm fast bowler made his priorities clear ahead of the first Test.

“That’s personally why I play the game, to get guys like that (Kohli) out and test myself against them, so I can’t wait to get stuck in. But he’s an exceptional player. Everyone knows how great he is,” Boult said, sending out a warning after landing in the capital city for the opening Test.

The Basin Reserve track will have a lot for the seamers and in conditions conducive to seam bowling, a wily customer like Boult might prove to be a handful.

“I’m preparing for a solid wicket. It generally is very good here and goes the full distance (five days). I do enjoy playing here, the history that’s involved, and it’s going to be an exciting week building up. I can’t wait to get out there,” said the 30-year-old who has taken 256 wickets from 65 Tests.

It was frustrating for him to watch his side get walloped 0-5 in the T20 series but exhilarating to when it got its mojo back in the subsequent one-dayers. The Black Caps won 3-0 in the 50-over format.

“I think it is what it is. I have just got to put the last six or so weeks behind me and just back myself to get out there and do my thing,” said Boult, who warmed up by playing a club game at the picturesque Taupo ground.

“I was pushing in off the long run. I think a couple of the clubbies from Taupo really enjoyed that. It was a good afternoon,” added the pacer, who sent down eight overs in a friendly game for his club Cadets.

Professionally, Boult had to lie low due to injury, but it was also a good break as he and wife Lana welcomed their second child.

“Having some time away from the game and having my second son a couple of weeks ago came at quite a good time,” said Boult.

Fighting fit, all he wants now is to get hold of a red kookaburra and get a few to tail into Kohli and company.

“I am hungry to be here and can’t wait to get back in the white and get the red ball moving around,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can---t-wait-to-get-virat-out--boult.html
197,19-2-20,Won’t rule out playing 2023 WC: Taylor,"Veteran New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor doesn't rule out playing the 2023 ODI World Cup but says his form, fitness and motivation level at the end of next year will decide whether he actually manages a place in the squad.

The 35-year-old will become the first cricketer in the world to complete 100 games across three international formats when he steps out for the first Test against India at Basin Reserve on February 21.

“I haven’t ruled it (2023 World Cup) out but I still think it’s a long way away. First and foremost I want to get to next year - the Twenty20 World Cup and then the home summer - and then I’ll have a good idea on how I’m placed at the end of next summer,” Taylor was quoted as saying by ‘stuff.Co.Nz’.

“Whether there is still a drive, whether I’m good enough, whether I’m fit enough, and whether I deserve my spot in the side. If I can tick all those, then definitely 2023 is an option.”

The big-hitting batsman said despite his desire to continue, he won’t out himself under too much pressure.

“You always want to do well and first and foremost the game is more important. At the same time you can put extra pressure on yourself. You've just got to go out and enjoy it and take it as another game. Hopefully I can contribute in any way I can,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/won---t-rule-out-playing-2023-wc--taylor.html

Another former champion, the 2017 and 2018 winner Elina Svitolina, also fell, 6-2, 6-1, to US qualifier Jennifer Brady.

Pavlyuchenkova could not have made a worse start.

“It doesn’t matter what the score is, just play. Slowly I started to turn it around, I started to find my game.”

“I honestly wasn't focusing on the score. Sometimes you can play amazing tennis and still lose 6-1. In the third set, it was a good level from both of us.”

201,19-2-20,AC Milan eye Euro spots after Torino win,"AC Milan closed in on the European places in Serie A after Ante Rebic fired them to a 1-0 win over Torino.

Rebic on Monday swept home Samu Castillejo’s low pull back in the 25th minute to consign to draw Milan level on 35 points with Hellas Verona, who currently occupy the final Europa League spot on goal difference.

Rebic’s winning goal was his sixth in seven games in all competitions, a run that comes after failing to score at all in the first half of the season.

The Croatian’s strike helped the hosts bounce back from last week’s derby disappointment against Inter Milan to continue a positive run under coach Stefano Pioli that also saw them unlucky not to beat Juventus in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg last week.

They have lost just once since the turn of the year — to title-chasing Inter — and are playing well enough to aim for European football next season.

However the Champions League will likely be beyond them thanks to the 10-point gap between them and fourth-placed Atalanta.

Torino meanwhile are inching closer to the relegation zone after their fifth straight defeat, a slump that shows little sign of ending.

202,19-2-20,Spurs holding on for dear life after Son’s injury: Mourinho,"Tottenham Hotspur’s hopes of obtaining something from the season have been equated to someone hanging on for dear life from a balcony in a typically colourful analogy by their manager Jose Mourinho.

The 57-year-old Portuguese made the comparison after he said he believed Korean star Son Heung-min's season could well be over due to a fractured right arm.

Mourinho is already without star striker Harry Kane — side-lined since January with a torn hamstring -- as the club enters a crucial period. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko is another long-term casualty.

Spurs host German side RB Leipzig in a Champions League Last 16 first leg match on Wednesday and play Chelsea in a match that could prove pivotal in the dog-fight for the fourth and final Champions League spot.

“You know I like analogies,” said Mourinho, who took over after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked in late November last year.

“Sometimes I do good ones and sometimes silly ones. This time I do this.

“When we arrived we were in minus 12 floor, we got on the stairs and we started climbing.

“But immediately the stairs broke and trouble.

“We were trying to find a way.

“Lots of effort but we were going and going.

“Then 11th floor and when we arrived on the fourth floor, where we wanted to arrive, someone took the stairs away so we are now in trouble.

“We are holding by our arms on the balcony.”

Mourinho said the club were at a crossroads in their season.

“Now we have two options,” he said.

“To fall and die because it's the fourth floor.

“The other is to climb. We will be on that balcony fighting with everything we have.”

‘We miss him’

Son's absence comes as a cruel blow to the player and the team as he had been in a rich vein of form scoring in the last five matches after filling in for Kane up front.

The 27-year-old South Korean international forward suffered the injury in the 3-2 Premier League victory over Aston Villa— in which he scored twice including the late winner — on Sunday.

Son suffered the injury in a robust first-minute challenge from Villa's Ezri Konsa. The club did not specify how long Son would be out -- he is due to undergo surgery this week -- but Mourinho was pessimistic.

“I’m not going to count on him again this season,” Mourinho said.

The club said only after the medical operation would they be able to say how long he would be absent.

“Following surgery, our medical staff shall be reviewing management options for Son's rehabilitation with the player expected to be sidelined for a number of weeks.”

Mourinho said he would have phrased the statement differently.

“The club wrote a nice statement,” he said.

“If I was the one to write the statement I would write different. We miss him,” added the 57-year-old Portuguese.

With both Kane and Son missing, Lucas Moura looks like having the burden placed on him as Mourinho discounted untested Irish youngster Troy Parrott.

“In some periods I was worried about not having attacking options on the bench, now it’s not having attacking options on the pitch,” said Mourinho.

""My thoughts are that Troy Parrott is not ready and Ryan Sessegnon is not a striker.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spurs-holding-on-for-dear-life-after-son---s-injury--mourinho.html
203,19-2-20,‘One can rely on scholarships and grants for funds’,"There is always a way to ease financial burden while studying abroad, says Rohit Sethi

Pursuing education abroad can be a costly affair for many. It is not just the tuition fees but also the living expenses that need to be taken care of. With the fall in the value of rupee every year, it is only adding up to the burden.

Managing funds in a foreign country can be relatively challenging. If unable to manage expenses of their three-year graduate programme, students are compelled to seek part-time employment, which is good but sometimes end up becoming a priority.

Relying on scholarships and grants for funding options: Expenses vary in every country considering the currency exchange value, the university and the course. Students can look out for managing their tuition fees and scholarships and grants are the best possible financial aid in this case. There are merit-based scholarships offered by the Federal and State Government, large corporations, local businesses, professional organisations or universities. Students can also opt for programme-based scholarships and specific allowances provided on the basis of factors like gender, race, religion, disabilities, or sexual orientation. For instance, scholarships programs like Benjamin A Gilman Scholarship or Diversity Abroad Scholarships can be beneficial for diverse students searching for financial aid. Finally, there are grants, mostly need-based that doesn't require to be repaid. They are mostly given on the basis of financial circumstances but may also consider other factors like physical or mental disabilities. The Department of Education in the US offers several federal grants to students who attend four-year colleges or universities and community colleges. Germany, too, awards numerous merit-based grants. For example: The University of Hamburg offers a merit grant of 720 – 1,000 EUR/month for two semesters (12 months).

Some external agencies and trusts also provide scholarships. However, bagging a scholarship is not an easy process as thousands of students target for the same. Students are required to go through a number of exams to determine their eligibility.

204,19-2-20,In brief,"Content in Hinglish to make learning easier

The Lido Learning announced the launch of live tutorials in Hinglish to facilitate easier adoption of concepts and simplify e- learning across India. Students in metro and smaller cities are more comfortable with Hinglish.

The emergence of ed-tech in Tier II and Tier III cities in India is largely due to the availability of educational content in vernacular languages. Despite children going to English medium schools, research shows that many students struggle with English as a language. Students especially struggle when studying and trying to grasp complex concepts in other subjects like Math and Science that are taught in English.

Sahil Sheth, founder-CEO, said: “Students and their well-being is at the center of everything that we do. Subjects like Math and Science can be complex and mind-numbing for many, learning the curriculum in a language they are comfortable can keep them more engaged. The launch of Hinglish content was prompted by our core belief that a student must be in a comfortable space while learning and have accessibility to educational content in diverse languages.”

205,19-2-20,Limited DRS use was always planned for Ranji semifinals,"The limited use of Decision Review System was always planned for the Ranji Trophy semifinals and not from the knockout stages, clarified BCCI’s general manager of cricket Saba Karim on Tuesday.

The move to introduce limited DRS comes after the umpires committed some howlers in some knockout games of the previous season. However, the quarterfinals starting on Thursday will not see the use of DRS.

“We are introducing from the semifinals. This the first time we have initiated this program, we wanted to bring in semifinals and we have done that. It was never meant for the quarterfinals,” Karim, also a former India wicketkeeper, told PTI.

“The whole idea is that we wanted to bring in the DRS wherein we can have uniformity for both the games and that will be in the semifinals. All the four teams have been pitted equally and that would not have been possible before (in quarters),” he said.

The restricted technology for Ranji semis will not have Hawk Eye and Ultra Edge, two key components of the DRS used in international games.

“We will be using the technology which is available to us. We are looking at a very limited use of the DRS. We don't have snickometer and ball tracking. We have red zone and we have spin vision and we will try and give whatever is available to umpires for them to decide,” added Karim.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/limited-drs-use-was-always-planned-for-ranji-semifinals.html
206,19-2-20,‘Hope Pandya gets to play some cricket before IPL’,"Mumbai Indians bowling coach Shane Bond wants all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who is recovering from a back surgery, to play a few matches before the Indian Premier League, beginning March 29.

“I only hope he gets to play some cricket before the IPL and always believe it’s better to spend a little bit longer for coming back rather than rushing it,” Bond said.

“There’s no doubt he can come back. I am just pleased that they are taking an orthodox approach with Hardik’s rehabilitation and T20s, especially IPL will be nice for him to comeback as he will not be over-bowled.”

Pandya underwent a productive net session at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru recently.

He was seen facing throwdown in the nets and mainly played with a straight bat. It is not yet clear if he will make a comeback in the South Africa ODIs next month or the IPL.

Earlier this month, Pandya was ruled out of the Test series against New Zealand after failing to regain full match fitness.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---hope-pandya-gets-to-play-some-cricket-before-ipl---.html
207,19-2-20,‘NZ’s conservative approach against Bumrah will soon be adopted by others’,"New Zealand’s conservative approach against Jasprit Bumrah could become a template for other teams as they look to tackle the Indian pace ace who recently endured a rare wicket-less outing in an ODI series, reckons former fast bowler Shane Bond.

The premier bowler copped criticism for his lean run during the three ODIs against New Zealand and Bond put that down to expectations.

“That's the nature of expectations when you got a bowler of Jasprit's quality,” Bond, the fastest New Zealand bowler during his time, told PTI in an exclusive interview.

“I thought New Zealand played him well and identified him as a risk. They have played him conservatively and obviously there was some inexperience around (Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur),” he said.

“All teams will now identify him as a risk and attack others. So that’s where the bowling group and what they do (as a group) is massive. It is not an easy place to bowl as wickets are flat.”

But Bond felt Bumrah's bowling wasn't all that bad during the series, which India lost 0-3.

“At the end of the day, all you can do is try and bowl well. He bowled reasonably well but sometimes you don't get wickets,” Bond said.

Bond, who has spent considerable amount of time with Bumrah as the Mumbai Indians bowling coach in the IPL, nonetheless expects India's premier strike bowler to have a “massive impact” on the two-Test series starting Friday.

“When you come back from a lay-off, it’s always hard to get into the groove. Just that he hadn't had a lot of game before the series and conditions are a bit foreign,” said Bond.

“Although New Zealand played him well in limited overs, Jasprit will have a massive impact on the Test series. I have no doubt about that,” added the bowler, whose promising career was cut short by numerous injuries.

“It always takes time to get back to top form because there is no substitute of game time. So it’s good for Jasprit that he is leading into Test matches with some short form cricket,” said Bond, who played 18 Tests, 82 ODIs and 20 T20 Internationals.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---nz---s-conservative-approach-against-bumrah-will-soon-be-adopted-by-others---.html
208,19-2-20,Jamieson credits shift to Auckland for making him better cricketer,"Towering New Zealand pacer Kyle Jamieson has revealed that moving from Canterbury to Auckland helped him get rid of a detrimental aggressive streak and become a cricketer worthy of national duty.

The 6’8” tall pacer, who made his ODI debut against India in the recent series, was handed a place in the Test squad for the upcoming two-match rubber beginning at Basin Reserves here on February 21.

“I’m a pretty fiery character on the field. On the field I’m pretty aggressive. I think it came out in ways I necessarily didn’t like. I would sort of do it and then post-game be like,’What did I do that for?” he was quoted as saying by ‘stuff.Co.Nz’.

Jamieson shifted to Auckland, where he was born, prior to this season after making his T20 debut for Canterbury in 2016 in the Super Smash.

He said there was a lot of negativity around him in Canterbury, where he grew up, and it affected his behaviour.

“There was a bit of negativity surrounding myself and that environment and that was coming out in my behaviour on the field,” he said.

The 25-year-old said returning to Auckland made a massive difference to his game.

“I’m really enjoying my cricket, which is probably something I couldn’t say a couple of years ago,” said Jamieson, who scored 25 and took 2 for 42 on debut during the second ODI against India at Eden Park.

“I was going through a bit of stuff off the field. Just the chance to come in with this group and turn up and learn everyday - try and better myself as a cricketer - was something that was too hard to turn down, so look, it’s been massive for my game.

“...It was just a shift that I needed to make. Most importantly, I needed to be happy and I needed to enjoy my cricket. Wherever that may take me, then it will,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jamieson-credits-shift-to-auckland-for-making-him-better-cricketer.html

216,19-2-20,"India to switch to world's cleanest petrol, diesel from Apr 1","India will switch to the world's cleanest petrol and diesel from April 1 as it leapfrogs straight to Euro-VI emission compliant fuels from Euro-IV grades now - a feat achieved in just three years and not seen in any of the large economies around the globe.

India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissions that are said to be one of the reasons for the choking pollution in major cities.

Sanjiv Singh, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) - the firm that controls roughly half of the country's fuel market, said almost all refineries began producing ultra-low sulphur BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI grade) petrol and diesel by the end of 2019 and oil companies have now undertaken the tedious task of replacing every drop of fuel in the country with the new one.

""We are absolutely on track for supplying BS-VI fuel from April 1. Almost all refineries have begun supplying BS-VI fuel and the same has reached storage depots across the country,"" he said.

From storage depots, the fuel has started travelling to petrol pumps and in the next few weeks all of them will only have BS-VI grade petrol and diesel, he said. ""We are 100 per cent confident that fuel that will flow from nozzles at all the petrol pumps in the country on April 1 will be BS-VI emission compliant fuel.""

India adopted Euro-III equivalent (or Bharat Stage-III) fuel with a sulphur content of 350 ppm in 2010 and then took seven years to move to BS-IV that had a sulphur content of 50 ppm. From BS-IV to BS-VI it took just three years.

""It was a conscious decision to leapfrog to BS-VI as first upgrading to BS-V and then shifting to BS-VI would have prolonged the journey to 4 to 6 years. Besides, oil refineries, as well as automobile manufacturers, would have had to make investments twice - first to producing BS-V grade fuel and engines and then BS-VI ones,"" he said.

State-owned oil refineries spent about Rs 35,000 crore to upgrade plants that could produce ultra-low sulphur fuel. This investment is on top of Rs 60,000 crore they spent on refinery upgrades in the previous switchovers.

BS-VI has a sulphur content of just 10 ppm and emission standards are as good as CNG.

Originally, Delhi and its adjoining towns were to have BS-VI fuel supplies by April 2019 and the rest of the country was to get same supplies from April 2020.

But oil marketing companies switched over to supply of BS-VI grade fuels in the national capital territory of Delhi on April 1, 2018.

The supply of BS-VI fuels was further extended to four contiguous districts of Rajasthan and eight of Uttar Pradesh in the National Capital Region (NCR) on April 1, 2019, together with the city of Agra.

BS-VI grade fuels were made available in 7 districts of Haryana from October 1, 2019.

Singh said the new fuel will result in a reduction in NOx in BS-VI compliant vehicles by 25 per cent in petrol cars and by 70 per cent in diesel cars.

The switchover, he said, is a tedious task as every drop of old, higher-sulphur content fuel has to be flushed out in depots, pipelines and tanks before being replaced by BS-VI.

""We are confident of disruption-free switchover to BS-VI supplies across the country,"" he said. ""What we will be supplying is the best quality available anywhere in the world. You don't have any better fuel that is supplied in any part of the world. Perhaps our BS-VI fuel will be better than equivalent fuel in some parts of the US and Europe.""

India adopted a fuel upgradation programme in the early 1990s. Low lead gasoline (petrol) was introduced in 1994 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. On February 1, 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide.

Similarly, BS-2000 (Euro-I equivalent, BS-1) vehicle emission norms were introduced for new vehicles from April 2000. BS-II (Euro-II equivalent) emission norms for new cars were introduced in Delhi from 2000 and extended to the other metro cities in 2001.

Benzene limits have been reduced progressively from 5 per cent in 2000 to 1 per cent nationwide. Lead content in gasoline was removed in phases and only unleaded gasoline is being produced and sold from February 1, 2000.

The octane number of gasoline signifies the improved performance of the engine. Loss in octane number due to phasing out of lead was made up by installing new facilities in the refinery and changes in refinery operation. RON (Research Octane Number) of gasoline for BS-2000 spec was increased to 88. This has over time been increased to 91.

Singh said sulphur reduction will reduce Particulate Matter (PM) emissions even in the in-use older generation diesel vehicles.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-to-switch-to-world-s-cleanest-petrol--diesel-from-apr-1-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-to-switch-to-world-s-cleanest-petrol--diesel-from-apr-1.html
217,19-2-20,Malaysia suspected MH370 downed in murder-suicide: Aussie ex-PM,"Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has claimed ""very top"" level Malaysian officials believed vanished Flight MH370 was deliberately downed by the captain in a mass murder-suicide.

The Malaysia Airlines jet vanished on March 8, 2014 carrying 239 people -- mostly from China -- en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

No sign of the plane was found in a 120,000-square kilometre (46,000-square mile) Indian Ocean search zone and the Australian-led search, the largest in aviation history, was suspended in January 2017.

A US exploration firm launched a private hunt in 2018 but it ended after several months of scouring the seabed without success.

The disappearance of the plane has long been the subject of a host of theories -- ranging from the credible to outlandish -- including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.

In an excerpt from a Sky News documentary airing Wednesday, Abbott claims he was told within a week of it vanishing that Malaysia believed the captain had intentionally downed the jet.

""My very clear understanding from the very top levels of the Malaysian government is that from very, very early on here, they thought it was murder-suicide by the pilot,"" he said.

""I'm not going to say who said what to whom but let me reiterate, I want to be absolutely crystal clear, it was understood at the highest levels that this was almost certainly murder-suicide by the pilot -- mass murder-suicide by the pilot.""

Zaharie's family and friends have long strongly rejected such claims as baseless.

Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the former head of Malaysia's civil aviation regulator, criticised Abbott's remarks and said there was not sufficient proof to support the idea.

""It is only a theory,"" Azharuddin, who led the regulator when Flight MH370 disappeared, told AFP.

""You do this speculation and it will hurt the next of kin. The family of the pilot will also feel very bad because you are making an accusation without any proof.""

In 2016, Malaysian officials revealed the pilot had plotted a path over the Indian Ocean on a home flight simulator but stressed this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.

But they failed to come up with any firm conclusions, leaving relatives angry and disappointed.

Six passengers were Australian, including four from Queensland state, where Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk this week suggested authorities may pursue an inquest into their deaths.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/malaysia-suspected-mh370-downed-in-murder-suicide--aussie-ex-pm-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/malaysia-suspected-mh370-downed-in-murder-suicide--aussie-ex-pm.html
218,19-2-20,Sunil opens India's Gold account,"Competing in 87kg category wrestler rewrites history and becomes third Indian to win yellow metal in Greco-Roman

Wrestler Sunil Kumar won India’s first Gold medal in the opening day of Asian Wrestling Championship 2020 here at KD Jadhav stadium on Tuesday after beating Kyrgyzstan opponent Azat Salidinov 5-0 in the final match of 87kg Greco-Roman category.

Last edition Silver medallist dominated the entire game and didn’t allowed his counterpart to gain any sort of breathing space and in process put a full stop to country’s 27-year drought for the yellow metal. Sunil now becomes only the third Indian ever to achieve this feat.

His comprehensive defence was able to keep Salidinov at bay for most of the bout. Salidinov didn't have an answer to the strategy of Sunil and finally went down pretty easily.

Earlier on his way to the final Sunil made an impressive comeback in the semi-final bout. He came back from 1-8 down to win the bout 12-8. This was an improvement for Sunil from his 2019 performance in the same tournament where he won a Silver Medal.

Speaking after the win he said, “I am feeling happy to have earned India's first Gold Medal today (Tuesday). I have worked really hard on my ground techniques and it feels good to have done better than my last year's performance.”

Before Sunil’s historic Gold medal win, Arjun Halakurki (55kg) opened India’s medal account with a Bronze medal defeating Donghyeok Won of Korea.

Arjun started the bout slowly and was down by 1-4 in the first period. But, Arjun didn't give up and came back strongly snatching six straight points with a combination of good defence and attack. The final score at the end of the bout was 7-4 in favour of Arjun.

However, India’s third medal hope Mehar Singh (130 kg) suffered a setback as he lost his bout against Roman Kim of Kyrgyzstan by a narrow scoreline of 2-3. Mehar was majorly suffering the aftereffects of his wrist injury which he suffered in his semi-final bout earlier.

In other winners of the day, Iran's Pouya Mohammad Naserpour won 55kg Gold medal with a comfortable 8-0 win over Uzbekistan’s Jasurbek Ortikboev. While, 63kg Gold went to Uzbekistan's Elmurat Tasmuradov, who win with a scoreline of 9-0 against Korean Jinseub Song. Also, Kazakhstan's Tamerlan Shadukayev bags 77kg title.

Today, national champion in 60kg category and last edition Bronze medallist, Gyanender will fight the biggest battle of his life against reigning world champion Kenichiro Fumita of Japan in the quarterfinals.

While the youngest member of India’s Greco-Roman squad Ashu will enter the mat against unherald Fu Hao Lin of Chinese Taipei. And if he wins, in the semis, he will play the winner of Mohammad Alhasan of Syria vs Makhmud Bakhshilloev of Uzbekistan. Bakhshilloev won the Rome ranking series Gold and also won the world championships Silver medal in 2019.

Also in the 72kg Non-Olympic category, Aditya Kundu, who is making a comeback to the Indian team after winning 2017 Commonwealth Championship Gold will be up against Alijon Khuseynov of Uzbekistan who is making his senior debut at the Asian Championships.

While in the Olympic category of 97kg, national champion in the weight Hardeep has drawn Abdollah Saravi of Iran in the last 8 battle. Under 23 world Bronze medallist, Saravi will be a tough nut to crack for Hardeep and he needs to be at his best to put it across the Iranian.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sunil-opens-india-s-gold-account-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sunil-opens-india-s-gold-account.html
219,19-2-20,India's openers may be inexperienced but they are classy: Southee,"India's opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithivi Shaw may be inexperienced but has enough talent to make a difference in the upcoming two-Test series, feels senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee.

With Rohit Sharma ruled out due to hamstring injury and KL Rahul not selected, the onus is on Shaw (2 Tests) and Agarwal (9 Tests) to give India a good start against the likes of Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Matt Henry in the series beginning on Friday.

""They are missing a couple of guys due to the injury but there are plenty guys who are talented and capable of stepping up when required. They had a good outing in Hamilton. Although, they may be inexperienced but at the same time, they are class players,"" Southee told PTI during a brief interaction on Wednesday.

An open venue like Basin Reserve with cross breeze blowing across the ground could be a factor and a lot will depend on how quickly India adapt to the conditions.

""Obviously, these are home conditions and it favours us. But there are a number of things that you need to do well in here at the Basin Reserve and India will have to get used to it in the next three days,"" Southee gave a subtle warning to the visiting team.

However, when it comes to India, they have been the top Test nation for a considerable period time and opposition needs to respect that.

""It's a completely different format. India have played great Test cricket for a long period of time so it should be an evenly contested Test series.""

He attributes his long-standing successful ball pairing with Trent Boult to their friendship and knowing each other's skills well enough.

""We have complemented each other for long with the left-arm and right arm combination. We are both capable of swinging the ball and knowing each other's skills for so many years having played a lot of cricket together. We form a good partnership and hopefully we can carry it into the series,"" he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-openers-may-be-inexperienced-but-they-are-classy--southee-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-s-openers-may-be-inexperienced-but-they-are-classy--southee.html

221,19-2-20,"UN chief applauds Pakistan, censures India during Islamabad trip","Just a week ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to New Delhi, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres during his four-day trip to Islamabad applauded Pakistan for its peace efforts and expressed concern for the Muslims in India.

Before concluding his Pakistan visit on Wednesday, the UN chief in an interview to Pakistani newspaper Dawn commented on India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which fast-tracks citizenship of persecuted religious minorities of its three neighbouring Islamic theocracies.

The Dawn quoted Guterres as saying that there was a ""risk of statelessness for two million Muslims excluded by the divisive Citizenship (Amendment) Act passed by the Indian Parliament.""

Guterres also told Dawn that he was personally concerned about the rising discrimination against the minorities in India. The newspaper claimed that the UN chief said: ""All the reports, including two by the UN High Commissioner, in the international media, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and recent fact-finding reports on Kashmir released in New Delhi, regarding torture, sexual abuse and incarceration of children as young as seven by the Indian military"", played an important role in ""clarifying exactly what is happening"" in Kashmir and ""it is essential that these reports are taken seriously"".

The UN chief made no mention of Pakistan's cross-border terrorism in Kashmir for the last three decades. Instead, while visiting Pakistan's Kartarpur Corridor constructed to facilitate the visit by Sikh pilgrims from India, Guterres praised Pakistan for opening ""a symbol of interfaith harmony.""

During his four-day trip, the UN chief showed huge admiration for Pakistan and patted the Imran Khan government on its back for its peace efforts. ""For 40 years, Pakistan has sheltered Afghan refugees. I urge the world to support host countries and show similar leadership in standing with the refugees. The country has stood in solidarity with the refugees from Afghanistan for 40 years, showing how generosity is not always proportional to wealth,"" he said.

The UN Secretary General said that Pakistan is one of the most consistent and reliable contributors to the UN peacekeeping efforts around the world. ""I am closely following vital peace efforts in Afghanistan to reduce violence, especially against civilians. By building regional consensus, Pakistan's role in this process remains crucial,"" he tweeted.

Sources in Islamabad said that the Imran Khan government had lobbied hard to invite Guterres in view of the fact that US President Donald Trump was skipping Pakistan and visiting only India during his maiden trip to the region.

""The UN chief was invited to handle the opposition at home and also pacify domestic constituency that is unhappy about an ailing economy and failing diplomacy even as Prime Minister Khan has been travelling around the world and campaigning against India over Kashmir,"" said an Islamabad-based politician who did not want to be named.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-chief-applauds-pakistan--censures-india-during-islamabad-trip-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/un-chief-applauds-pakistan--censures-india-during-islamabad-trip.html
222,19-2-20,First meeting of Ram Mandir Trust today,"The first meeting of the Ram Mandir Trust to oversee construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya will be held here on Wednesday at the Delhi residence of K Parasaran, the head of the Trust.

The Trust has been constituted by the Narendra Modi government.

The trust meeting is likely to finalise the date to start construction of the Ram Temple.

Modi had announced the formation of the 15-member trust in Parliament on February 5. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust has seven members, five nominated members and three trustees.

223,19-2-20,Workload takes toll but will play all formats for at least 3 more years: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli is preparing himself for a ""rigorous three years"" of playing all three formats after which he might reassess his workload amid a ""transition phase"" setting in.

The world's premier batsman is looking at the ""bigger picture"" in Indian cricket with two T20 and one 50-over World Cup in the next three years after which he might decide on playing two of the three formats.

""My mindset is on the bigger picture as I prepare myself for a rigorous three years from now and after that we might have a different conversation,"" Kohli replied when asked if he is having second thoughts about quitting at least one format after the 2021 World T20 in India.

The skipper was speaking to the media ahead of the two-Test series against New Zealand starting on Friday.

He didn't mince any words while admitting that fatigue and workload management are issues that need to be discussed at all forums.

""It's not a conversation you can hide away from in any manner. It is around eight years now that I have been playing 300 days a year, which includes travelling and practice sessions. And intensity is right up there all the time. It does take a toll on you,"" the Indian captain was forthright in his reply.

Kohli, who will turn 31 this year, agreed that periodic breaks have worked well for him.

""It's not that the players are not thinking about it all the time. We do choose to take lot more breaks individually even though the schedule might not allow you to. Especially from guys, who play all the formats.""

For Kohli, it is not just about his performance alone but also the leadership which needs him to have his brain ticking all the time to devise strategies.

""It's not easy being captain, having that intensity in the practice sessions. It does take a toll on you. Periodic breaks seem to work pretty okay for me.

""At a time where the body can't take anymore, maybe when I am 34 or 35, we will have a different conversation. For the next two to three years I have no issues at all,"" he said.

The skipper understands his presence and peak performance is crucial till the 2023 World Cup after which he understands that the next phase of transition will set in.

""I can keep going on with the same intensity and also understand that the team wants a lot of my contribution in the next two to three years, so that I can ease into another transition that we faced five-six years ago,"" he said referring to the retirements of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/workload-takes-toll-but-will-play-all-formats-for-at-least-3-more-years--kohli-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/workload-takes-toll-but-will-play-all-formats-for-at-least-3-more-years--kohli.html
224,19-2-20,Saving big trade deal with India for later: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said he is ""saving the big deal"" with India for later and he ""does not know"" if it will be done before the presidential election in November, clearly indicating that a major bilateral trade deal during his visit to Delhi next week might not be on the cards.

""We can have a trade deal with India. But I'm really saving the big deal for later,"" he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews Tuesday afternoon (local time).

Trump is scheduled to visit India on February 24 and 25.

The US and India could sign a ""trade package"" during the visit, according to media reports.

Asked whether he expects a trade deal with India before the visit, Trump said, ""We're doing a very big trade deal with India. We'll have it. I don't know if it'll be done before the election, but we'll have a very big deal with India.""

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the point-person for trade negotiations with India, is likely to not accompany Trump to India, sources said. However, officials have not ruled it out altogether.

In an apparent dissatisfaction over US-India trade ties, Trump said, ""We're not treated very well by India."" But he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he is looking forward to his visit to India.

""I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,"" Trump said.

""He told me we'll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under construction, but it's going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it's going to be very exciting... I hope you all enjoy it,"" he told reporters.

Meanwhile, the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) in a report said the latest quarterly data depict continuation of overall positive bilateral trade trends. The third quarter data reflects some downslide in growth rates.

""It may be due to several reasons, including the unexpected economic slowdown in India's economic growth, impact of US-China trade war, GSP withdrawal from the US side and retaliatory tariffs on specific US goods from the Indian side,"" USISPF said.

According to the report, the data available for the first three quarters of 2019 (January-September) pulled the overall growth rate in cumulative bilateral trade down to 4.5 percent from 8.4 percent registered for the first two quarters.

Goods and services trade performance in third quarter was dismal at -2.3 percent, in contrast with the impressive 9.6 percent growth witnessed for the first two quarters of the year; while trade in services was up two percent goods trade dropped five percent, the report said.

The cumulative US-India trade in goods and services (USD 110.9 billion) for the first three quarters of 2019 increased 4.5 percent with US exports and imports growing at four percent and five percent respectively.

The US exported USD 45.3 billion worth of goods and services to India in the first three quarters 2019, up 4 percent from the corresponding period in the previous year; and the US imported USD 65.6 billion worth of goods and services from India, up five percent from the previous year's USD 62.5 billion level for the same period, it said.

The USISPF has projected that the total bilateral trade can touch USD 238 billion by 2025 if the current 7.5 percent average annual rate of growth sustains; however, higher growth rates can result in bilateral trade in the range of USD 283 billion and USD 327 billion.

The US remains the top trading partner for India in terms of trade in goods and services, followed by China. While the bilateral trade between US and India is approximately 62 percent in goods and 38 percent in services, the bilateral trade between India and China is dominated by goods.

India's trade with China grew 13 percent in 2018, while India's goods trade with the US increased 18 percent.

China had a huge trade surplus of USD 58 billion with India, indicating Beijing's strength in the Indian market, especially in sectors, such as electronics, machinery, organic chemicals, plastics and medical devices.

The US goods exports to India, in comparison, were mainly concentrated in mineral fuels, precious stones, and aircraft. The US faces tough competition with China in the Indian market in areas such as electronics, machinery, organic chemicals and medical devices.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saving-big-trade-deal-with-india-for-later--trump-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/saving-big-trade-deal-with-india-for-later--trump.html

226,19-2-20,Sharjeel Imam chargesheeted as instigator of Jamia violence,"A Delhi court on Tuesday sent Sharjeel Imam, named as an “instigator” by the Delhi Police in its chargesheet for violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at New Friends’ Colony here last year, to judicial custody till March 3.

It stated that it had attached CCTV footage, call detail records and statements of over 100 witnesses as evidence in the chargesheet. Imam was arrested on sedition charges last month in a separate case.

Earlier on Monday, the court had sent Imam to one-day custody of the Delhi Police in the case as it wanted to quiz him because an accused — Furkan — in the December 15, 2019 violence case has alleged in his disclosure that he was provoked by Imam’s speeches.

The police had earlier told the court that Furkan was arrested on the basis of a CCTV footage which showed him carrying a container allegedly containing petrol. Four people were arrested in the case on December 16 and sent to judicial custody. Furkan was arrested later.

Imam, who came into the limelight during the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh against the CAA and the NRC, was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28 in a separate case for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at Jamia Millia Islamia here and in Aligarh.

A case was registered against him on sedition and other charges on January 26.

Protestors had torched four public buses and two police vehicles as they clashed with police in New Friends’ Colony near Jamia during the demonstration against the CAA on December 15, leaving nearly 60 people including students, cops and fire fighters injured.

The police used batons and teargas shells to disperse the violent mob. They entered Jamia campus, saying rioters had taken shelter there. However, Jamia students had denied that they were involved in the violence and had alleged police brutality.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal had said groups of people, who were coming from the Jamia side, gathered near New Friends’ Colony and blocked the road. The protesters, around 1,500, did not pay heed to the police appeals to clear the area.

The protest was being held against the contentious law which seeks to provide citizenship to non-Muslims religious minorities from three neighbouring countries who arrived in India to escape religious persecution before 2015.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sharjeel-imam-chargesheeted-as-instigator-of-jamia-violence.html
227,19-2-20,IDSA renamed after Manohar Parrikar,"The Central Government has renamed Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), a Government think tank, as Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in order to “honour the commitment and legacy” of the late Defence Minister. The IDSA is a non-partisan, autonomous body dedicated to objective research and policy-relevant studies on all aspects of defence and security.

Parrikar was Defence Minister from November 9, 2014 to March 14, 2017. He died last year due to pancreatic cancer. He steered the Defence Ministry “through the tough challenges of attacks like Pathankot and Uri and responded to these with exemplary boldness,” said a Government statement on Tuesday while announcing the decision to rename the IDSA.

“An epitome of integrity and dedication in public life, throughout his career, late Parrikar showed a tremendous fighting spirit, taking on the odds with fearlessness,” the statement noted.

When Parrikar was the Defence Minister, India witnessed a series of decisions that “enhanced its security capacities, boosted indigenous defence production and bettered the lives of ex-servicemen”, it said.

His biggest contribution was towards the implementation of long-standing One Rank One Pension (OROP) demand for the Armed forces, the statement said.

The renaming of the IDSA will align the vision and aspiration of the premier defence institute with the contribution of the former Raksha Mantri, said the statement.

Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said, “I welcome the decision of Defence Ministry to rename IDSA as ‘Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses’, honoring Manohar bhai’s tremendous contribution as Defence Minister of India.”

Parrikar’s son Utpal termed the renaming of the IDSA after his late father as a “proud moment.” He said naming of such a prestigious and important institute (IDSA) of the country after a Goan is a “proud moment for every one of us.” He also said only avid followers of Indian defence will get a hint about the magnitude of the Central Government’s accomplishment in the field of defence adding, “I am happy that my father played a significant role in this in his short stint as the raksha mantri (Union Defence Minister).”

An autonomous body under Ministry of Defence, IDSA was established as a registered society in New Delhi in 1965, dedicated to objective research and policy relevant studies on all aspects of defence and security.

Its aim is to promote national and international security through the generation and dissemination of knowledge on defence and security-related issues. To achieve its goals, the institute undertakes scholarly research, policy-oriented research, dissemination of research findings, training and capacity building and public education.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/idsa-renamed-after-manohar-parrikar-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/idsa-renamed-after-manohar-parrikar.html
228,19-2-20,AAP MLA to hold Sundar Kaand recital every month,"Programme to be organised on first Tuesday, says MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bhardwaj has said recitation of “Sundar Kaand” (a chapter in Tulsidas’ Ramcharitmanas, which talks about Lord Hanuman’s visit to Lanka) will be held on the first Tuesday of every month in different areas of his constituency to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman and Lord Ram.

Bhardwaj said advance bookings have been made and sponsors are ready for the scheduled programmes.

Speaking to PTI on the issue, Bhardwaj said he has the freedom to practise his religion.

“I am a Hindu. Arvind Kejriwal is a Hindu. Nobody can deny this fact. I have religious freedom. If I am getting Sundar Kaand recital done, it does not make me less progressive. Being progressive does not mean you are an atheist,” he said.

The AAP leader said he was “just following his faith” and have been doing it for long.

“Today there is no election so it should not be seen as a political thing. The controversy was started after the BJP questioned the Chief Minister’s visit to Hanuman mandir, although the temple priest came on record to say he (Kejriwal) has been visiting the temple for years,” he said.

Also, Bhardwaj targeted the BJP and Congress leaders, saying they may be fuming but should be happy to be a part of “Sundar Kaand Paath” irrespective of their religion.

Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor hit out at the AAP, saying its attachment towards Lord Hanuman was not a matter of religious faith, but a “political melodrama”.

“We expect that the Aam Aadmi Party which used to play politics in favour of a particular religious community will now work for all the religious communities of the society during the next five years,” said another BJP spokesperson Ashok Goel Devraha.

Former Delhi Government media adviser Nagendar Sharma also termed Bhardwaj’s announcement as “disappointing”. “Disappointed to see a competent legislator with progressive outlook fall into the fallacious trap of trying to outdo BJP in its game,” he tweeted.

Sharma, however, later deleted the tweet, saying it was leading to rumours and “unnecessary interpretations”.

“My tweet was a suggestion in good faith to my very close friend @Saurabh_MLAgk, whom I consider as my younger brother, but since it was leading to rumours and unnecessary interpretation, I have deleted it,” he said on Twitter.

Party national convener Kejriwal’s frequent visit to Hanuman Temple during his election campaign was trolled by the BJP leaders and its social media team. Kejriwal had also recited ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ during a TV programme earlier this month.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said during a poll rally, “Now Kejriwal has started reciting the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’. In coming days, you will see Owaisi reciting the same. This will certainly happen”. Delhi BJP unit president Manoj Tiwari had called Kejriwal a “nakli bhakt” (fake worshipper).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aap-mla-to-hold-sundar-kaand-recital-every-month-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/aap-mla-to-hold-sundar-kaand-recital-every-month.html
229,19-2-20,"China drives and shapes US-India relations, says Indian-American scholar","Washington, Feb 19 (PTI) China is one of the prime drivers of relationship between India and the United States – the two largest democracies of the world – not only in the last two decades but since India's independence, a top Indian-American scholar has said in her latest book.

""Today, it is almost a truth almost universally acknowledged that China drives and shapes US-India relations. Indeed, broad convergence on China has been a key driver of US-India relations for the last two decades across US administrations and across Indian governments,"" Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at Foreign Policy and the director of India Project at the Brookings Institute told a Washington audience.

In her latest book “Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped US-India Relations During the Cold War”, she argues that China's influence on the US-India relationship is neither a recent nor a momentary phenomenon.

Drawing on archival documents from India and the US, Madan traces how American and Indian perceptions of, and policy toward, China significantly shaped US-India relations during the Cold War.

“China's role in shaping the U.S.-India relationship was not just a recent phenomenon restricted to kind of the last few decades. Indeed, what I found and this book lays out was that China's influence went back the early years of Indian independence,"" Madan said during a discussion on her new book.

Through extensive archival research in India and in the US, Madan disentangles how American and Indian perceptions of and policy toward China shaped the US-Indian relationship throughout the Cold War, said Suzanne Maloney, interim vice president and director, Foreign Policy, Brookings Institute.

The book that starts post-independence refers to the first US visit by India's first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1949. “When he came in 1949, he received a warm welcome on his arrival. President Truman, indeed, went to the airport to receive him taking along three cabinet members and an honor guard. You had the US Congress host Nehru for a speech. Why all this fanfare behind the visit of this Indian leader,” she asked.

“A major was what had happened just before Nehru's visit to Washington. What American policymakers saw as the loss of China to communism. And this had happened just a few days before on October 1, 1949 when Mao Zedong establishes the People's Republic of China. The establishment in the US now saw in that context a democratic India as the hope of Asia and believed it could serve as a counterbalance and contrast to Soviet backed communist China,” Madan said.

“But during the course of this kind of visit that Nehru takes with much fanfare, it became quite clear that India did not share the same view of or the same approach to China as the US did. And so, instead of convergence in China pushing the US and India together, over the next few years what you really see in the US-India partnership and between the two countries is divergence on the subject of China,” she added.

“They've disagreed about a number of different things. Whether to recognize the People's Republic of China or not. What to do about the Chinese takeover of Tibet. China's role in the Korean War and the reasons for its intervention in that war. China's role in Southeast Asia. They also disagreed about the approach to take to China,” she said.

According to Madan, China has adverse impact on US-India relations. “Now just in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations but also on Capitol Hill where these differences on China negatively affected decisions to aid India which needed aid at that time. And this, in turn, caused resentment in India that thought the US was holding back because of these differences on China,” she said.

But things changed late 50s. The US and India didn't just agree on a perception of China now. They also agree on what to do about this threat. “Primarily, in their minds, that meant a partnership with each other. Now this came, this agreement on what to do about it came with a lot of American economic assistant to India which is better known. But also, military assistance that eventually culminates and, of course, US direct assistance during the 1962 China-India war,” she said.

Historical baggage, she said, to this day, affects and shapes how the two countries see each other in the context of a rising China. “To give you one example, you cannot understand Indian concerns about a G-2 or a US-China condominium without understanding India's sense that in 1971, essentially overnight, much like the Japanese called it Nixon shock. India had to face going from having a US partnership against China to the prospect of a US-China-Pakistan, facing a US-China-Pakistan partnership against it,” Madan said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-drives-and-shapes-us-india-relations--says-indian-american-scholar-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/china-drives-and-shapes-us-india-relations--says-indian-american-scholar.html
230,19-2-20,Nath laughs off differences with Scindia,"After having upset at his differences with former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Chief Minister Kamal Nath here on Tuesday laughed off on talks of his differences with Scindia. “I never get angry with Shivraj Singh Chouhan so forget about being upset with Scindia,” Nath said, while addressing a seminar organised by the Madhya Pradesh Government.

Noted economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia addressed the seminar at Minto Hall in Bhopal.

“He (Scindia) had said something and I said what I had to say. It’s not a big deal,” Nath said apparently referring to Scindia’s remarks of taking to streets if the Vachan Patra is not implemented. An upset Nath had responded to this by saying, “Toh utar jayen (let him take to streets).

After this, speculations were rife that there has been a tug of war between the two senior leaders in the State.

For the time being, NPR would not be implemented in Madhya Pradesh, said Nath, adding that the State would ponder over the subject.

Scindia had been highly critical of the Nath Government of late on several key issues primarily on farm loan waiver which is yet to be completed.

Earlier reports of Scindia walking out of the co-ordination committee meeting, held at Nath’s Delhi residence, had been reported which was later denied by his close aides.",book-reviews,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/book-reviews/nath-laughs-off-differences-with-scindia.html
231,19-2-20,FATF subgroup wants to keep Pak in Grey List,"A subgroup of the global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Tuesday recommended continuation of Pakistan in the “Grey List” for its failure to check terror funding and a final decision will be taken on February 21, sources said on Tuesday.

The decision was taken at the meeting of the FATF’s International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG), held at the ongoing Paris plenary.

The FATF meeting is being held a week after an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan sentenced Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attack and founder of LeT, to 11 years in two terror financing cases inside Pakistan.

The Pakistani court’s judgment came ostensibly to please the FATF and Western countries so that the country can exit the “Grey List”.

India has been maintaining that Pakistan extends regular support to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen, whose prime target is India, and has urged FATF to take action against Islamabad.

Saeed, a UN designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty, was arrested on July 17, 2019 in the terror financing cases. The 70-year-old fiery cleric is lodged at the high-security Kot Lakhpat jail in Pakistan.

Pakistan has also recently informed FATF that JeM founder Masood Azhar and his family are “missing”.

It has claimed that there were only 16 UN designated terrorists in Pakistan, of which “seven are dead”.

Out of the nine who are alive, seven had applied to the UN for exemption from financial and travel restrictions.

Pakistan needs 12 votes out of 39 to exit the ‘Grey List’ and move to ‘White List’. To avoid ‘Black List’, it needs support of three countries.

In the last month’s FATF meeting in Beijing, Pakistan has got support of Malaysia and Turkey besides FATF current chair China.

The FATF plenary held in October 2019 had noted that Pakistan addressed only five out of the 27 tasks given to it in controlling funding to terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen, responsible for a series of attacks in India.

The FATF had said it strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February, 2020.

In the Beijing meeting, Pakistan provided a list of its action taken to comply with FATF directions.

Pakistan was placed on the ‘Grey List’ by the FATF in June, 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete it by October, 2019 or face the risk of being placed on the ‘Black List’ along with Iran and North Korea.

The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations -- the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group.

If Pakistan continues with the ‘Grey List’, it will be difficult for the country to get financial aid from the IMF, World Bank, ADB and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.",book-reviews,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/book-reviews/fatf-subgroup-wants-to-keep-pak-in-grey-list.html
232,19-2-20,Time of day linked to decrease in activity in specific brain regions: Study,"As the day progresses, the electrical activity between different brain regions when people are at rest may significantly decrease, according to a study which suggests that the excitation could be the lowest in the morning, increases in the mid-afternoon, and dips in the early evening.

The study, published in the journal PLOS, revealed a cumulative decrease in the excitation between different regions of resting brains as the day progressed.

According to the researchers, including those from the National University of Singapore (NUS), this global decrease was most prominent in brain regions responsible for processing vision and body movements.

In the study, they analysed the brain scan data of approximately 900 subjects who were examined between 8 AM and 10 PM on two different days.

Across the whole brain, the scientists found that the time of day was also associated with marked decreases in resting-state functional connectivity -- the correlated activity between different brain regions when no explicit task is being performed.

""We were surprised by the size of the overall time-of-day effects, since the global fMRI signal is affected by many factors and there is substantial variation across individuals,"" said Csaba Orban, first author of the study from NUS.

""At the present moment we don't have a good explanation of the directionality of our findings,"" Orban said.

However, the researchers said, they also observed slight time-of-day-associated variation in the breathing patterns of participants, suggesting that they may also need to consider clues outside of the brain to fully understand the effects.

Based on the findings, the researchers recommended that clinicians report the time of day of fMRI brain scans, and other experimental protocols and measurements, since this could help account for between-study variation in results, and potentially even failure to replicate findings.

""We hope these findings will motivate fellow neuroscientists to give more consideration to potential effects of time of day on measures of brain activity, especially in other large-scale studies where subjects are often scanned throughout the day for logistical reasons,"" said Thomas Yeo, senior author of the study from NUS.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/time-of-day-linked-to-decrease-in-activity-in-specific-brain-regions--study-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/time-of-day-linked-to-decrease-in-activity-in-specific-brain-regions--study.html

235,19-2-20,Coronavirus outbreak to hit global growth; to have limited impact on India: RBI Guv,"The coronavirus outbreak will have a limited impact on India but the global GDP and trade will definitely get affected due to the large size of the Chinese economy, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has said.

Only a couple of sectors in India are likely to see some disruptions but alternatives are being explored to overcome those issues, he said.

The deadly virus has brought a large part of the world's second-largest economy China to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries.

India's pharmaceutical and electronic manufacturing sectors are dependent on China for inputs and they may be impacted, Das told PTI in an interview here.

""It is definitely an issue which needs to be closely monitored by every policymaker whether in India or any other country. Every policymaker, every monetary authority needs to keep a very close watch. So coronavirus issue needs to be closely watched,"" he said.

A similar problem, perhaps on a lower scale, occurred last time during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, he said adding that the Chinese economy had slowed down by about 1 per cent during that time.

At the time of SARS outbreak, China was the sixth-largest economy and accounted for only 4.2 per cent of the world's GDP. While, the Asian giant is now the world's second-largest economy, accounting for 16.3 per cent of the global GDP, therefore, any slowdown in the Chinese economy would impact the global economy.

The RBI governor said that the coronavirus outbreak appears to be larger than SARS and this time China's share in world GDP and world trade is much higher. ""So, the coronavirus will definitely have an impact on the global GDP and global trade,"" he said adding that every major economy today will have to be very careful and must monitor the situation closely.

For India, China is an important trading partner and policymakers both in the government and the monetary authority ""are very watchful of the developments that are taking place,"" he said.

If the Chinese authorities are able to contain the problem, the impact on the global economy and on India will be minimised, Das said.

On the impact on India, he said the pharmaceutical sector is sourcing raw materials from China.

""Most of the large pharma companies, according to information that we have, always keep stock for three-four months. So, therefore, they should be able to manage and also those provinces from where these pharma intermediates are sourced have not been impacted by the virus outbreak. Therefore, there is an expectation that the supply of pharma raw materials will be maintained,"" he said.

The other areas where India is dependent on China is mobile handsets, TV sets and certain other electronic products. ""There again it is important that our manufacturers are able to develop alternative places of sourcing these raw materials.""

""So, I think there is evidence that already our manufacturers are discussing with other countries in the Asian region. So, if they are able to quickly access raw materials from these other countries, then to that extent the problem on our manufacturing will be contained,"" he said.

He noted that the critical thing to be watched and monitored now is how quickly Chinese authorities are able to contain the problem. For India, he said, the important aspect is manufacturer should be able to quickly develop alternative sources.

India exports iron ore to China and it could be impacted, he said. ""But in economics, something negative in one place always works positive elsewhere. So if your iron ore exports are impacted, then perhaps the raw material supply to our local domestic steel manufacturers will be at reduced costs. So their cost of production may go down.""

Das said Coronavirus is a big human tragedy and the focus has to be on containing this menace.

China's GDP has risen dramatically since SARS outbreak in 2003. In 2002, China contributed 23 per cent to the world GDP growth, in 2019 China contributed an estimated 38 per cent of world growth.

The 11 Chinese provinces have announced an extended holiday period.

Meanwhile, the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic in China crossed the 2,000-mark on Wednesday with the death of 136 more people, while the overall confirmed cases climbed to 74,185, authorities said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-outbreak-to-hit-global-growth--to-have-limited-impact-on-india--rbi-guv-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/coronavirus-outbreak-to-hit-global-growth--to-have-limited-impact-on-india--rbi-guv.html
236,19-2-20,Deaths during protests: Adityanath says nothing can save those with death wish,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday defended police over the deaths of anti-CAA protesters, saying they were shot by other rioters and nothing can be done to save someone with a death wish.

Wrapping up the discussion in the state assembly on the Governor's address, Adityanath said the role of the police in dealing with rioters during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act should be appreciated.

In hard-hitting remarks, the chief minister said his government supported democratic protests but will maintain law and order by dealing strictly with those indulging in violence.

“Jo jis bhasha main samjhega, usey uss bhasha main samjhayenge (We will talk to them in the language they understand),” he warned.

About 20 people died of gunshot wounds during violent protests in several parts of Uttar Pradesh in December.

“If someone is coming with an intention to die, how can he remain alive?” Adityanath said.

“If someone comes out to kill an innocent person and he is challenged by police, then either he or the policemen have to die,” he added.

The CM said nobody died of a police bullet during the protests.

“Rioters died of rioters' bullets,” he said, repeating the claim made earlier by police.

He claimed that the anti-CAA protests revealed terror funding by Popular Front of India, which is said is “another name” for banned terror group SIMI.

""Any sympathy for them means, support to the PFI and SIMI. Those who do treason with country, will die an anonymous death (gumnam maut),"" he said.

He said criminals don't want their sons and daughters to become criminals, but some big leaders had sent their daughters amidst those who raise anti-national slogans.

The chief minister claimed that “azadi” slogans were being raised during the protests.

“What kind of 'azadi'? We have to see whether we want to fulfil the dreams of Bapu or Jinnah,"" he said, referring to the founder of Pakistan.

During his two-hour speech, Adityanath trashed the opposition charges against him on crime and women empowerment.

In an indirect reference to the Samajwadi Party, he recalled how in the past MLAs ""used to throw paper balls"" at the podium during the Governor's customary address to the House.

""Those who insulted the Constitution are today trying to preach us about the Constitution. It's better they keep off or they will be badly exposed,"" he said.

Without naming former chief minister and Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Adityanath recalled his controversial “boys will be boys” remark and mocked the opposition for speaking on women empowerment.

While opposing capital punishment for rape, Mulayam Singh Yadav had sparked an outrage by saying ""ladke, ladke hain... Galti ho jati hai (boys will be boys... They commit mistakes).""

Adityanath cited the police firing on 'kar sevaks' gathered in Ayodhya on October 30, 1990, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was the chief minister.

He also trained his guns at the Congress, referring to the infamous ""tandoor case"" in which former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma spent 23 years in Tihar Jail for killing his wife Naina Sahni and then trying to dispose of her body in a restaurant tandoor.

""These parties have the cheek to call themselves champions of women empowerment,"" he said.

The chief minister said when the governor spoke on 'Ramrajya' in her address, it did not have any religious connotations.

He said Ramrajya does not mean governance through religion. “The country needs Ramrajya' not 'Samajwad',” the chief minister said.

""My government is determined on Ramrajya, which means governance for public welfare,” he said.

He listed his government's achievements during the past three years. ""It takes time to cleanse the system, age-old garbage cannot be removed overnight,"" he said.

Using a computer tablet, he cited data to claim that the crime rate has come down during his term.

The House passed the motion of thanks on the Governor's address by voice vote.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/deaths-during-protests--adityanath-says-nothing-can-save-those-with-death-wish-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/deaths-during-protests--adityanath-says-nothing-can-save-those-with-death-wish.html
237,19-2-20,11 as Hindu terror,"Mumbai ex-top cop Rakesh Maria’s book makes startling revelations about conspiracy

Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria has dropped a bombshell by claiming in his 624-page memoir “Let Me Say It Now” released recently that how there was a bid to dub 26/11 as “Hindu terror”, a phrase coined by the then Home Minister.

But it didn’t happen so as Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was caught alive.

Had Kasab not been caught alive, his body would have been found with an I-card bearing a fictitious Hindu name, writes Maria about the investigation helmed by him in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.

“If all had gone well, he (Kasab) would have been dead with a red string tied around his wrist like a Hindu. We would have found an identity card on his person with a fictitious name: Samir Dinesh Chaudhari, student of Arunodaya Degree and PG College, Vedre Complex, Dilkhushnagar, Hyderabad, 500060, resident of 254, Teachers Colony, Nagarabhavi, Bengaluru,” Maria writes.

“Ramesh Mahale, Prashant Marde and Dinesh Kadam would have been on their way to Hyderabad to find more about him. There would have been screaming headlines in newspapers claiming how Hindu terrorists had attacked Mumbai. Over-the-top TV journalists would have made a beeline for Bengaluru to interview his family and neighbours,” he wrote.

Mahale, Marde and Kadam were senior police officers involved in the 26/11 attack investigation. “But alas, it had not worked that way and here he was, Ajmal Amir Kasab of Faridkot in Pakistan, and I was asking him, Ki karan aya hai? (What are you here for?),” the former IPS officer wrote.

Maria’s book also mentions that Pakistan’s ISI and the Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT) were bent upon killing Kasab by “hook or by crook” after he was caught alive by ASI Tukaram Ombale.

“As the Joint CP incharge of the Crime Branch, Kasab was now my most esteemed guest. Keeping this enemy alive was my number one priority. Anger and hostility towards Kasab were perceptible. The way the men and officers were reacting to him, I had to personally choose his guards for the entire period he would be with us,” Maria writes in the book.

“The ISI and the Lashkar were bent upon eliminating him by hook or by crook to obliterate the only living evidence of their heinous deed... Specific Intelligence inputs had been received from Central Intelligence agencies that Pakistan was intent on killing Kasab and the Dawood gang had been entrusted with the task,” Maria wrote.

“He seriously believed that Muslims were not allowed to offer namaaz in India and mosques were locked up by the authorities. He felt that the azaan he heard five times a day in the Crime Branch lock-up was just a figment of his imagination. When we came to know of this, I instructed Mahale to take him to the mosque near the Metro Cinema in a vehicle. When he saw the namaaz in progress with his own eyes, he was bewildered. This was not how it was supposed to be!” Maria writes in the book.

In one of the most horrific terrorist attacks in the country’s history, 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai on November 26, 2008.

Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bid-to-paint-26-11-as-hindu-terror-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bid-to-paint-26-11-as-hindu-terror.html
238,19-2-20,UK MP’s visa revoked for anti-India activities,"Singhvi backs Govt’s action, slams Debbie as ‘Pak proxy’

A day after British MP Debbie Abrahams was deported from the Indira Gandhi International Airport here, Government sources said on Tuesday her e-Business visa was revoked as she was involved in anti-India activities. They also said revoking or grant of visa is the sovereign right of a country and the cancellation of visa was conveyed to her on February 14.

Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi welcomed the step even though his party colleague Tharoor on Monday had criticised the Government on her deportation. Singhvi said the British MP was a “Pakistan proxy.”

Justifying the decision to cancel the visa and deporting the MP, sources said Abrahams was issued an e-Business visa on October 7 last year for attending business meetings. The visa was valid till October 5, 2020.

“Her e-Business visa was revoked on February 14, 2020 on account of her indulging in activities which went against India’s national interest. The rejection of the e-Business visa was intimated to her on February 14,” they said. Sources also asserted the grant, rejection or revocation of a visa or electronic travel authorisation is the sovereign right of a country.

Abrahams was not in the possession of a valid visa at the time of her arrival at the IGI Airport here on Monday and she was asked to return, the sources said.

There is no provision of “visa on arrival” for the UK nationals at the airport, sources said, dismissing Abrahams’ contention she should have been granted a “visa on arrival”.

They said as per the rules previously issued e-Business visa meant for business meetings cannot be used for visiting “family and friends”, as stated by the British MP. “This is not permitted as per the rules and a separate visa request has to be made,” a source said.

The Labour Party MP had said despite having a valid visa she was denied entry into India after she landed at the airport here about 8.50 am from Dubai. She was among a group of British MPs who issued formal letters expressing concerns over the revocation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 in August last year.

“We are gravely concerned at the announcement by Indian Home Minister, Amit Shah, that Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which grants special status to Jammu & Kashmir, has been removed by Presidential Order,” the Opposition MP had noted in her letter to UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.

Abrahams reacted on Twitter, “Very disappointing that a friend can’t respectfully criticise another friend.”

Isn’t this the sign of a healthy democracy?” She also posted a shot of her visa in a bid to prove that it was valid till October.

She also said in a statement, “I presented myself at the immigration desk with my documents including my e-visa, had my photograph taken and then the official looked at his screen and started shaking his head. Then he told me my visa was rejected, took my passport and disappeared for about 10 minutes. When he came back he was very rude and aggressive, shouting at me to ‘come with me’.”

“I told him not to speak to me like that and was then taken to a cordoned off area marked as a Deportee Cell. He then ordered me to sit down and I refused. I didn’t know what they might do or where else they may take me, so I wanted people to see me.” The politician said she rang a relative she was to stay with, and he called the British High Commission.

“I’m prepared to let the fact that I’ve been treated like a criminal, and I hope they will let me visit my family and friends,” Ms Abrahams had said.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Singhvi backed the Government’s deportation of British lawmaker Debbie Abrahams, saying she is not just an MP but a “Pakistan proxy.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-mp---s-visa-revoked--for-anti-india-activities-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/uk-mp---s-visa-revoked--for-anti-india-activities.html

Addressing reporters later, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called the Budget — the fourth presented by his Government — “historic”, “growth-oriented” and “people-friendly”.

Opposition parties, however, termed it “directionless” and a “farce”.

The Rs 5.12 lakh crore Budget is bigger than the one presented last year by Rs 33,159 crore. It has provisions for new schemes worth Rs 10,967 crore, Khanna said.

Among the major allocations is Rs 500 crore for an airport at Ayodhya, where the construction of a Ram temple is expected to begin in the next few months.

In addition, the State Government will spend Rs 85 crore for the development of the pilgrim city as a tourist spot.

The Budget allocates Rs 200 crore for the expansion and beautification of Kashi Vishwanath temple in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Varanasi constituency. Another Rs 180 crore will go on setting up a cultural centre in the holy city.

The Government announced two new schemes to provide employment for the youth -- the Chief Minister’s Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (CMAPS) and the Yuva Udhyamita Vikas Abhiyan (YUVA).

The Budget lays emphasis on developing metro networks, airports and expressways.

Besides the allocation for the metro projects, it provides Rs 2,000 crore for the 637-km ‘Ganga Expressway’ from Meerut to Allahabad, which the Government says will be in the longest in the country.

The Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar near Delhi has been allotted Rs 2,000 crore, which is about half of the estimated cost of its first phase of construction.

“The airport is expected to go operational by 2023,” Khanna said in his speech.

The Budget estimates total receipts of 5,00,558 crore -- Rs 4,22,567 crore through revenue and Rs 77,990 crore through capital receipts. It estimates a deficit of Rs 12,302 crore.

Opposition parties slammed the exercise.

“The Government is betraying all sections -- be they youth, farmers or women. The BJP says it wants to make the State a trillion dollar economy but it is not saying from where the investment will come,” Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav told reporters.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati called it a “farce”.

“The promises and claims made in the Budget appear hollow and are only on paper,” she said.

UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Budget is “directionless” and a mere “jugglery of figures”.

“The Budget has nothing for the youth, farmers, women and the poor,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ayodhya--jewar-airports-get---rs-2-500-crore-in-up-budget-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ayodhya--jewar-airports-get---rs-2-500-crore-in-up-budget.html

In August 2019, Grylls had hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the show, which was shot at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand in February last year.

In 'Man vs Wild', former British serviceman Grylls showcased survival strategies in extreme challenging conditions in the most remote locations around the world.

The Emmy-winning actor died suddenly in her sleep at her home in Glendale, California early Tuesday, reported Variety.

DuBois' most memorable role may be Wilona, the Evans family neighbour in the Norman Lear-developed ""Good Times"" for some of the greatest entrances in sitcom history but she was not restricted to the small screen.

She appeared on Broadway with Sammy Davis Jr and Louis Gossett Jr in ""Golden Boys"" in the late 1950s and her first feature was the Academy Award-nominated ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" in 1970.

She was credited in numerous other films as varied as ""Basic Instinct"", ""Next Friday"" and ""Tropic Thunder"", which used the song ""Movin' on Up"".

The news of her death comes barely over two months after she performed at ABC's ""Live in Front of a Studio Audience: All in the Family & Good Times"".

Hollywood personalities including Lear, Viola Davis, and her ""Good Times"" co-star BernNadette Stanis remembered the actor.

""Ja'Net DuBois was all light and will be missed. I love that she wrote the theme song for her passing, 'Movin' on Up'."" #goodtimes #thejeffersons,"" Lear wrote on Instagram.

Davis thanked DuBois for all the childhood memories.

""Oh man! Just saw you! What a pleasure it was to meet you. You shaped so much of the best memories of my childhood! God bless you, Ja'net DuBois! RIP,"" she tweeted.

Dr Liu Zhiming, president of the Wuhan Wuchang Hospital in Hubei province died of the novel coronavirus pneumonia on Tuesday despite medical efforts to revive him, the state-run CCTV reported, the latest fatality among medical workers as they rush to save tens of thousands of patients at the epicenter of the outbreak.

""My deepest condolences to the family of Dr Liu Zhiming, his colleagues and patients for this enormous loss,"" the WHO chief tweeted on Tuesday.

Liu ""touched and saved numerous lives in the COVID-19 outbreak,"" Tedros said, adding that ""my thoughts are with them and all the front-line health workers fighting the virus.""

An eulogy issued by the local health commission said Liu, 51, head of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, had made important contributions to the city's epidemic prevention and control while leading all medical personnel of Wuchang Hospital on the frontline to fight against the epidemic.

A total of 1,716 Chinese medical workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus by February 11, and six of them have died.

The death toll from the coronavirus epidemic in China crossed the 2,000-mark on Wednesday with the death of 136 more people, while the overall confirmed cases climbed to 74,185, Chinese authorities said on Wednesday.

The National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily report that 2,004 people had died of the disease known as COVID-19.

The NHC said 1,749 new cases of novel coronavirus infection have been confirmed.

Of the new deaths, 132 were reported from the worst-hit Hubei Province.

The WHO which has sent a team of experts to China early this week has issued guidance on the rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers as its latest move in its response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the rights and responsibilities of health workers, including specific measures needed to protect occupational safety and health.

Noting that health workers are at the front line of any outbreak response, the WHO guidance said that the hazards include pathogen exposure, long working hours, psychological distress, fatigue, occupational burnout, stigma, and physical and psychological violence.

According to the guidance, employers in health facilities should assume overall responsibility to ensure that all necessary preventive and protective measures are taken to minimise occupational safety and health risks, and to familiarise personnel with technical updates on COVID-19 and share infection prevention and control information with patients and the public.

They should also provide a blame-free environment for workers to report on incidents, such as exposures to blood or bodily fluids from the respiratory system or to cases of violence, and to adopt measures for immediate follow-up, including support to victims.

The guidance suggests that health workers swiftly follow established public health reporting procedures of suspect and confirmed cases and provide or reinforce accurate infection prevention and control and public health information, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-chief-condoles-death-of-chinese-doctor-in-fight-against-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/who-chief-condoles-death-of-chinese-doctor-in-fight-against-coronavirus-outbreak.html
251,19-2-20,"Regulate all companies developing AI, including Tesla: Musk","Elon Musk has called for regulating all companies, including Tesla, which are working in the field of developing advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Responding to an article about independent research lab OpenAI by MIT Technology Review, Musk tweeted: ""OpenAI should be more open in my opinion. All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla.""

According to the report on Tuesday, OpenAI which was co-founded by Musk has shifted from its mission of developing AI safely into becoming a company that is obsessed with image and driven to raise more money.

Musk, who is a staunch critic of AI, stepped down from OpenAI's board in 2018.

San Francisco-based OpenAI -- now in the lap of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella -- is aiming to extend the benefits of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to humanity.

For OpenAI, a safe and beneficial AGI means highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work which is the next step for AI with ""widely distributed economic benefits"".

The start-up with 100 people on board is building free software for training, benchmarking and experimenting with AI.

Nadella who sees a greater role of AI for humanity will invest $1 billion in the next few years in OpenAI to support it build ""democratised AGI"" models.

OpenAI would develop a hardware and software platform within Microsoft Azure Cloud platform which will scale to AGI. The start-up would also jointly develop new Azure AI supercomputing technologies, further extending Microsoft Azure's capabilities in large-scale AI systems.

OpenAI's investors include Reid Hoffman's charitable foundation and Khosla Ventures. The start-up has created ""MuseNet"" -- a deep neural network that can generate four-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments, and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles.

It also created a bot which beat the world as top professionals at 1v1 matches of ""Dota 2"" competition. The bot learned the game from scratch by self-play, and does not use imitation learning or tree search.

""This is a step towards building AI systems which accomplish well-defined goals in messy, complicated situations involving real humans,"" said OpenAI.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/regulate-all-companies-developing-ai--including-tesla--musk-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/regulate-all-companies-developing-ai--including-tesla--musk.html

255,19-2-20,Microsoft tests software to ensure votes are not altered,"Microsoft has begun testing its free open-source software called ""ElectionGuard"" in a small Wisconsin town in the US that aims to make voting more secure, verifiable and efficient.

""ElectionGuard"" will enable end-to-end verification of elections, open results to third-party organisations for secure validation, and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted.

It enables government entities, news outlets, human rights organisations or anyone else to build additional verifiers that independently can certify election results have been accurately counted and have not been altered, according to the company.

The software would create a paper trail and assure voters their votes were properly tallied.

""On Tuesday, Fulton residents are using the technology while choosing who will join the local school board and hold a seat on Wisconsin's state Supreme Court,"" reports CNBC.

With the test, the company aims to see if voters like the experience and make sure everything works fine.

In May last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced ""ElectionGuard"".

According to Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security and Trust, voting system manufacturers will be free to build ElectionGuard into their systems in a variety of ways.

""These are exciting steps that enable individual voters to confirm their vote was properly counted, and assures those voters using an ElectionGuard system of the most secure and trustworthy vote in the history of the US,"" Burt said in a recent blog post.

""ElectionGuard"" is not intended to replace paper ballots but rather to supplement and improve systems that rely on them, and it is not designed to support internet voting.

The software provides each voter a tracker with a unique code that can be used to follow an encrypted version of the vote through the entire election process via a web portal provided by election authorities.

During the process of vote-casting, voters have an optional step that allows them to confirm that their trackers and encrypted votes accurately reflect their selections.

But once a vote is cast, neither the tracker nor any data provided through the web portal can be used to reveal the contents of the vote.

After the election is complete, the tracker codes can be used by voters to confirm that their votes were not altered or tampered with and that they were properly counted, said Microsoft.

On the security front, ""ElectionGuard"" uses something called homomorphic encryption - which enables mathematical procedures ""like counting - to be done with fully encrypted data"".",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/microsoft-tests-software-to-ensure-votes-are-not-altered-2020-02-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/microsoft-tests-software-to-ensure-votes-are-not-altered.html
