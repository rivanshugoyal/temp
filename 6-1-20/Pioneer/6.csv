0,06-1-20,A day’s tale at the Taj,"For the foreign traveller, the new India, as opposed to the one in guidebooks, has been difficult to reconcile with. That’s costing us business and perception

An 1899 handbook on the Taj Mahal had said that your presence at the monument was enough to make the whole world your kin. No matter what the asymmetry of cultures, the pristine symmetry of the structure and its elevated consciousness by the banks of the Yamuna seem to clear all the cobwebs of our minds into an incredible whiteness of perfection. The Taj has withstood many assaults in its time — physical, cultural and ideological. Now it has even learnt to live in splendid isolation like its creator and Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, held captive by the circumstances of our time.

I happened to be in Agra over the Christmas/New Year weekend quite by chance, it being the celebratory time of the year when a record number of tourists congregate for a pilgrimage of sorts to witness the world’s wonder but perhaps for the first time felt unwelcome in a city under siege. The administration, fearing tension following the protests over the Government’s new identity-based and divisive policies, had ensured a virtual lockdown with internet shutdowns, restricted entry, limited mobile telephony, barricaded localities and chaperoned access. Agra has not just been any other tourist town; it has been the crown of India’s Golden Triangle, our most popular circuit, where heritage is living, the entirety of its local economy and identity geared around its sense of hospitality. While the Taj has been the pivot of the tourist economy, the attention span it commands has seldom extended to other structures. Over long years, successive Governments, culture czars and tour operators have painstakingly worked on “Taj by moonlight” sightings, cultural soirees, art walks, crafts workshops on pietra dura (the inlay work used in the monument) Mughal spas and a host of other experientials to hold the tourist. Though middle India sleeps early, the tourist enclaves have always bustled with life and danced to an eclectic vibe. The jackboots not only destroyed that spirit but years of hard work to make the tourist stay in the city and not run after the customary ritual of a day trip.

The desolateness echoed everywhere. Shops in the Taj complex itself downed shutters as many of their owners could not make it past “troublesome” localities without being asked why they needed to move outdoors in the first place. The little that did open for business wound up early because the business was not worth the establishment cost; there weren’t enough tourists going around. On Christmas day, the Taj had the highest number of visitors this season, which was dismally low, less than half of what the monument gets on that day every year. Tourist operators have been conservative in estimating a 40 per cent drop in business. But unofficially, fearing stricter gag orders, they tell you that business has fallen by 80 per cent, the food business being hit the most severely. Cafes, proudly displaying free wi-fi, an attraction for young travellers on the move, looked bleak. Many of them told us that the administration had really nothing to fear as no rioting of consequence had taken place in the city. Neither would it be as even the most ghettoised Muslim had been tamed into submission by the brutal face of organised repression and random pick-ups of innocents, simply because they “looked” suspicious. In fact, they did not want any activist to take up their cause, fearing a hitback. But the fear psychosis and aura of a police state was chillier than the December cold, the face of the policeman more ominous with the temporary power he had been given to intimidate people, who wouldn’t have noticed him otherwise. The friendly tourist police shut shop earlier than usual, handing over charge to the special personnel on the ground. The unsaid dystopian future was suddenly all too palpable.

It all began with the site. Much time was lost because of the elaborate entrance drill through circuitous pathways and one-man pass-throughs — something which was most inconvenient to the elderly and the wheelchair-bound — and being herded by the sternest minders. The Taj terrace had more security personnel than tourists, who were being escorted in batches. Low turnouts meant fewer battery-operated carts and buses were available for ferrying visitors, most of whom were left waiting endlessly. And as the fog rushed in from the edges post-sunset, the Taj tourist complex crawled with military police. Café El Clasico, which serves light bites and beams European football alongside, was empty. We were the third or fourth visitor group it had got that day. The internet shutdown meant no online bookings or transactions could go through, no aggregator service, be it of food or transport, was operable, no apps were serviceable and no video chats were possible. Agra that weekend had stranded tourists on the move, who completely rely on online reservations and forward linkages to plan their holidays. Hotels were no better. The broadband worked late evening at some properties in fits and starts, with ridiculously low speeds. Cable TV was down, too, and where available, offered you more free-to-air entertainment channels than credible news. Why would anybody want news on a holiday? Apart from “our” kind. What about telemedicine networks and online referrals at hospitals then? Or even hotels themselves, which were off the grid for prime bookings? Agra hotels were not only lowering tariffs but even encouraging tourists to stay an extra day with complimentary benefits to ensure occupancy figures. Understandable as internet blackouts had meant a 60 per cent drop in December bookings, according to operators. Over 200,000 domestic and international tourists had either cancelled or postponed their trip to the Taj in the last fortnight of 2019.

The arrogance of power and machismo may seem the new normal but international travellers, who are our actual brand ambassadors, have clearly been shocked by the new idea of India as opposed to the one depicted in guidebooks. Many were cautious about talking, fearing they would be unnecessarily harassed or sent back. Everybody was aware about the deportation of the German IITian and the Norwegian student for sympathising with and extending moral support to the protesters. Their concerns are deeply problematic for us because for the first time they felt there were no shared values of democracy here anymore. Those drawn by the mysticism of the Orient wondered how India, as an ancient civilisation that had absorbed millennial layers of influences through the Silk and Spice routes but still held its own, could disown its ethos of inclusivity and subscribe to alien ideas of isolationism and racism? Some said they respected India for making feel everyone at home no matter what the shortcomings, simply because it was not like China. “Even there, the autocracy of the State doesn’t feel as overbearing. Yes they watch the tourist districts but within their orchestrated confines, they do not dilute the overall experience,” said one of the travellers. Another cancelled his visit to Varanasi and decided to return to Delhi the next morning. Others cut short their trips following travel advisories from their countries. Cancellations are bad news for hoteliers during the busiest time of the year. Worst, European travellers, who have been born of the colonial legacy and have an unexplained happy feeling about coming to India and embracing it with its warts and eccentricities, are going back disturbed. Simply because the India in their genes is not the India today. Much like author William Dalrymple, who had never thought of leaving India but is wondering whether he should die here or not. Dangerously, some even asked if the clampdown had anything to do with eroding Mughal legacies and their significance. Nobody dare ask an Indian this question but seen in the context of Chief Minister Yogi Adiyanath’s earlier statement that the Taj was not that important a monument, one can understand why it is being raised in the first place.

No regime, no matter what its colour of politics, can disregard the economic value of the Taj. Especially, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has pitched tourism as the key growth driver of a slowing economy. Government records show that Mughal era monuments attract the highest number of tourists and the Taj Mahal generates the maximum revenue. It attracts over 6.5 million tourists every year, generating nearly $14 million annually from entrance fees. And spends on its maintenance have remained almost the same in the Modi years because of its economic and metaphorical value. But has the venom of politics stained its walls deeper this time? Politicians would tell you otherwise but the truth emerged at the twilight hour. As the Taj darkened its silhouette with the receding light of day, a small temple behind it on the river bank came alive with bells and fire rituals. The birds came home to roost on the domes, lulled by the dulcet beats. The Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb can still withstand a rough tide or two.

1,06-1-20,We didn't start the fire,"As tension between the US and Iran is bound to escalate, India and the world must be prepared to be singed by it

The drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force variously described by analysts as being the “Tip of the Iranian Spear”, has the potential to spark a war. One just hopes that the targetting of one of Iran’s most powerful men and its most seasoned military commander, particularly in the Middle-East, should have been taken very carefully by the US’ political and military command. Unlike someone like Osama bin Laden, who was killed by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2011, Soleimani was not difficult to find. Until a few days ago, he was secure that his position granted him a degree of safety. Unlike Houthi rebels or even the Taliban, he was the representative of a sovereign state. He had adopted an aggressive political and military tactic that continued to challenge America’s regional primacy. What his death will mean for future conflict in the Middle-East remains to be seen. Some analysts worry that this will certainly lead to a formal war between Iran and the US. But commentary and analysis on the Levant and Persia are a dime a dozen because there are other experts who say that Iran should have seen this coming, particularly after the way the US embassy in Baghdad was attacked by Shia militants in the guise of protesters a few days ago. Soleimani was the man behind a lot of America’s troubles in the region. Besides, he had irritated and attacked others as well. His hands were behind field actions such as the attacks on the Saudi Arabian refinery, sites in Yemen and the formation of the nebulous alliance between Turkey, Iran and Malaysia. However, according to some reasoned analysts, Soleimani’s violent death is a bit more troubling because he was also a “grown-up” in a world full of juvenile imbeciles, who do not think of the consequences of their actions. He thought he knew how far Iran’s enemies would push the boundaries although he did get his calculations wrong at times. One of those miscalculations cost him his life.

What does this mean for India, a country that has been trying to balance its relationship with both Iran and the US? The External Affairs Ministry put out a reasoned and sensible statement, asking the US and Iran to exercise “restraint” in order to avoid destabilising the region, but it is the Petroleum Ministry that should be petrified in case the conflict escalates. If Narendra Modi’s economic team should be grateful for anything, it is the relative calm in fuel prices over the past six years, which has allowed him to impose high taxes on petrol and diesel without too many complaints from the public at large. But with prices of petrol at the pump already reaching the Rs 80 mark, how much more can the consumers take? Surely, some anger around the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is being fuelled by the current economic situation in the country, with job creation being not sufficient enough. Can the Indian economy afford an oil shock right now? Unlikely. With India’s relations no more being limited to oil, escalating tensions may even hurt its ambitious plans to develop the new oceanic port in Chabahar, a key transport and trade corridor with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Will Soleimani’s death lead to a war? Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khameini has already said that Tehran will retaliate. And it would do so at a suitable time and place of its choice. Although the top general’s elimination has come as a huge setback for Iran today, it is still very much capable of leading a war against America, howsoever asymmetrical. Should this happen, hostilities between the US and Iran are bound to spell turmoil in the entire Gulf region and lead to a major conflagration. Both the US and Iran are to go to polls soon. A full-scale conflict should not become the inflicting point for either to win over the people. Also, despite his demise, may be the grown-ups can come to the table and de-escalate the situation.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-didn-t-start-the-fire-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/we-didn-t-start-the-fire.html
2,06-1-20,Pak’s doublespeak,"The siege of Nankana Sahib exposed Imran Khan’s motivated championship of the Sikh cause

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has to give up his blunderous ways if he wants to convince the world of his credibility. While “championing the cause” of minorities in India and using an old video from another country as visual evidence of what he calls “pogroms” here, he conveniently forgot violations of minorities in his own backyard. A mob gheraoed Nankana Sahib Gurdwara, the birthplace of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak Dev, and pelted stones over the arrest of a few locals accused of abducting and converting a teenaged Sikh girl last September. What makes this significant is the fact that Khan, who has been curating the minority Sikh constituency to fuel Khalistan hawks against India, has been unable to protect them from genuine abuse and vandalism of their highest shrine on his home turf. The attack completely jeopardises his initiative on the Kartarpur corridor to link Indian Sikhs to the gurdwara. Most damaging for him, the hold-up of innocent pilgrims at the shrine has given grist to the Indian propaganda machinery about minority persecution in Pakistan and the need for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to rehabilitate them. The Modi Government doesn’t need to conduct awareness drives on CAA, the siege of Nankana Sahib has been convincing enough with Khan dim-wittedly becoming its spokesman.

Pakistan has had a dismal track record as far as the treatment of minorities living on its soil is concerned, be it of Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Khalsis, Shias and Ahmadiyya Muslims and even Indian Muslims who migrated to that country at the time of the Partition. Over the last two decades, the population of Sikhs in Pakistan has come down from 40,000 in 2002 to a dismal 8,000 in 2019. But driven by an anti-India design, it did try to placate Sikhs worldwide with the Kartarpur corridor and by reviving the centrality of Nankana Sahib. So the vandalism of angry protesters over the weekend was the proverbial spanner in the works. Not only have many Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) generals, including the former chief Hamid Gul, openly supported the Khalistan movement, several officers have also been acting as handlers and organisers of Sikh separatist activities in Canada, Europe, the US, the UK and Malaysia. Not surprisingly, several Khalistani extremists are being sheltered in Pakistan. In its zeal to foment trouble on Indian soil, the ISI has also been targetting and rewarding crime syndicates in Punjab that have expressed sympathies for the Khalistani movement on their social media platforms. In fact, shedding all pretensions, during the opening of the Kartarpur corridor, Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had released a music video displaying posters of Khalistani separatist leaders in the background. But reports of forced conversions and the dwindling Sikh population in Pakistan have exposed Khan’s duplicity. Unable to drum up much support at the UNGA after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, he now stands even more exposed and ridiculed. Hopefully, Sikhs across the world will see through Pakistan’s nefarious design for what it really is.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak---s-doublespeak-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/pak---s-doublespeak.html
3,06-1-20,Take responsibility,"It is time that we took some responsibility for our actions and impact on the environment and stopped waiting for the Government to do something

It is a chilly January morning and with the clock showing 5.30 am, Delhi is still dark and the Air Quality Index (AQI) is still severely poor. Sunlight finds it hard to penetrate a thick blanket of life-threatening smog. Visibility is under a metre and our vision for a greener Earth and cleaner Delhi and National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) is marred by propaganda of industry lobbyists from the automobile to the hydrocarbon sector.

Stubble doesn’t burn in the neighbouring States of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Haryana and Punjab at this time of the year, yet Delhi-NCR chokes and shivers. The demagogues who wanted to punish farmers lie exposed as the night dew drenches our homes and loved ones with fresh toxic vapour residues. Neither the stubble burning nor the pollution stopped but instead more tractors and happy seeders were sold through Government-supported programmes, effectively increasing consumption of fossil fuels and profits of tractor makers.

We, as a society, made many environmental blunders this year and each of them was made intentionally.

Cars not farmers have darkened Delhi-NCR’s skies: Although the annual stubble burning by farmers is an episodic source of pollution, social media and opinion makers left no stone unturned to berate farmers for choking Delhi-NCR and darkening our skies. They effectively deflected attention from more serious polluters — cars and construction activities.

As we continue to asphyxiate long after the crop residue burning season is over, the truth is out. Cars are the major source of pollution. But the lobbyists don’t care for the real pollution. When India buys lesser cars, they term it as bad economic growth. And what does the Government do? The Odd-Even vehicle rationing scheme of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi Government did well to keep a few cars off the Capital’s roads but this was not a permanent solution.

The expansion of the metro system is a great step forward but we need to do much more. We have to restrict taxis in the city and also heavily tax new car purchases in the Delhi-NCR region, just the way progressive places like Singapore have done in order to bring down their pollution levels. But a larger problem looms unaddressed — Delhi’s darkened Sun. If you fly into the Capital on a sunny day, it’s hard to miss the thick smog enveloping the city even at 20,000 feet. The smog is making it harder for pure sunlight to reach us. It is harmful for us and our plants as sunlight is refracted off smog particles.

However, just taxing cars won’t be enough. We need to create an alternative, carbon-free and safe transportation system. There is a need to look at cities like Copenhagen and so on and incentivise cyclists by building separate cycle tracks and infrastructure so more people can be linked to the metro system in a few pedals from work or home.

Currently Delhi doesn’t even have one dedicated corridor for cyclists, although Delhi has hundreds of thousands who use the cycle everyday to work or for chores. The policymakers should understand there is a stark difference in cycling to Parliament and cycling in areas like Haus Khas. You could be dead in the latter location if you’re not extra cautious. This needs to change and the more we pedal, the faster it will come. This is the first positive step we all can take this New Year. Ditch the car, try a cycle, even if once a week, for what is at stake is not just our air, it’s our sunshine.

Plastic Satyagarha — Refuse, reduce and reuse: While the Narendra Modi Government’s move to ban single use plastic is commendable, the root of the problem is not extirpated. The problem of plastic is entwined with the profits of the petrochemical industry and I doubt there will be any decrease in profits or production of plastic in its various forms unless the demand plummets.

As plastic doesn’t only come in single use form, but in myriad forms starting from the phones to clothes to the toothbrush, comb and food packaging material. The irony, despite the ban on plastic, our landfills are filled with more of the material than ever before. Plastic producing giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo continue to pump plastics into the country through their bottles and packaging materials. It’s about time the Modi Government took a bolder step based on the “polluter pays principle” and make these corporations liable for our overflowing landfills and contaminated ground water. India needs to tax them while at the same time ban plastic packaging. The food laws need to be re-imagined to curb the menace of micro-plastics in our food and water that are not just harming our health and the health of our children but are also hurting hapless animals who have no role to play in the huge environmental mess that we humans have created.

We need a holistic consumer centric solution. For each person, we need to first follow a three-step principle, a “Plastic Satyagraha,” — refuse, reduce and reuse. We can refuse each time we are given plastics. One simple way is tearing off all the packaging material at the shop you buy it from. Carry minimal or no plastic home. Next would be to reduce the use of plastic, or at least try and replace each plastic item you use with some natural alternative and last try and reuse the plastic you have.

If we don’t act now the “trash mountains of Delhi” will be higher than the historic and iconic Qutub Minar soon.

Don’t buy it, try and grow it: Delhi is the top destination for thousands of trucks each day carrying different types of fruits, vegetables and so on. Whether it is the Azadpur Mandi or other smaller wholesale vegetable markets, the transportation of food for Delhiites has a heavy carbon footprint. If you look closer, the whole system of production that gets food to Delhi is extremely degrading.

From the growing stage, our food is dozed with chemicals and then sometimes kept in cold storage and finally trucked to a wholesale vegetable market near you. Try and imagine each step and the kind of pollution each stage causes.

Social media has ample videos showcasing adulterations in our food. But this is a necessary evil, as Delhi, much like other cities, cannot be self-sufficient in food supply and we need to depend on villages and the trucks to send food to the city. But, nevertheless, we can ease this burden and reduce our dependency on food grown outside the city.

Change is coming to Delhi as urban gardening is proliferating around the national Capital. City dwellers are leasing land collectively around Gurugram and spending their weekends working on the farms and helping grow their own vegetables.

Rooftop gardening is another activity which finds much resonance with young professionals in Indian cities. But to make this into a large movement the municipal bodies or city administration can step in and help convert some parts of public parks as organic horticulture zones. These zones will become carbon sinks and also attract local residents to pay the city to grow their own vegetables and herbs. This encourages public participation and also gives a chance for urbanites to learn about horticulture. As a big bonus this may also generate additional revenue for the municipal bodies.

This 2020, no matter if you live in Delhi or Chennai, try your hand at gardening. It doesn’t matter if you grow a herb or a pumpkin, the trick is don’t buy everything, try growing something this year. This is the only way we will reduce our carbon footprint and give future generations a fighting chance at survival. It is time that we took some responsibility for our actions and impact on the environment and stopped waiting for the Government to do something.

4,06-1-20,The dark world of bright crystals,"Perhaps one day, management experts will wake up to the sorry state of affairs and the despicable conditions of those involved in crystal mining

Business is fickle because, like the rising sun, an emerging success is always welcomed and the declining sun is ever-abjured. At the end of the day, there is a lot of jostling to continue to be successful and brand oneself as such. There are instances in post-Independence India where a public system was rapaciously ransacked by voracious and cunning individuals to get an initial breakthrough in the circle of wealth. Interpretation has it that in the most successful of such ravaging for years, nothing was unknown. What was happening was almost in the knowledge of those who cared to know. Even the so-called culprits were known. But no one was really booked because if you booked one of the key functionaries, he/she knew too much. Once they spilt the beans it would cause convulsions in the close circles and nobody knew who would be affected. So at the end of the day, a new business house was born and some flourishing careers in the corporate and governance circles were re-enforced. A few of the vulnerable known to flourish in any regime thrive even today.

The moralist can go into convulsions and the Romanist can thump his chest but the colt had bolted. This cannot be the place to discuss the morality and worse, of such a scenario. Someday if not in an economic history book, this episode would make a successful narrative of a novel. That’s another story. The basic proposition remains that lucre is always dirty. The dictionary defines it as a monetary reward or gain. It is more than that. It is the end pursued by many minds. Whether it is dirty or not, doesn’t seem to affect many in any substantial sense. Not very long ago there was a movie called Blood Diamond. Those who know of it would recall how it made a theme of the kind of exploitation of the human body and more that went into diamond mining. The message was simple, that those who buy these diamonds lubricate the coffers of unscrupulous businessmen who have no conscience. The story does not end there. The high and the mighty, in their search for the distinctive, lubricate the business of the unscrupulous. The public reaction to the information can only be of the type that, however, is material to actual ground conditions. If the movie made any dent on the overall attraction of the business or reformed the processes, the message is still to come in. Such movies and related writings on this theme are neither unique nor once in a lifetime. It’s like a parallel stream. The business does what it does. The objector does what he/she has to.

The art lies in recognising that such writings or presentations, even cinematic, help to contain the problem, because at least something is being set in motion to do so. Unfortunately, ethics in enterprise is a very limited domain, even in business schools. The emphasis seems to be more on proper bookkeeping, integrity of documentation and simple morality of truthfulness and more. There can be nothing wrong with that. However, there are other core issues. It doesn’t happen only in diamonds. It has to do with matters big and small, including child labour. There was a newspaper report of crystals colonising Tucson in February 2019. This was the month of the Tucson gem shows, perhaps the largest crystal expo in the world. A very large species of businessmen, from new-age enthusiasts to major wholesalers would number amongst the customers and there are no prizes for guessing that the US and Europe dominate the users. They include everything, from museums to crystal healers, yoga centres to wellness retailers. This is a specific fallout of the wellness fever which has swept the world. Go to any city or aspiring city and one business which is on the uptake is that of crystals and gems. There is nothing wrong with that. The only thing is that in a world where so many things are being converted into revenue items, there is little surprise that being social media-friendly lubricates business. Aesthetics, combined with cosmic spirituality, is a heady cocktail. Healing crystals are a great rage and when anything becomes such a trend, passions, the like of which can only be selectively discussed, enter the scene. Today there is a crystal for every occasion. The celebrities, the collectors, the investors are all into it.

Predictably the concept of ambient energy enters the scene. Yet, the fate of miners of crystals, even in the age of rose quartz, reminded one of scenes from the Blood Diamond. There is almost a conspiracy of silence because enthusiastic patrons of all kinds of causes, from the most obvious to more subtle ones, are a dime a dozen. However, there appear to be very few applying scrutiny to the crystal industry. There is no certification of fair trade in crystals. Transparency schemes, the likes of which are there for gold and diamond, are yet to enter the crystal industry in any significant way. Perhaps one day, management experts will wake up to the sorry state of affairs and the despicable conditions of some of the poorest of the poor involved in the mining for crystals. Perhaps they will make an issue of matters of human dignity and sound working conditions, if not of terrible business practices. Hope that day comes soon.

5,06-1-20,A ‘private matter’ punishable by death,"When the British introduced the blasphemy law in India in 1860, it did not carry the death sentence. Then how and when did the law mutate to claim more and more victims?

The regime of 13th century king of France, Louis IX, formulated and imposed what are considered to be the first formal laws that prescribed punishments for those found to have committed blasphemy. The punishments included the mutilation of the tongue and the lips. Historian Nora Berend writes in her book At the Gate of Christendom that Louis IX largely used his blasphemy laws against Jews and Muslims and against his Christian opponents. He also ordered the burning of dozens of copies of the Talmud — the central text of Rabbinic Judaism — after claiming its contents were “blasphemous.”

There was no concept of such a law in the Muslim world at the time. As Fareed Zakaria (quoting the renowned South Asian Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiddudin Khan) points out in an article, “Nowhere does the Quran prescribe the punishment of lashes, or death, or any other physical punishment.”

Yet, a detailed 2017 report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom placed Iran and Pakistan as the top two countries whose blasphemy laws severely deviated from recognised international human rights principles. The report studied 71 countries where some form of blasphemy laws exist. It then investigated the severity of these laws and prepared a list. The top two names on the list were of Iran and Pakistan.

According to the report, the blasphemy laws of these two countries were also more likely to be misused and/or encourage vigilante violence. To understand how this happened, it is important to investigate how the idea of the blasphemy law evolved in Europe, where it had originated. After 13th century France, blasphemy laws also appeared in England in the 15th century during the reign of King Henry IX. Between 1404 and 1504, dozens of alleged “heretics” were killed for blasphemy. The 13th century blasphemy law in France was finally repealed almost 500 years after it was first enforced. It was cancelled in 1791 soon after a revolution toppled the French monarchy and established a secular nationalist republic in France. England’s 15th century blasphemy law was made part of the British Common Law in the 17th century, but without the death penalty. In 1949, a British judge ruled that the law was a “dead letter” and “not required anymore.”

It is interesting to note that various forms of blasphemy laws were enacted in Europe between the 13th and 19th centuries, but no such law was ever adopted by a Muslim-ruled region. The first Muslim-majority region to prescribe the death sentence for blasphemy was Saudi Arabia, when that country came into being in 1932.

In South Asia, the idea of the blasphemy law was introduced by British colonialists. It was first codified in India in 1860 and then, as tensions and violence between Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus increased, it was expanded in 1927. It did not carry the death sentence. In 1947, when Pakistan came into being, it adopted the 1927 law. It carried a one-year prison sentence or a fine. Pakistan thus became the second Muslim country to have a blasphemy law. Libya adopted one in 1953 and Indonesia in 1965. None carried the death sentence.

However, the situation began to mutate rather drastically when Shia clerics came on top during the 1979 revolution in Iran. The new Islamic regime enacted stern blasphemy laws, making Iran only the second Muslim-majority country to prescribe the death penalty for blasphemy after Saudi Arabia. Pakistan would become the third and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, the fourth. In Pakistan, the intransigent military regime of General Zia that had come to power in July 1977, upped the ante in 1980 when it added two more years of imprisonment to the 1927 law. In response to Iran’s increasing “Islamisation”, Saudi Arabia began to further beef up its blasphemy laws. The Zia regime followed suit when, in 1982, it further expanded the law by prescribing life imprisonment for those found guilty of “defiling the Muslim holy texts.” A year after the 1985 election, in which only pro-Zia parties and individuals took part, a new Parliament came into being, led by Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo. Zia encouraged the Parliament to legislate laws that would “truly turn Pakistan into an Islamic state.”

Human rights activist and lawyer, the late Asma Jahangir then delivered a scathing speech at a Women’s Action Forum (WAF) seminar in Islamabad in which she asked why the ulema (Muslim scholars) were being turned into a political class. A member of the Jamaat-i-Islami Liaqat Baloch and another member of Zia’s Parliament, Nisar Fatima, took slight at Jahangir’s criticism and demanded that WAF be banned.Fatima then accused Jahangir of using inappropriate language for Islam. A former justice of the Zia regime’s Federal Shariat Court, Aftab Hussain, disagreed. He told reporters that he found nothing objectionable in Jahangir’s speech. But Fatima continued to demand action. With a few of her colleagues in the Parliament, she demanded that a Bill be tabled to add the death penalty to the blasphemy law. In the “debate” that ensued, only an MNA from Jhang, Arif Khan, pleaded that patience be exhibited to pass a Bill prescribing the death sentence. But his voice was drowned out by those who claimed that “divine displeasure awaited those who would oppose the Bill.” Ironically, the situation seemed to have spiralled out of control for the Junejo regime because some ministers tried to stall the Bill. But they couldn’t and it was passed into a law which many experts believe is highly vague.

For example, a Multan court recently sentenced a professor to death for committing blasphemy, whereas the Islamabad High Court rejected a petition against Prime Minister Imran Khan (for allegedly committing blasphemy) when the court noted that “religion was a private matter.”

From 1947 until 1985, just 14 people were charged under the blasphemy law that carried a one-year sentence.

After 1986, when the death penalty was added, over 1,500 people have been charged.

16,06-1-20,"Manohar condemns attack on Nankana, launches Sampark Abhiyan on CAA","Haryana CM Manohar Lal on Sunday condemned the incident of attack and stone-pelting on Sikh devotees at the historic Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and said that protest would be made, if required, against Pakistan and other countries like Afghanistan and Bangladesh so as to ensure that the minorities residing there are not oppressed in the name of religion and their rights are protected.

Manohar Lal was addressing the gathering after launching the Sampark Abhiyan in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Sector-10 at Panchkula today.

He said that the Parliament has recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act to provide citizenship of India to the minorities coming to India from neighboring countries that are being oppressed there in the name of religion. But few opposition parties are misguiding the people of the country by spreading false information without understanding the provisions of the Act.

He said that it is being propagated among the Muslims that it is a law to take away the citizenship of the country from the Muslims, whereas in reality, it is to give citizenship. He exhorted the people to remain cautious and do not fall prey to these rumours and consider this Act as in the interest of humanity. He said that this is not a new Act as it has came into force in the year 1955 as per which minority communities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian who are oppressed in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh in the name of religion come to India to lead a respectable life. Earlier, it was mandatory for them to stay in India for 11 years to get citizenship of India but now Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi has implemented a new provision as per which minorities who have come to India before 2014 could be given citizenship of India.

He said that during Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Government in which Mr Lal Krishna Advani was the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh had himself said in the Lok Sabha that such people should be given citizenship as soon as possible. In Haryana, now decks have been cleared for giving them citizenship, he added.Mr Manohar Lal said that a number 8866288662 has been started to register participation of people of Haryana in the Sampark Abhiyan in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at the Central Level.

20,06-1-20,Jivatman — the Embodied Soul,"Metaphysically speaking, whole of the existence can be viewed through the prism of three basic entities namely jivatman, the embodied soul or the self; Pramatman, the Supersoul; and prakriti, the nature.

The origin and movements of the jivatman have been described in shlokas 15.7 to 15.9 of the Bhagavad Gita. It has been stated that an eternal fraction of the Supreme Lord having become a living soul acquires five senses and the mind from the nature. It, thus, becomes an embodied soul. That is how the beings are created. It has further been stated that the embodied soul experiences life through body and the mind. When he leaves the body and takes another, he carries these senses and the mind along, in the same manner as the air carries aromas from one place to another.

In other words, the embodied soul is an inalienable part of Ishvara, the God. Its distinctiveness is determined by the senses and the mind which it draws, from nature, to itself. The jivatman forms an inseparable part of the Supreme Lord in the same manner as the space in an earthen pot, though identifiable separately, is an inseparable part of the universal space. The embodied soul is qualitatively the same as the Supreme Lord, just as pieces of the gold are also gold.

The jivatman, thus, expresses one part of the all-pervading consciousness. The Divine does not move from place to place. It is the embodied soul which travels from one abode to another. Each time it takes birth, it acquires a body-mind complex out of the materials available in nature, as per his past evolution and future needs.

Beings manifest from the union of the material and the consciousness natures of Ishvara, the Supreme Lord (shlokas 7.4 to 7. 6). The integral and indivisible reality of the Divine appears to be divided into multiplicity of beings (Shloka 13.17).

Thus, it is evident that the mind-body complex and the soul are different. While the former is perishable, the latter is eternal and imperishable. The jivatman does not cease to exist when the body ceases to be. It is the inner light that continues to shine from birth to birth and from life to life.

The self is superior to everything else in the human being. It is stated in shloka 3.42 that senses are great, but mind is greater than the senses ; and intelligence is greater than the mind. And that which is greater than even the intelligence, is the self.

Further, nature of the jivatman has been explained in shlokas from 2.17 to 2.25. As per these shlokas Atman (or jivatman) is all-pervading, indestructible, immutable, eternal and incomprehensible. He is unmanifest, unthinkable ; and unchanging. He can neither kill anyone nor can anyone kill him. He does not get killed when the body is killed. Neither is he ever born, nor does he die at any time. Having once come into being, he never ceases to be. He is unborn, ever-existing and primeval. He can neither be cut by any weapon nor can he be burned by fire. Waters do not make him wet, nor does wind make him dry. He is indivisible. He is the same for ever.

Just as a person discards worn-out garments and puts on new ones ; in the same manner, the embodied soul gives up old bodies and takes up new ones.

Gita recognises the fact that it is not very easy for an ordinary human being to gauge the true nature of the soul. That is why it is stated that some people look upon soul with amazement, others speak about it with amazement ; and still others hear about it with amazement. But even after hearing about him, no one can fathom his mystery (Shloka 2.29). Shlokas 15.10 and 15.11 have also re-iterated this view wherein it is stated that the unintelligent and the deluded ones cannot see the indwelling soul when he is staying, experiencing or departing from the body. Only the ones who have an eye of wisdom can.

The concept of the body, the embodied soul and the Supreme Lord has been explained in a slightly different terminology in the chapter 13. The physical body, mind and the entire material world is called the field (kshetra). The one who is aware of the field is kshetragya (the knower of the field). As the one sun illumines the entire universe, so does the knower of the field (Atman) illuminate (through consciousness) this field (the entire body). All beings are born from the union of the field and the knower of the field. The Supreme Lord is the kshetragya in all the fields.When the self is associated with the gunas, it is called kshetragya. And when it is released from these modes of material nature, it is called Pramatman or the Supersoul.

In this very chapter, the physical nature and the soul have been called prakriti and purusha respectively. Both prakriti and purusha are beginningless. Whereas the physical nature is the reason behind all material causes and their effects ; the embodied soul is the reason behind all experiences of pleasure and pain.

A word of caution here. The thoughts, emotions, perceptions, intuition, logic and will etc. should not be confused with the soul.

All these are the functions of body, mind and the intelligence. Jivatman is not the doer but only a witness.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jivatman-----the-embodied-soul.html

The foreign rulers whoever invaded India, never bothered to administer this land, because they found its population with a social hierarchy based on cast system as self-administered. They just did all that was required to remain content in collecting taxes. This self-governing cast division marking the Indian social mosaic, has never allowed a cultural mobilization while composing new pages of its national history. There are no heroes or villains in history. Ideas and beliefs play major roles in weaving the story of a race.

The idea of divine sanction with a package of prejudices, blind beliefs, irrationality and misconceptions is actually the architect of socio-political change that has ever happened here. This shocking revelation is all what this book puts forth in plain and persuasive prose.

In going to sustain and substantiate his claim, the author brings together lots of proofs and propositions from a great many scattered sources and convinces us that we need to comprehend all these forces in order to build a modern nation based on scientific temper.

Cast system is not indigenous to India. The author continues. The idea of a superior cast is originally an ancient Greek mindset that Alexander left here before he retreated. Brahmanism is a new edition of Plato’s philosopher king. Hindus had never been seen to be more loyal and dutiful to any system than the dictates of caste. Laws of Khilafat governed Muslims, on the other hand. Too late, British rule and introduction of English education system set the static Indian society in motion of secularisation and democratization.

Very engaging are the pages when they recount a narrative of ideas and beliefs in their historical succession. The insightful analysis through the x- ray vision of the author relating to past events leaves a reader in awe and wonder when one flips through them. Obsolescent ideas give rise to dictatorial societies, the author argues strongly. Religion has served as a more potent instrument than the State power.

The atheistic Soviet State was caused to collapse by might of church power. Religious belief system played a pivotal role in Indian society and helped it retreat to self governing system. The book has captured the time past and the continuity of the Indian society with a rare dexterity by the brilliant foresight, farsight and insight of the author and is a must to be preserved as a treasure- token for researchers in varsities' libraries and in once’s study table. The publisher of the book is Kalpaz Publications, New Delhi, while its distributor is Guan Books Pvt Ltd, New Delhi.

41,06-1-20,Amarinder condemns Sikh youth killing in Peshawar,"Hard on the heels of attack on Nankana Sahib Gurudwara in Pakistan, a Sikh youth Ravinder Singh was killed in Pak’s Peshawar on Sunday — an unpleasant incident which was condemned by the political leaders, cutting across party lines in Punjab.

Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh besides the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal, SAD MP and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, among others talked tough on the issue.

Expressing anguish, Capt Amarinder urged Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure “strict punishment” to the perpetrators besides a thorough investigation into the matter.

“Shocked and anguished over killing of Sikh youth Ravinder Singh in #Pakistan, coming on heels of #NankanaSahibAttack. @ImranKhanPTI govt must ensure a thorough investigation and strict punishment for the culprits. This is the time to act on what you preach (sic),” tweeted Capt Amarinder.

Condemning the brutal killing of the Sikh youth in Peshawar, SAD chief Sukhbir Badal expressed grave concern over the rising incidents of religious persecution of Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan.

He urged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the issue with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure the safety of Sikh brethren in the neighboring country.

“It is condemnable that a day after a mob attacked Gurdwara Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib, a Sikh youth had been murdered in Peshawar…This shows the extent of religious persecution the Sikhs and other minorities are facing in Pakistan,” said Sukhbir.

He said that rising attacks on religious places as well against Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan are a direct outcome of the anti-minority policies of Pakistan.

“It is because of these policies that Islamic fundamentalists had become a law unto themselves and are persecuting minorities and indulging in forced conversions,” he added.

Sukhbir, giving details, said that the killing of Islamabad reporter Harmeet Singh’s younger brother in Peshawar by unknown assailants proved that innocent people were being targeted indiscriminately to instill a sense of fear among minorities.

“The victim came from Malaysia for his marriage and became a target of hate crime currently on the rise in Pakistan,” he said adding that the Pak government seemed to be in league with the hardliners in targeting minorities there.

Senior SAD leader and the Union Minister Harsimrat also took to Twitter to urge the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately take up the issue with his Pak counterpart Imran Khan and “ensure safety of Sikh brethren there”.

“A day after mob attacked our holy shrine #GurdwaraNankanaSahib, this brutal murder of Sikh youth in Peshawar shows the extent of persecution minorities face in Pak. I urge PM @narendramodi ji to take up the issue with @ImranKhanPTI & ensure the safety of Sikh brethren there (sic),” tweeted Harsimrat.

While attacking Pak, Harsimrat also lashed out at the opposition, and Capt Amarinder Singh in particular. “Another Sikh has been killed just because his brother, the first Sikh news anchor in Pakistan, raised his voice against persecution of minorities there. How many more Sikhs need to die before you & your @INCIndia stop this double speak? (sic)” tweeted Harsimrat addressing to Punjab Chief Minister.

“How much blood has to be spilled before @RahulGandhi & his coterie come to their senses? After vandalisaton of #GurdwaraNankanaSahib, now a Sikh youth has been shot dead in Peshawar. Killings of minorities in Pak underline the need for #CAA, their hope for safe & dignified life (sic),” said Harsimrat in another tweet.

Notably, a 25-year-old youth, identified as Ravinder Singh, was found murdered in Peshawar. Indian Government has also condemned the Sikh youth’s killing and called upon the Pakistan government to “stop prevaricating and take immediate action” to apprehend the perpetrators.

“India strongly condemns targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar (Pakistan) that follows recent despicable vandalism and desecration of Gurdwara Sri Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib and the unresolved case of abduction, forced conversion and marriage of a Sikh girl,” the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement on Sunday.

It may be mentioned that an angry group of local residents had pelted stones at the holy Sikh shrine in Pakistan on Friday evening. The group was allegedly led by the family of a boy who had abducted a Sikh girl, Jagjit Kaur, from her home in August last year. India, on Friday, had strongly condemned the vandalism at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib and called upon the Pakistan Government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community in the neighbouring country.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amarinder-condemns-sikh-youth-killing-in-peshawar.html
42,06-1-20,"No time to wait and watch, take immediate steps to ensure safety of Indians in gulf: Capt to Centre","Amid the escalating US-Iran tensions, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged the Central Government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety and security of the 10 million Indians in the Gulf region.

India could not afford to simply wait and watch, or to just monitor the situation, given the rising stakes in view of the threats and counter-threats between the US and Iran, said Capt Amarinder, in the context of the Union Ministry of External Affairs’ statement that it was keeping a close watch on the situation.

The Chief Minister emphasized that the Indian Government should immediately direct their embassies in the region to connect with the Indians settled there, and provide all possible help to them in this hour of crisis.

Pointing out that besides the US, other countries like Britain, were preparing to evacuate their citizens, if needed, Capt Amarinder asked the Centre to also prepare and initiate plans to evacuate all Indians seeking to return to India in the current circumstances.

The close proximity of the Gulf region to the Indian border made it imperative for the Centre to intervene without delay, and issue the necessary directions to its missions in the West Asian countries, as well as the Indian population there, the Chief Minister stressed.

With the conflict showing no signs of easing, the situation was evidently grave and it would be in the interest of the Indians to leave the Gulf region immediately, he added.

Referring to the large Punjabi and Sikh diaspora also settled in the region, Capt Amarinder further said that his government would extend all support to anyone wanted safe return back home.

Punjab Government officials were in direct contact with the community there and had been instructed to move swiftly in response to any plea for help, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-time-to-wait-and-watch--take-immediate-steps-to-ensure-safety-of-indians-in-gulf--capt-to-centre.html
43,06-1-20,Money-for-absence allegations by registrar,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday demanded time-bound probe into ‘money-for-absence’ allegations by a former registrar, besides setting up a joint action committee of Punjab Vidhan Sabha to look into the allegations.

“The written allegations of government doctors absenting themselves from duty by paying hefty amount leveled by a social activist and former Punjab Government official Dr Pyare Lal Garg are of serious nature, which have earned disgrace for the government,” said AAP’s senior leader and the Leader of the Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema.

He demanded to set up a special committee of Punjab Vidhan Sabha comprising MLAs and representatives of all parties and investigating agencies experts to investigate the allegations within a timeframe to unearth the role of the “health mafia”.Expressing grave concern over the deteriorating public health facilities in the state, Cheema alleged that subsequent governments were solely responsible for their anti-people policies and for allocating shoe-string annual budget to augmenting health services.“There is an urgent need for free medical treatment on the lines of the Arvind Kejriwal Government in Delhi for the people of the state, who are wrestling with high rise inflation and economic slowdown,” said Cheema.He said that Dr Payre Lal Garg, in an article, had leveled serious allegations that a large number of doctors in government dispensaries in rural areas, especially those under the Panchayat Department, were allowed to absent themselves from duty by paying hefty amounts, which had badly hit the services in the rural dispensaries where doctors were not seen around for days.“The allegations leveled by Dr Garg, a former registrar of Baba Farid University, who had been handling various top responsibilities in the state health sector from time-to-time, needed to be investigated seriously and within a timeframe,” he stressed. AAP leader also stressed the need for enhancing annual budget allocation for health and medical education for the financial year 2020-21, on the lines of the Arvind Kejriwal's government in Delhi.

Cheema said that only 3.48 percent of the total budget for health and medical education in the state was earmarked during the financial year 2019-2020, which did not even make for one percent of the state's GDP, as a result of which the health services were badlyhit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/money-for-absence-allegations-by-registrar.html

Speaking at the 12th KLF Corner, a monthly literary event at the Oxford Book Store here, Nayak said Sri Devi had even refused to act with Amitabh Bachhan for many years, saying she would act with the top star only if the lead female character has a central role to play in the script.

""The fact that Sri Devi chose to come back after a gap of 15 years for the movie English Vinglish reveals that she was waiting for a perfect script, where she could play a central role,” remarked Nayak.

People were seen pulling their cars and bikes to give way to the traffic. The most dangerous thing was that the streetlights running at the side of the BRTS were also drown in the water and the possibility of current coming on road could not be ruled out. It took more than 4o minutes for the people to drive a distance of 1 km to cross Noulakha square.

Notably, Indore BRTS which is around 12 kilometers long and is the lifeline of the Indore public transport.

There are more than a dozen imp squares and dozens of side roads connected to this BRTS. More than lakhs of vehicles and people move on this road daily and the outsiders who come to Indore from any side of Indore cross this BRTS road to enter into the city.

Locals told that Indore is aspiring to be the number one in traffic and the maintenance of this BRTS road should be also connected under the project of better traffic system of Indore.

Additional commissioner of Indore municipal Krishan Chaitnya told The Pioneer that he has instructed Devendra Singh and Tomar to look after the causes of water logging at BRTS.

55,06-1-20,Providing quality education in Govt schools is key: Kanwar Pal Gujjar,"Kanwar Pal Gujjar, Minister of Education, Forests, Tourism, Parliamentary Affairs and Hospitality, says that the Government is committed to provide quality education to the students studying in Government schools in Haryana. He says Haryana tourism would further be promoted through digitisation in a big way in 2020.

59-year old, Gujjar won the Assembly election in 2019 for the third time from Jagadhiri Vidhan Sabha constituency by defeating Akram Khan of Congress. He is among the few senior Haryana BJP leaders who won the Assembly election in 2019.

Inspired by Sadhvi Rithambara, Gujjar jumped into the Ram Janambhoomi movement in 1989 and joined the BJP in 1990. He became legislator for the first time in 2000 but quit the assembly to protest Punjab government’s 2004 move to scrap the water-sharing agreement. Gujjar was earlier Speaker of the last Assembly.

In an exclusive interview with The Pioneer, he reveals his political journey and his experience as a Minister of the State. Excerpts from the interview:

Your party had set target of 75+ in the Assembly election 2019 but BJP’s tally reduced to 40 from 47 seats. Your comment

There is nothing much to say on this now. But people have given mandate to BJP in Haryana as we did work. The five or six independents who have won are all BJP rebels who fought separately due to ticket issues so in this way, the BJP did get a majority as the independents were our own. Sometimes, there is a mistake in estimates on seats one will win. But the bottom line remains that we got three per cent more vote share than last time, up to over 36 per cent now. The work Manohar Lal Khattar has done as a State CM of running a non-corrupt government was unheard of in Haryana in the past. Jobs were given in the most transparent manner. Still, the new government will look into any shortcomings and improve upon them in the second.

Congress leaders say that both the parties -BJP and JJP fought election against each other but jointly formed government in the State. Will this coalition government complete its tenure of five years? Your comment

This is laughable as the Congress has won just 31 seats. If the mandate was for Congress, they would have crossed the 45-mark. As far as JJP is concerned, it won 10 seats. Also, JJP is now with us in the new government. This government will complete its five year tenure. There is no threat to this government.

Many senior BJP leaders lost the Assembly election. Eight out of 10 ministers of the previous BJP-led government lost their seats. How did this happen?

Maybe these ministers got too busy in running the government and did not pay adequate attention to people in their constituency. There is a delicate balance which must be maintained as a minister of running the government and attending to people in the constituency.

What are the works you done in your constituency during previous five years’ of BJP government?

All round development took place in my Constituency. From hospitals, schools, colleges and roads to rural electrification, developmental works worth Rs 1,100 crore are either ready or near completion. Two 30-bed hospitals are operational, while work on a 100-bed hospital will start soon. I used to live with the people and held Janata Darbars (open sessions) regularly to solve problems of the people. I have done lots of work and ensured better roads and augmenting the sewerage system besides the setting up of college buildings and ITIs.

How has your political journey been so far?

Since school days, I was interested in politics. I was students’ leader and also contested election of students’ union in Maharaja Aggarsain College, Jagadhri. I was elected as a president of students union in Maharaja Aggarsain College. Since school days, I was also a very keen sportsman. Initially, my family was associated with Congress. An incident has changed my life forever. There was a programme of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) firebrand leader Sadhvi Rithambara in my district Jagadhri in 1990 and I had attended her programme. Her speech was patriotic and motivational. I took membership of RSS and later joined the BJP. In 1991, I contested the election first time as BJP candidate and lost the election by 4000 votes. In 1996, I again lost the election by 520 votes. But I was elected MLA in 2000 when INLD-BJP ruled the state. In 2009, I again lost the election. In 2014, I won by 40, 000 votes and got an opportunity to become a Speaker.

Cutting across the party lines, you as a Speaker were appreciated by leaders of ruling and opposition parties. How was your experience as a Speaker? How do you see your new role as a Minister in the coalition government?

I am thankful to all leaders who appreciated my conduct in the House. I was honest in my work during the session. I gave equal chance to all legislators, including those of opposition, to raise public issues during session. New legislators were also given equal chance to raise public issues.

Unemployment is a big issue before the government. What are the steps being taken in your departments to provide employment opportunities for the youth of the State?

Employment was given to large number of youth of the State during previous five years of BJP-led government. Moreover, the State government has now decided to launch an employment project on a pilot basis in five State colleges. The project will be launched in collaboration with private sector. Under this project, the unemployed graduate and post-graduate youth of the State will be given training on freelancing platforms like upworks.com, Guru.com, Odesk.com.

This type of training will generate self-employment opportunities in selected colleges for the excellence of higher education. After successful implementation of training in these colleges, graduate and postgraduate youth in other government colleges will also be trained to start self-employment and will get an opportunity to work from home.

Being a tourism Minister, what are the steps being taken to attract visitors to the state?

In the forthcoming Surajkund International Crafts Mela, Uzbekistan will be the “Partner Nation”. This time Himachal Pradesh will also participate as a theme-state. Due to the selection of Himachal Pradesh as a theme-state, this time the Surajkund fair will be having the Himachali tradition. After 23 years, cultural diversity of McLeodganj and Manali will be seen in the 35th International Surajkund Craft Fair. Himachal was made a theme-state in Surajkund Fair in 1996. Recently the Pinjore Heritage Festival was held and this time, school students and senior citizens visiting the festival were provided the facility of free entry at the Festival. Haryana Tourism Department has signed an agreement with the 'BharatP' company, so the payment can be accepted through UPI based 'QR' code scanning through more than 120 applications like Paytm, Google-Pay, Bheem-UPI, Phone-Pe, HDFC-Payzapp, SBI YONO, Truecaller etc in Haryana government tourist resorts and petrol pumps. Also, 120 swipe-machines have been installed at the department's resort and petrol pump to promote digitization in the department.

Many ministers (including you) of the Haryana government recently conducted raids in various departments and suspended the officials. What was the need for it?

Inspections should be conducted in departments from time to time so that services to the people can be delivered on time. During review meeting, I had directed to suspend Junior Engineer (JE) of Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam in Karnal for not performing his duties properly.

How will you improve level of education in government schools?

The Education board is presently holding various academic activities. To ensure the smooth functioning, 100 percent computerisation has been adopted by the Board. In many cases, the Haryana board has adopted the transparent policies of Central Board of Secondary Education, (CBSE), which includes Internal and continuous assessment of school candidates. Government and private schools of the State, which have excelled in the Board of School Education Haryana examinations were honoured by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

What is farm tourism? What steps are being taken to promote it?

Farm-tourism will be promoted in the State so that farmers can earn extra income along with their basic work. For this purpose, some places will be identified where tourists from India and abroad can get the information about Haryanvi culture such as making jaggery, cow milking, sowing seeds, plucking fruits in orchards, kite flying, bullock cart ride and Wrestlers arena. Till now 17 people have been given the license for Farm Tourism in Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar, Sonipat, and other districts and for this there is a lot of trend among tourists.

58,06-1-20,Some cosmetics may cause a skin rash,"Do you know why many different chemical compounds found in creams, cosmetics, and other topical consumer products trigger allergic reactions in the skin? The way some chemicals displace natural fat-like molecules -- called lipids -- in skin cells may be the culprit, suggests new research.

This discovery, published in the journal Science Immunology, raises the possibility that allergic contact dermatitis could be stopped by applying competing lipids to the skin to displace those triggering the immune reaction.

Currently, the only way to stop allergic contact dermatitis is to identify and avoid contact with the offending chemical. Topical ointments can help sooth the rashes, which usually clear up in less than a month.

In severe cases, physicians may prescribe oral corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents that suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of infections and other side effects.

An allergic reaction begins when the immune system's T cells recognise a chemical as foreign. T cells do not directly recognise small chemicals, and research suggests that these compounds need to undergo a chemical reaction with larger proteins in order to make themselves visible to T cells.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/some-cosmetics-may-cause-a-skin-rash.html

60,06-1-20,CM launches awareness drive,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday slammed Pakistan over religious persecution of minorities after the recent Nankana Sahib incident.

Citing the Nankana Sahib vandalism in Pakistan, Manohar Lal said that this incident is enough to prove that the minorities in Pakistan and other Islamic countries are being subjected to inhuman and step-motherly treatment.

“Protest would be made, if required, against Pakistan and other countries like Afghanistan and Bangladesh so as to ensure that the minorities residing there are not oppressed in the name of religion and their rights are protected,” he said while condemning the attack and stone-pelting on Sikh devotees at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib.

Manohar Lal was addressing a gathering after launching the Sampark Abhiyan in support of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) in Sector-10 at Panchkula.

He said that the Parliament has recently passed Citizenship Amendment Act to provide citizenship of India to the minorities coming to India from neighboring countries who are being oppressed there in the name of religion. But few opposition parties are misguiding the people of the country by spreading false information without understanding the provisions of the Act, Manohar Lal said.

He said that it is being propagated among the Muslims that it is a law to take away the citizenship of the country from the Muslims, whereas in reality, it is to give citizenship.He exhorted the people to remain cautious and do not fall prey to these rumours and consider this Act as in the interest of humanity.

The Chief Minister said that this is not a new Act as it has came into force in the year 1955 as per which minority communities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian who are oppressed in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh in the name of religion come to India to lead a respectable life. Earlier, it was mandatory for them to stay in India for 11 years to get citizenship of India but now Prime Minister Narendra Modi has implemented a new provision as per which minorities who have come to India before 2014 could be given citizenship of India, he added.

He further said that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Government in which Lal Krishna Advani was the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh had himself said in the Lok Sabha that such people should be given citizenship as soon as possible. In Haryana, now decks have been cleared for giving them citizenship, he added.

Manohar Lal said that a number 8866288662 has been started to register participation of people of Haryana in the Sampark Abhiyan in support of CAA.He said that people could give their consent in favour of CAA by giving missed call on this number.

Earlier, the Chief Minister also visited the houses of prominent people in Sector-10 at Panchkula as part of Sampark Abhiyan and garner support in favour of CAA.Among those present on this occasion included Vidhan Sabha Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar, Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, Deputy Commissioner of Police Kamaldeep Goyal and others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-launches-awareness-drive.html
61,06-1-20,"Refrain from politicising Nankana Sahib incident, Jakhar tells BJP","Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Sunday said that the BJP-led NDA Government must resolve the incident of Sri Nankana Sahib by taking up the matter with the Pakistan Government instead of politicising it.

Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president advised that the Union Government to refrain from politicizing the sensitive issue. “Rather, the Union Government must follow Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who has asked Pakistan Prime Minister to intervene for immediate action in the matter,” said Jakhar adding that instead of politicking on the matter concerned with the Sikhs’ psyche, the Centre must take up this matter with the Pakistani Government for its immediate resolution.

Jakhar said that the matter was concerned with the emotions of the Sikhs and it was unfortunate that the BJP-led Central Government was trying to justify its draconian law by politicizing this incident.“Sri Nankana Sahib is a pious place for the entire humanity in general and Sikhs in particular…Politicization of this unfortunate incident is reflection of BJP’s myopic outlook,” said Jakhar while asking the Central Government to use its diplomatic relations with the neighboring country to ensure the safety of our religious places in Pakistan.

Slamming the BJP Government, PPCC chief said that it was unfortunate that by shedding crocodile tears on the issue, BJP is trying to justify its Citizenship Act, which has been framed in contrast with the basic spirit of the Indian Constitution.He said that it was high time that the Pakistani Government must be asked to ensure severest of severe punishment for the perpetrators of the heinous incident at Sri Nankana Sahib.

“The psyche of the Sikhs has been bruised with this incident but the manner in which Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has reacted on it has further disappointed the Sikhs,” he said.Jakhar added that linking of this incident with Citizenship Act by BJP was reflection of its communal outlook and hatred for the minorities. “It is shameful that BJP is trying to use the feelings of Sikhs for marketing of its draconian law,” he said while reminding the BJP that Sikhs were not political currency of any political party, which it could utilize for its vested interests.“To hide its sin, BJP is doing theatricals on this unfortunate incident,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/refrain-from-politicising-nankana-sahib-incident--jakhar-tells-bjp.html
62,06-1-20,"SAD, BJP question Sidhu’s silence","Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) on Sunday questioned the silence of senior Congress leader and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “friend” Navjot Singh Sidhu on the sacrilegious violent attack by a mob on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in the neighbouring country.

Questioning Sidhu’s silence on the “hate attack” on the Sikhs as well as Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, SAD’s former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said that Sidhu had not only belied his love for the Pak Army and ISI but had also proved that he was not honest to his own country and his community.“It is clear that Sidhu has sold his soul to the Pak military establishment and is being used by the ISI to further its anti-India plans. This is the reason why he has become ISI mouthpiece and has even turned against his own brethren and their suffering in Pakistan,” said Grewal.

Asking Sidhu to explain his silence on the forced conversion of a minor Sikh girl in Pakistan and the subsequent turn of events which have led to death threats to the victim family, stoning of Gurdwara Janam Asthan and even threats to rename the holy city of Nankana Sahib, the Akali leader said: “This alone proves where your loyalties lie”.

Grewal said that no Sikh worldwide could tolerate forced conversions of community members and stoning of its most holy shrines. “Similarly, they will never forgive those like Sidhu who continue to dance to the tunes of their friends in Pakistan,”

he added.Asking Sidhu to clear the air immediately or be ready for the subsequent consequences, Grewal said: “Sidhu must condemn the Pak establishment as well as his friend and Pak Prime Minister Imran Khan immediately. Sidhu should also use his good offices with his buddy General Qamar Javed Bajwa to ensure swift and decisive action against all those who stoned Gurdwara Janan Asthan as well as those responsible for the forced conversion of the minor Sikh girl.”

Asserting that everyone was aware of Pak’s evil designs, Grewal urged the Sikh community to stand up as one to condemn persecution and oppression of Sikhs in Pakistan. “We also appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give a stern message to Pakistan that this dastardly behavior will not be tolerated at any cost,” he said.

Simultaneously, we warn the Congress party and the Gandhi family not to play Pakistan’s game by remaining silent on the barbarity committed against Gurdwara Janan Asthan and only speaking up after being called out by Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, he added.

WHY MOTORMOUTH SIDHU NOT UTTERED A WORD AGAINST HIS ‘PAK FRIENDS’: BJP

Hitting out at the Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu for his ‘studied silence’ on Nankana Sahib incident, Punjab BJP’s senior leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina on Sunday said that while the entire Sikh community and nation was shocked at the incident, “motor-mouth Sidhu has gone into hibernation and has not uttered even a word against his Pakistani friends”.

“Where are you hiding now? Your friends, whom you were embracing, have not only waged war against India but are even targeting the most sacred places like birth place of Guru Nank Dev. Your silence is deafening,” said Chhina, Sidhu’s known staunch opponent.Chhina said that the NDA Government had brought courageous Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which is justified in the wake of the attack on holy shrine of the Sikhs in Pakistan. “The Sikhs and Hindus are minorities and are not safe in Pakistan. Their lives, properties and places of worships are always under attack. The CAA has brought respite to the bealeagured minority communities as they can seek right to live in India,” said Chhina",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad--bjp-question-sidhu---s-silence.html

68,06-1-20,"Shah says Kejriwal misleading people, CM hits back","War of words broke out between the BJP president Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after the former accused the Chief Minister of misleading people with a host of promises. He also sought to know whether the AAP Government has completed any of the promised work in the last five years.

Reacting to the charges, Kejriwal said Shah said nothing other than to ""abuse"" him. Kejriwal said the Home Minister Amit Shah choose to ""abuse"" him instead of talking about development and pointing out shortcomings of the AAP-led Government at a rally.

""I heard the entire speech of the Home Minister, Amit Shah ji. I thought he would point out the shortcomings of our work and talk about the development of Delhi. He did not say anything else except abusing me,"" he said in a tweet.

""If they (BJP) have suggestions for Delhi, then tell and we will implement them in the next five years,"" Kejriwal said.

Addressing a BJP's booth-level workers' rally, Shah alleged that Kejriwal came to power in Delhi five years back by misleading people with a host of promises. He also accused Kejriwal of ""favouring the tukde tukde"" gang by not giving sanction to prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar, the former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU), in the JNU sedition case.

Shah also exuded confidence that the BJP will come to power in Delhi under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP has been out of power in Delhi since 1998. ""He promised 20 colleges, I cannot see any even with binoculars. He promised 5,000 schools but they are not visible even with spectacles,"" Shah said and asked party workers to ensure that the BJP stages a comeback in Delhi after a gap of 20 years.

Asking whether the AAP government has completed any work during its tenure, the BJP president listed the works done by the Centre for Delhi in the last five years.

Urging party workers to undertake door-to-door campaign to take the BJP's message to the people, Shah said he will himself take part in 'mohalla sabha' campaign in the national capital.

The Home Minister also led the party's door-to-door 10-day campaign to spread awareness about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act with top party leaders reaching out to people across the country, amid a wave of protests against the contentious law since it was passed in December.

Shah visited homes in Lajpat Nagar and talked to people about the benefits of the amended citizenship law. He also distributed literature on the subject and urged them to go through it.

The BJP has launched a 'Jan Jagran' (public awareness) campaign to contact three crore families to counter the opposition's campaign against the CAA and inform the masses about its features. The event is a public awareness campaign to apprise people about the outcome of the revocation of Article 370.

Listing various works done by Modi government in Delhi including construction of eastern and western peripheral expressways to reduce pollution, expansion of Delhi Metro, property registries in unauthorised colonies and redevelopment of slums, Shah hit out at the Kejriwal government for falling short of fulfilling his promises on various fronts.

Speaking immediately before Shah, party's West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma led the crowd in chanting ""Jai Sri Ram"" and dubbed Modi as ""Bharat ka laal (son of India) who abrogated Article 370, paved way for construction of Ram temple and provided ownership in unauthorised colonies in Delhi as wished by the people.

Verma invited the BJP president to address the booth level workers, introducing him as the man ""who delivered what he promised"" and under whose leadership the BJP won 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

BJP working president JP Nadda said that BJP will achieve its target in Assembly polls through dedication and hard work of its workers.

The convention was attended by Union ministers and Assembly poll incharges Prakash Javadekar, Hardeep Puri and Nityanand Rai, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari, Union minister Harsh Vardhan, BJP MPs Ramesh Bidhuri, Meenakshi Lekhi, Gautam Gambhi, Hans Raj Hans senior party leader Vijay Malhotra, party vice president Shyam Jaju, election committee convener Tarun Chugh among others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shah-says-kejriwal-misleading-people--cm-hits-back.html

With inauguration of these new clinics, the total number of mohalla clinics across the city has risen to 450.

""We targeted 1,000 Mohalla clinics in Delhi. Due to administrative reasons, work in this regard could resume just three-four months ago resume at an accelerated speed. Within the next three-four months, remaining Mohalla Clinics will be inaugurated"", said the chief minister.

""When we came to power in 2015, we observed that there is no lack of big hospitals in Delhi. In Delhi, we have bigger hospitals like AIIMS, LNJP, GB Pant, GTB, and Safdarjung. But for the common people, it was difficult for accessing these hospitals for treatment of small illnesses like cold, cough, and fever and so on. Due to this, these hospitals used to experience a huge rush. So we realized that if we start smaller clinics in nearby locations, people can access the service of doctors and avail medicines and treatment without traveling a lot. Also, it will reduce the rush in the bigger hospitals in Delhi,"" he added.

The chief Minister said that the government has faced so many difficulties to expand this initiative in these years. ""The files were pending for one to two years. Then the Supreme Court judgment came in between and it eased the process of opening new Mohalla Clinics. Now we made 450 Mohalla Clinics functional. In the coming three-four months, more clinics will be opened and I hope that the target of 1,000 Mohalla clinics will be achieved in Delhi"", he said.

As per the officials, about two Crore OPD patients and conducted 18 Lakhs tests until November 2019. Earlier, the number of patients in Delhi government hospitals was three Crores annually. Since AAP led government made hospitals better in terms of infrastructure and cleanliness, and treatment and medicines free, the turnout of patients has now doubled to six Crores annually.

""Government hospitals are being closed down and the standard of government dispensaries is deteriorating in other states across the country. There you may see broken walls, the absence of doctors and staff and people losing trust. But in Delhi, across the city, Mohalla Clinics are being opened, and Air Conditioned hospitals are being built. In Delhi, people's trust in the Public healthcare system has been multiplied,"" said the cm.

The AAP government is also expecting that the development of this primary health care will find a place in Guinness World Records and Limca Book of Records. ""If people are happy, I would be happy. It is Guinness World Records for me. I don't require anything more than that"", said Kejriwal.

The mohalla clinics, porta cabin alike settlement are being set up in about 50 to 60 sqm built-up area, in a plot of about 100 to 150 sqm in a semi-permanent structure built with modern technology and the latest design economically made. The Clinics (Rented) are being set up in rented premises with a minimum of 40 sq. meter built-up area and at least one Toilet.

These clinics operated in shift basis from 8.00 am to 02.00 pm for normal Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinic (AAMC); Double Shift: 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.

70,06-1-20,Mandal dam: Tribal bodies keep their fingers crossed,"Tribal organisations are keeping an anxious eye on the new Government led by a tribal Chief Minister as to how it handles and tackles the issue of renovation of the four-decade-old Mandal dam.

President of the Kutku Doob Chhetra Sangharsh Samiti Pratap Tirkey said “We are not against the repair or renovation of the Mandal dam, but our demands should be met before any work begins here.”

Listing his demands, Tirkey said, “First is one time settlement of compensation. Rehabilitation of 15 villages facing threat of submergence should be done. Second demand is to give the displaced all infrastructural facilities like roads, drinking water, medical assistance, education, PDS shops, electricity etc.”

The concerned department identifies only 6 villages susceptible to flooding if four gates are installed at this dam. The height of the dam is 341 meters. Tirkey said, “I know that irrigation department has identified only six villages that may get submerged, but let them assure that the remaining 9 villages will not face any problem on account of this dam.”

Tirkey said the submergence and displacement will affect more than 90 per cent population of the tribal which is no minor issue at all.

He said, “We have heard that State Government is planning to send troops in large numbers at Mandal dam site for the start of work by the executing agency Webcos. We will not allow any such re building of this dam under the shadow of the guns.”

He said, “We tribal do not want any confrontation but if it is imposed upon us then tribal know how to deal with such a situation.”

Police sources in Latehar district as Mandal dam comes under Latehar district said “It is really a big challenge to start work on the dam.”

Police sources admitted that tribal men, women and children had squatted for days together on the road to Mandal dam soon after PM Narendra Modi’s re-launching of this dam on January 5 last year from the Chiyanki air strip.

Sources said the tribal then had even stopped newsmen from visiting the dam. Sources said same resistance is in store among the tribal over this dam now.

A police officer begging for anonymity said there is bound to be elaborate security cover for workers, officials engaged in the repair or renovation of this dam as hurdles are bound to come from the people who are to face submergence and displacement.

Sources said there has been an episode where irate people had detained three personnel of the executing agency of the construction company drafted for this dam last year.

Another tribal organisation Adivasi Senegal Andolan’s head Victor Kerketta told this newspaper that the Government must first do concrete things for resettlement of people of those villages who are going to be displaced before doing anything for the dam.

Kerketta further said the government officials must sit with villagers, hear them and solve their fears and doubts.

Kerketta and Tirkey both demanded that hundreds of tribal families who are living since decades on korkar and gair majrua land be given lagan receipts which only will legalize their right of possession of these two types of land.

Chatra BJP MP Sunil Singh is sanguine that people will realize the benefits of this dam on its operation.PM has set a deadline of 2020 for this dam to be all operational.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mandal-dam--tribal-bodies-keep-their-fingers-crossed.html

73,06-1-20,Delhi zoo to get virtual reality technology soon,"Aiming to be among the top-10 zoos in the world, the National Zoological Park in Delhi has planned to introduce virtual reality technology allowing visitors to ""get closer"" to animals and a GPS-based mobile application to make zoo visits more engaging and informative.

Virtual reality headsets will allow visitors to see the animals up-close. People will find themselves standing next to a tiger, hugging a deer or caressing an elephant, Delhi Zoo Director Suneesh Buxy said.

""They will be able to see a lion hunting and playing in front of them and not just sitting under a tree.""

Top zoos around the world have turned to technology to make visitors' experience better. The government also wants the Delhi zoo to be among the top 10 across the world. Virtual reality and a mobile application are steps in that direction, he said.

Range Officer Saurabh Vashishtha said, ""The technology will change people's perspective. It will allow visitors to interact with animals without disturbing them. It will be an exhilarating adventure.""

With the GPS-based mobile application and Bluetooth beacons, visits to the zoo will become more engaging and educative. At present, boards placed outside every enclosure carry only limited information in the form of text and pictures. The mobile application will engage visitors with text, pictures, audio and video content about the inhabitants of the zoo.

""Visitors spend a large part of their time in the zoo locating the animals, finding the right direction etcetera. Many a time, they go back with not-so-good experience. The mobile application will set it right.

""Download the application and put on your headphones, it will be that simple. Using beacon technology, the app will tell visitors what's on their left, right, and ahead. On reaching the enclosure, it will provide all information related to the animal — its habitat, food, behaviour and others,"" Buxy said.

The ideas have been discussed and tenders will be floated within the next three months, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-zoo-to-get-virtual-reality-technology-soon.html
74,06-1-20,C’garh govt begins survey to internally displaced tribals,"Seven months after the union ministry of tribal affairs decided to rehabilitate the people who were internally displaced due to Maoist violence 15 years ago, the Chhattisgarh government has initiated the process for their identification.

Around 16,000 tribals (5,000 families) were uprooted from Chhattisgarh during 2004-05 when Naxal violence escalated in the state. Around 3,000 families moved to over 150 villages in the forests of the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Once identified and verified, the tribals will be eligible for their return and rehabilitation in the state under Forest Right Act (FRA) 2006.

FRA grants land rights to all indigenous people who worked on their land till December 12, 2005.

The union ministry of tribal affairs has also decided to rehabilitate the internally displaced tribals at alternative land to their original habitation, under an ain situ' provision under clause 3.1.m of the FRA.

In July last year, the National Commission for Schedule Tribes (NCST) held a meeting of the official representatives of all the Naxal-hit states -- Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Odisha. Since Chhattisgarh is the most affected state by Maoist violence, the NCST asked the state government to complete its survey of internally displaced people in three months and submit its report.

However the Bhupesh Bhagel government is yet to conduct a survey or submit its report. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs, according to official sources, sent several reminders, the latest on December 20, asking it to immediately submit a report on the status of the survey.

Finally, in a letter sent on December 27, Chief Minister Bhupesh Bhagel's office has asked the Telangana government headed by KC Rao to help it with the survey of its displaced tribals living in the state.

""We came to know that most displaced people have moved to Telangana. So we have sent a letter only to the Telangana government as of now,"" DD Kunjam, joint secretary of SC & ST development department in Raipur told IANS.

Kunjam said that the government had also directed the district revenue officials to conduct survey in Chhattisgarh.

The government, he said, is yet to figure out how to implement ain situ rehabilitation' under FRA. ""There are other technical issues as well but all of them will have to be addressed once we have the survey. We have begun the process and we will be conveying it to the Central government too,"" he said.

The NSCT and the union ministry of tribal affairs had ordered the survey of the internally displaced people following an application filed by CGNet Swara Foundation, an NGO based in Raipur, headed by Shubhranshu Choudhary.

""The government has been thoughtful about the refugees who have come from the neighbouring countries. But we have refugees within the country and they are living in deplorable conditions. The government must expedite the process to rehabilitate the internally displaced people of Chhattisgarh,"" he told IANS.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/c---garh-govt-begins-survey-to-internally-displaced-tribals.html
75,06-1-20,Rajnath: People shouldn’t have misconception about CAA,"Hitting out at opposition for spreading lies about Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that people should not have any misconception about the amended citizenship law because Indian culture believes in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and does not segregate people on the basis of caste, creed and colour.

Singh was in his parliamentary constituency Lucknow for a day on Sunday to dispel misgivings about the CAA and the NRC as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party campaign to clear doubts about them.

“The people are being mis-led by the opposition parties for their political gains. The BJP has decided to give a message to the people that they should not have any misconception about the CAA. The Indian culture teaches us about Sarvdharma Sambhav and a Hindustani cannot discriminate on lines of caste and religion,” he said.

Singh visited the house of retired judge Khemkaran in Sarojini Nagar where the residents were given the booklet ‘Nagarikta (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 2019: ek parichay’, highlighting the main points of the CAA. The defence minister asked people and party workers to go through the booklet.

“This Act does not deal with taking citizenship of any person. Instead it will give citizenship to the minority who are being persecuted in neighbouring countries and are staying in India since 2014. The opposition has spread lies that this Act will be used to take away citizenship of members of a particular community,” Singh said.

He said that there were many occasions when the opposition leaders demanded citizenship rights for the minority being persecuted in neighbouring countries but now they were spreading lies.

“The message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam had gone from India to the entire world. Our party believes in this ethos and cannot violate the Indian cultural values,” he said.

Singh clarified that the NRC was being implemented in Assam and the exercise was carried out on the directives of the Supreme Court.

“We are just following the directives of the Supreme Court. There is no government order in this regard. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified that the government has so far no plans to implement NRC across India,” Singh said.

Rajnath Singh’s visit to Lucknow comes days after widespread violence during protests against the amended citizenship law left 19 persons dead in UP.

Singh also met doctors at Sun Eye Hospital. He told people there that they should not get swayed by the lies being spread by some TV channels.

During this campaign, state minister Swati Singh, Mayor Samyukta Bhatia and leaders of BJP city unit accompanied Rajnath Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rajnath--people-shouldn---t-have-misconception-about-caa.html

77,06-1-20,Akhilesh announces Rs 5 lakh aid for kin of killed protesters,"Samajwadi Party has announced Rs 5 lakh compensation for the families of protesters who lost their lives in violence during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. It also demanded government job for one member of such families besides a compensation of Rs 25 lakh each to them.

The announcement was made by SP president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday after he met the family of Mohammed Wakil, who lost his life in anti-CAA protests in Lucknow on December 19. Wakil was hit by a bullet in his stomach.

“He (Wakil) was not involved in the agitation. The government should probe as to whose bullet hit him. They (police) have the post-mortem report now,” the SP chief said, adding that “all the deaths during the protests in the state were caused by police bullets”.

The UP Police initially claimed that none of the deaths was caused by police firing, but subsequently admitted some casualties in police bullets when cops fired in “self defence”, he said.

Yadav said that Wakil was the sole bread winner of the family and demanded adequate compensation, a job for a family member, and a house for the family.

The SP chief said it was unfortunate that the Bharatiya Janata Party, which claims to be a party of all, was ignoring a particular community.

Demanding a probe into the violence and killing of people during the anti-CAA protests, Yadav said that the government should give job and free house to the families of all protesters killed in the violence.

“A software engineer was killed in police firing in Lucknow and the state government had given a compensation of Rs 25 lakh, a house and a job to the family. The same should be given to Wakil’s family,” he said.

The SP chief also demanded a thorough probe into the killing of Mohd Wakil and punishment to the guilty.

Yadav gave Rs 1 lakh to the bereaved family from the Samajwadi Party fund. He said the SP would reach the families of all the anti-CAA protest victims and provide financial help.

A separate delegation of the party went to Meerut and other places to meet the families of those killed in violence during anti-CAA protest.

On Saturday, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had visited Muzaffarnagar and Meerut to meet the families of those affected by the anti-CAA protests.

Akhilesh Yadav also lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the alleged transfer-posting racket, saying that the allegations made by Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna were serious and if the Samajwadi Party came to power, it would see that all the corrupt officers were punished.

“Lakhs of rupees exchange hands in the transfer and posting of officers in UP. Corruption is rampant in the state. Officers from constable to the DIG level bribe their seniors for suitable posting. We are not saying this. A Senior Superintendent of Police (Vaibhav Krishna) has made these allegations. Now think how dangerous is the situation in UP,” Yadav said.

“Documents and reports are with the government. They will be there when we return to power unless the government destroys them. Then we will see. We will not spare even a single corrupt officer,” Yadav added.

He also said that the government may forget about the whole issue and try to delay action, but the people of the state would not forgive them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-announces-rs-5-lakh--aid-for-kin-of-killed-protesters.html

“In Uttar Pradesh, especially in Bijnor, Sambhal, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Firozabad and other districts, innocent people have been sent to jail for protesting against the CAA/NRC without an investigation. This issue has also been raised by the media and is very shameful and condemnable,” the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh said in a tweet.

Mayawati demanded immediate release of the innocent people and asked the state government to “provide justifiable financial assistance to the kin of those who have died during the protests”.

She also asked the Uttar Pradesh government to seek an apology from the public for putting anti-citizenship law protesters behind bars without thorough investigation.

Mayawati said that on Monday, her party would send a letter to UP Governor Anandiben Patel, seeking a judicial inquiry into the entire episode.

“A delegation will give the letter of our demands to the Governor at Raj Bhawan on January 6 at 11 am,” she said in another tweet.

As many as 1,246 people have been arrested in connection with the violence which erupted across the state during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the UP Police had disclosed on December 27.

82,06-1-20,"Sakhi Mandal supplies ration to 100 rural, 33 urban AWCs","The women of Sakhi Mandal in support of the livelihood mission are supplying nutritious take-home-ration to Anganwadi Centres in urban and rural areas. In the Ranchi district, the take-home-ration was distributed among 1800 beneficiaries across 33 urban Anganwadi Centres on January 4.

At Anganwadi Centres located in Hindpiri, Bariatu, Hotwar, Pandra, Raru, the supply work was carried out by women from Nagri, Angada and Namkum Sakhi Mandal as well as village organisation and cluster federation. The supply for the month of December has been completed in about 100 rural and 33 urban centres.

About 4665 Sakhi Mandals and village organisations have tagged around 38472 Anganwadi Centres across the State. This initiative of the government will not just provide an additional income to the rural women, but it will also ensure that children between 6 to 36 months, pregnant and lactating women and severely malnourished children benefit from the ration available at Anganwadi Centres.

Out of a total of 38472 Anganwadi Centres across the State, more than 37000 centres have been supplied with the take home ration for the month of November.

Surajmani Toppo who reached the Anganwadi Centre in Hindpiri to supply feels that the take home ration is not benefiting pregnant, lactating women and children but is also a new way of livelihood for rural women. “Initially when this work started, we believed that with this we will be able to fulfill our social responsibility towards our sisters and children who will now get proper and good quality food on time,” she said.

Toppo further added that right from purchasing the material to packing it, the organinsation has also earned some money.

Sangeeta Munda from Hatia Anganwadi Centre said that the beneficiaries used to question the quality of ready to eat food distributed earlier but the new system started last month is getting good response.

Amaritu Manjari who reached a centre with her two- year old child said, “We never liked the taste of oatmeal given earlier. But now rice, dals, potatoes and peanuts are not only nutritional but also suit our taste buds. We have faith in the ration packed by the women of Sakhi Mandal. The quantity and quality of food packed is also of high standard,”

Badunisha Begum from Hindpiri also praised the nutritious diet provided. “We are very happy with the nutritious food being given by Sakhi Mandal. Since the women have started distributing the ration, we have been getting it regularly every month. Since our sisters are distributing the nutritious food, there is no question about the lack of quantity or quality.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sakhi-mandal-supplies-ration-to-100-rural--33-urban-awcs.html

88,06-1-20,Delhi lacks fire in belly to douse it,"National Capital was kept on its toes as devastating fire incidents kept on taking place unabated in the year just gone by. The New Year 2020 too started on an ominous note as a blaze in a battery and inverter manufacturing unit in Nangloi, consumed the life of a young fireman Amit Balyan. 2019 witnessed over a dozen infernos which claimed scores of precious human lives. The most deadly was the fire in Anaj Mandi in the Walled City area that took away 43 poor labourers. Every time political leadership and the bureaucracy have been found wanting as corrective measures that were promised to prevent such tragedies from happening, remained only on papers. Even if some measure were put in action but that was not enough to make Delhi a safe city for the poor dwellers. The Pioneer looks back on fire incidents that were reported in 2019 and also delve into the factors that were responsible for deaths caused by fire.

Several unauthorised colonies across the city, availability of cheap labour and use of residential buildings for commercial purposes are few of the many factors which lure owners to establish illegal factories. The year 2019, saw five major fire tragedies claiming 81 lives in national Capital. Irony is that the fire incidents which occurred in illegal manufacturing units and hotel located at Karol Bagh, Zakir Nagar, Sudarshan Park and Anaj Mandi in National Capital did not have any 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) issued from Delhi Fire Services (DFS) department.

Just after the tragedies, the favourite pastime of passing the bucks begins; DFS blames civic authorities while civic authorities blame Delhi government. But the core of the issue remains the same, the illegal factories in residential complex and hotels without 'NOC' and safety equipments continues to run abated, risking lives of several innocent people working and living there. These tragedies are grim reminder that civic agencies don't learn lessons from past tragedies as they wait for another to happen.

On December 23, 2019, a massive fire ripped through a three-storey residential-cum-commercial building in outer Delhi's Kirari area, killing at least nine people, including three children.

On December 8, 2019, a massive fire ripped through a factory in Anaj Mandi area of north Delhi, leaving 43 labourers dead and many others injured. The fire broke out in the second floor of the four-storey building in the early hours and 30 fire tenders were pressed into service.

On August 6, 2019, five people were killed and 11 injured in a massive fire at Zakir Nagar area, in Delhi. According to the fire department, information regarding the incident was received at around 2.30 am, following which eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The fire occurred in a four-storey residential building due to short circuit in electric metres, which was doused by 5.25 AM.

On February 12, 2019, a massive fire swept through a four-floor hotel in central Delhi's Karol Bagh, killing at least 17 guests, including a child and two people who jumped off the building in a desperate bid to save themselves. The blaze, in which 35 people were injured, started in the second floor of the Arpit Palace Hotel in the heart of the national capital around 3.30 AM, trapping many guests who were deep in sleep.

On January 5, 2019 seven people died after a ceiling fan parts manufacturing unit running illegally in a two-storey building in Delhi's Moti Nagar area collapsed following an explosion in the gas compressor.

And these are not one-off incident as many areas where illegal factories operating in residential areas across the national Capital are ticking bombs and inviting incidents. These lives could have been saved had the Delhi Municipal Corporation authorities and other agencies acted timely, learning from the unfortunate Uphaar fire tragedy, which claimed 59 lives on June 13, 1997.

Sources in the civic bodies disclosed that these industries are illegal not only because they run from unauthorised areas, but also because they do not have the licence to operate. ""It is totally up to the enforcement agencies to keep track of the polluting factories operating from residential areas,"" a source declared.

According to sources, there are more than 45,000 illegal manufacturing units operating in Moti Nagar, Kirti Nagar, Ramesh Nagar, Jangpura, Najafgarh and Mansarovar Garden, all in west Delhi, Bhogal, Ashram, Mahipalpur, Maharani Bagh and Jangpura in south Delhi, Gandhi Nagar, Jheel, Shastri Nagar, Kailash Nagar, Jafrabad and Shahdara in east Delhi; and Sadar Bazaar, Chandni Chowk, Malkaganj, Ballimaran, Lal Kuan and Kashmere Gate in north Delhi.

Other areas includes Karol Bagh, Patel Nagar, Anand Parbat, Rohtak Road, Rajinder Nagar, Old Rajinder Nagar in central Delhi, Shahdara, GT Road, Babarpur and Vishwas Nagar in northeast Delhi, and Burari and Jagatpuri in northwest Delhi.

According to Atul Garg, the Chief Fire Officer, DFS, the fire department had issued only 2372 'No Objection Certificates' issued till date for hotels and industrial purpose.

However, a senior Municipal Corporation official said that they have been carrying out sealing action against such units as per instructions of the Supreme Court, adding that many units were either found closed or vacant after a notice to that effect had been served.

But is this a reality, as claimed by Municipal Corporation. The Pioneer the visited Sudrahsan Park in West Delhi's Moti Nagar area where seven people died after a gas compressor blast and people there blamed civic authorities for the havoc in the area.

Harish Saini a resident of Sudarshan Park area told The Pioneer that this is not the only illegal unit in the area. Basai Dara Pur — cramped, dirty and jumbled — at Sudarshan Park area in Moti Nagar has several small illegal factory in two or four-stroyed houses running just stone's throw away distance from zonal office of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).

""We don't have any other option other than to work here. At least we are able to get one square meal for our family,"" said Ajit Kumar, who hails from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and is working at Sudarshan Park in a shoe factory.

Farhan, a worker, told The Pioneer he had been working in a denim factory in the Bawana area for last five years. ""I work and earn Rs 4,000 per month. This incident is shocking for us and I agree there is no provision for us to escape if there is some tragedy or a fire incident but for living we have work,"" he said.

Venting his anger over promises by local leaders for developing facilities and better working conditions for them, Rajendra, who works in a factory situated at a narrow and congested lane of Jangpura said that leaders talk about development but the ground reality is just the opposite.

""We have a family to run. Children to teach and a house rent to pay so why would I not work, knowing that there is risk to my life. Leaders come and shed tears, announce compensations but nothing happens on the ground. So what if seven lives were lost, people will forget it after sometime and things will be back to square one,"" Rajendra said.

The DFS in year 2019 recorded more than 22,840 incidents of fire in which there were deaths and injuries in over 2,372 incidents. The total incidents of fire in 2019 may be less compared to the previous year, but the number of casualties has increased in the city. Further 65-75 per cent of incidents of fire occur in buildings that house both residential and commercial units.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-lacks-fire-in-belly-to-douse-it.html

The Chairman of the Manifesto Committee moved a resolution in the first meeting of the Manifesto Committee that was adopted unanimously by the party on Sunday.

Addressing the media, Delhi Congress President Subhash Chopra hit out at BJP- ruled centre, saying that it has raised such issues just before the Delhi Assembly election to divert people's attention from pressing issues like economic distress, price rise and unemployment.

Chopra also demanded the Delhi Government to call a special session of the Delhi Assembly to clear its stand on CAA and the police attack on students of the Jamia Millia University for protesting against the act.

Highlighting the differences between NPR of 2010 and the NPR of 2020, Maken said that the Modi Government has added six new illegal clauses now. ""The BJP Government has added six new questions to the NPR that is violation of Article 14 in the Constitution,"" he said.

90,06-1-20,‘Poonachi: The Story of a Black Goat’ is a commentary on our times,"Perumal Murugan the writer is dead. As he is not god, he is not going to resurrect himself. He also has no faith in rebirth. An ordinary teacher, he will live as P. Murugan. Leave him alone"".

The Tamil writer Perumal Murugan thus posted on his Facebook wall immediately after he was forced by religious bigots to sign an 'unconditional apology' for certain passages in his novel 'One Part Woman' (2010) and an undertaking to withdraw unsold copies of the book. The writer's 'death-note' touched many a raw nerves among the intelligentsia and upset a large number of right-thinking people.

The 'dead writer' resurrected himself though, after the Madras High Court ruled, in a series of litigation and suits concerning the novel, that his written undertaking didn't obligate him to apologise for his writing or to withdraw copies of the book. Following this judgement, Murugan returned to his literary career and Poonachi became the first novel after his self-exile had ended. The book was shortlisted for the 2018 JCB Prize for Literature.

The book is a coming-of-age fable of a goat named Poonachi. Just a day old, the little kid is gifted to an old villager by a mysterious man. The villager's wife happily adopts the little one. The old couple does everything to keep the young and undernourished doe alive. Under their constant vigil, it manages to survive an encounter with a wildcat, an eagle, and getting lost in the jungle.

Poonachi slowly grows into a strong animal. The book captures most vividly all her dreams, her failures, and her struggles to survive in a goat world that is squarely male-dominated. The goat's predicament at times looks like that of our own women.

N. Kalyan Raman, the book's translator, notes that the reader might as well find Poonachi to be an intensely political novel like George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' (1945). To me, however, the political side of the novel appears more akin to Orwell's 1949 dystopian classic 'Nineteen Eighty Four'. The regime envisioned by Murugan, for example, has prescribed stringent procedures for registration of all new-born, humans as well as pet animals, by getting their ears pierced. The eerie scenes at the government ear-piercing office would starkly remind the reader of Orwell's super-state that was controlled by Thought Police intending to persecute individuality and independent thinking.

Sample this chatter among citizens standing in endless queues for getting ears of their wards pierced:

'Speak softly, sir. The regime has ears on all sides'.

'There's an old saying that the regime is deaf'.

'It's deaf only when we speak about our problems. When we talk about the regime, its ears are quite sharp'.

Every citizen under the regime was ""well versed in how they were expected to behave towards the regime. They had mouths only to keep shut, hands only to make obeisance, knees only to bend and kneel, backs only to bend, and bodies only to shrink before the authorities"".

Perumal Murugan has done a tremendous job here of creating a narrative that takes a feeble goat through a range of urges and emotions which are strikingly similar to our own desires and longings.

The way Poonachi scuttles the sexual advances of the loutish male goat Kaduvayan, or develops a great liking for Poovan, the genteel buck, are all less animalistic and far more human. N. Kalyan Raman rightly says: 'As we track the destiny of Poonachi, the orphan goat, we realise that the author's real theme is our own fears and longings, primordial urges and survival tactics. Murugan makes us reflect on our own responses to hegemony and enslavement, selflessness and appetite, resistance and resignation, living and dying'.

Poonachi isn't merely the author's exploration of the life journey of a goat, it's a commentary of our times, of the unequal hierarchies of class and colour, of power and abuse, of government apathy and overreach, and of the increasing vulnerability of individuals to an all-powerful State. The book is worth a read.

91,06-1-20,"Centre, State need competition, coordination for smooth service delivery","Emphasising the need of Centre-State coordination to smoothen the effective delivery of Government services and schemes to the people, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that there should be competition as well as coordination between the Governments.

Speaking at his sixth town hall meeting at the Delhi Technological University Campus on Sunday, he said that if we are providing free electricity to the people of Delhi, the Central Government as well as other State Governments should competitively implement such a path-breaking scheme in the entire country and if Haryana or Maharashtra Government implements a scheme to immensely benefit the people, the same should be adopted and implemented in Delhi as per the requirement.

""To reduce pollution in Delhi, Centre and State Governments should collaborate. I wish to acknowledge that the union Government constructed the East-West peripheral way that removed the entry of 30-40 thousand trucks per day in Delhi and significantly reduced pollution in Delhi,"" he added.

While presenting the achievements of his government in the last five years, he reiterated that Delhi's Healthcare schemes are better than Centre's Ayushman Bharat Scheme. ""We amazingly transformed the public healthcare system in Delhi. Earlier people had to spend their entire savings and sell their properties to save their lives in case of any kind of serious illness,"" he said, adding that the healthcare infrastructure in Delhi's Government hospitals has been significantly improved.

""People can avail of treatment, surgery and various tests free of cost. Delhi Government gives support up to Rs 15 Lakh to get treatment for severe illness at private hospitals in Delhi"", he added.

Outlining the achievements of his Governmnet in last five years, he said ""our Government launched a new scheme 'Farishte Dilli Ke' to help the accident victims in Delhi. ""The Delhi Government invites the people of Delhi to be a Farishte in the lives of the accident victims. Nearly 1000 lives have been saved due to this scheme"", he added.

Delhi is the only city in India that provides 24X7 power supply and free or highly subsidized electricity to every household, he said. ""When we formed our Government in 2015, only 58 per cent of Delhi had water pipelines installed, and now around 93 per cent of Delhi has water pipelines installed. Within a year, the remaining seven per cent of households will have piped water connections. We aim to provide 24 hours clean water to every household in Delhi"", he said.

Kejriwal further said that the annual budget of the Delhi government has doubled from Rs 30,000 Cr in 2015 to Rs 60,000 Cr in 2019. It is because of the increased trust of the taxpayers as they realised that this honest Government will utilize the tax money for developing infrastructure facilities for its people as we did in the education and health sectors.

92,06-1-20,‘Govt paid homage to Mahatma through CAA’,"Union Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Mahendra Nath Pandey on Sunday said that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed by both the houses of the Parliament and has taken constitutional shape following the due procedure. Addressing a workshop at the State headquarters of BJP in Ranchi, he said that the Modi government has paid homage to the revered Mahatma Gandhi by granting citizenship to millions of refugees.

“Pujya Bapu had asked to keep the doors of India open for the refugees suffering due to religious persecution. Many big leaders of the Congress and the governments of the past had expressed their opinion in favour of the CAA in the past,” said Pandey, adding that the Congress Party was now speaking the language of appeasement in desperation.

The former State President of BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit lauded the Modi Government for its success in resolving complex issues like Article 370, 35A, triple talaq and Ram temple dispute. “The opposition is nervous. Today the public acceptance of the Modi government has increased. The public stands with the decision of the Modi government as these decisions strengthen the country. The opposition is again trying to give it a communal colour as it is their old habits, but the people of the country know it well by now,” he said.

He said that Parliament has not been formed to hang on to problems or complicate them, but to solve burning issues of the country.

“The Indian Parliament has made the law in accordance with the sentiments of people who become refugees tosave their dignity, cultureand religion. Many families have left property worth millions and have taken refuge in India only for safety of the women in their family,” he added.

Pandey said that the BJP is starting a public relations campaign across the country on Sunday to combat the corrupt politics of the opposition parties. Several party workers will take a public response campaign and give a befitting reply to the propaganda of the opposition and will make the public aware of the reality, Pandey added.

After the workshop, Pandey launched a public contact campaign in various houses in Harmu and Argora in the state.

BJP State General Secretary Deepak Prakash said that the party will organize a divisional level mega rally in Ranchi, Palamu, Dhanbad, Dumka and Jamshedpur from January 15 to 20 in which national leaders will also participate.

A public conference will be held in all 26 organizational districts of the state from 10 to 15 January, he said, adding that the BJP will also organize Nukkad Nataks and skits to spread awareness about the CAA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---govt-paid-homage-to-mahatma-through-caa---.html

Hans also expressed grief over the killing of a Sikh youth in Peshawar.

""There should not be double standards in the words and deeds of the Pakistan government. As a singer and artiste, I just want to remind Imran Khan he had termed Nankana sahib as 'Makkah' of Sikh community and that he should stick to the same spirit of respect to other religion,"" said Hans.

In September, Khan had termed Kartarpur ""Madina"" and Nankana Sahib ""Makkah"" of the Sikh community and promised to facilitate pilgrims of the faith, according to media reports.

""The incidents of attack on Nankana Sahib and violence against Sikhs are against the tenets of Guru Nanak Dev who spread the message of humanity. I just want to appeal to Khan to ensure that Sikhs and other minorities in his country have a safe and peaceful life,"" Hans said.

94,06-1-20,JMM makes inroads into non-traditional seats in State,"First time in the history of the State, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) led alliance won the State Assembly elections and formed Government in Jharkhand; the party won several new seats for the first time in recently concluded State Assembly elections which helped the party form its Government in the State.

Santhal Pargana and Kolhan divisions were considered stronghold of the party. In these areas JMM is performing well since long, but in this State Assembly election, the party has managed to make inroads in those areas also where it had not been able to get a single seat. In the Palamu region of the State, the party won two seats and in Hazaribagh region also the party performed very well. It also got better result in Ranchi region – a BJP stronghold since decades.

In Palamu region JMM won first time from Garhwa and Latehar constituencies in this election. Party candidate Mithilesh Kumar Thakur won from Garhwa and Baidyanath Ram won from Latehar respectively. Ram had won the seat on BJP ticket in 2009, just some days before the election he joined JMM. In Hazaribagh region the party also has managed to win two seats. First time former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee Chief, Sarfaraj Ahmad won from Gandey constituency and the party candidate Sudivya Kumar Sonu won from Giridih Assembly constituency. Only one MLA of the party in the region from Mandu seat, Jaiprakashbhai Patel won in 2014, but he contested on the BJP ticket this time and won.

Similar results were seen in Ranchi region as sitting MLA from Tamar Vikas Kumar Munda won on JMM ticket and Sisai Assembly seat was won by JMM candidate Jigga Sisoran Horo. Vikas Munda won the seat in 2014 on AJSU Party ticket and when AJSU Party expelled him from the party he formally joined JMM on September 19 when it organized its mega ‘Badlao Rally’ in the State Capital. However, the party got defeat from Silli Constituency as the party MLA Seema Mahto lost the seat to AJSU Party Chief Sudesh Kumar Mahto.

Speaking on the issue, JMM General Secretary, Supriyo Bhattacharya said that the party has worked hard in Palamu region and the State Government’s misrule helped the party to perform better this year as the party never performed so well in the regions. In this election the people of entire State voted to JMM candidate as the party contested the election with well planned strategy, he added.

“Tireless work done by the party leader, Hemant Soren, other leaders and workers has ensured the victory of the party in this election. We chalked out special strategy for non –tribal areas like Palamu and Hazaribagh and implemented it successfully. We focused on the seats where we lost by a thin margin and this time we changed some strategies to get desired results,” said Bhattacharya.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jmm-makes-inroads-into-non-traditional-seats-in-state.html

""The violence on JNU campus is worrisome and unfortunate. I condemn it. I appeal students to maintain the dignity of university and peace on campus,"" Nishank tweeted.

Asserting that acts of violence and anarchy will not be tolerated, the ministry said a group of “masked” people had entered the campus and attacked students.

""We have sought an immediate report from JNU vice chancellor on the violence on campus. We have also spoken to JNU VC and Delhi police to ensure peace is maintained on campus,"" an HRD Ministry official told PTI.

Addressing the media, Nishank termed the CAA as a historic development. He clarified that the Act is about granting citizenship to the religiously persecuted minorities from India’s three neighbouring Islamic nations and not about taking away citizenship.

He said, “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Central Government has been doing works which have been pending for about 70 years. The CAA was needed for a long time and was enacted in the nation’s interests. This Act would not be needed if India had not been partitioned on the basis of religion,” he said.

He said that the Act was brought in to ensure citizenship and respectable life for the persecuted minorities who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

There is no reason for any Indian citizen to feel afraid due to this. Some political parties and persons are opposing the CAA for political and other ulterior gains. These are the type of people who were earlier responsible for the partition of India. Using this Act as an excuse, they are trying to spread anarchy and hatred. Stating that some people are making educational institutions a hub of politics to achieve their own dubious aims, Nishank stressed that the government will not allow educational institutions to be politicised. He appealed to the students to focus their energies on works in the interests of the nation. The Government is focusing on developing educational institutions to secure place in international rankings, he added.

Meanwhile, in Haridwar, the BJP vice president Avinash Rai Khanna spoke of the party’s plans to reach out to citizens across the nation with correct information about the CAA.

In Uttarakhand, the party workers will go to each booth and informing the citizens about the facts related to CAA, garner support for Act. Citizens can also extend their support for the Act by giving a missed call on the toll free number issued by the party, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-continues-drive-to-inform-citizens-about-caa.html
97,06-1-20,Patriotism is better than Govt’s idolatry : Gandhi,"“I am proud that my grandfather had met Mahatma Gandhiji and had conversation with him on the current scenario of the time”, says Nitin Trivedi who runs a printing press in Pola Ground locality, Chhindwara. His father Devendra Govind Ram Trivedi started it.

Nitin Trivedi heard a lot from his father how his grandfather Govind Ram Trivedi, a leading lawyer, joined Congress on the call of Mahatma Gandhi. He cheerfully shares what he heard from his father about how Govind Ram Trivedi purchased a silver plate from Gandhiji offering Rs 501. Gandhiji came to Chhindwara second time in 1933. He was raising funds and collecting donations in support of the freedom movement. He auctioned the silver plate. The auction price was the lowest Rs 11, but Govind Ram Trivedi offered Rs 501 for the noble task.

Inspired by Gandhij, Govindram Trivedi joined Congress. Nitin Trivedi proudly shows a wooden swing on which Gandhiji sat and his grandfather had a few dialogues on the current political scenario. Nitin feels proud of his grandfather and continues to cherish the legacy.

Gandhiji reached Chhindwara in the afternoon of 6th January 1921 after attending the Nagpur Session of the Congress, which passed a resolution to continue non cooperation movement against the British rule. He was accompanied by the great revolutionary Ali Brothers. The Chhindwara Speech still remains fresh and vivacious.

Today is 99th anniversary of Gandhiji’s Chhindwara Speech. The Nagpur session passed a resolution that Gandhiji and other prominent leaders of the

Congress would go to the masses appealing to them not to cooperate with the British Government. The non-cooperation movement remains the most significant part of freedom struggle. Though, it took a violent shape, which was against the philosophy of non– violence but it infused confidence into the masses that they could get freedom very soon.

The movement witnessed participation of every section of the society responding to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, who was the architect of the movement. In such a tumutous scenario, Gandhiji’s Chhindwara speech on January 6, 1921 remains the most significant. Gandhiji elaborated the objectives of non-cooperation movement among the masses. It received tremendous public response.

Gandhiji’s Chhindwara Speech has three major highlights, which have universal appeal. They were- Patriotism is far superior, Hindu Muslim Unity and Liberation lies in Charkha – a symbol of self dependence.

The Chitnavisganj, which is known as Gandhi Ganj was chosen as the venue of public meeting according to historic documents available. Around 10,000 people attended the public meeting. Gandhiji’s Chhindwara speech gives a glimpse of the greatness of Gandhiji, his clarity of vision and universal appeal.

Gandhiji explained the duty of the people towards complete Swaraj. He made an appeal to surrender government services and titles and stop going to government schools and colleges. In the same speech Gandhiji appealed to the lawyers to stay away from practices and give more time to the freedom struggle.

The most remarkable part of the speech was Gandhiji’s statement that the Congress party would financially help the lawyers who could not have enough savings to sustain their families.

Gandhiji urged them not to waste time and energy in courts and devote fully to the immediate task of achieving freedom. He also appealed to the parents of students to stop sending them to Government schools and make alternative arrangements. He clearly asked students above 15 years of age not to go to Government schools and colleges.

An appeal was also made to the soldiers to be duteous towards the Nation and not the Rule. He said that patriotism is superior than idolatry of the Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/patriotism-is-better-than-govt---s-idolatry---gandhi.html

113,06-1-20,"Govt mulls leaner CAPFs; merger, rotation of troops on cards","The Government is working on an ambitious proposal to transform various paramilitary forces into leaner and compact fighting units by undertaking probable steps like merging and rotating older troops amongst them, informed officials said.

They said a special committee of senior Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) officers and Union Home Ministry brass has been constituted to deliberate on the issue and present a final report to the Ministry by the middle of this year.

One of the proposals that is being discussed by the committee of the Directors General (DsG) and Special Secretary (internal security) in the Ministry of Home Affairs is to merge some forces to make them leaner, fighting fit and task-oriented for a specific border guarding role or a specialised counter-terrorist task.

It is being discussed if the two border guarding forces, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), could be merged to create a uniform unit to guard the entire eastern land border along countries like China and Nepal, a senior official told PTI.

At present, their task is separate. While the ITBP guards the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the SSB mans the 1,751 km front with Nepal and another 699-km border with Bhutan.

A few discussions have taken place on the subject but merits have to be analysed before going ahead with the merger of these two forces as against the post Kargil war policy decision to have 'one force for one border', another official said.

Both the forces are just under one lakh personnel in strength and have their unique culture and regimentation. More discussions are in the offing and nothing has been finalised, officials said.

Another proposal in the discussion stage is the merging of country's largest paramilitary force CRPF with the counter-terror commandos force, NSG.

The two forces are very different from each other but the discussion is to possibly have a single command for the two forces, officials said.

While the CRPF is the lead force for maintenance of law and order, anti-Naxal operations and counter-insurgency, the NSG is the premier federal strike force for counter-terror and counter-hijack operations.

The sheer core competencies of these two forces can be blended to achieve the target of having a single force to combat terror and hijack incidents and Maoist and insurgency threats, they said.

However, the proposal is only at discussion stage at present and many other issues are to be analysed before it is accepted or rejected, the officials added.

Another proposal in the works is to have a physically fit profile for the over 3 lakh personnel strong CRPF in order to use it as the first instrument of strike in all theatres of the internal security domain.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who recently visited the CRPF headquarters here to review its operational preparedness, had asked the force to see if policy steps can be taken to keep its profile young and fit.

CRPF then constituted a six-member committee of officers to prepare a blueprint if a threshold cut-off age can be fixed after which its personnel can be shifted to ""relatively static duties"" within the organisation or such personnel can be given less hard duties.

The committee headed will also analyse if such personnel can be ""absorbed"" in other CAPFs like the SSB or the airports security force CISF to ensure better ""rest and recuperation"" for them.

All the CAPFs comprising the CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF and SSB apart from the National Security Guard (NSG) have been asked by the MHA to look for and induct modern technology and gadgetry to perform their duties either along the borders or in the hinterland, officials said. The home minister during his maiden visits to the head offices of a number of these forces has stressed on primarily two subjects: welfare of troops to keep them motivated for their task and using modern technology to ease their hard task without fail, they added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-mulls-leaner-capfs--merger--rotation-of-troops-on-cards.html

In 2016-17, a total of 195 out of 3,788 adopted children were returned while in 2017-18 a total of 153 out of a total of 3927 adopted children were returned by adoptive parents, the data showed.

In 2018-19, a total of 133 out of 4027 children were returned by adoptive parents, the data showed.

The CARA official said about half of the older children who are adopted are returned by parents due to ""adjustment issues"".

He stressed on the need to prepare children in childcare institutions so that they are able to adjust with their families.

""At child care institutions, children are groomed in a different way. They have to be prepared and counselled to stay and adjust with families,"" he said.

He further said that in many cases it is seen that children have developed a strong bonding with their caretaker at child care institutions due to which it becomes very difficult for them to leave them and move into a family.

The official said that families also need to be prepared for taking care of the children.

""Even the parents have to be counselled and prepared. The parents think that as soon as they bring a child they would put him in an age specific class and the child should start putting in effort due to which the child feels he was better off there at the CCI with his or her friends and he expresses a desire to come back to the institution,"" he said.

The official also stressed on the need to build social infrastructure at the ground level. ""Each state is supposed to have state social welfare board but these have become defunct in most of the states, if these infrastructures are energised and put in place then service can be delivered but that is yet to be made operational on ground,"" he said.

He said CARA, the nodal body of adoption, is conducting a study to look at ways to prevent it.

Among states, the highest number of children were returned in the last five years from Maharashtra at 273 followed by Madhya Pradesh at 92, Odisha at 88, and Karnataka at 60, the data showed.

Dr Nimish G Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, said this experience can be ""very traumatic"" for the adopted children.

""Children living at child care institutions already have a rough experience of rejection early in his or her life and this (returning back to CCIs or shelter homes) will only further add to it,"" he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/over-1-100-adopted-children-returned-to-child-care-institutions-in-last-5-years.html
115,06-1-20,Varma asks Nitish to reject ‘CAA-NPR-NRC',"JD(U) general secretary Pavan Varma on Sunday asked party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the “divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme”, saying this has “nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence”.

In an open letter to Kumar, Varma expressed his surprise at the “unilateral” announcement of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who is from the BJP, that the National Population Register exercise will be carried out in the state between May 15-28 despite Kumar's stand against the National Register of Citizens.

“...In consonance with your own publicly stated views, and long established secular vision, may I request you now to take a principled stand against the CAA-NPR-NRC scheme, and reject its nefarious agenda to divide India

and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence.

“A clear cut public statement by you to this effect would be a major step towards preserving and strengthening the idea of India to which, I know, you yourself are committed. The politics of principle cannot be sacrificed at the altar of short term political gain,” Varma said in the letter.

The JD(U) leader has been critical of his party's decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, and it has now become a law following its passage in both Houses.

Protests have occurred in different parts of the country against the law, which seeks to give citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who had arrived in India due to religious persecution by December 31, 2014.

JD(U) vice president Prashant Kishor has also spoken strongly against the CAA and said this, in combination with the NRC, can turn into a “lethal combo in the hands of the Government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion.”

In his letter, Varma said the CAA-NRC combine is a direct attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims, and to create social instability.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/varma-asks-nitish-to-reject----caa-npr-nrc-.html
116,06-1-20,Apologise for sending anti-CAA protesters to jail: Maya to UP Govt,"Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Sunday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to seek apology from the public for putting anti-citizenship law protesters behind bars without thorough investigation.

She dubbed it as “highly shameful and condemnable”.

“In Uttar Pradesh, especially in Bijnor, Sambhal, Meerut, Muzzafarnagar, Firozabad and other districts, innocent people have been sent to jail for protesting against the CAA/NRC without an investigation. This issue has also been raised by the media and is highly shameful and condemnable,” the BSP national president said in a tweet in Hindi.

Accusing the Yogi Adityanath led Government of jailing anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters without any proper investigation, she asked them to seek an apology from the public.

Her statement comes in the backdrop of a local court granting bail on Saturday to social activist Sadaf Jafar and former IPS officer SR Darapuri, besides 13 others arrested in connection with anti-CAA protests in Lucknow.

Mayawati also demanded financial assistance to those killed in the protests.

Officials maintain that 19 persons died in clashes during the widespread protests across the state in December, though opposition parties claim a higher toll.

117,06-1-20,Opp creating confusion on Act among Muslims out of malice: Yediyurappa,"Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday challenged Opposition leaders to prove that the Citizenship Amendment Act will have its ill-effects on the Muslim community, as he accused them ofattempting to create confusion out of “malice.”

“There will not be any ill-effects on our Muslim brothers of the country because of the Citizenship Amendment Act. During Jawarharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi's (former PMs from

Congress party) time also there was consensus on it,” Yediyurappa said.

He said out of malice an attempt is being made to create confusion among Muslim brethren and that is the reason the BJP had decided to conduct door-to-door campaignsin favour of the CAA.

The party has plans to reach out to three crore people across the country and 30 lakh houses in the state, he added.

Amid growing opposition and protests, the BJP on Friday had announced that it will be launching a mega door- to-door campaign in favour of CAA across the country on January 5.

Reiterating that the act will in no way affect Indian Muslims, Yediyurappa challenged opposition leaders to prove to the people of the country that the law will affect the community.

“We will also be visiting places where Muslim community resides in large numbers and try to create awareness among everyone. We don't have any difference towards Hindu, Muslim or Christian, we will inform facts to everyone, he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-creating-confusion-on-act-among-muslims-out--of-malice--yediyurappa.html
118,06-1-20,Deaths during anti-CAA protests in UP caused by police bullets: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday alleged that all deaths during anti-CAA protests in Uttar Pradesh were caused by police bullets and said the BJP's campaign in support of the Act was to “mislead” people.

Yadav, who visited the residence of Mohammad Wakil killed during an anti-CAA protest in the state capital, said, “He (Wakil) was not involved in the agitation. The Government should probe as to whose bullet hit him. They (police) have the post-mortem report now.”

“All the deaths during the agitation in the State were caused by police bullets,” he claimed.

Yadav also demanded compensation, house and job for Wakil's family, currently living in a rented accommodation.

He said families of all those killed during protests should be given adequate compensation.

The UP police initially claimed that none of the deaths was caused by police firing, but subsequently admitted some casualties in police bullets when cops fired in “self defence”.

Officials have put the death toll at 19 in widespread clashes in the state, though the opposition parties claimed a higher figure.

Yadav asked the Government that if it wanted to make someone from another country its citizen, then why has it not given this “right” to

Muslims.

“This is because you (BJP) want to divide the society and play politics. Every Indian is against CAA and NCR. When Aaadhaar has all information why NPR?” he posed.

“In a village, who has papers...From where will I bring date of birth paper of my mother. Government wants the people to only search for papers and not do daily chores,” he lamented.

He said his party will resort to “Satyagrah” by not filling the form.

Noting that people of all walks, castes and religions were coming out against CAA and NPR, Yadav said, “The BJP knows its decision is wrong and against the Constitution.”

Asked to comment on the BJP's campaign in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said it was to “mislead” people.

“The BJP is misleading the people. What will they tell the people now? They could not convince us in Parliament. Now, they have come out to mislead the people,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/deaths-during-anti-caa-protests-in-up-caused-by-police-bullets--akhilesh.html

The External Affairs Minister noted that the developments have taken a very serious turn.

""Just concluded a conversation with FM @JZarif of Iran. Noted that developments have taken a very serious turn. India remains deeply concerned about the levels of tension. We agreed to remain in touch,"" Jaishankar tweeted.

The conversation between the two leaders comes three days after Iran's top military commander Soleimani was killed in a US strike in Baghdad on Friday.

US President Donald Trump has warned Iran that the US has identified 52 possible targets in the country and will hit it harder than ever before if Tehran, which has vowed ""severe revenge"", carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of Soleimani.

Maj Gen Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Soleimani's killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US and is estimated to be more dangerous in recent past since he was an uniformed general unlike Al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden and ISIS' Abu Bakr al-Baghdaid, both of whom were known terrorists.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-deeply-concerned-about-us--iran--jaishankar.html
124,06-1-20,1.03 crore streetlights installed in five yrs,"Doing its bit to help mitigate climate change, India, in the last five years has installed over 1.03 crore smart environment-friendly light emitting diode (LED) streetlights till date, enabling an estimated energy savings of 6.97 billion kWh anually and an estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction of 4.80 million tCO2 annually.

Similarly, over 36.13 crore LED bulbs have been distributed across the country, resulting in estimated energy savings of 46.92 billion kWh per year, avoided peak demand of 9,394 MW, and an estimated GHG emission reduction of 38 million tCO2 annually, said a statement here on Sunday from the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of PSUs under the Union Power Ministry.

ESSL has been given the mandate to implement the LED Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP), the world's largest streetlight replacement programme and The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA), which is also the world's largest domestic lighting project.

""Energy efficiency is vital for India's efforts in mitigating climate change and achieving a sustainable future. These programmes exemplify the Government's vision for a New India, and the empowerment of every citizen, said Saurabh Kumar, Managing Director, ESSL about the progress of the two energy efficient schemes which completes five years on Sunday.The schemes were launched on January 5th 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In fact, accelerating adoption of Energy Efficiency (EE) technologies, and LED lighting in particular, have been identified as key elements in achieving the ambitious commitments under the recently concluded Paris Agreement on Climate Change and transitioning to a low carbon global economy.

Lighting accounts for nearly 6% of global CO2 emissions. A global switch to energy efficient light emitting diode (LED) technology could save over 1,400 million tons of CO2 and avoid the construction of 1,250 power stations, as per various global studies.

Saurabh Kumar said that UJALA project brought the market transformation in energy efficiency sector. Prices of LED bulbs being distributed under UJALA programme have fallen to one-tenth of their rates in 2015 from Rs 310 to Rs 38 in 2018.

The switch from inefficient incandescent bulbs to LEDs is helping families reduce their electricity bills while also enabling them to access better brightness in homes. With the average household electricity bills down by 15 per cent, the annual energy saving is equivalent to a week's average earning.

Now the ESSL is aiming to replace 1.34 crore conventional streetlights in India with smart LEDs under the SLNP by March 2020. This will enable peak demand reduction of about 1500 MW, annual energy savings of 9 billion kWh, and reduction in 6.2 Million tons of CO2 per year, said the official.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/1-03-crore-streetlights-installed-in-five-yrs.html

128,06-1-20,One decade of Omar Abdullah in politics,"On January 5, 2009 when Omar Abdullah had taken oath of office he not only became the youngest Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir but also remained focal point of media attention.

Close family friends, industry captains, bollywood celebrities and even political adversaries had converged in the newly opened Zorawar Singh Auditorium of Jammu university to witness historic oath taking ceremony.

Former Chief Minister and his father Dr Farooq Abdullah had even dedicated a famous song, “Papa Kahtain hain bada naam karega” to his dutiful son while wishing him all the luck for the most difficult job.

While occupying the 'hot seat' and running an alliance Government with the Congress party in the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, Omar Abdullah experienced many ups and down in his 'tumultuous' political career.

He faced first litmus test when under his watch the State witnessed prolonged cycle of violence between 2009 (in the aftermath of Shopian rape and murder case) and 2010. Over 100 protesters were killed in sporadic incidents of stone pelting and several hundred were put behind bars to restore normalcy on ground zero.

Security forces had to resort to use to 'pellet' guns for the first time to control the rampaging mob on the streets of Srinagar especially in volatile downtown areas.

During his term in office, Omar even attempted to scale down the foot prints of the Indian army and revoke Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from peaceful districts of the region but failed to assert his authority even while chairing meetings of the Unified command. Union government at the helm of affairs, kept him in the 'waiting' mode. After promising 'moon' to the people of the state Omar could not do much to buy back power projects from NHPC. As his innings came to an end his report card was dotted with dark spots and was not 'impressive'.

After completing his six year long term in office when Omar Abdullah went to the electorate to seek reelection he faced crushing defeat at the hustings in December 2014.

The National Conference tally declined from 28 seats it won in 2008 to 15 in 2014. The party not only lost sizeable chunk of seats but its total vote share also witnessed steep decline.

As President of the party and head of the alliance Government Omar failed to fulfil the promise of restoration autonomy which remained high point of NC’s election manifestos since Indra — Sheikh Accord.

Sitting in the Opposition, Omar competed with the arch rival, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and also flirted with the idea of promoting 'soft separatism' to woo electorate. With BJP acquiring centre stage in the national politics, Omar choose to continue his friendship and alliance with youth congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

He also lost a perception war when he locked horns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after propagating another lofty idea of reviving the posts of sadr-e-riyasat (president) and Prime Minister for Jammu & Kashmir.

A decade later, Omar Abdullah is struggling to spend time, all alone in his own company.Since August 5, 2019 he is under preventive political detention.

Barring close family members, no other visitors are allowed to meet him. Since August 5, only once a delegation of party leaders led by his close aide and provincial President, Jammu DS Rana called on him for about 30 minutes in the first week of October 2019. No other meeting with the party leaders fructified since then.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/one-decade-of-omar-abdullah-in-politics.html
129,06-1-20,India's aquanauts getting ready for sea bottom exploration,"If the observation made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech at the inaugural ceremony of the 107th Indian Science Congress at Bangalore last Friday is any indication, Chennai is set to emerge as the country’s hub for deep sea missions akin to its feats in Space explorations. While ISRO has started training astronauts for space faring, the country’s aquanauts are being trained for deep sea missions.

“We have to replicate the achievements made by the country’s scientists in Space exploration in ocean too. The seas remain unexplored and untapped for want of technology,” the Prime Minister had said at Bangalore on Friday.

Interestingly, Modi began his speech from where Dr K Sivan, chairman, Space Commission, left on New Year day by announcing about the country’s manned Space mission (Gaganyaan), Chandrayaan-3 and other inter –planetary explorations.

Even as Prime Minister Modi was delivering his speech at the ISC , a group of scientists and engineers in the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, an elite institution under the Ministry of Earth Sciences were busy in perfecting the nuances of Samudrayaan (the deep sea manned mission) for exploring and exploiting the hitherto unmeasured deep sea marine wealth.

“We hope to perfect the first ever manned mission to deep sea by 2022. The Samudrayaan has many constraints and hence the progress is slow though steady,” said Dr Atmanand, director , NIOT Chennai. For Dr Atmanand and his team of researchers, the bottom of the ocean is not a strange domain.

They have succeeded in sending unmanned mission to the depth of the Indian Ocean as early as 2009 as part of the Samudrayaan mission.

The NIOT scientists had conducted a successful but silent Samudrayaan on April 13, 2009 itself by planting the national tricolour on the seabed at a depth of 3000 meters using ROSUB-6000, a Remotely Operated Vehicle for deep sea exploration.

“It was a successful mission and we proved the capability of ROSUB in exploring ocean depths. The machine has the potential to go up to 6000 meters but we want to reach that depth in stages,” Dr G A Ramadass, chief scientist, had told The Pioneer while declaring the details of the mission.

Vice President M Venkiah Naidu while addressing the scientists of NIOT during its silver jubilee celebrations in

November last had referred to the importance attached by the Government of India to the operations carried out by the institute. “NIOT is working on almost all aspects of the six priority pillars of blue economy — Fisheries and Aquaculture; Renewable Ocean Energy; Seaports and Shipping; Offshore Hydrocarbons and Seabed Minerals; Marine Biotechnology, Research and Development and Tourism,” he had said. India’s top priority is to exploit offshore hydrocarbons and seabed minerals whoich would elevate the country to a super economic entity, a NIOT veteran had pointed out.

“While oceans already account for significant trade and commerce in the fields of shipping, offshore oil and gas, fishing, undersea cables, and tourism, the emerging industries such as aquaculture, marine biotechnology, ocean energy and sea-bed mining have the potential to create jobs and spur worldwide economic growth,” Naidu had said.

The brief given to NIOT is to mine and bring out the vast deposits of cobalt, nickel, manganese and copper present in the Central Indian Ocean Region in the form of polymetallic nodules at a depth of 6000 meters.

A Manned Submersible vehicle which can reach the 6000 meter depth is getting readied in the laboratories of NIOT at Chennai. Simultaneously, a mission is on to train the country’s aquanauts (the ocean equivalent of those known as astronauts). If everything proceeds as planned, the sea craft carrying three aquanauts will touch the ocean bed by 2022 and they will be back with the first consignment of polymetallic nodules.

Who knows, in another couple of years, India will emerge as an exporter of copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese etc.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-s-aquanauts-getting-ready-for-sea-bottom-exploration.html
130,06-1-20,Khamenei adviser says Iran response to US to be military: CNN,"The military adviser to Iran's supreme leader said the Islamic republic's response to a US strike that killed one of the country's top commanders will be military, CNN reported Sunday.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed ""severe revenge"" after a US drone strike Friday in Baghdad killed Qasem Soleimani, the powerful commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force foreign operations arm.

""The response for sure will be military and against military sites,"" Brigadier General Hossein Dehghan told CNN in Farsi, according to a translation by the US news network.

In a televised news conference on Sunday, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said ""Iran is not seeking a war but is ready for any situation"".

Mousavi said the final decision would be made by ""the system's leadership"".

It would try to ""devise a response in a way that would both make the enemy regret"" the assassination and ""not bring the Iranian nation to a war"".

In his interview with CNN, Dehghan said: ""It was America that has started the war. Therefore, they should accept appropriate reactions to their actions.""

Shah is also believed to have directed the police commissioner to take all possible steps to ensure peace at JNU.

Condemning the atrocious attack on the students she said, “We strongly condemn the brutality unleashed against students/teachers in JNU. No words enough to describe such heinous acts,” adding “a shame on our democracy.”

The Chief Minister immediately decided to send a “Trinamool delegation led by (former Railway Minister) Dinesh Trivedi with MPs Sajda Ahmed, Manas Bhunia, Vivek Gupta to show solidarity with the JNU students.”

Another senior TMC leader and Bengal Education Minister Partho Chatterjee condemning the attack said students movements did take place in Jadavpur University in Kolkata “but never were any criminals allowed to enter the campus like this. It is for the Government to explain such attacks.”

134,06-1-20,UP CM meets Muslims in Gorakhpur to clear doubts,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath met Muslim community members in Gorakhpur on Sunday to dispel doubts about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and said the move was in line with India's tradition of giving shelter to persecuted people.

Adityanath's deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya, who took part in a similar drive in Moradabad, hit out at the opposition parties, saying they were trying to misguide the public against the citizenship law to create unrest in the state.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday launched a 10-day nationwide campaign in support of the law.

In his home turf Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath walked down to the shop Haji Chaudhari Kaif-ul-Wara and handed him a booklet on the law which he said was meant to give citizenship to persecuted people.

“This is a booklet about CAA, read it and all doubts will be cleared. I thought of beginning the awareness campaign from here,” he told Kaif-ul-Wara.

Kaifulwara promised to create awareness about CAA and requested the Chief Minister to release people with no criminal background who were holding protests against the CAA and the proposed countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Gorakhpur on December 20, saying children make mistakes.

On his way to Kaif-ul-Wara's shop from the Gorakhnath temple, of which he is the head priest, Adityanath met many Muslim community members.

He explained to them that it was a law to give citizenship. “Those who did not have citizenship and are living in India, this law gives them citizenship,” he said.

“It is the tradition of India to give shelter to persecuted people and Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought CAA to give citizenship to such people,” Adityanath said.

He said it was not meant to take away anyone's citizenship, but the Congress, Samajwadi Party and its allies are “unfortunately” trying to mislead people by spreading confusion and violence.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/up-cm-meets-muslims-in-gorakhpur-to-clear-doubts.html
135,06-1-20,"BJP, TMC begin door-to-door campaign","In a counter-drive against anti-CAA campaign launched by the Opposition parties the Bengal unit of BJP has launched a massive door-to-door campaign to hammer home the utility of the Citizenship Amendment Act and drive away the alleged misgivings regarding the amended citizenship laws.

“Senior State leaders like BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha on Sunday went house to house to clear the air on CAA,” party sources said adding similar campaigns were also being carried out in districts of North and South Bengal.

“Contrary to the general perception fanned by the TMC, Congress and the Left that CAA is a mischievous device to victimize the Muslim population and the non-BJP population it is in fact a positive Act that will complete the work left undone by the post Independence Governments and their leaders,” a senior State BJP leader said adding “the people are now convinced that the TMC is falsely generating a fear psychosis among the masses.”

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said his party members were getting massive response from the citizens who want the Act to be thoroughly implemented in all parts of the State. “Our people have been visiting houses and the people are giving overwhelming response to the changed laws.

“In East and West Midnapore we have been particularly receiving good response from the people,” he said adding the “popular response in receiving the BJP cadres was so much that the TMC goons resorted to vandalism and using physical force to stop and scare our workers away. They attacked and vandalized our party offices. But we will not get intimidated by their strong arm tactic.”

The ruling Trinamool Congress too went about collecting signatures from people to register their complaints against the controversial laws. “Let the BJP go house to house, let them go room to room but they will not succeed misleading the people about the true nature of t he CAA which is in fact a poison sweet laced with poison being offered to the people,” said TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee.

“The people initially were carried away by their communal campaigns which gave them 18 seats in the parliamentary elections but the CAA has proved how dangerous the BJP is and what dangerous designs they really have,” said Bengal Minister Jyotipriya Mullick.

“Interpreting the massive turnout in Mamata Banerjee’s mass rallies against the CAA we can say that BJP will be wiped out in the coming elections,” the Minister said.

Meanwhile, the Left Front and the Congress which have jointly called a general strike against a host of issues including CAA-NRC have warned the Chief Minister against any bid to foil the bandh.

“If the Chief Minister is genuinely against the CAA and if her public rallies are not a public pretense then she will not use force to thwart the strike — which she has been doing for the past so many years to gag the working class people’s voices,” said CPI(M) Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakrabarty.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp--tmc-begin-door-to-door-campaign.html
136,06-1-20,People shouldn't have misconception about it: Rajnath,"Union Minister and senior BJP leader Rajnath Singh on Sunday said people should not have any misconception about the amended citizenship law.

On a day's visit to his Lok Sabha constituency, Singh visited the residence of Justice Khem Karan here to mobilise support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“Our party has decided to give a message to the people that they should not have any misconceptions about CAA. The Indian culture teaches us 'Sarvdharma Sambhav' and a Hindustani cannot discriminate on lines of caste and religion,” he said.

His visit comes days after widespread violence during protests against the law, which officials said left 19 persons dead.

The message of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family) had gone from India to the entire world, Singh said, adding “Indian cultural values cannot by violated by our party.”

The Defence Minister also circulated pamphlets on the CAA and requested the media and party workers to go through them.

Asked by mediapersons about the National Register of Citizens, he said the exercise was on in Assam on the directives of the Supreme Court and not on the Centre's initiative.

“NRC is going on only in Assam and work has been completed to some extent. It is going on there on SC directives. There is no order of government in this regard. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified it,” Singh said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/people-shouldn-t-have-misconception-about-it--rajnath.html
137,06-1-20,"BJP's pro-CAA campaign is laughable, says Gehlot","Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday ridiculed the BJP's door-to-door awareness campaign about the merits of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

If the controversial legislation — which offers citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh — had any merit, such a campaign would not have been necessary, he said, speaking to reporters here.

“There was a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered Rs Mann Ki Baat' (his monthly radio talk), and the entire country listened to him.

“And now for the CAA, party leaders and ministers are forced to go from door to door to convince people. It is a laughable situation,” the senior Congress leader said.

“Had the Act been good, they would not have been forced to go door-to-door,” he said.

In the BJP-ruled Assam, 19 lakh people were found to have no documentary proof of citizenship and 16 lakh of them were Hindu, Gehlot said, asking why the Government was not giving citizenship to them through the new law. “There are some 10,000 people in Rajasthan who need citizenship. The other day Union home minister Amit Shah was in Rajasthan to address a rally, but he did not even mention offering citizenship to them,” he said.

“It means they are not serious about their own law,” he said.

A country formed on the basis of religion does not remain stable, he said.

“Pakistan was founded on the basis of Islam. Why did Pakistan split into two countries during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's time? Because it was formed on the basis of religion, you have seen what it leads to,” he said.

Gehlot also alleged that the BJP's “hidden agenda” was to turn India into a “Hindu Rashtra”.

There were once secessionist tendencies in Tamil Nadu and Punjab, he said, adding “how many countries you want to make out of India?”

The Rajasthan CM also demanded that the government bring out a white paper on the state of economy.

“The economy has been crippled because of the Centre's policies. Former economic adviser Arvind Subramanian and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan have already expressed concerns about the economy,” he said.

“Most of the economic indicators are going down...But instead of focusing on it, the Centre is diverting attention to the Citizenship Act and National Register of Citizens,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-s-pro-caa-campaign-is-laughable--says-gehlot.html
138,06-1-20,"NCP gets Home, Cong Revenue, Sena Urban","In the much-delayed allocation of portfolios carried out by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) walked away with plum portfolios like Home, Finance, Co-operation, Water Resources, Rural Development and Housing, while the Congress managed to land only a couple of important Ministries like Revenue and Public Works Department (Excluding Public Undertakings).

The Shiv Sena, which is the principal ruling party in the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVS) Government, somewhat got a raw deal in the portfolio distribution exercise that look six-long days since Uddhav Thackeray expanded his Cabinet, as it got very few key portfolios like Urban Development, Public Works ( Public Undertakings), Agriculture and Industries.

While Uddhav Thackeray retained portfolios like General Administration, Information Technology, Law and Judiciary, Information and Public Relations, he assigned his Cabinet minister-son Aditya Thackeray the portfolios of Environment, Tourism and Protocol.

Shiv Sena’s number two man in the State Cabinet Eknath Shinde, whose name had been discussed in the state political circles as a chief ministerial candidate before Uddhav assumed the office, has been given the key Urban Development and Public Works Department (Public Undertakings) portfolios. Shiv Sena’s senior-most leader Subhash Desai has been handed Industries, Mining and Marathi Language portfolios.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who played a key role in cobbling the Sena-NCP-Congress front managed to corner a maximum of high-profile portfolios for his party, in the portfolio distribution that saw a lot of hard-bargaining among the three constituents in the MVA and lobbying among the ministers in the three parties.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who was initially tipped to be Home Minister, has instead personally chosen the Finance and Planning portfolios –the two Ministries that Sr Pawar’s confidant and State NCP president Jayant Patil held earlier.

In place of the Finance and Planning portfolios that he had held in the past and present nine consecutive State budgets in the previous Congress-NCP Government, Jayant Patil has been given Water Resources (Known popularly as Irrigation) and Command Area Development.

In what is being seen as a shrewd move, Sr Pawar has hand-picked his loyalist Minister Anil Deshmukh from Vidarbha. Deshmukh, who was a minister of state in the Shiv Sena-BJP Government in the nineties, later served as both as a Minister of State and Cabinet Minister in the Congress-NCP Government between 2001 and 2014.

Elected to the State Assembly from Katol constituency in Nagpur district, Deshmukh is understood to have been vested with the Home portfolio to deal with former Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, who is also from Nagpur and held the Home Ministry in the previous BJP-Shiv Sena Government.

The NCP’s other influential leaders like Dilip Walse-Patil, Jitendra Awhad and Hasan Mushrif have been given State Excise & Labour, Housing and Rural Development Ministries respectively. Sr Pawar’s another confidant Chhagan Bhujbal, who was in the past a deputy chief minister in the previous Congress-NCP Government, has been assigned relatively insignificant portfolios of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection.

Dhananjay Munde, estranged nephew of late BJP leader Gopinathrao Munde, has been given relatively low-key portfolio of social justice and special assistance, while low-profile Balasaheb Patil has been vested with co-operation and Marketing portfolios.

NCP’s national spokesperson Nawab Malik has been vested with Minority Development, Aukaf, Skill Development and Enterpreneurship portfolios.

The second-run NCP leaders like Rajesh Tope and Rajendras Shingne have been given portfolios like Public Health & Family Welfare and Food & Drug Administration respectively.

On the Congress front, senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who had resigned as the Chief Minister on November 9, 2010 following the expose of the Adarsh society scam, has returned to the State Cabinet after a gap of more than nine years. He has been vested with the Public Works Department (excluding Public Undertakings).

The Congress high command’s decision to vest Chavan with PWD portfolio has rubbed senior party leader from Vidarbha Nitin Raut, who initially held that portfolio, the wrong way. Raut has now been assigned relatively lesser significant portfolio of Energy.

Maharashtra Congress president and senior minister Balasaheb Thorat has been given the important Revenue portfolio, while late Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh’s son Amit Deshmukh has been vested with the portfolios of Medical Education and Cultural Affairs.

The Congress’ two women Cabinet Minister Yashomati Thakur qnd Varsha Gaikwad have been given Women & Child Development and School Education portfolios respectively.

Former leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Congress leader from Chandrapur in Vidarbha region Vijay Wadettiwar has been given OBC, Khar land development, Relief and Rehabilitation, while another senior Congress leader KC Padvi has been vested with Tribal development.

The other portfolio allocations made included: Shiv Sena: Dadaji D. Bhuse — Agriculture, Uday Samant — Higher & Technical Education, Sanjay D. Rathod — Forest, Disaster Management, R&R, Gulabrao Patil — Water Supply & Sanitation, Sandipanrao Bhumre – Employment Guarantee & Horticulture, Anil Parab — Transport & Parliamentary Affairs, Shankarrao Gadakh (KSK Part) — Soil & Water Conservation.

Congress: Sunil Kedar – Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development, Sports & Youth Welfare and Aslam R. Shaikh – Textiles, Fisheries and Ports Development.

Among the 10 Ministers of State (MoS) are: Shiv Sena’s Abdul Sattar Nabi who has been given Revenue & Rural Development, Shamburaj Desai — Home (Rural), Omprakash alias Bachu Kadu — Water Resources, Command Area Development, School Education, etc., and Rajendra Yadravkar (Independent MLA) — Public Health, FDA, etc.

NCP’s Dattatray Bharne has been made Minister of State for Public Works (excluding Public Undertakings), Forests, etc., while other ministers of state from the Sharad Pawar-led party are: Sanjay Bansode — Environment, Water Supply & Sanitation, etc., Prajakt Tanpure — Urban Development, Energy, etc., and Aditi S. Tatkare — Industries, Tourism, etc.

Congress’s Satej Patil has been made Minister of State for Home (Urban), while another Mminister of State Vishwajit P. Kadam has been vested with Agriculture, Cooperation, scial Justice and other portfolios.

It may be recalled that on November 28, Uddhav Thackeray had been sworn into office as the Chief Minister along with six Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVS) Ministers —Eknath Shinde, Subhash Desai (both from the Shiv Sena), Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal (both from the NCP), Balasaheb Thorat and Nitin Raut (both from the Congress).

On December 30, Uddhav carried out his first full-fledged expansion of his ministry by inducting Ajit Pawar as his Deputy Chief Minister, Aditya Thackeray as the Cabinet Minister and 34 new Ministers in his Cabinet.

Of the Ministers who were administered oath by the Governor on December 30, 25 were of the Cabinet rank, while the remaining 10 were Ministers of State.

With the induction of 36 new ministers, including the deputy chief minister, the number of ministers in the Uddhav Thackeray Cabinet had risen to 43, including that of the Chief Minister.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ncp-gets-home--cong-revenue--sena-urban.html

145,06-1-20,Developments in West Asia to steer Indian equity market,"With the US killing of the top Iran commander Qasem Soleimani tensions in the Middle East have reignited and any further development on this front would be the most importact factor for the Indian equity market, along with its global conterparts, in the coming week.

Iran has vowed to take ""tough"" revenge and global leaders have raised concerns over the the incident and its eventualities. US President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has warned Iran that he has identified 52 Iranian targets and will respond ""very fast and very hard"" to any reprisal from Tehran.

Oil and gold prices had already surged on Friday after reports surfaced of the General being killed in Iraq, and both the Sensex and Nifty50, along with global indices, tumbled during the day.

The same nervousness and concern is likely to follow in the coming week.

""Escalation between US and Iran, will add crude prices and geopolitical tensions impacting the performance in the short-term,"" said Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said: ""Markets could be volatile going ahead due to risk of possible retaliation from Iran.""

However, there are also some positive global and domestic factors which are likely to provide support to the market in the coming days, including the Trump's recent announcement to sign the first phase of the US-China trade deal.

In a major sign of improvement in the manufacturing segment, the IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in December from 51.2 in November.

Further, the gross GST collection in December 2019 announced last week, grew by 8.92 per cent year-on-year to 1.03 lakh crore, although remaining below the target of Rs 1.10 lakh crore set by the Government.

This growth in GST collection is also likely to boost market sentiments, analysts said, along with the Government's latest announcement of a Rs 102 lakh crore infrastructure pipeline.

""Few positive domestic data, like improvement in GST revenue and India factory production to 7-month high, has brought a broad-based rally,"" Nair said.

He added that the global market may also trade in the positive in anticipation of improvement in economy and uptick in steel prices post the announcement of US-China first phase deal to be signed on January 15.

Another major factor for the domestic market sentiments in the coming week would be the corporate earning results for the quarter-ending December, analysts added.

""On the positive side, markets would be looking ahead for signing of the phase-1 of the US-China trade deal along with the December quarterly results and developments prior to the Union Budget,"" said Motilal Oswal's Khemka.

With all the factors playing their role, the most significant factor to be watched by the investors would be the developments in West Asia and any further movement by the US and Iran on that front, as per analysts.

146,06-1-20,National Pension Scheme for traders fails to gain traction,"The National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self-Employed Persons has failed to gain traction as only about 25,000 persons have opted for the scheme as against the government's target to enrol 50 lakh by March-end.

As per Government data, only 84 traders and self-employed persons from Delhi have registered for the scheme so far, while 59 persons from Kerala, 54 from Himachal Pradesh, 29 from Jammu and Kashmir and two from Goa have registered.

No one has registered for the scheme in Lakshadweep and Mizoram.

Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of registrations with 6,765 persons, followed by Andhra Pradesh (4,781), Gujarat (2,915), Maharashtra (632), Bihar (583), Rajasthan (549), Tamil Nadu (309), Madhya Pradesh (305) and West Bengal (234).

The National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self Employed Persons (Pradhan Mantri Laghu Vyapari Maan-dhan Yojana) is a voluntary and contribution based central sector scheme.

The Government launched the scheme, entailing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs 3,000 for the entry age group of 18-40 years after attaining the age of 60 years, with effect from July 22, 2019.

Under the scheme, the Government makes matching contribution in the subscribers' account.

Commenting on the lukewarm response to the scheme, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the entry age and the premium for the scheme should be raised to encourage more traders to join the scheme. ""Rs 3,000 to be given after 30 years of paying premium will hardly have any value. Why have traders aged between 40 and 55 years been kept out of the scheme? The Government can increase premium for this age group (40-55) instead of depriving them of the scheme's benefits. These are two big drawbacks,"" Khandelwal told PTI.

He said the traders' body had suggested to the government that a provident fund like provision be made whereby a fund is created out of the total tax paid by a trader throughout his/her life, out of which every trader can be paid monthly pension upon attaining the age of 60.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/national-pension-scheme-for-traders-fails-to-gain-traction.html
147,06-1-20,Further escalation in US-Iran tension may affect India's exports: FIEO,"Further escalation in the tension between the US and Iran will have implications on India's exports to the Persian Gulf nation, apex exporters body FIEO said on Sunday.

Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said so far exporters have not flagged any concerns related with exports to Iran. ""However, if the tensions will continue, it may have affect on India's exports to Iran,"" he said.

He added that due to existing trade sanctions on Iran, Iranian shipping lines are only taking Indian consignments to that country.

Tensions between Iran and the US increased after an American drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani last week. Iran is a key trading partner of India. Its major exports to India are oil, fertilisers and chemicals, while it imports cereals, tea, coffee, basmati rice, spices and organic chemicals, among others.

148,06-1-20,"Petrol, diesel prices up for 4th straight day","Petrol and diesel prices rose for the fourth straight day on Sunday as global oil prices jumped after the US killed a top Iranian general, fanning fresh fears of conflict in the crude-rich Middle East.

Retail pump price of petrol was hiked by 9 paise per litre and that of diesel by 11 paise, according to a price notification of State-owned fuel retailers.

Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 75.54 per litre - the highest in more than a year, while a litre of diesel comes for Rs 68.51.

While global stock markets were mixed following the US killing of Qasem Soleimani, oil prices jumped more than 3 per cent on Friday. Oil markets will reopen on Monday after the weekend break. The killing of Soleimani represents ""a significant spike in geopolitical risks and could lead to a direct confrontation between the US and Iran,"" Oxford Economics said in a commentary.

India is 84 per cent dependant on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in global prices has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil -which forms the raw material for making petrol, diesel and other petroleum products - is priced according to international benchmarks.

Middle East accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being the top suppliers.

Even though import basket has been sought to be diversified with oil being contracted from nations such as US, pricing in all the regions is governed by international benchmarks and rates went up everywhere following Friday's strikes.

Officials said there is no immediate threat of any supply disruption to India and the only impact would be felt in prices.

For an economy that is struggling to recover from a six-year low growth rate of 4.5 per cent, a spike in oil prices poses significant risk as it will not just stoke inflation but also lead to higher outgo on Government subsidies on cooking fuel.

""Nowhere in the world has seen any supply being stopped because of US strikes. Oil continues to flow as normal,"" an official said.

Sunday's price increase is the fourth straight day of retail prices going up. Since January 2, petrol price has increased by 38 paise per litre while diesel rates have gone up 55 paise.

Prices were unchanged over the new year. Rates of petrol have been on the upswing since December 26 and that of diesel since November 29, 2019. Diesel prices have increased by Rs 2.78 per litre over this period while petrol has become costlier by 91 paise.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/petrol--diesel-prices-up-for-4th-straight-day-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol--diesel-prices-up-for-4th-straight-day.html

Acting on a tip-off, the police searched Santacruz- Chembur Link Road (SCLR) and found the chopped head, suspected to have been thrown from a bridge, near the railway track in the area late Saturday night, he said.

“The severed head was found near the rail track below the SCLR bridge. Since the place is not so far from where the woman's torso was earlier recovered, we suspect that the head may be of the deceased,” the official said.

It was sent to Rajawadi Hospital for an examination, the official said, adding that a DNA test would also be conducted to find out if it belonged to the killed woman. “We will send the head for DNA testing as it is suspected to be of the woman whose torso was found earlier,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 5) Niyati Thakar told PTI.

153,06-1-20,Cyrus Mistry: Won't take up chairmanship of Tata Sons,"In a major turn in the Tata-Mistry saga, Cyrus Mistry on Sunday said that he would not take up the chairmanship of Tata Sons or become director of any Tata Group company but pursue all options to protect the Shapoorji Pallonji Group's rights as minority stakeholder, including a seat at the Tata Sons' Board.

He said that his decision has been made in the interests of the Tata Group, ""whose interests are far more important then the interests of any individual"".

""To dispel the misinformation campaign being conducted, I intend to make it clear that despite the NCLAT order in my favour, I will not be pursuing the Executive Chairmanship of Tata Sons, or Directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries.

""I will however vigorously pursue all options to protect our rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the thirty year history of a seat at the Board of Tata Sons and the incorporation of the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency at Tata Sons,"" he said, in a statement.

To recent media reports attributed to Ratan Tata and others questioning the NCLAT judgment ahead of an hearing in the Supreme Court, he contended these ""profess an interpretation of corporate democracy as being one of brute majoritarianism with no rights for minority stakeholders"".

""The question in these legal proceedings is whether oppressive actions of a majority that stifles minority shareholders is beyond reproach and outside judicial oversight,"" he added.

Mistry said that the founding fathers of the Tata Group had laid a strong ethical foundation that cared for all stakeholders and the relationship between the Tata Group and the Shapoorji Pallonji Group is one spanning multiple decades that was built on common agreement and mutual faith.

""Former Tata leaders worked together with the minority partner to create value for all stakeholders.""

The statement comes just days after Tata Sons and it Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata moved the Supreme Court challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's December verdict which ordered the reinstatement of Mistry as the Chairman of Tata Sons.

Ratan Tata, in the petition filed in the top court on January 3, had said that that the appellate tribunal's verdict was ""erroneous"" and it ""pulled down"" the governance and corporate structure of the group.

On Mistry's replacement as the Chairman of Tata Sons, he told the apex court in his petition that the relationship between Mistry and Tata Trusts had become discordant and it was felt by Tata Trusts that he could not provide robust leadership to Tata Sons in future.

""The company has on January 3 filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against the judgement of NCLAT dated December 18, directing reinstatement of Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as Director of the Company for the rest of the tenure,"" said TCS in a regulatory filing on Saturday.

Last month, NCLAT had restored Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons and ruled that appointment of N Chandrasekaran was ""illegal"". In response to this decision, Tata Sons moved the apex court.

Besides, Ratan Tata had on Friday moved the Supreme Court in his personal capacity challenging the NCLAT's verdict reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman, alleging that in an instance of conflict of interest, Mistry was reluctant to disassociate himself from his family business even after he became the chairman of Tata Sons.

The former Tata Sons chief moved the Supreme Court in his personal capacity, a day after Tata Sons moved the apex court challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) December 18 judgement.

Ratan Tata in his petition to the top court mentioned that disassociation from his family business, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, was a precondition for Mistry's appointment as Tata Sons Chairman.

""Amongst the various fronts where Cyrus Mistry's leadership was lacking was his reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the Chairman of Tata Sons and address any conflict in this regard, which was a condition precedent to his appointment as Chairman of Tata Sons,"" Ratan Tata's petition said.

155,06-1-20,"CSR projects gain when US Presidents, honchos differ","Business leaders take up more social responsibility projects when they disagree with White House, reveals a study.

Liberal CEOs invested more in socially conscious activities, like diversity initiatives and environment conservation, when they felt those values were threatened, found the researchers.

""Republican Presidents aren't as interested in those values, so business leaders think, 'we need to do more to promote and protect these values',"" said Nara Jeong, Assistant Professor of Management at San Francisco State University in US.

When business leaders shared same political beliefs as President, support for socially conscious initiatives declined.

For left-leaning CEOs, more likely to engage in socially responsible activities, those efforts declined by an average of 18 per cent, Jeong said.

Business leaders with same political orientation as President might have an expectation that Govt ""will deliver on social values they hold dear,"" said the study published in journal Management Decision.

As a result, these executives might feel empowered to focus on their companies' financial performance, Jeong added.

For the study, the researchers examined a decade of behaviour, starting mid 1990s.

Jeong and her collaborator went a step further and tested whether politics encouraged companies to act irresponsibly. Examples could include increasing pollution, lowering emission standards or doing away with policies that protect minority employees.

156,06-1-20,India's service sector activity growth hits 5-month high in Dec: PMI,"India's services sector activity gained momentum and touched a five-month high in December, supported by uptick in new business orders that boosted output as well as employment, a monthly survey showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index improved from 52.7 in November to 53.3 in December, highlighting the second-strongest rate of increase in output in over a year, after July.

""The news of sustained job creation, robust new order growth and a pick-up in business confidence suggest that expansion can be maintained in the early part of 2020,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

Survey members linked the rise to better market conditions and new business growth. Moreover, total sales expanded for the third consecutive month at the end of the year, and at the quickest pace since October 2016.

On the prices front, input costs increased further in December, with monitored firms citing higher charges for food, fuel, medical products and transport.

""Worryingly, inflationary pressures intensified, with the fastest rise in input costs for almost seven years pushing output charge inflation to a 22-month high,"" the survey said.

On the employment front, driven by rise in new business orders, service providers continued to hire extra staff in December and employment increased for the 28th month in succession.

The survey further noted that Indian services firms expect marketing efforts and favourable economic conditions to boost business activity during 2020. However, the overall level of positive sentiment remained below its long-run average.

Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index that maps both the manufacturing and services sector, rose from 52.7 in November to 53.7, reflecting stronger rates of expansion in both the manufacturing and service sectors.

""With manufacturing sector weakness also fading in December, what was anticipated to be a disappointing private sector performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019/20 is now looking brighter,"" Lima said.

Lima, however, noted that growth looks set to be sustained, but at an unspectacular rate, with the latest quarterly PMI Composite Output Index reading broadly in line with that recorded in the three months to September.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-service-sector-activity-growth-hits-5-month-high-in-dec--pmi-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-s-service-sector-activity-growth-hits-5-month-high-in-dec--pmi.html

159,06-1-20,Al-Shabab attacks military base used by US forces in Kenya,"Somalia's al-Shabab extremist group attacked a military base used by US and Kenyan troops in coastal Kenya early on Sunday, destroying US aircraft and vehicles, Kenyan authorities said.

Kenya's military said the pre-dawn assault was repulsed and at least four attackers were killed.

It was the first known al-Shabab attack against US forces inside Kenya, a key base for fighting one of the world's most resilient extremist organizations.

A plume of black smoke rose above the base near the border with Somalia, where al-Shabab is based.

Residents said a car bomb had exploded.

Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia told The Associated Press that five suspects were arrested and were being interrogated.

The US Africa Command confirmed the attack on Camp Simba in Lamu county.

Spokesman Col. Christopher Karns called al-Shabab's claims, including that its attack inflicted severe casualties, “grossly exaggerated.""

There was no report of US or Kenyan deaths.

The camp, established more than a decade ago, has under 100 US personnel, according to Pentagon figures.

A US flag-raising there in August signalled its change “from tactical to enduring operations,"" the Air Force said at the time.

An internal Kenyan police report seen by the AP said two fixed-wing aircraft, a US Cessna and a Kenyan one, were destroyed along with two US helicopters and multiple US vehicles at the Manda Bay military airstrip.

The report said explosions were heard at around 5:30 am from the direction of the airstrip.

The scene, now secured, indicated that al-Shabab likely entered “to conduct targeted attacks,"" the report said.

According to another internal report seen by the AP, dated Friday, a villager that day said he had spotted 11 suspected al-Shabab members entering Lamu's Boni forest, which the extremists have used as a hideout.

The report said Kenyan authorities did not find them.

Al-Shabab's claim of responsibility said Sunday's attack destroyed US equipment including aircraft and vehicles, and it posted photos of blazing aircraft it asserted were from the attack.

161,06-1-20,Arrest warrant issued against B’desh's 1st Hindu chief justice for alleged graft,"An arrest warrant was issued against Bangladesh's first Hindu chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha on charges of embezzling 40 million taka, court officials said on Sunday.

Sinha, 68, who lives in the US, has been described as a ""fugitive"" by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in its charge-sheet.

Judge KM Emrul Kayesh of Dhaka's Senior Special Judges' Court took cognizance of the graft charges brought against Sinha and 10 others by the ACC.

""The judge ordered his (Sinha's) arrest along with 10 others as the ACC accused him of misappropriating and laundering about 4 crore taka (USD 471,993) in 2016,"" public prosecutor Taposh Kumar Pal told reporters.

The rest of the accused are former senior officials of Farmers Bank including its ex-managing director.

The ACC in its charge-sheet described all the 11 to be ""fugitives"". It alleged that Sinha and 10 others embezzling 40 million taka from Farmers Bank, which was later renamed as Padma Bank Limited, Pal said.

The development came nearly three months after the ACC said it found evidence of fraud involving transactions of 40 million taka borrowed with fake documents by two businessmen from the bank while the amount was deposited in Sinha's account.

Sinha, who is said to have sought asylum in the US, served as the 21st Chief Justice of Bangladesh from January, 2015 to November, 2017.

The case came days after Sinha's newly-launched autobiography brought him in political spotlight over two years after he was forced to quit amid a row with the government.

The ACC earlier said if required it would quiz Sinha by bringing him back home but ""interrogation is not a mandatory provision for investigations"".

In his autobiography ""A Broken Dream: Rule of Law, Human Rights and Democracy"", Sinha said he was forced to resign in 2017 intimidation and threats, drawing a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who accused some anti-government newspapers of backing him.

163,06-1-20,Time to find answers,"For filmmaker Kanu Behl, films should respect the audience and create a space for them to question and even explore answers themselves. His short film, Binnu Ka Sapna, initiates a conversation on patriarchy. By Ayushi Sharma

The cyclical pattern of patriarchy is a globally recognised social condition. And evidently, a highly flawed phenomenon. One might even go a step forward and think of it as a social disorder. In almost every other home in the country, this cycle is justified and normalised. The real impact of being witness to the cycle, unfortunately, comes a full circle when children who grow up in such an environment, enter adulthood. Filmmaker Kanu Behl’s short film Binnu Ka Sapna talks about the journey of one such young man, initiating a larger conversation about the need to introspect.

The story revolves around Binnu, who carries multiple lives that he has witnessed in his mind. His dreams get filtered and nightmares remain unshed. An uneasy cycle of violence bursts beneath the surface. Will it drench everyone around him? Binnu has grown up struggling with the echoes of the sound of his father slapping his mother, the first one being 25 years ago, when she merely emerged from the same room as her brother-in-law. Many years later, Binnu leaves home. At a party, he sleeps with his boss’ daughter, whom he falls in love with but things don’t go as planned. He leaves the town, engaging in another romance in another city. But something is not quite right. Slowly, a strange paranoia begins to engulf his being.

Behl says that Binnu Ka Sapna delves deep into a malignant mindset, trying to bare the ticking time bombs around us and illuminate the wicks that light them. The 32-minute narrative is his attempt to understand the anger within. He shares, “I went through a period where I raged and destroyed everything in my path. Irretrievably, irrevocably. Where did the roots of that anger lie? Did the anger root from a focal core or was it a constantly mutating unrecognisable beast? Its consequences and ripples, either way, rested on my individual doorstep. That’s how it began. In such times, you try to universalise your experiences to make them larger so that they don’t just stay restricted to your personal life.” He believes that Binnu Ka Sapna is a film that will be relevant even after decades because it tries to explore the impact of anger and violence on an individual as well as society. “It will help us reflect on the way we live our lives today,” adds he. The film, produced by Terribly Tiny Talkies and Colosceum Media, shows a harrowing transformation of a victim into an attacker, with society only serving as a catalyst.

The filmmaker believes that patriarchy is a disorder as it establishes the supremacy of one gender over the other. “It resonates with the capitalist structure, much like taking control over what belongs to the other. Even the institution of marriage in India has been subsumed with patriarchy, so much that one gender is only suppressing the other. In that sense, patriarchy is clearly dysfunctional. Having said that, such films are a fair rebellion and an initiative to structure such a thing that is defunct and clearly doesn’t work. So there is a need to have a nuanced debate about it,” says Behl, whose debut feature Titli has won eight international awards including the NETPAC and the Best First Foreign Film (2015) from the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

So what influences have shaped him to question the pattern of patriarchy because even Titli dealt with a similar issue. He says, “Thematically, I think they are two completely different pieces exploring different sides of the psychological spectrum. Titli was more about secularity and how patterns travel within a family.”

According to him, it is really important for a film to not be a sermon. He doesn’t think films are meant to be someone’s observation. “Generally it’s like... someone who knows everything about life and they are now trying to tell you,” says he. For him, a film should always respect its audience and have something to say and generate a conversation at the end of the day because now, he feels, the audience has matured and is accepting more complex narratives easily. Behl points out, “The grand 80s and the 90s failed our commercial cinema as they didn’t reflect the society. As a result, they didn’t mean anything to anyone at that time. Before that, the Bollywood of the 60s and the 70s was still doing very relevant work. From Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor, Hrishikesh Mukherjee to Shyam Benegal, they made films that had as much to say as much as they entertained.”

Looking at the current trend in Bollywood, there has been a streak of biopics over the last five years, which has also become one of the favourite genres. However, Behl doesn’t have a very high opinion on this trend. He says, “It is incorrect to call them biopics. They are more of a hagiography. This streak is more of a substitute of Marvel-like superheroes in India because we don’t have any traditional superheroes here.”

And what about the theme of realism that is taking rounds in the Hindi film industry? The director feels that most of the social issue films are just public service advertisements. “I find a total lack of nuance and complexity in them. I don’t think that most of them are interested in exploring the issue beyond just preaching. For me, it is not what cinema is for. We all know what they are saying at the end of the day. They are just repeating the kahavatein. But where is the conversation around that issue?”

Well, Behl is someone who would make a film that has enough space for the audience to walk out with certain questions and have the rest of the conversation with themselves rather than someone passively telling them that this is the lie and that is the truth. “Films should leave enough space for the audience to come and interact. It must not close all doors by giving a particular solution. Someone shouting or giving a solution explicitly for people is almost propagandist. That is the power of cinema that people connect in an ideal scenario, which leaves them moved not just by the story or the plot but by what they notice that leaves them questioning the lives that they live. And that is where the change begins — with questions that are raised while you watch a piece of art and then every individual going back and finding answers for themselves,” says he.

165,06-1-20,"Market bleeds: Sensex, Nifty suffer worst loss in 6 mths on US-Iran tussle","The BSE Sensex crashed nearly 788 points, its worst session in about six months, as escalating US-Iran tensions sent crude oil prices soaring and also made investors shun equities and rush to safe haven assets.

At the closing bell, the 30-share Sensex was at 40,676.63, down 1.90 per cent or 787.98 points -- the biggest single-day drop since July 8.

After opening the session on a subdued note, the BSE gauge broadened losses and hit an intra-day low of 40,613.96.

Similarly, the 50-scrip NSE Nifty closed at 11,993.05, falling by 1.91 per cent or 233.60 points.

On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63 per cent, followed by SBI, IndusInd Bank, Maruti, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries.

Bucking the broader trend, only Titan and PowerGrid ended with gains.

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with BSE metal, finance, realty, bankex, energy, auto, oil and gas, capital goods and healthcare indices cracking up to 2.96 per cent.

While, broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices slumped up to 2.31 per cent.

Along with soaring crude prices, the negative impact of weakening Indian currency is also weighing on equities.

The Indian rupee dropped 13 paise to close at 71.93 against the US dollar on Monday amid rise in crude benchmark Brent Futures, quoted last at USD 69.64 per barrel -- an increase of 1.37 per cent in price.

""The ground reality is unstable, global market feels that this (US-Iran) tension can escalate further. Investors are closing their current position and shifting to haven assets leading to a mount in bond yield, oil and gold prices,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said.

Global markets too remained underpressure after US President Donald Trump warned Iran of major retaliation if Tehran carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani and hinted at striking its cultural sites.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended lower. European markets were also trading in negative terrain in early sessions.

Trump's statement came hours after Iran announced it will no longer abide by the limits contained in the 2015 landmark nuclear deal.

The US President also threatened to impose ""very big sanctions"" on Iraq if it follows through on a parliament vote calling for the expulsion of US troops based in the country.

Analysts opined that the Indian market is reacting more negatively than other emerging markets due to crude oil impact.

Since India's dependence on crude imports as a percentage of consumption is the highest, the impact on economy and markets is also higher, they said.

166,06-1-20,Pompeo: US military would only hit lawful targets in Iran,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that any target the US military may strike in Iran, in the event Iran retaliates against America for killing its most powerful general, would be legal under the laws of armed conflict.

Pompeo was asked on ABC's ""This Week"" about President Donald Trump's assertion Saturday on Twitter that the United States has 52 Iranian targets in its sights, ""some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.""

The laws of armed conflict prohibit the deliberate targeting of cultural sites under most circumstances.

""Every target that we strike will be a lawful target, and it will be a target designed with a singular mission — defending and protecting America,"" Pompeo said.

He also said the Trump administration has abandoned the previous US administration's focus on countering Iranian proxy groups and suggested the US Strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian Gen Qassem Soleimani was an example of the new strategy.

""We're going to respond against the actual decision-makers, the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Pompeo said.

In Baghdad on Sunday, the US coalition combating the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria announced that it has ""paused"" training of Iraqi security forces in order to focus on protecting coalition personnel.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pompeo--us-military-would-only-hit-lawful-targets-in-iran.html
167,06-1-20,Mourners flood Iran cities as top general's remains return,"Mourners flooded the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad on Sunday, weeping and beating their chests in homage to top general Qasem Soleimani who was killed in a US strike in Baghdad.

""Death to America,"" they chanted as they packed Ahvaz's streets and a long bridge spanning a river in the southwestern city to receive the casket containing Soleimani's remains.

As Shiite chants resonated in the air, people held portraits of the man seen as a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and for spearheading Iran's Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force.

In the northeastern city of Mashhad, scores took to streets around the Imam Reza shrine and, addressing the US, chanted ""Be afraid of your own shadow"". Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike Friday near Baghdad airport, shocking the Islamic republic. He was 62.

The attack was ordered by President Donald Trump, who said the Quds commander had been planning an ""imminent"" attack on US diplomats and forces in Iraq.

In the face of growing Iraqi anger over the strike, the country's parliament was expected to vote Sunday on whether to oust the roughly 5,200 American troops in Iraq.

Soleimani's assassination ratcheted up tensions between arch-enemies Tehran and Washington and sparked fears of a new Middle East war.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed ""severe revenge"" and declared three days of mourning.

But Trump warned late Saturday that America was targeting 52 sites ""important to Iran & Iranian culture"" and would hit them ""very fast and very hard"" if the country attacks American personnel or assets.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/mourners-flood-iran-cities-as-top-general-s-remains-return.html

169,06-1-20,Saudi ‘not consulted' over US strike that killed Iran general,"Saudi Arabia was not consulted by its ally Washington over a US drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, an official said Sunday, as the kingdom sought to defuse soaring regional tensions.

Saudi Arabia is vulnerable to possible Iranian reprisals after Tehran vowed ""revenge"" following the strike on Friday that killed powerful commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not consulted regarding the US strike,"" a Saudi official told AFP, requesting anonymity.

""In light of the rapid developments, the kingdom stresses the importance of exercising restraint to guard against all acts that may lead to escalation, with severe consequences,"" the official added.

Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry made a similar call for restraint at the weekend and King Salman emphasised the need for measures to defuse tensions in a phone call on Saturday with Iraqi President Barham Saleh.

In a separate phone call with Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stressed ""the need to make efforts to calm the situation and de-escalate tensions"", the official Saudi Press Agency reported. The crown prince has instructed Prince Khalid bin Salman, his younger brother and deputy defence minister, to travel to Washington and London in the next few days to urge restraint, the pan-Arab Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported. Prince Khalid will meet White House and US defence officials, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.

The killing of Soleimani, seen as the second most powerful man in Iran, is the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Washington and Tehran and has prompted fears of a major conflagration in the Middle East.

US President Donald Trump, who ordered the drone strike, has warned that Washington will hit Iran ""very fast and very hard"" if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both allies of Washington, are also vulnerable to Iranian counter strikes, analysts say. A string of attacks blamed on Iran has caused anxiety in recent months as Riyadh and Washington deliberated over how to react.

In particular, devastating strikes against Saudi oil installations last September led Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to adopt a more conciliatory approach aimed at avoiding confrontation with Tehran.

Analysts warn that pro-Iran groups have the capacity to carry out attacks on US bases in Gulf states as well as against shipping in the Strait of Hormuz — the strategic waterway that Tehran could close at will.

""Expect Iranian reprisals (directly or through partner groups in Iraq, Lebanon or elsewhere) to target US partners in the region including Saudi Arabia,"" said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi----not-consulted--over-us-strike-that-killed-iran-general.html
170,06-1-20,UK's Johnson faces heat for silence on Iran while on holiday,"Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to return Sunday to the UK, where he faces criticism for not cutting short his holiday to deal with soaring Mideast tensions.

Johnson, who celebrated the New Year on the Caribbean private island of Mustique after leading his Conservative Party to a strong majority in the December 12 election, has been silent over the US slaying Friday of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike.

Soleimani's death stoked fears that heightened world tensions could spiral into war after Iran threatened revenge against the US, which has sent 3,000 more soldiers to Kuwait.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has defended Johnson, saying the two have been in constant contact during this time. The British government has upgraded its travel warning for the Middle East and dispatched two warships to escort UK-flagged ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipment corridor for world oil supplies. Jeremy Corbyn, the outgoing leader of the opposition Labour party, said Johnson ""should have immediately cut short his holiday to deal with an issue that could have grave consequences for the UK and the world.""

In an op-ed in The Observer, Labour's foreign policy spokeswoman Emily Thornberry, who is in the race to take over from Corbyn, said she was astonished Johnson hadn't said anything 48 hours after the strike and wondered if he was afraid of angering US President Donald Trump, who ordered the slaying.

Ed Davey, the leader of a smaller party, the Liberal Democrats, tweeted that Johnson's silence was “deafening.” Raab, appearing Sunday morning on British news shows, dismissed the criticism, telling Sky News that “the whole government is working closely together. We're very clear on strategy.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uk-s-johnson-faces-heat-for-silence-on-iran-while-on-holiday.html
171,06-1-20,Meatless in Beverly,"The Golden Globes will serve plant-based meals at its 77th awards ceremony to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste

The Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” is going with a meatless menu for its 77th annual awards show.

Guests will be served a 100 per cent plant-based meal just ahead of the showtime Sunday. The initiative is being taken to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste.

“If there’s a way we can, not change the world, but save the planet, maybe we can get the Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change,” Lorenzo Soria, president, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said. He added, “The food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.”

Soria said that there was some initial push back about changing the menu just about two weeks before the show but the hotel eventually agreed on the new menu.

“People were basically saying it’s too late, we’re ready with all the orders, the holidays and all that,” he said. “But after we began discussions, meeting for one or two days, they (the hotel) accepted the change completely. They started to experiment with how to do plant-based meals that was not just their symbolic steps but also something that guests could enjoy.”

Matthew Morgan, executive chef at The Beverly Hilton, called the menu change initially surprising. But he ultimately understood that it would send across a positive message. “It was a little shocking when it was first mentioned because of being very close to the actual Globes and having already decided on a menu,” he said. “But once we thought about it and the message that it sent, we were really excited about it! That’s something I stand behind myself.”

Items on the main entree include king oyster mushrooms scallops and wild mushroom risotto, along with roasted baby purple and green Brussels sprouts and carrots. A chilled golden beet soup will be served as an appetiser.

The HFPA has partnered with Icelandic Glacial, a naturally alkaline and sustainably-sourced natural spring water. The water will be served in glass bottles to eliminate plastic waste in the ballroom and red carpet, which is reused at other events throughout the year.

Soria called the food “excellent” after a recent taste-testing session. Morgan said making the change wasn’t too difficult and added that the first course was already vegan and the main course was a vegan alternate in which they enhanced the dishes to add some “pop and colour to the plate.”

172,06-1-20,Mohun Bagan beat RKFC 2-0,"There was bone-chilling cold. Then there was a Real Kashmir outfit used to such extreme conditions but Mohun Bagan still, making light of both, won their I-League match 2-0 here on Sunday.

After a barren first half, Joseba Beitia (71st minute) and Nongdamba Naorem (73rd) scored for the Kolkata giants in a span of two minutes, shattering the hopes of home fans.

It was a chilly morning, with the temperature dipping to 1 degree, but 11,500 Kashmiri spectators still enthusiastically watched the game against one of India’s biggest and oldest clubs.

For tickets, they queued up since 9 o’clock in the morning, but quite a few of them still could not make it to the ground. Such was the craze.

The game started at 11.30 am at the TRC ground because of bitting cold, but the harsh weather conditions failed to stop the visitors from showing their skills.

The green and maroons had the lion’s share of possession and more shots on target but the home side had more attempts and five more corners in a game which could have gone either way.

Mohun Bagan have 10 points from five games, while Kashmir dropped to eighth spot with five points from four games.

Mohun Bagan coach Vicuna expressed his joy and said, “We won against a tough opponent, but it was not out best match. Real Kashmir were going with their set piece, but we played better football against Churchill brothers.

“Today we played good football, and copped with the difficulties of conditions.”

173,06-1-20,Klopp kids batter Toffees,"Liverpool inflicted fresh misery on Merseyside rivals Everton as a superb strike from teenager Curtis Jones sealed a 1-0 win in the FA Cup third round on Sunday.

Jones’second half curler sent Anfield in ecstasy as the club’s youth academy graduates handed Everton an embarrassing derby defeat.

The 18-year-old Liverpool-born midfielder was making only his fifth appearance and his memorable match winner was his first senior goal.

Jones is the youngest goalscorer for Liverpool in a Merseyside derby since Robbie Fowler.

Without a win over their rivals in any competition since 2010 and thrashed 5-2 at Anfield in the Premier League earlier this season, Everton will feel the pain from this defeat against their under-strength neighbours for some while.

Hit by injuries that left him with 12 fit senior outfield players, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp had made nine changes, selecting Nat Phillips, 22, and teenage trio Neco Williams, Harvey Elliott and Jones.

In contrast, Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti made just two changes, fielding a strong team as the visitors chased a first win at Anfield since 1999.

Liverpool’s injury problems mounted within 10 minutes when James Milner limped off to be replaced by another teenager Yasser Larouci.

Ancelotti’s side threatened early on when Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s strike was pushed away from Adrian, who then repelled Mason Holgate's header and Richarlison’s shot.

Liverpool’s youngsters had been thrashed by Aston Villa while the senior stars were away at the Club World Cup in December.

But they acquitted themselves much better this time and Japan striker Takumi Minamino, making his debut after joining from Salzburg, glanced a header narrowly off-target before Divock Origi’s low drive was brilliantly saved by Jordan Pickford.

Jones’ moment of magic came in the 71st minute when he played a chipped pass to Origi, took the return ball and curled a stunning effort into the top corner.

Spurs held

Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Moura kept Tottenham’s FA Cup hopes alive with the equaliser in their 1-1 draw at second tier Middlesbrough, while Callum Hudson-Odoi got back in the groove as Chelsea cruised to a 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest.

Woodgate was on course to dent Tottenham’s bid to end that wretched run when Ashley Fletcher put Middlesbrough ahead in the second half at the Riverside Stadium.

But Brazilian winger Lucas headed the equaliser to send the tie to a replay in north London later in January.

174,06-1-20,Immobile’s double snatch late win,"Mario Balotelli warded off the insults from travelling Lazio fans to strike the first goal of the decade in Italy but the title-chasers hit back with a Ciro Immobile double to snatch a late win at ten-man Brescia on Sunday.

Simone Inzaghi’s side stretched their winning streak to nine consecutive league games and with a game in hand are three points behind leaders Inter Milan and Juventus who play today.

Immobile struck the winner after 91 minutes having also converted from the penalty spot before the break.

Felipe Caicedo had the ball in the back of the net early for Lazio off an Immobile cross but it was ruled offside.

But Italian international Balotelli picked up where he left off before the winter break opening the scoring after 18 minutes for the promoted side.

The 29-year-old pulled clear of Luiz Felipe to volley in his first home goal for Brescia and first of the decade.

He also scored the first goal of the previous decade in January 2010 with Inter Milan.

Balotelli was targeted by insulting chants from Lazio fans with the referee interrupting the game in the first half and an announcement made that play would be suspended if they continued.

Brescia fans tried to drown out the insults with whistles and cheering which Balotelli applauded.

Relegation-threatened Brescia were hit after Andrea Cistana was sent off for a second yellow card after bringing down Caicedo just before the break.

And Serie A top scorer Immobile pulled Lazio back on level terms from the penalty spot on 42 minutes.

Lazio dominated the second half with Immobile bringing his league tally to 19 goals connecting with a Caicedo cross to fire in the injury time winner.

It was the 12th time this season that the team have scored a late winner.

Inzaghi meanwhile equals Sven Goran Eriksson’s record of nine consecutive league wins set in the 1998-99 season.

“We will try to continue like this. We absolutely want to hit the Champions League,” said Inzaghi, whose side defeated Juventus to lift the Italian SuperCup trophy last month.

Inter Milan recommence the title battle with Juventus today, with both sides level on 42 points after 17 games.

The 34-year-old Wawrinka, a three-time major winner, is top seed in Doha which boasts a respectable $1.4 million prize fund.

Wawrinka has not won a title since pocketing the 16th of his career on the Geneva clay in 2017.

176,06-1-20,Top names crash at ATP Cup,"Stefanos Tsitsipas whipped an error-strewn Alexander Zverev to win the battle of the big guns at the ATP Cup on Sunday, inflicting a second successive defeat on the German in his warm-up for the Australian Open.

On day three of the inaugural 24-nation team event in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, world number 11 David Goffin was another loser, along with Italy’s Fabio Fognini, ranked one place below him.

Greek star Tsitsipas, who won the 2019 season-ending ATP Finals in London and is now ranked six, was in a different league to Zverev, who only began hitting balls a week ago after an off-season curtailed by a lucrative exhibition tour.

The lacklustre German world number seven sent down 10 double faults and made just 45 percent of his first serves, a worrying sign ahead of the opening Grand Slam of the year.

He lost to Australia’s Alex de Minaur in his opening match on Friday, throwing away a one-set lead.

“I worked very hard for this win, I found solutions, found my rhythm and my pace and knew what I was doing on court,” said impressive 21-year-old Tsitsipas after his 6-1, 6-4 walloping in Brisbane.

The Boris Becker-captained Germans have now won one of their opening ties, while Greece has lost both of theirs.

The Grigor Dimitrov-led Bulgaria won their second tie in a row, beating Moldova 2-1, to be in a commanding position in Group C, while Australia also made it two-out-of-two in Group F with De Minaur again on fire in their 3-0 sweep of Canada.

Belgium’s Goffin saved five match points against Dan Evans, but it was too little, too late as he crashed 6-4, 6-4 in Sydney for one of the biggest wins of the Briton’s career.

Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury won the deciding doubles to secure the tie for Britain 2-1.

Fognini was beaten by emerging Norwegian 21-year-old Casper Ruud, who claimed his second big scalp after upsetting American John Isner in his first match on Friday.

Ruud, whose father Christian is Norway’s captain, won 6-2, 6-2, although it wasn’t enough to prevent Norway losing 2-1 to Italy.

Mercurial Australian Nick Kyrgios pulled out of his country’s tie against Canada just hours before it started with back soreness.

But John Millman seamlessly stepped in to stun Felix Auger-Aliassime in straight sets before De Minaur again showed the fighting qualities for which he is renowned.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/top-names-crash-at-atp-cup.html
177,06-1-20,Made in China,"Wu Lei strikes late as Espanyol hold 10-man Barcelona

Espanyol’s Wu Lei became the first Chinese footballer to score against Barcelona on Saturday and has revealed how the goal that went viral was planned while he was warming up.

Wu earned Espanyol a dramatic 2-2 draw at the RCDE Stadium after he fired in an 88th-minute equaliser to salvage a point in the all-Catalan clash of La Liga’s top against bottom.

The 28-year-old drove decisively past Barcelona’s stand-in goalkeeper Neto and into the far corner but his goal owed much to a brilliant reverse pass too, executed by his team-mate Matias Vargas.

Both players had been introduced by new coach Abelardo Fernandez in the second half and Wu said after the match that Vargas had predicted he would give him a chance.

“I am very happy, not just because I scored but because of that assist,” Wu told Espanyol TV.

“When we were warming up, Matias told me he was going to put me in with a through ball. After 10 minutes he played one to me and I scored.”

Chinese media on Sunday declared the strike as heralding “a new chapter” in Chinese football while one related hashtag generated 370 million views on social media platform Weibo.

“Wu has now become the first Chinese player to score against Barcelona in all competitions ever,” state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN) said.

The 28-year-old Wu “single-handedly revitalised Espanyol” against the Spanish champions, CGTN continued.

“A new chapter in history has been opened,” it added. “For Wu, it was a night that will live long in the memory.”

State news agency Xinhua said Wu’s dramatic leveller from a narrow angle “sparked a wave of praise from media and fans in China”.

Wu joined in the celebrations by writing on Weibo: “Wonderful night, a new year, a good start.”

Chinese Maradona

The forward, dubbed the “Chinese Maradona” as a youngster, joined Espanyol from Shanghai SIPG in January last year and after finishing top scorer in the Chinese Super League, he said he wanted to prove the country’s players could deliver at the highest level.

“Pressure is my driving force, it’s what pushes me forward,” he said last year.

“I want to show fans around the world that there are players in China who can shine in the best leagues in the world.”

He has stayed true to his word and more than justified his modest transfer fee of 2 million euros.

After making his debut at the start of February, Wu missed only one game for his new club through to the end of last season, playing 21 times and scoring four goals.

This term, he has been even more effective, scoring six goals in 28 appearances in all competitions, despite Espanyol’s poor form that has them languishing at the bottom of the La Liga table.

Yet Abelardo’s appointment seems to have revitalised the team and Wu believes their stirring performance against Barcelona can now be a turning-point in their fight against relegation.

“After the game in the dressing room, you could see everyone’s confidence was up,” Wu said.

“It feels like we are going to change the whole dynamic this year. Hopefully in the next game we can get the victory because we are gaining momentum.

“We thank all the fans who supported us because they give us unity. We are all a family together.”

China’s new coach Li Tie will also hope Wu's form can help rescue the country’s hopes of reaching the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. They sit second in their qualifying group after four games, eight points behind Syria.

“He is currently the only Chinese player in one of the five major football leagues,” said Li Tie in his first press conference in charge on Sunday.

After Shorey’s 96 on day two, Rana (92 off 189) batted sensibly alongside Jonty Sidhu (41) to take Delhi past Punjab’s first innings score of 313.

Lalit Yadav (39) also made a crucial lower-order contribution as Delhi ended their first innings at 339.

After a spirited showing with the bat, pacers extended Delhi’s advantage, especially the young Simarjeet Singh who continues to impress in his second first-class season.

He removed Sanvir Singh (11) before removing the in-form Gurkeerat Singh Mann (15).

Opener Shubman Gill (4), who courted controversy in the first innings, failed for the second time in the game. The India batsman was dismissed by Subodh Bhati in the third over.

Punjab captain and first innings’ top-scorer Mandeep Singh was in the middle on 8 when stumps were drawn. Punjab lead by just 18 runs going into day four.

Karnataka thrash Mumbai

Mumbai: Putting up an all-round show, Karnataka defeated Mumbai by 5 wickets in their Elite Group B game at BKC, inside two-and-half days.

This was Mumbai’s second consecutive loss at home, following their defeat against Railways.

It is also Karnataka’s fourth outright win against Mumbai since the 2013-14 season.

Chasing 126 for an outright win, Karnataka openers R Samarth (34; 2x4) and Devdutt Padikkal (50; 5x4, 2x6) gave the team a solid start and the visitors were racing towards the target as they were 77/0 at lunch.

However, post lunch offie Shashank Attarde (4-52) pegged back the visitors by taking wickets.

But Shreyas Gopal (5 not out) and B R Sharath (4 not out) took the side home without any further damage.

Earlier, resuming the day on 109/5, left-arm pacer Prateek Jain (4-11) grabbed all the wickets in the morning session as he ran through the Mumbai’s lower order.

Meanwhile in Vadodara, Baroda thrashed Railways by 99 runs.

Services gain bonus

New Delhi: Medium-pacers Diwesh Pathania and Sachidanand Pandey took five wickets each as Services thrashed Maharashtra by an innings and 94 runs in a Group C match.

Resuming at their overnight score of 93 for five, Maharashtra’s second innings folded for just 147.

The visitors lost Naushad S Shaikh (41) for the addition of just one run when Pandey (5/56) induced an edge, taken by wicket-keeper Nakul Verma.

Opener Murtaza Trunkwala, who had retired hurt on Saturday returned to the crease but didn’t last long, falling to Pathania (5/49) for 9 after hitting two boundaries.

Vishant More, who was batting on 33 overnight, added only three runs to his score before being bowled by Pandey.

There was brief resistance from the lower-order but eventually Maharashtra were bundled out in 48.1 overs.

Bihar beat Mizoram

Patna: Medium pacer Abhijeet Saket produced a magical spell during which he dismissed seven batsmen without conceding a single run to fashion Bihar’s six-wicket win over Mizoram in a plate group match.

Saket eventually ended the match with his career-best figures of 7/12 as Bihar completed the win inside three days.

Mizoram opener C Lalrinsanga’s (0) first-over dismissal marked the beginning of Saket’s electrifying spell. Four Mizoram batsmen could not even open their account.

Taruwar Kohli soon followed suit with a first-ball duck in the the 24-year-old’s second over. Lalhruaizela (1), Lalhmangaiha (3) , Lalruatdika (0), Pratik Desai (0) and G Lalbiakvela (0) were Saket’s other victims.

His efforts helped Bihar bundle out Mizoram for 68 in their second innings, setting Bihar a 185 run target.

In reply, Bihar cruised to the target in 33.4 overs with opener Indrajit Kumar (98 not out) and Babul Kumar (61) hitting comfortable half centuries.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rana--pacers-put-delhi-on-top.html

Actor Vidya Balan wants bigger openings for her films than the film industry’s male superstars.

“I want bigger openings than the male superstars,” she laughed and added, “I am greedy. I think it’s a very interesting time to be in Hindi cinema. I really look forward to this decade. As a female actor at 41, I am amazed with the kind of roles and films I am being offered.”

About which other female actors she has looked up to in Hindi cinema, Vidya said, “I’ve always looked up to Shabana Azmi. She was one of the actresses with the voice. She was not scared to express her opinions and the kind of roles she picked for herself. Also, Sridevi has had a strong influence on me.”

Her next, Shakuntala Devi releases on May 8.

‘We give different kinds of upbringing to the son and the daughter. We don’t teach boys how to accept rejection. Later, it turns into ego. In most cases of acid-violence, the boy has faced with rejection from the girl. The first step to stop the crime is to change the upbringing and parents need to do that. Boys need to learn to accept ‘no’ for an answer and realise why consent is important.’

—Vikrant Massey

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has called the PM Narendra Modi government egoistic and “illiterate.”

In his recent Twitter post, Anurag wrote (in Hindi), “The CAA/CAB is not going anywhere. It is impossible for them to take it back because for them, that would mean defeat. This government views everything in terms of victory and defeat. Such is their ego that even if everything gets burned to ashes, Modi can never be wrong. Because illiterate people are like that.”

A few days ago, Kashyap had called PM Modi an “urban Nazi” on social media.

181,06-1-20,Be the change,"Central to Haku Shah’s vision are enduring Gandhian ideas that powered the Indian independence as well as international resistance movements, says Sujata Prasad

Iss Ghat Antar Baag Bagiche, are words evocative of the exceptional oeuvre of Haku Shah, a celebrated Gandhian artist, art historian, photographer, crafts archivist and polemicist, who is the subject of an ongoing exhibition at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art. His death at the age of 84, after a long illness on March 21 last year, has stirred renewed interest in his art practice. His approach predates most of the contemporary theoretical lenses and the razzmatazz of fleeting zeitgeist movements. Central to his vision are enduring Gandhian ideas and values that powered the Indian independence movement, the civil rights movement in the US, the Solidarity Movement in Poland, the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa and several other political and human rights movements across the world.

The retrospective, with its display of terracotta figurines, is a celebratory homage to his passion for collecting and presenting traditional rural and tribal craftsmanship. His life was a crusade for placing India’s economy at the cornerstone of its development strategy. In the words of Kapila Vatsyayan, his eye was discerning, his taste impeccable, and his respect for the creators of art exemplary. “I watched him, both as an artist and a collector, and knew that, despite the challenges and temptations of professional curatorship, here was a man committed to the “earth” and soil of these creations, the human dignity of the creators and the eloquence of the forms they developed as objects, functional and symbolic”. Shah’s exhibition of clay objects, Form and Many Forms of Mother Clay, curated for the Crafts Museum in Delhi pioneered some of the best indigenous curatorial practices as he did his collaborative 1968 exhibition with art historian Dr Stella Kramrisch named Art of Unknown India at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Mentored in equal parts by artist-pedagogue KG Subramanyan, Sankho Chaudhuri and NS Bendre at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda, Shah’s love for rural and tribal art forms received fillip during his association with Pupul Jayakar at the Weavers’ Service Centre, Bombay with which she was closely connected. Seeing his interest in indigenous traditions, she encouraged him to move as research assistant to the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. At that point it was called the National Design Institute, located in the museum complex built by Le Corbusier in Paldi, driven by the ideas of luminaries like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ernst Scheidegger, Hans Gugelot, Armin Hoffmann, Frei Otto and others. Shah thrived in this house of creativity.

As a teacher, Shah mentored generations of students at the National Institute of Design, taught at the School of Architecture and joined the University of California in the spring of 1991 to teach a studio course in Textiles and Design as a distinguished Regents’ professor. He was a conscientious researcher and authored several books and monographs on folk and tribal art, deconstructing the semiotics of rites and rituals embedded in nature and earth with eminent scholars like Eberhard Fischer, Stella Kramrisch, Joan Erikson and Charles and Ray Eames. His book on Votive Terracottas of Gujarat is amongst his most compelling work together with his monograph on Temple Tents for the Mother Goddesses in Gujarat. One of his most seminal contributions was in establishing an ethnographic Tribal Museum at the Gujarat Vidyapith in Ahmedabad. He also set up a Crafts Village in Udaipur.

His own art practice was inseparable from his political beliefs. It was also powered by a refined Sufi poetic sensibility reflected in a small body of work emanating from his collaboration with Shubha Mudgal in an exhibition called Haman Hai Ishq (love is all there is). One also sees his effortless creativity at work in playful experiments with handmade paper called Kalamkhush (the paper that delights the pen). The most resonant work displayed in this unforgettable retrospective is from the Gandhi series, where he has used the semiotics of Gandhian objects to engage with important political and ethical questions, creating a space for Satyagraha:the wilful, peaceful, breaking of laws that are unjust, the most powerful weapon of dissent in a non-violent struggle.

182,06-1-20,Create holistic harmony,"Education would fulfil its noble objective if it imparts values that maintain harmony in the society and create a friendly relationship of man with nature, environment and self, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Looking at the current global political scenario, the demand for harmony between various communities, castes, regional linguistic and other inter-caste groups, is on the top of every nation’s agenda. People are also aware that the absence of harmony leads to waste of energy, money and time as efforts are made to prevent worsening of relations between various antagonistic groups or restore normalcy in law and order if there are clashes between various communities or groups.

Our societal structure is so clearly knit today that a disturbance caused by one factor in one sector, sets waves of disturbance in other sectors of the society also. An act of disharmony, wrought by science, technology, education, art or religious worship, in fact by any aspect of the society’s life can disturb harmony. The forces of disturbance in turn will affect various fields. Disharmony in the form of environmental degradation is the best example of recent times. It is, therefore, essential that all types of institutions and all aspects of an organised society should work together to create holistic harmony, else an incongruous step by one or a desynchronised way by another can disturb the system.

Research has proved that education is one of the most important sectors which can contribute a lot to the well-being and smooth functioning of the society. To create a healthy and prosperous society, in which there is social, political and economic justice, education is essential to enlighten the people on the need to inculcate human values and divine qualities in their life. Currently, this element is neglected in education, as a result of which many highly educated people do not know how to live a peaceful life and face their problems.

It is also found that the present education system does not cultivate the qualities of tolerance, self-control, humility, service and co-operation for the well being of society and responsibility for one’s own actions. Also, students are not taught to value simplicity, honesty, justice, non-violence and fair play. The result is that even after spending so many years in schools, colleges and universities, there is often a lack of gentleness, nobility, sincerity, humanism and an inspiring goal. The society, therefore, may have many educated people yet there may be commotion in legislative bodies, disregard for law, criminal tendencies and unsocial habits.

Therefore, education would fulfill its noble objective if it imparts such values that create harmonious personality and helps to maintain harmony in the society. It will also lead to a harmonious relationship of man with nature, environment and self.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/create-holistic-harmony-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/create-holistic-harmony.html
183,06-1-20,Think small. Find your spot,"Starting too large is the most common mistake made by first-time gardeners. Here are a few tips for them

Another growing season is building momentum with the 2020 seed catalogs and gardeners are drafting plans for new harvests. There’s such a thing as being too enthusiastic, though, especially among novices.

Beginners can achieve their best planting results by thinking small. “Starting too large is the most common mistake made by first-time gardeners,” said Barbara Murphy, a Master Gardener coordinator and horticulturist with University of Maine Cooperative Extension for 23 years.

“Limit yourself to 10 feet by 10 feet. If you grow frustrated because of too many things happening the first year, there’s a good chance you won’t feel like gardening for a second. You can always expand as your skills develop,” says she.

Other tips that beginners can start thinking about now:

Find the right location

You need 12 to 16 hours of sun per day for a vegetable garden, Murphy said. Ornamental gardens aren’t as fussy. Gardens also need a convenient water source and rich, well-drained soils.

Good soil preparation

“It is important to success, but be patient,” said Rosie Lerner, an Extension horticulturist with Purdue University. “Don’t force the soil when it’s wet. Soil structures will compact and get tight. That makes it tough for water and air to move through and greatly inhibits growth,” she added. Squeeze the soil gently in your hand. If it crumbles a bit when squeezed, it’s ready for use. “It can take a long time to get good soil texture, and just minutes to destroy it if you work it while it’s too wet,” Lerner said.

Keep records

“You can learn a lot by recording things. What worked and what didn’t. Put those lessons to use the following year,” Lerner said. For vegetable gardens, choose easy-to-grow plants like leaf lettuce, carrots, zucchini, potatoes, green beans and radishes. Leave more challenging plants like cauliflower, melons, celery and broccoli for another season.

Deal quickly with insects

“Make regular visits to your garden to check for plant pests. Don’t worry about the adults. You want to go after the eggs before they develop into juvenile leaf cutters. Most eggs are on the underside of leaves. Use soapy water and picking or simply remove the infested leaves,” Murphy said. Weeds compete with your plants for nutrients and water. Get rid of them before they go to seed. Mulching retains soil moisture, cools the ground and smothers weeds. Use natural and free materials like shredded leaves, newspaper, grass clippings and sawdust that also enrich the soil over time. Also try to eliminate or ease up on the pesticides. Chemicals don’t discriminate. They kill the beneficial insects along with the bad.

Avoid overcrowding and recruit pollinators

Avoid overcrowding that stresses plants, invites disease and reduces yields. And recruit pollinators by adding clumps of pollen-rich blooms (think daisy-like coneflowers, sunflowers, asters) to a vegetable mix enhances pollination and boosts harvests.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/think-small--find-your-spot-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/think-small--find-your-spot.html

185,06-1-20,Svitolina on right path for Slam glory,"Elina Svitolina believes the progress she made in 2019 will help her achieve her ultimate goal of becoming the first Ukranian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Speaking ahead of the season-opening Brisbane International, the 25-year-old insisted she is ready to take the next step after promising so much over the past five years.

Svitolina has long been touted as a future major champion, but despite reaching a career-high world ranking of three and winning 13 titles on the WTA tour, until 2019 she had never reached the semi-final stage at a Grand Slam.

However, last year she made the semi-finals at both Wimbledon and the US Open and she said this showed she was on the right path.

“Making semi-finals definitely brought me the belief that I could take one step further,” she said.

“I had the chance to play on the biggest stages and that gave me lots of confidence at that particular point.”

Svitolina had a mixed year in 2019. Although she also made the decider at November’s WTA Finals, where she fell to world number one Ashleigh Barty, she also failed to win a title for the first time since 2012.

“I think maybe 2019 was tough because there were more sad moments, I would say. But also, it’s tough to really understand what’s going on because the year is very long,” she said.

“You have to lose almost every single week, so you have to take lots of positives somehow, and that’s, I think, what I learned from the past year, that you have to stay really positive in even bad moments and try to move forward.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/svitolina-on-right-path-for-slam-glory.html
186,06-1-20,I never lost my swing: Irfan Pathan,"Former India pacer Irfan Pathan on Sunday said he never lost his swing, contrary to the general perception at that time, and added blaming then coach Greg Chappell for his downfall was a cover-up.

Pathan, 35, announced his retirement here on Saturday, saying “most players start their India career at 27-28 but I ended up playing my last game at that stage”.

Pathan was 27 when he made his final appearance in 2012. There was also a time when there was speculation over the left-arm pacer’s intention to play all three formats.

“All these discussions…people talking about Greg Chappell they are just covering up. (The discussion that) Irfan was not interested, it was coming from somewhere. All the aura they made that Irfan lost his swing, people need to understand, that you are not going to get the same kind of swing that you get in 10 overs.. I was still getting the swing,” Pathan said.

“People talk about my performance, but my job was different. I was given job to contain because I was bowling first change. I had been told this is your job. I remember getting dropped after winning the game in Sri Lanka in 2008, who gets dropped after winning the game for the country without any reason?” he questioned.

Pathan featured in 29 Tests (1105 runs and 100 wickets), 120 ODIs (1544 runs and 173 wickets) and 24 T20Is (172 runs and 28 wickets).

He also praised his former captains Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble.

“When I came into the Indian team, Ganguly knew I could do well with the new ball in Australia. He eventually gave me the confidence. I think that was the start,” he said.

“When Dravid became the captain, he utilised my potential one step ahead. (He) used me higher in the batting order (when) besides bowling with the new ball,” he said.

“Anil bhai was the kind of senior I was lucky to have alongside Sachin paaji (Tendulkar), who always gave me the right advice.

187,06-1-20,"Actors, filmmakers condemn violence at JNU","Bollywood actors Swara Bhasker, Shabana Azmi, Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub and Taapsee Pannu, and filmmakers Aparna Sen and Hansal Mehta on Sunday condemned the violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and urged Delhi Police to intervene.

Violence broke out at JNU on Sunday night after masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police.

At least 18 people were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). JNU students' union president Aishe Ghosh suffered a head injury.

The Left-controlled JNUSU and the RSS-affiliated ABVP blamed each other for the violence that continued for nearly two hours. Several disturbing videos that show masked people carrying sticks and bats have gone viral on social media.

Swara, whose mother Ira Bhaskar is a professor at the JNU, took to Twitter to appeal to the people on social media to reach the campus ""to pressure the government and Delhi Police"" to control the violence.

""Urgent appeal!!!! To all Delhiites PLS gather in large numbers outside the Main Gate of JNU campus on Baba Gangnath Marg.. To pressure the govt. & #DelhiPolice to stop the rampage by alleged ABVP masked goons on JNU campus,"" the actor captioned the video, adding that she was concerned about her parents' safety who live at the campus.

Commenting on Swara's video, Azmi said she was shocked by the violence and called for immediate action against the perpetrators.

""Is this really happening ? Im not in India and it all seems like a nightmare. 20 Students Admitted To AIIMS As Violence Breaks Out In JNU. Students and Teachers beaten. Reprehensible, Appalling Condemnable. Immediate action must be taken against the perpetrators,"" she tweeted.

Aparna alleged that the JNU students were being beaten up by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) ""goons"".

""How much longer are you going to look the other way? Or r u spineless? Yes I AM a liberal! Yes, I AM secular! And proud to be so if THIS is the alternative. Shame! Shame on ABVP & the police who are aiding & abetting them!"" she tweeted.

Taapsee said it was saddening to see an educational institution ""getting scarred forever"".

She shared a video allegedly showing the situation on campus.

""Such is the condition inside what we consider to be a place where our future is shaped. It's getting scarred for ever. Irreversible damage. What kind of shaping up is happening here, it's there for us to see..."" Taapsee tweeted.

Zeeshan asked people to reach the JNU in large numbers.

""By closing the doors and roads they have given free hand to their goons. Tell your friends and relatives, tell everyone and gather there together,"" the actor said in a tweet.

""Friends in Okhla and Jamia go to Shaheen Bagh. This #JNUAttack has been done to divert attention and they'll surely attack Shaheen Bagh at night,"" he tweeted.

Zeeshan further called for peace amid violence and urged people to exercise patience and take care of their friends.

Director Anurag Kashyap retweeted several purported videos of violence and vandalism from the JNU.

Mehta asked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to intervene.

""Dear @ArvindKejriwal. Can you do something to stop the violence in JNU?"" the filmmaker tweeted.

Writer Kanika Dhillon too asked Kejriwal to step in.

""Sir!!! Pls atleast reach there!!!! Ur presence will help!!!!"" she said.

""Masaan"" fame director Neeraj Ghaywan asked the police to help the students.

""Extremely distressing video from JNU. @DelhiPolice, these are students, the future of our nation, like your own. Help them please!"" Ghaywan wrote.

Filmmaker Vinod Kapri also shared an alleged video from JNU campus.

""This is a horrifying video. At least 30-40 masked goons are vandalising JNU hostel. Delhi Police is nowhere to be seen. This has full political support. TV news channels have shut their eyes,"" Kapri tweeted.

Filmmaker-composer Vishal Bhardwaj also condemned the violence. ""It's shameful and enraging to see what's happening in #JNUViolence,"" he said.

Director Bejoy Nambiar questioned the silence of many in the film fraternity.

""All you silent friends of mine watch this !!! Watch this & then come and talk to me about how concerned you are about the damage to ‘public' property. How is THIS OK ? How can we watch students & teachers being brutally attacked like this and stay quiet ?"" he asked.

""#SOSJNU @DelhiPolice this is NOT OK. JNUSU president has been brutally beaten up. She is severely wounded. Media Please het there @ndtv @BBCIndia #JNU,"" tweeted director Onir.

Actor Richa Chadha said: ""A few months ago JNU gave the world a Nobel laureate. Now JNU teachers and students are being beaten up for protesting a fee hike. World watches.""

""Frightening visuals from #JNU. Praying that the #Delhipolice intervene swiftly and protect the students. Stay safe students. What a scary world we live in,"" wrote actor Siddharth on the microblogging site.

Director Anubhav Sinha tweeted: ""Either this Government is not capable of maintaining law and order or they are complicit...""

Writer Gaurav Solanki called the attack on the varsity ""an act of terror by terrorists"".

Director Anurag Basu said: ""We can't remain mute spectators anymore! #SOSJNU"".

192,06-1-20,SC upholds validity of West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008, clearing the way for appointment of teachers in madrassas in the state.

The top court also upheld the appointment of teachers made by commission constituted under the Act.

A bench of justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit set aside a Calcutta High Court verdict which had held the legislation as unconstitutional and said that appointments made by the madrassa management committees till now will also remain valid in the larger interest.

It upheld the constitutional validity of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008 which mandated that the appointment of teachers in madrassas was to be decided by a commission.

Several petitions were filed in the Calcutta High Court challenging the validity of the law, contending that the government, which funds or provides aid to the minority institutions, can formulate guidelines for appointments of teachers but cannot itself appoint them.

The high court declared the Act unconstitutional, saying it was violative of Article 30 which stated that all minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

The verdict of the high court was eventually challenged in the top court by teachers who were appointed under the new law.

The top court, while agreeing to hear the batch of pleas challenging the high court verdict, had granted them interim relief and directed the state government not to remove them from their jobs till the final order.

In 2018, the top court had allowed the state government to fill the vacant posts subject to final outcome of the case.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-upholds-validity-of-west-bengal-madrasah-service-commission-act-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-upholds-validity-of-west-bengal-madrasah-service-commission-act.html

Carter achieved the feat during his side Canterbury Kings’ win over Northern Knights in New Zealand’s domestic Twenty20 tournament Super Smash.

The 25-year-old left-handed batsman smashed left-arm spinner Anton Devcich six times over the Hagley Oval boundary during his stunning unbeaten knock of 70 off just 29 balls to seal a seven-wicket win for his side while chasing an imposing 220.

Overall, Carter is the seventh player in world cricket to record the feat across all formats in both domestic and international level. He entered the elite list that includes the likes of Gary Sobers, Shastri, Herschelle Gibbs, Yuvraj, Worcestershire’s Ross Whiteley and Afghanistan’s Hazratullah Zazai.

Carter also became only the fourth batsman to achieve the feat in T20 cricket in both domestic and international level.

Karachi: Bangladesh has agreed to play one Test in Pakistan, provided the second match of the ICC World Test Championship is held in Dhaka, a proposal which was rejected by the PCB. A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said that the board has rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) proposal, making it clear that the two Tests were part of Pakistan's home series and must be played there. ""It is strange that the BCB wants Pakistan to play a Test in Bangladesh in return,"" the official said. Bangladesh is due to tour Pakistan from January 18 to play two Tests and three T20 Internationals but the tour is still uncertain after BCB officials said that they will just play the T20 series there and not the Tests.

Sushil Meitei gave the visitors the lead in the 24th minute before Vikram Partap Singh equalised for the hosts three minutes before the end of first half. Arrows head coach Shanmugam Venkatesh retained the majority of his previous line-up, with only two changes in the form of Aman Chetri slotting into the front three ahead of Harmanpreet Singh and Bikash Yumnam starting at the back in place of Saurabh Meher. Hoping for a repeat of their stellar performance against Churchill Brothers, coach Venkatesh stuck to his tried and tested 4-3-3 formation at the Tilak Maidan. NEROCA head coach Gift Raikhan, on the other hand, opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Monaco: Monaco's exciting young Nigerian striker Henry Onyekuru is to spend the rest of the season on loan at Galatasaray, the Ligue 1 club announced on Sunday. It will be the 22-year-old's second loan spell in Turkey as he shone for Galatasaray last season when he was still at English club Everton. He scored 14 goals in 35 appearances for Galatasaray who went on to win the Turkish championship. Monaco, who signed the Nigerian for 17 million euros during the summer, have not included an ‘option to buy' clause in the loan, suggesting that Onyekuru remains a part of their long-term strategy.

196,06-1-20,Poms take charge at Newlands,"A gritty 85 not out from opener Dom Sibley ground down South Africa's bowlers as England took control on the third day of the second Test against South Africa at Newlands.

Sibley, playing in only his fourth Test, came in during the morning session after James Anderson had picked up the last two South African wickets to finish with 5-40 and give England a first innings lead of 46.

By the close, Sibley was still there and England had reached 218 for four, stretching their overall lead to 264.

Sibley's 85, his first Test half-century, came off a painstaking 222 balls in just under six hours and included 13 boundaries.

It was slow going but it consolidated England's advantage after Anderson and Ben Stokes combined to secure an important first innings lead.

Anderson completed his 28th Test five-wicket haul - an England record - and Stokes caught last man Anrich Nortje to set an England Test record of five catches by a fielder.

Zak Crawley made a streaky 25 when England started their second innings, with Sibley making only three in an opening stand of 28, before the day settled into a battle of attrition.

Sibley and Joe Denly (31) used up 33 overs in adding 73 for the second wicket before Denly hooked Nortje to fine leg.

England captain Joe Root was more aggressive as he and Sibley added 116 for the third wicket.

Root made 61 off 98 balls before being caught at slip off Dwaine Pretorius shortly before the close.

The ball that got Root was an exception in deviating from a crack outside off stump that was far more of a factor on the first two days.

Dom Bess, who suffered a golden duck in the first innings, came in as nightwatchman and survived until the last ball of the day when he was adjudged to have gloved a bouncer from Nortje to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, thus collecting a 'pair'.

Those two late wickets marked the high point of the day for the toiling South Africans who will be wary of the potential damage that Stokes and Jos Buttler could inflict on Monday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/poms-take-charge-at-newlands.html
197,06-1-20,Aussies on course of clean sweep,"Lyon bags five as Baggy Greens take 243-run lead against Trans-Tasman rivals at the end of third-day play

Australia took a commanding 243-run lead over plucky New Zealand in the third Test in Sydney on Sunday, looking set for a clean sweep of the series.

The Australians dismissed the Black Caps for 251 to lead by 203 runs on the first innings before batting a second time in a bid to build an overwhelming total with two days remaining.

At stumps on day three, the hosts were 40 without loss with David Warner on 23 and Joe Burns not out 16, and were expected to bat on for some time on the fourth day.

Off-spinner Nathan Lyon captured five for 68 to lead the Australian bowling attack, with Kiwi Test debutant Glenn Phillips top-scoring with a charmed knock of 52.

“We’re in a very good position here,” said Lyon, who has now taken a career 385 Test wickets.

“A lot of work to do in the morning and we have to see what lead we the batsmen want to get to.

“It is pretty special to play here in front of your home crowd, in front of your family and friends. Nice to go up on the honours board.”

Phillips, who only flew in on the eve of the Test as cover for a team weakened by a virus outbreak, was dropped twice and given a reprieve when caught off a no-ball.

Lyon put down the two caught-and-bowled chances when Phillips was on two and 17.

The Kiwi batsman dodged another bullet on 28 when he was caught by Travis Head at deep midwicket only to be recalled when James Pattinson was found to have over-stepped for a no-ball.

Phillips hit a cracking pull shot off Pat Cummins to raise his debut half-century before Cummins got him two balls later, ripping through his defences to take off-stump for 52.

Lyon bowled Will Somerville and Neil Wagner for ducks and fast bowler Matt Henry came out to bat despite fracturing his left hand earlier in the match.

Henry ducked out of the way of a couple of Mitchell Starc thunderbolts directed at his body before he was stumped off Lyon’s bowling to end the New Zealand innings.

It was the longest innings of a disastrous lost series for the Kiwis, bettering the 71 overs they faced in the second innings of the second Test in Melbourne.

The Black Caps lost three wickets in the middle session with the experienced Ross Taylor out lbw to Cummins for 22 in the second over after lunch.

Taylor remains 20 runs away from becoming the highest-scoring New Zealand batsman in Tests, behind Stephen Fleming (7,172).

Wicketkeeper BJ Watling chopped a wide Starc delivery on to his stumps for nine off 30 balls to put his team under more pressure.

Colin de Grandhomme was needlessly run out for 20, taking on Matthew Wade’s throw from the deep to wicketkeeper Tim Paine while attempting a second run.

Lyon grabbed two key wickets in the morning session, removing Melbourne Test centurion Tom Blundell and recalled Jeet Raval.

Raval, who was dropped after twin batting failures as an opener in the first Test in Perth, batted positively at number three before he was leg before wicket to Lyon for 31 off 58 balls.

Tom Latham was out two balls later in the next over from Cummins, done by a fuller delivery and chipping straight to Starc at mid-on.

The new skipper, deputising for the sidelined Kane Williamson, was denied a deserved half-century on 49 in his 133-ball vigil.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aussies-on-course-of-clean-sweep-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aussies-on-course-of-clean-sweep.html
198,06-1-20,Naomi Osaka reveals Beyonce pep talk,"Japanese sensation Naomi Osaka has revealed her excitement at meeting her idol Beyonce, saying the US singer ""smelled expensive"" and gave her a morale-boosting pep talk at a low point last year.

The two-time Grand Slam champion, who will be defending her Australian Open title this month, bumped into Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z while still ""depressed"" after losing in the fourth round at the US Open.

""I met Beyonce and Jay-Z during the off-season. She just smelled expensive and beautiful and she was soft and she hugged me,"" Osaka told the WTA website.

""I was like, this is what heaven is."" The meeting came in the aftermath of Osaka's defeat at Flushing Meadow to Belinda Bencic, which ended her first Grand Slam title defence.

""She was talking to me and she said she was proud of me. I thought, wow, that actually was a really important moment,"" said the 22-year-old, who stunned Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open final.

""I felt really depressed after I lost my match, but I'm thinking about the impact that tennis players -- I don't think we know, I don't think we're aware of all the good that we can do.

""That was kind of an eye-opening thing. Even though it was one of my worst points, to lose -- I wanted to be a defending champion and I lost early -- there's still something really good that came out of that.

""There are some things that I have to remember are out of my control, especially past events. So I just have to put myself in a position to not regret anything.""

Osaka hired a new coach in the off-season, Wim Fissette, having split with Jermaine Jenkins following the US Open, and said she was raring to go after her 2019 season was abruptly cut short by injury at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen.

She is set to play her first match of the year at the Brisbane International against Maria Sakkari on Tuesday.

""I just feel like for me having positive energy and having a clean mental slate is really important, so that's what I did this entire off-season,"" she said.

""I mean, I trained, but I wasn't super pressed on anything. That's just something I had to learn throughout the entire year.

""I feel like 2019 had so many trials and errors and all in all it felt like a very long year, but now that I'm here it feels very compact. It's learning about myself more.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-she-smelled-expensive----naomi-osaka-reveals-beyonce-pep-talk-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/-she-smelled-expensive----naomi-osaka-reveals-beyonce-pep-talk.html
199,06-1-20,"I am different person in terms of how I think about the game, says 'Family Man' Rohit","Rohit Sharma is in a ""great space"" in his life.

India's white-ball vice-captain enjoyed a phenomenal 2019 in which he scored a record 2,442 runs as an opener across three formats and more importantly took up the challenge of being a Test opener with stupendous success.

""I am a different Rohit in terms of how I think. I am in such a great space in my life because of the family that I have -- my wife (Ritika) and daughter (Samaira). I am not worried about what others are talking,"" Rohit told PTI in an exclusive interview looking back at the 12 eventful years of his career in international cricket.

For someone, who has received bouquets and brickbats in equal measure, the 32-year-old is no longer bothered by criticism.

""They (wife and daughter) fill me with love and happiness and I try to stay within that rather than thinking about X, Y or Z making comments about me,"" he said.

""I have actually passed that age to react to someone talking good or bad things about me. Frankly speaking, it doesnt matter anymore.""

A double century on his ""debut"" as Test opener against South Africa gave India the kind of momentum they were desperately looking for after Virender Sehwag's exit from the scene.

But ask Rohit about it and he says, ""Honestly speaking, I stopped thinking about Test matches long time back.""

And the obvious question is why?

""Earlier, I was thinking too much about success in Tests. I would go overboard as to why is this happening, why am I playing that shot. After each Test innings, I would go to our video analyst, sit, watch and then confuse (clutter) my brain further. That wasn't actually the right thing that I was doing,"" recalled one of India's greatest white ball players.

""Thinking too much about technique was not allowing me to enjoy the game. All that was there in my mind was 'Oh I need to do well in Test cricket'. So, before 2018-19 Australia series, I told myself 'Boss whatever has to happen will happen and I am not going to think about technique'.

""At the end of the day, I want to go out there, share a laugh with my mates and enjoy,"" the stylish Mumbaikar revealed.

Many thought that the South Africa series was his last shot at redemption as a Test cricketer but not the man himself.

""If you talk about opening in the SA series, from people's perspective, it was my last chance but I am a sportsman and I can't think like that. If I thought it was my last chance then I wouldn't have scored runs with that mindset.

""You can't allow negative thoughts to creep in when you are playing such a high profile sport,"" he said.

But at the same time, he is realistic enough to admit that he had to grab the opportunity that came his way.

""I know that I am no longer 22 or 23 years old that I will keep getting opportunities in Test matches and can take my place for granted. I know that every time I go out there, I have to put a high price tag on my wicket. I am blessed to get an opportunity that many are waiting for. So, why should I regret worry or think about so many things?""

For Rohit, the success in recent years is because of a shield that he has been able to build around himself to ""shut the noise down"".

""When you play the sport, there is a lot of distraction and noise around you. You need to create an environment around yourself so that none of this bothers you. No idea, vision or sermons will come inside that shield unless you allow it. Let people say good things, bad things, one shouldn't be bothered about it.""

He empathises with the young Rishabh Pant, who has been hounded by the critics for inconsistency.

""In fact, I was telling Pant the same thing. Poor guy is only 21 (22) and people are telling him to score hundreds in every game, do this and do that. I mean cut some slack man. I told Rishabh 'Create a wall and ensure that nobody comes inside. It's your safe-house. People want to talk about you, let them do it outside that wall and you do what you intend to do inside your zone'.

""Who knows it might help Rishabh. It worked for me at least.""

After the ICC World Cup, there were stories about senior players extending their families' stay beyond the designated number of days and Rohit said he felt hurt at families being dragged into it.

""Our families are there to support us, make us feel happy. When all these things were being written about, few of my friends came and told me and believe me or not, I was just laughing.

""But then it went on and on and they dragged my family and that was not on. You talk about me but don't drag my family as they genuinely don't care about anything else. I think even Virat (Kohli) must have felt the same way as families are an important aspect of our lives.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-am-different-person-in-terms-of-how-i-think-about-the-game--says--family-man--rohit-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-am-different-person-in-terms-of-how-i-think-about-the-game--says--family-man--rohit.html

205,06-1-20,Tata-Mistry case: SC likely to hear Tata Sons plea against NCLAT decision on Jan 10,"Tata Sons Private Ltd (TSPL) preferred not to mention in the Supreme Court on Monday its petition challenging the NCLAT decision restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of the Tata group.

The apex court website showed later in the day that the petition is to be listed, tentatively, on January 10.

It also showed that Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd, Cyrus Mistry and other respondents have also filed a caveat that no ex-parte order be passed in the matter.

A lawyer associated with the matter had said earlier that the appeal against the NCALT decision would be mentioned for early listing on reopening of the apex court after the winter break.

The petition was not mentioned however and the lawyer said that ""no decision has been taken yet in this regard"" and instruction from the client is awaited.

The top court reopened on Monday after two weeks of winter break.

The Tatas have submitted that the verdict by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) ""undermined corporate democracy"" and the ""rights"" of its board of directors.

While the petition is pending in the apex court, Mistry came out with a statement on Sunday saying that he is not interested in returning to the Tata Group and the decision was made in the interest of the Group, whose interests are far more important then the interests of any individual.

""To dispel the misinformation campaign being conducted, I intend to make it clear that despite the NCLAT order in my favour, I will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries.

""I will however vigorously pursue all options to protect our rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the thirty year history of a seat at the Board of Tata Sons and the incorporation of the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency at Tata Sons,"" he said.

In the last three years, both in conduct and in their statements to the world at large, Tata Group's leadership has shown scant respect for the rights of minority shareholders, Mistry he said, adding that it is time the Group's management introspects and reflects on its conduct as it embarks on future actions.

""I am humbled by the NCLAT order, which after review of the enormous material on record, recognized the illegal manner in which I was removed and the oppressive and prejudicial conduct of Mr. Tata and other Trustees,"" he said.

TSPL, formerly known as Tata Sons Limited, in its petition, has sought ""setting aside of the impugned judgment in toto"" of NCLAT, alleging it was ""completely inconsistent with the annals of corporate law"" and reflected ""non-appreciation of facts"", which was ""untenable in law"".

The NCLAT, in a big relief to Mistry and Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd, on December 18 restored him as the executive chairman of TSPL and ruled that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the head of the holding company of the USD 110-billion salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.

It held the group's chairman emeritus Ratan Tata's actions against Mistry were oppressive and the appointment of a new chairman was illegal.

It however stayed the operation of its order with respect to Mistry's reinstatement for four weeks to allow TSPL to file an appeal in the top court.

In its appeal, filed through Karanjawala & Co, TSPL sought a stay on NCLAT's verdict as an interim relief.

""In other words, far from putting an end to the alleged acts complained of, the judgment (of the NCLAT) has sown the seeds for a never-ending discord and conflict between the shareholders of the appellant (TSPL), creating a recipe for an unmitigated disaster,"" it said.

The plea raised questions of law and said the order restoring Mistry to his ""original position"" as the executive chairman of TSPL for the ""rest of the tenure"" was illegal as his tenure ""stood extinguished in March 2017"".

The plea termed ""illegal"" NCLAT's declaration that Chandrasekaran's appointment as the chairman of TSPL was wrong and claimed he was appointed ""in accordance with the articles and duly approved by the board and shareholders"".

It alleged the NCLAT granted reliefs to Mistry which were not even sought.

""Respondent nos 1 (Cyrus Investment Pvt Ltd) and 2 specifically pleaded before the NCLAT that they are not seeking reinstatement of Mistry. The tenure of Mistry as the chairman and director of Tata Sons expired in March 2017 and thus, for good reason, the respondents did not seek such reinstatement,"" the plea said.

""Mistry was replaced as the chairman of Tata Sons on October 24, 2016, by the majority of its board of directors (all directors voted in favour of the replacement, except one who abstained from voting and the remaining one was Mistry himself) for loss of confidence and the impugned judgment, by restoring Mistry to the position as chairman, has undermined corporate democracy and rights of the board of directors,"" the plea said.

It said Mistry was removed following the procedure applicable to corporate appointments, as envisaged in law.

The plea alleged it was nobody's case that Mistry's removal had resulted in any serious prejudice being caused to the working of Tata Sons and it ""violated law or any contract"".

Mistry, scion of the wealthy Shapoorji Pallonji family, had in December 2012 succeeded Ratan Tata as the executive chairman of Tata Sons, a post that also made him the head of all Tata group-listed firms such as Tata Power and Tata Motors.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tata-mistry-case--sc-likely-to-hear-tata-sons-plea-against-nclat-decision-on-jan-10-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tata-mistry-case--sc-likely-to-hear-tata-sons-plea-against-nclat-decision-on-jan-10.html
206,06-1-20,NRC is mischievous plan to divide India: Chidambaram,"Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Monday dubbed the National Register of Citizens a ""sinister and mischievous plan"" to divide the country and alleged that the NRC-CAA-NPR exercise is part of the RSS-BJP plan to push its ""divisive"" agenda of a 'Hindu Rashtra'.

Terming the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) ""patently discriminatory"", he said three neighbouring countries have been included, while Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan excluded and some minority groups, including Muslims, kept out of its ambit.

The people who will be directly affected are the Muslims of India, Chidambaram said, adding that all other religious groups, even if excluded under the NRC, will be included under the CAA and it is only the Muslims who will be identified as illegal migrants under the NRC and excluded under the CAA.

""Naturally, there is widespread fear and uncertainty among the Muslims of India, the former Union finance minister said.

He also clarified that there is a world of difference between the National Population Register of 2010 and the NPR of 2020 and it must be opposed after a ""failed"" Assam NRC-like exercise.

""The NRC is a sinister and mischievous plan to divide India. Under the NRC, every person residing in India has to prove that he is a citizen of India. In modern, liberal democracies, citizenship is based on the principle of territoriality,"" he told reporters.

""Don't compare 2010 and 2020. 2010 and 2020 are like chalk and cheese. 2010 was cheese, 2020 is chalk,"" he said.

Chidambaram said if the state suspects that a person is not a citizen, the burden of proving that the person is not a citizen lies on the state. On the contrary, under the NRC, the burden of proving that he is a citizen falls upon the person concerned, he said.

""This is contrary to the basic tenets of a democracy. It is this perverse burden of proof that was applied in Assam: the result was that 19,06,657 people were identified as illegal migrants or stateless persons. Most of them belong to the poorest and vulnerable sections of society. No one knows what their fate will be,"" the senior Congress leader said.

The NPR of 2020 with additional fields of information is a disguised attempt to carry out an Assam NRC-like exercise throughout the country and must be ""stoutly opposed"", he told reporters.

""The NRC-CAA-NPR exercise is part of the RSS-BJP plan to push its divisive agenda of a Hindu Rashtra. The Constitution of India embodies the values of equality, equal protection of the laws, secularism, humanism and constitutional morality. In order to protect these values, every patriotic Indian has the duty to fight the pernicious doctrine of Hindu Rashtra,"" Chidambaram said.

The Congress leader said that is why thousands of people, especially students, are on the streets to save the idea of India and protect the Constitution given to us by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Babasaheb Ambedkar.

""Abraham Lincoln saved the Constitution of the United States in 1865, our task and our duty are not different,"" he noted.

Chidambaram said the widespread protests have forced the government to backtrack on what the home minister and other ministers had said in Parliament on many occasions, the most recent being December 9 in Lok Sabha and December 11 in Rajya Sabha.

""The government has therefore come up with the idea of National Population Register (NPR) and has attempted to liken it with the census-related exercise undertaken in 2010. There is a world of difference between NPR 2010 and NPR 2020. NPR 2010 was conducted in a few states when there was no controversy about NRC and without the unhappy experience of the Assam NRC,"" he said.

He said earlier there was no CAA looming large and the NPR 2010 gathered data in respect of only 15 fields while to the contrary, NPR 2020 will be conducted all over the country.

Chidambaram said it will be done in the background of the ""disastrous experience of the Assam NRC and the discriminatory CAA"", and the form that will be used in NPR 2020 will have many additional fields -- ""all mischievous and irrelevant to a census"".

""NPR 2020 will ask for information on the last place of residence, the place of birth of the parents, voter identity, passport number, driver's licence, PAN and Aadhaar. Who added these additional fields and why? In terms of text and context, NPR 2010 and NPR 2020 are very different. NPR 2020 with the additional fields is a disguised attempt to do an Assam NRC-like exercise throughout the country and therefore, it must be stoutly opposed,"" the Congress leader said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nrc-is-mischievous-plan-to-divide-india--chidambaram-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nrc-is-mischievous-plan-to-divide-india--chidambaram.html

210,06-1-20,11 Mumbai terror attack: Uddhav,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday compared the JNU violence with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, and said students were feeling ""unsafe"" in the country.

""The attack on JNU students on Sunday night reminded me of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack. I will not allow anything like JNU to happen here in Maharashtra...Students are feeling unsafe in the country,"" he told reporters here.

Terming the masked attackers at JNU as ""cowards"", Thackeray said their identity should be revealed.

""If Delhi Police fail to find out perpetrators of the attack, then they will also be in the dock,"" he said.

Violence broke out in JNU on Sunday night as masked men armed with sticks and rods attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police which conducted a flag march.

At least 28 people, including JNU Students' Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, were injured as chaos reigned on the campus for nearly two hours.

Eyewitnesses alleged that the attackers entered the premises when a meeting was being held by JNU Teachers' Association over the issue of violence on the campus, and assaulted students and professors. They also barged into three hostels.

Video footage aired by some TV channels showed a group of men, who were brandishing hockey sticks and rods, moving around a building.

In a statement, she accused the Modi government of seeking to stifle and subjugate every voice of dissent and said Sunday's ""bone chilling"" attack on students and teachers in JNU was a grim reminder of that.

Gandhi alleged that everyday campuses and colleges are raided across India, either by the police or lumpen elements with support of the BJP government.

216,06-1-20,Ugly face of state at JNU,"JNUSU prez, gen secy, students, teachers hurt in ABVP-JNUSU clash; police called in after masked miscreants go berserk on campus

Several students, including Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Students Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, general secretary Satish Chandra and teachers, were injured after a violent clash broke out between JNUSU and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) members on the campus on Sunday.

The clash took place during a public meeting organised by the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA). Sources said the violence started around 5 pm near Sabarmati tea point in the campus, where there had been minor clashes over the issue of semester registration under the revised rules.

Violence broke out as masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police.

JNUSU said many students were injured in stone pelting by ABVP members. The Left-controlled JNUSU and the ABVP blamed each other for the violence that continued for nearly two hours.

The ABVP alleged that its members were ""brutally"" attacked by students affiliated to Left student organisations SFI, AISA and the DSF. “Around 25 students have been seriously injured in this attack and there is no information as to the whereabouts of 11 students. Masked goons of Left entered the JNU today and beat up the students who went for registration,” the outfit said.

JNUSU alleged that ABVP members attacked students who were peacefully protesting against massive fee hike in JNU. “On Saturday, a mob led by Ritwik Raj who is councillor from School of International Studies belonging to ABVP attacked students. Then they attacked JNUSU president and general secretary Aishe and Satish, and other students. Dripta’s, a 1st year MA student, leg was broken due to ABVP violence. Today they shamelessly attacked students again injuring a student from JNU’s Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health,” said JNUSU in a statement.

JNU Professor Sucherta Sen was thrashed and was taken to AIIMS for the treatment, said students. Several photos and videos of the incidents were doing rounds on social media. In a video, Aishe — who suffered a head injury — said she was attacked by goons wearing masks.

JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar said, “There is a law and order situation on the JNU campus. Masked miscreants armed with sticks roamed around, damaging property and attacking people. The JNU administration called the police to maintain law and order. This is the moment to remain calm and alert.”

217,06-1-20,At least two injured in Jakarta building collapse,"A five-storey building in Jakarta partly collapsed Monday morning, injuring at least two people who were taken to hospital, authorities said.

TV images showed about half the building on Jakarta's western side had caved in with concrete and other debris lying on the road. Rescue officials were seen carrying people out on stretchers.

The structure is a mixed residential-commercial space with a convenience store on the ground floor and small rental units on the upper floors.

""The upper floors of the building were empty, while the second floor was a warehouse and a place for employees to rest,"" West Jakarta police chief Audie Latuheru told reporters.

""The employees ran away when they heard creaking sounds. The two injured people were outside of the building when the accident happened,"" he added.

Indonesia's national search and rescue agency said three people were injured.

Initial media reports said eight people were wounded, but police later said that figure included those evacuated from the building.

It was not immediately clear what caused the accident or if it was connected to the flooding sparked by torrential rain in the capital region last week that left more than 60 people dead.

The search and rescue agency said it appeared that the downpours may have played a role.

""We found evidence of flooding on the rooftop and the third and fourth floors had no water drainage system,"" said Budi Purnama, national operations director for Indonesia's search and rescue agency.

""Water had seeped through the walls... The structure couldn't hold it any longer."" Police and eyewitness said the accident started shortly after 9:00 am local time (0200 GMT).

""The building just suddenly collapsed,"" eyewitness Ridwan Ria told AFP.

""There was a thundering noise and it happened very quickly. In seconds the building had collapsed.

""There was no sound or weird noise beforehand,"" the 60-year-old shop owner added.

Another witness said there was water dripping from the ceiling of the building's shop on Sunday.

""I noticed since yesterday that something was wrong,"" the witness, identified as Juni, told local TV.

""I went to the store yesterday and saw the place was damp with water dripping from the ceiling."" Police told AFP that another witness, identified as a convenience store employee, said the building had started leaning to one side two years ago.

Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.

In 2018, a group of teenagers practising for a dance and music show were among seven killed when the building they were in collapsed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta.

The same year, at least 75 people were injured when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia's stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/at-least-two-injured-in-jakarta-building-collapse-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/at-least-two-injured-in-jakarta-building-collapse.html
218,06-1-20,"5 dead, dozens hospitalized in Pennsylvania Turnpike crash","A deadly crash involving a passenger bus and multiple other vehicles on the Pennsylvania Turnpike left at least five dead and dozens injured early Sunday, shutting down a large portion of the highway.

Officials said at least 60 people, ranging in age from 7 to 52 years old, were hospitalized with unknown injuries after the crash that happened at 3:40 am in Westmoreland County, around 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Pittsburgh.

Photos from the scene show a mangled collision of multiple vehicles including an overturned bus, two tractor-trailers, passenger cars and a smashed FedEx truck that left packages sprawled along the highway.

The images appear to show the bus is an Ohio Coach vehicle. The company runs an express bus service that travels between New York City, Ohio and Kentucky, according to its website. Messages were left with the company seeking comment.

FedEx did not provide any other details besides that they are cooperating with authorities.

There were 25 victims transported to Excela Frick Hospital in Mt Pleasant, Excela Health spokeswoman Robin Jennings said. Nine of those patients are under the age of 18.

At least one of the 25 victims initially sent to Excela was transported to a nearby trauma center and the rest of the patients' conditions were not known, Jennings said.

Information about what caused the accident was not immediately available, and the National Transportation Safety Board investigators were called to the scene. The National Weather Service forecast for Westmoreland County early Sunday listed light unknown precipitation and an air temperature just below freezing.

Pennsylvania Turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said it was ""premature"" to say if weather was a factor in the crash. He added that a portion of the turnpike will likely be closed for the rest of the day, DeFebo said.

The Tribune-Review reported that Angela Maynard, a tractor-trailer driver from Kentucky, said the roads were wet from snow but not especially icy. Maynard was traveling eastbound on the turnpike when she came upon the crash site and called 911.

""It was horrible,"" she told the newspaper. She saw lots of smoke but no fire. She and her co-driver found one person trapped in their truck and another lying on the ground.

""I tried to keep him occupied, keep talking, until medical help arrived,"" Maynard said. ""He was in bad shape. He was floating in and out of consciousness.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/5-dead--dozens-hospitalized-in-pennsylvania-turnpike-crash-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/5-dead--dozens-hospitalized-in-pennsylvania-turnpike-crash.html
219,06-1-20,Iran says to forego 'limit' on nuclear enrichment centrifuges,"Iran on Sunday announced its fifth step back from a nuclear deal saying it will forego the ""limit on the number of centrifuges"", amid mounting tensions with the United States.

In a statement, Tehran said it would continue cooperating ""as before"" with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the implementation of the nuclear deal.

The announcement came after a US drone strike Friday killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, sparking fury in Iran which has vowed to avenge his death.

The nuclear accord between Iran and the United Nations Security Council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany was agreed in 2015.

It has been hanging by a thread since the US withdrawal in May 2018, despite efforts to salvage it led by the three European nations that remain parties to the deal along with China and Russia.

On Saturday, France urged Iran to stick to the landmark 2015 nuclear accord. ""France fully shares with Germany the central objective of de-escalation and preservation of the Vienna (nuclear) accord,"" Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.

220,06-1-20,At least two rockets hit near US embassy in Baghdad: witnesses,"Two rockets hit near the US embassy in Iraq's capital Sunday, witnesses told AFP, hours after the ambassador was summoned over a US strike that killed top Iraqi and Iranian commanders.

Sunday's attack was the second night in a row that the Green Zone was hit and the 14th time over the last two months that US installations have been targeted.

A third rocket simultaneously hit a family home outside the Green Zone, wounding four, medical sources told AFP.

Ties between Iraq and the US have deteriorated after an American drone attack Friday on the Baghdad international airport that killed Iran's Major General Qasem Soleimani and top Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

The precision strike came just days after a pro-Iran mob attacked the US embassy in Baghdad.

In response on Sunday, Iraq's parliament called on the government to oust US and other foreign troops from the country.

Some 5,200 US soldiers are stationed across Iraqi bases to support local troops preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State jihadist group.

They are deployed as part of the broader international coalition, invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help fight IS.

Sunday's rocket attack came hours after a deadline by a hardline group in Iraq's Hashed al-Shaabi military force, which has close ties to Iran, for Iraqi security forces to ""get away"" from US troops at joint bases across Iraq.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/at-least-two-rockets-hit-near-us-embassy-in-baghdad--witnesses-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/at-least-two-rockets-hit-near-us-embassy-in-baghdad--witnesses.html

222,06-1-20,Trump warns Iran of 'major retaliation' in case of attack,"US President Donald Trump has warned Iran of ""major retaliation"" if Tehran carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani and hinted at striking its cultural sites.

His statement came hours after Iran announced it will no longer abide by the limits contained in the 2015 landmark nuclear deal.

Maj Gen Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Soleimani's killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US.

Trump, on his way to the White House from Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after spending his Christmas and New Year vacation, told reporters abroad Air Force One: ""If it happens it happens. If they do anything there will be major retaliation"".

""They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way,"" Trump said in response to a question.

Iran on Sunday announced its fifth step back from the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, saying it would not observe the nuclear deal's restrictions on fuel enrichment, on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on its research and development activities.

In a statement, Tehran, however, said it would continue cooperating ""as before"" with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the implementation of the nuclear deal.

Meanwhile, Trump spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

""The two leaders discussed the current situation in Iraq and Iran and reaffirmed the close alliance between the two countries,"" the White House said.

On Saturday night, Trump warned that the US will target 52 sites in Iran some of which are ""at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture"" if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.

Responding to Trump's remarks, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said targeting cultural sites was a 'war crime'.

Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed a revenge against the killing of his general, saying ""severe revenge awaits the criminals"" behind the attack.

Soleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran behind the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the Ayatollah Khamenei and he was hailed as a heroic national figure.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-warns-iran-against-retaliation--threatens-cultural-sites-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-warns-iran-of--major-retaliation--in-case-of-attack.html
223,06-1-20,2 more missing in Australian wildfires as rain brings relief,"Two more people are missing in remote parts of New South Wales state as rain and cooler temperatures brought some measure of relief Monday to Australian communities battling wildfires.

But the rain was also making it challenging for fire crews to complete strategic burns as they tried to prepare for higher temperatures that have been forecast for later in the week.

The wildfires have so far scorched an area twice the size of the U.S. State of Maryland. They have killed at least 24 people and destroyed about 2,000 homes.

More than 135 bushfires were still burning across Australia's most populous state, including almost 70 that were uncontained.

The Rural Fire Service is warning the rain won't put out the largest and most dangerous blazes before conditions deteriorate again this week.

Australia's capital, Canberra, had the worst air quality of any major city in the world on Monday morning.

The Department of Home Affairs, which is responsible for coordinating the country's response to disasters, told all non-critical staff to stay home because of the abysmal air quality.

""With the more benign weather conditions it presents some wonderful relief for everybody, the firefighters, the emergency services personnel, but also the communities affected by these fires,"" Shane Fitzsimmons, the Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told reporters.

“But it also presents some real challenges when it comes to implementing tactical and strategic back-burns and other techniques to try and bring these fires under control.” New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that there was no room for complacency.

“Unfortunately, overnight, it's become apparent that we have two people unaccounted for in New South Wales,” she said at a news conference, adding she still held out hope for some good news to emerge about them.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under criticism for his response to the fires. He said this week that there has been plenty of blame thrown around, but that the commentary has not been productive.

Morrison announced on Saturday he would dispatch 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists to help battle the fires. He also committed 20 million Australian dollars ($14 million) to lease firefighting aircraft from overseas.

But the moves did little to tamp down the criticism that he had been slow to act, even as he has downplayed the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes.

Australians know to expect summer wildfires. But the blazes arrived early this year, fed by drought and the country's hottest and driest year on record.

Scientists say there's no doubt man-made global warming has played a major role in feeding the fires, along with factors like very dry brush and trees and strong winds.

Morrison, chided for past remarks minimizing the need to address climate change, has deflected criticism while trying to change his tone.

He has faced widespread criticism for taking a family vacation in Hawaii at the start of the wildfire crisis, as well as for his sometimes distracted approach as the disaster has escalated and his slowness in deploying resources.

His handling of the deployment of reservists also came in for criticism. Fitzsimmons, who is leading the fight in New South Wales, said he learned of the deployment through media reports.

""It is fair to say it was disappointing and some surprise to hear about these things through public announcements in the middle of what was one of our worst days this season, with the second-highest number of concurrent emergency warning fires ever in the history of New South Wales,"" he said.

Morrison was also forced to defend a video posted on social media Saturday that promoted the deployment of reservists and the government's response to the wildfires.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/2-more-missing-in-australian-wildfires-as-rain-brings-relief-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/2-more-missing-in-australian-wildfires-as-rain-brings-relief.html
224,06-1-20,Sikh youth shot in Pak,"India condemns ‘targeted killing’ of Sikh community member in Peshawar; 25-year-old man was shopping for his wedding

Two days after an attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan’s Punjab province by a Muslim mob, a Sikh minority community member Ravinder Singh was on Sunday murdered in Peshawar by an “unidentified” gunman,

leading to a strong protest from India which condemned the “targeted killing” of the young Sikh man.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Pakistan should stop “prevaricating” and take immediate action to apprehend and give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.

Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal condemned the killing and tweeted, “A day after mob attacked our holy shrine #GurdwaraNankanaSahib, this brutal murder of Sikh youth in Peshawar shows the extent of persecution minorities face in Pak. I urge PM @narendramodi ji to imm take up the issue with @ImranKhanPTI & ensure the safety of Sikh brethren there.”

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also tweeted, “Shocked & anguished over killing of Sikh youth Ravinder Singh in Pakistan, coming on heels of Nankana Sahib Attack. Imran Khan govt must ensure thorough investigation and strict punishment for the culprits. This is the time to act on what you preach.”

The incident involving killing of 25-year-old Sikh man comes two days after a mob attacked, desecrated and vandalised the most revered gurdwara at Nankana Sahib. The victim Ravinder Singh was the brother of Public News anchor Harmeet Singh. He was shot dead in Peshawar by an unidentified man, according to media reports.

Ravinder was a resident of Shangla district at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was in Peshawar for shopping ahead of his planned wedding. His Peshawar visit came soon after he returned home from his Malaysia visit. After killing him, the murderer made a phone call to Ravinder’s family, a media report said quoting the Peshawar police.

“India strongly condemns the targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar that follows the recent despicable vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurdwara Sri Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib and the unresolved case of abduction, forced conversion and marriage of a Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur,” the MEA said. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Pakistan should stop “prevaricating” and take immediate action to apprehend and give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.

“India strongly condemns the targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar that follows the recent despicable vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurdwara Sri Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib and the unresolved case of abduction, forced conversion and marriage of a Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur,” the MEA said. It said the Government of Pakistan should act in defence of their own minorities instead of “preaching sermons” about it to other countries. India had on Friday strongly condemned vandalism at the revered Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and called upon the neighbouring country to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

The External Affairs Ministry said members of the minority Sikh community in Pakistan have been subjected to acts of violence at the holy city of Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev.

The MEA said these reprehensible actions followed the forcible abduction and conversion of a Sikh girl who was kidnapped from her home in the city of Nankana Sahib in August last year.

According to media reports, a mob attack took place at the shrine where the Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev was born.

Reports suggested that hundreds of angry Muslims pelted the Sikh pilgrims visiting Nankana Sahib with stones on Friday. The mob was led by the family of a man who had allegedly abducted a Sikh teenager from her home last August.

Addressing a meeting of Delhi BJP workers in New Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah attacked Pakistan for “terrorising” Sikhs as he referred to a recent attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by a violent mob in Pakistan and asked Opposition leaders to open their eyes to atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.

“This is an answer to all those opposing the CAA. Tell me if these Sikhs who were attacked the other day in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib will not come to India, then where they will go?” he asked.

The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains and Parsis who had arrived in India by December 31, 2014 from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution.

The Opposition has also come out strongly against the Pakistan authorities for failing to prevent the attack. “The attack on Nankana Sahab is reprehensible and must be condemned unequivocally. Bigotry is a dangerous, age-old poison that knows no borders. Love + Mutual Respect + Understanding is its only known antidote,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Saturday.

Jammu & Kashmir-based All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee chairman Jagmohan Singh Raina said in a statement on Sunday condemned the attack on Nankana Sahib Gurudwara in Pakistan and demanded an immediate probe to fix responsibility.

“Some elements in Pakistan want to give trouble to minorities including Sikhs. An immediate probe would fix the responsibility following which action can be taken against the culprits,”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sikh-youth-shot-in-pak.html
225,06-1-20,"Vandalism at Nankana Sahib against my vision, says Imran","Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday condemned the recent incident of vandalism at the Nankana Sahib, saying it goes against his “vision” and the Government will show “zero tolerance” against those involved in it.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born. According to media reports, a violent mob had attacked the Gurdwara and pelted it with stones on Friday. A team of police had to intervene briskly to control the situation.

Breaking his silence on the incident, Khan said that there is a “major difference between the condemnable Nankana incident and the ongoing attacks across India on Muslims and other minorities”.

“The former is against my vision & will find zero tolerance & protection from the govt incl police & judiciary (sic),” he tweeted, referring to the Nankana Sahib incident. Khan claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “vision supports minorities oppression and the targeted attacks against Muslims.” He also alleged that the Indian police, supported by the Government, are leading attacks against Muslims.

India has strongly condemned vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan Government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

On Saturday, Indian leaders cutting across party lines and various outfits condemned the mob attack on the historic Gurdwara, terming it as “cowardly” and “shameful”. Hundreds of protesters thronged the streets near the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi demanding that Islamabad provide adequate security to Sikh shrines and community members there.

Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex body which manages Sikh shrines in India, said it will send a four-member delegation to Pakistan to take stock of the situation and urged the Pakistan Government to take stringent action against the culprits who attacked the gurdwara — one of the holiest sites in Sikhism.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office on Friday rejected the media reports that the Gurdwara Nanakana Sahib was desecrated in a mob attack, saying the birthplace of founder of Sikhism remains “untouched and undamaged” and the “claims of destruction” of one of the holiest Sikh shrines are “false”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vandalism-at-nankana-sahib-against-my-vision--says-imran-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/vandalism-at-nankana-sahib-against-my-vision--says-imran.html
226,06-1-20,"RaGa, Priyanka instigated riots, misled people: Shah","Assures minority that they will not lose citizenship as CAA has no such provision

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday accused Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of instigating “riots” by “misleading” people on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and sought to reassure Muslims, saying the law has no provision about taking away citizenship of minorities.

BJP launched a ‘Jan Jagran’ (public awareness) campaign to contact three crore families to counter the Opposition’s campaign against the CAA and inform the masses about its features. While Shah led the drive in the national Capital, other top party leaders like Rajnath Singh, JP Nadda and Nitin Gadkari were in different parts of the country as part of the campaign, which will end on January 15. As part of door to door campaign, Shah visited homes in Lajpat Nagar here and talked to people about the benefits of the amended citizenship law. He also distributed literature on the subject and urged them to go through it.

The ruling party also launched a toll free number to seek people’s support on the amended Citizenship Act, and asserted that it has undertaken a positive exercise to spread awareness about the law. The number, however, led to some controversy. Shah clarified that rumours were being spread about the number and noted that it belonged to his party and not to Netflix. The party later held a press conference to slam those spreading confusion over it. The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains and Parsis who had arrived in India by December 31, 2014 from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution.

While the Modi Government has asserted that it has so far not discussed the proposal for National Register of Citizens, NDA ally JD (U) general secretary Pavan Varma has asked party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the “divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme”, saying this has “nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence”.

Addressing a meeting of BJP workers in Delhi, Shah attacked Pakistan for “terrorising” Sikhs as he referred to a recent attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by a violent mob in Pakistan and asked Opposition leaders to open their eyes to atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country.

“This is an answer to all those opposing the CAA. Tell me if these Sikhs who were attacked the other day in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib will not come to India, then where they will go?” he asked.

“I want to tell brothers and sisters from the minority that none of them can lose their citizenship because the CAA has no provision about taking it away,” Shah said.

Shah also claimed that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra extended her support to rioters by saying that she will visit houses of those who carried out riots. Shah said Opposition parties have become habituated to the “politics of opposition and vote bank” and referred to their stand against measures like the law against triple talaq among Muslim men and nullification of Article 370. They also opposed construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shah said.

Congress leader Rajeev Satav hit back at Shah over his allegation that Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra instigated riots by misleading people over the amended Citizenship Act, as he raked up the BJP leader’s internment due to his alleged involvement in a criminal case. Shah was later discharged from the case. The entire country knows which party runs the “vote for riots factory”, Satav said.

Noting that vulgar claims are also being made, such as people can speak to lonely girls by dialing this number, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the exercise should not be reduced to ridicule.

Meanwhile, in an open letter to the Bihar Chief Minister, Varma expressed his surprise at the “unilateral” announcement of Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who is from the BJP, that the National Population Register (NPR) exercise will be carried out in the State between May 15 and 28 despite Kumar’s stand against the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The JD (U) leader has been critical of his party’s decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, and it has now become a law following its passage in both Houses.

JD (U) vice president Prashant Kishor has also spoken strongly against the CAA and said this, in combination with the NRC, can turn into a “lethal combo in the hands of the Government to systematically discriminate and even prosecute people based on religion.”

In his letter, Varma said the CAA-NRC combine is a direct attempt to divide Hindus and Muslims, and to create social instability.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/raga--priyanka-instigated-riots--misled-people--shah-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/raga--priyanka-instigated-riots--misled-people--shah.html
227,06-1-20,"Will hit 52 spots if you strike back, Trump warns Tehran","President Donald Trump has warned Iran that the US has identified 52 possible targets in the country and will hit it harder than ever before if Tehran, which has vowed “severe revenge”, carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani.

Maj Gen Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a US drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Soleimani’s killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US.

On Saturday night, Trump warned that the US will target 52 sites in Iran some of which are “at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture” if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.

“Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters,” Trump tweeted.

“He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years,” he said.

“Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!” Trump said.

Within 10 hours, Trump issued another warning and said the US would hit Iran harder than ever before if Tehran retaliates. “They (Iran) attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!” Trump said in a past-mid night tweet amidst remarks of retaliation coming from Tehran.

“The US just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...And without hesitation!” Trump said in another tweet.

Responding to Trump’s remarks, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said targeting cultural sites was a ‘war crime’. “Having committed grave breaches of int’l law in Friday’s cowardly assassinations, @realdonaldtrump threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS; Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME; Whether kicking or screaming, end of US malign presence in West Asia has begun (sic),” Zarif tweeted, referring to the principles which form the norms of international law.

“Those masquerading as diplomats and those who shamelessly sat to identify Iranian cultural & civilian targets should not even bother to open a law dictionary,” the top Iranian diplomat said.

Soleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran behind the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the Ayatollah Khamenei and he was hailed as a heroic national figure.

229,06-1-20,Women take more sugar than men: Reports,"The average intake of added sugar is more among women than in men said a survey report on Monday.

A survey was undertaken by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)- National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad and sponsored by the International Life Sciences Institute -India (ILSI-India).

According to the survey, women take around 20.2 grams of added sugar in a day while men's intake of added sugar is 18.7 grams per day.

The other significant finding of the study was that the mean intake of added sugar among metro cities of India, measured in grams per day, was highest in Mumbai and least in Hyderabad.

Prof. P K Seth, Chairman, ILSA-India said, ""the survey shows population of Mumbai and Ahmedabad with their average intake level of added sugar at 26.3 grams and 25.9 grams per day has a much higher intake than their counterparts in Delhi (23.2 grams/ day), Bengaluru (19.3 grams day), Kolkata (17.1 grams per day) and Chennai (16.1 grams per day).""

The joint initiative of ICMR-INN and ILSI India is the first of its kind that provides information on added sugar consumption of the city dwellers in seven major metro cities of India. At a time, the country is facing malnutrition on account of over and undernutrition along with micronutrient malnutrition, the study is of considerable importance to India to help prevent non communicable diseases (NCDs), which are engaging considerable attention of the government. National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) has collated the dietary data from 16 major states during 2015-16 and are-coded recipe-wise and metro city -wise to arrive at the conclusion.

The findings also revealed that the average daily intake of Aadded sugar in all metro cities was 19.5 grams per day, lower than the ICMR recommended level of 30 grams per day. The average energy intake through added sugar by all the states was 5.1%, said the report.In Mumbai, the energy through added sugar was found at the highest level (6.6%) followed by Delhi (6.1%), Ahmedabad (5.9%), Hyderabad (5.4%) Bengaluru (4.1%), Chennai (3.9%) and Kolkata (3.5%).

The survey also measured the intake of added sugar by age groups. In general, adults and elderly people were consuming slightly higher sugar than the younger ones. The highest intake of sugar was observed among older adults, 36-59 years age group was 20.5 grams per day, followed by elderly ( greater than 60 years) 20.3 grams per day.

The adolescents consumed 19.9 grams per day) and younger adults ( in the age group of A18-35 years) were consuming 19.4 grams per day, almost the same as that of adolescents. The school children and pre-school children were consuming 17.6 grams per day and 15.6 grams per day added sugar respectively.

The study also measured sugar consumption by community, level of literacy, occupation, activity status and by the diet intake.

Trump who ordered the killing of Soleimani without giving prior information to Congressional leaders, said in the dramatic tweet on Sunday that he was not legally required to notify Congress.

""These media posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any US person or target, the United States will quickly and fully strike back, and perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless,"" the President tweeted.

Yale Law School Professor Oona Hathaway tweeted: ""This tweet threatens to break several laws. The President cannot notify Congress under the War Powers Resolution by tweet"".

In an earlier tweet, Trump threatened the destruction of 52 Iranian targets, including cultural sites.

""Wait, when he says 'These Media Posts'..... Is he talking about his Tweets? So is he too scared or lazy to talk to Congress,"" replied a user.

Under the ""War Powers Act"" of 1973, the US President is required to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying US military assets into combat, said media reports.

Soleimani, 63, who was killed in the January 3 US drone strike was the elite Quds Force chief in charge of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operations outside Iran, and has been on the ground in Syria and Iraq supervising militias backed by Tehran.

Trump has used Twitter to issue surprise orders, announcements, and even threats against other nations like North Korea.

In 2018, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via a tweet.

Mendes also walked away with the best director trophy, defeating Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.

Phoenix was also a surprise winner at the Golden Globes in the best actor in a motion picture - drama category, which many thought would go to Adam Driver for his role in ""Marriage Story"".

Pitt took home the best supporting actor trophy for his performance as a gruff stuntman with secrets in ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"".

In his expletive-filled acceptance speech, Phoenix, known for being notoriously moody, acknowledged that he can be ""a pain in the ***"". He also called out Hollywood to walk the talk on voting and climate change.

""It's great to vote but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves and make changes and sacrifices in our own lives. I hope that we can do that we don't have to take private jets to Palm Springs sometimes or back, please,” he said.

The situation has also deteriorated in Iraq, where lawmakers have called for the 5,200 US soldiers deployed there to leave.

NATO maintains a training mission in Iraq, preparing local forces to take on Islamic State group extremists, but this would be in doubt if coalition forces pull out.

240,06-1-20,Iran 'offers $80mn bounty for Donald Trump',"Iran has offered an $80 million bounty on US President Donald Trump for the death of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in an American drone strike, a media report said.

During the televised funeral procession of the top Iranian, official state broadcasters said on Sunday $1 would be tabled for every Iranian in the country, with the cash going to whoever killed the US President, mirror.co.uk said in the report.

""Iran has 80 million inhabitants. Based on the Iranian population, we want to raise $80 million which is a reward for those who get close to the head of President Trump,"" it was announced.

The January 3 US drone attack ordered by Trump killed Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy chief of Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces.

The attack took place on the Baghdad international airport's road.

The attack has led to widespread condemnation in Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani has vowed revenge on the US.

Earlier on Sunday, Iranian MP Abolfazl Aboutorabi threatened to attack the heart of American politics.

""We can attack the White House itself, we can respond to them on the American soil,"" mirror.co.uk quoted Aboutorabi as saying.

241,06-1-20,Iran nuclear deal hangs by thin thread,"The Iran nuclear deal was already in tatters before the country announced the latest rollback of its commitments under the 2015 accord following the US assassination of a top general.

But Iran has not said it wants to quit the agreement, leaving some room for the deal's remaining parties - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - to try to save it, according to analysts.

Iran had been expected to announce a new step back from its commitments under the deal following a series of measures since May last year in response to the US pulling out of the accord in 2018 and reinstating sanctions.

The latest decision -- to forego the limit on the number of centrifuges used in uranium enrichment -- was in line with Iran's previous announcements, according to a diplomat.

""There is nothing enormously new,"" the diplomat who is familiar with the matter told AFP, adding it was a ""relief"" the Islamic republic did not go even further.

Iran is ""politically very careful... They are not saying we are leaving the deal,"" said Robert Kelley, a former inspections chief at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors the deal's implementation.

Friday's US killing of a top Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani, in Baghdad in a drone strike has added to geopolitical tensions, while the 2015 accord -- known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- had already been shaky.

The JCPOA offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for scaling back its nuclear programme, but remaining parties to the deal have so far been unable to find an efficient way to skirt reimposed US sanctions.

""Iran's decision to put aside the cap on the number of centrifuges as its fifth step away from its JCPOA commitments is less harsh than the initially feared resumption of 20 per cent enrichment,"" Ali Vaez of International Crisis Group tweeted.

The accord capped Iran's uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent, sufficient for power generation but far below the more than 90 per cent level required for a nuclear weapon.

Iran has already broken that limit with enrichment reaching 4.5 percent by November - still below the 20 per cent level it had previously operated.

It has always denied any military dimension to its nuclear programme.

On Sunday, Tehran also stressed it would continue to work with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, which sends inspectors to Iran to monitor its activities.

""The JCPOA may be a zombie, but it is not dead yet,"" Richard Johnson of the Washington-based organisation Nuclear Threat Initiative tweeted.

Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium.

Under the nuclear deal, Iran agreed to slash their number to 5,060 from more than 19,000, and to maintain that level for a decade.

It also agreed to use only less efficient, first-generation centrifuges.

In September, the IAEA said Iran had started using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium at its Natanz plant.

Two months later, Tehran said it had resumed uranium enrichment at the underground Fordo plant south of the Iranian capital.

It remains to be seen how Iran will expand uranium enrichment after its latest declaration.

""We will enter a period of waiting where we will see what is happening on the ground,"" the diplomat said, adding ""technical details provided to the IAEA by Iran would give an idea"" of the extent of the latest move.

Analyst Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association said ""production rates and how quickly Iran's stockpile grows"" depended on how many more centrifuges and what types Iran would install and use.

The 2015 accord aimed to secure at least one year of the so-called ""breakout time"" -- the period needed to produce weapons-grade material for a bomb -- though Iran has always denied this was its aim.

Davenport said that timeframe was ""slightly less"" after Iran's steps in 2019.

If Tehran was to step up uranium enrichment to 20 percent combined with an increase in the number and efficiency of its centrifuges, this would shrink further.

""Iran's nuclear programme no longer faces any limitation in the operational field,"" the government said on Sunday.

This extended to Iran's capacity for enriching uranium, the level of enrichment carried out, the amount enriched, and other research and development, it said.

However, Tehran underlined again that any steps would be reversible should US sanctions be lifted.

Current tensions make the lifting of sanctions highly unlikely, but according to Kelley, Iran was ""playing the game until the very, very end, so that they can say, 'We never quit the deal.'""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-nuclear-deal-hangs-by-thin-thread-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-nuclear-deal-hangs-by-thin-thread.html
242,06-1-20,Pak arrests main accused in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib vandalism case,"The main accused in the recent vandalism at the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan's Punjab province was arrested and charged with a non-bailable section of the stringent anti-terrorism act and blasphemy, a senior police officer said on Monday.

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.

The suspect, identified as Imran Chisti, is the elder brother of Mohammad Hassan who married a teenage Sikh girl in September last after allegedly abducting and converting her to Islam, triggering a controversy.

Chisti, a government employee working in the Fisheries Department, was arrested on Sunday for his role in the violent incident at the Gurudwara, Nankana police station Inspector Muhammad Jamil told PTI on Monday.

""We have arrested Imran Chishti, a government employee, under terrorism and blasphemy charges. He has been booked under sections 295A, 290, 291, 341,506, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code and 7-ATA (anti-terrorism act),"" the officer said.

According to the FIR, Chishti incited a mob on Friday in the name of religion and threatened to destroy a worship place of a minority community (Gurdwara Janam Asthan) to build a shrine there.

""The suspect incited the sentiments of Muslims in order to have settled his family issue and created a law and order situation in the Nankana city,"" it said.

A large number of people, led by Chishti on Friday, held a day-long sit-in outside Gurdwara Janam Asthan against the alleged police harassment and arrest of their family members over the abduction and conversion issue. He also vowed to build a Muslim shrine in the place of the Gurdwara.

Chishti claimed that his brother Hassan was beaten up by police for ""lawfully and consensually"" marrying the daughter of the Gurdwara's granthi.

Police officer Jamil said that Chishti had deliberately misled Muslims in the area against the Sikhs. He also said police patrolling has been increased around all the holy places of the Sikhs in Nankana Sahib.

When asked Hassan and any other member of his family are detained too, Jamil said: “We have only arrested Chishti as he is the main suspect misleading the people in the name of religion.”

Interestingly, earlier neither police nor Evacuee Trust Property Board which looks after the minority places in Pakistan admitted that Gurwara Janam Asthan came under attack/threat by the local Muslims.

The arrest of Chishti came after Prime Minister Imran Khan Sunday broke his silence on the incident and said it goes against his ""vision"" and the government will show ""zero tolerance"" against those involved in it.

India has strongly condemned the incident of vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

Pakistan's Foreign Office on Friday rejected the media reports that the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib was desecrated in a mob attack, saying the birthplace of founder of Sikhism remains ""untouched and undamaged"" and the ""claims of destruction"" of one of the holiest Sikh shrines are ""false"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-arrests-main-accused-in-gurdwara-nankana-sahib-vandalism-case-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-arrests-main-accused-in-gurdwara-nankana-sahib-vandalism-case.html
243,06-1-20,"Vehicular emission weakens bones, speeds up ageing","Living in polluted cities is harmful for health. Earlier several studies have shown air pollution causes a range of medical issues such as lung cancer, stroke, heart diseases, asthma, dementia, depression et al. Now, a new study has warned that inhalation of toxic airborne particles emitted by diesel and petrol vehicles can weaken bones and speed up the ageing process.

Researchers came to this disturbing conclusion after studying the health of nearly 4,000 residents from 28 villages just outside the city of Hyderabad, in southern India.

The researchers, whose study is published in the JAMA Network Open journal observed that those who inhaled more toxic airborne particles had less bone mass in their spines and hips. Household air pollution did not have a clear association with bone mass.

The bone mass loss due to the oxidative stress and inflammation was caused by the toxic particulate matters, said the study led by Otavio T Ranzani, from Barcelona Institute for Global Health, Barcelona, Spain. Osteoporosis is a health condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.

The researchers took measurements of PM2.5 and black carbon in the atmosphere in each village. Total 28 villages were studied. PM2.5 is the finest type of particulate matter, while black carbon is a larger toxin. Both come mainly from petrol and diesel vehicle exhausts. Analysis revealed average PM2.5 exposure was 33 micrograms per metre cubed (ug/m3) — far above the maximum 10ug/m3 levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), said the researchers Carles Milà from National Institute of Nutrition, Indian Council of Medical Research, Hyderabad and Bharati Kulkarni from Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London.

The researchers had cross-referenced pollution levels with X-rays measuring bone mass in participant’s lower back and hip. Results showed that exposure to air pollution were associated with lower levels of bone mass. For every 3ug/m3 increase in fine particulate matter, there was a decrease of -0.57g of bone mass in the spine and -0.13g in the hip, said the study titled ‘Association of Ambient and Household Air Pollution With Bone Mineral Content Among Adults in Peri-urban South India’.

An increase of 1ug/m3 of carbon saw bone density shrink by -1.13g in the spine and -0.35g in the hip, said Ranzani adding that “this study contributes to the limited and inconclusive literature on air pollution and bone health.”

According to the WHO, air pollution causes an estimated seven million premature deaths a year worldwide — one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease.

The WHO also points out that every day around 93 per cent of the world’s children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. Tragically, many of them die: WHO estimates that in 2016, 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air.

A recent report by the global health agency notes that when pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, and have small, low birth-weight children. “Air pollution also impacts neurodevelopment and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma, and childhood cancer. Children who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution may be at greater risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life,” said the report.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vehicular-emission-weakens-bones--speeds-up-ageing-2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/vehicular-emission-weakens-bones--speeds-up-ageing.html

246,06-1-20,Indore T20: Pressure mounts on Dhawan as battle with Rahul for opener's slot heats up,"A washed out series-opener means Shikhar Dhawan has one game less to make a statement in his quest to outperform an in-form K L Rahul, making the opener's fortunes an interesting sub-plot of India's second T20 International against Sri Lanka here on Tuesday.

Dhawan, 35, is a proven performer in limited overs cricket but with age on Rahul's side (27), time is running out for the easy-going Delhi-based cricketer to cement his place for the T20 World Cup later this year.

The left-hander's strike rate in the shortest format has been an issue for a while and that is one thing he must address in the remaining two matches against Sri Lanka.

The fact that Dhawan is coming back from an injury, one of the many he suffered in 2019, makes his task all the more challenging.

In the year that went by, Dhawan managed 272 runs in 12 games at a strike rate of 110.

Rahul, on the other hand, has made the most of his opportunities at the top and was in scintillating form in the previous limited overs series (three ODIs and three T20s) against the West Indies, scoring a hundred and three fifties in six innings.

Former India opener and chief selector Krishnamachari Srikanth has gone to the extent of saying that there is no competition between Dhawan and Rahul as the latter is way ahead in the race to be Rohit Sharma's partner in the T20 World Cup in Australia.

Skipper Virat Kohli too has stated that choosing between Dhawan and Rahul will be a tough call after Rohit, who is rested from the Sri Lanka series, returns to opening the innings.

""When Rohit comes back, you know, it's going to be a difficult thing to address because Shikhar has been an experienced player but KL is playing so well. I think we'll have to decide what is the best combination that we can go with and who are the best XI to take the field,"" Kohli had said ahead of the first T20.

Considering not a ball was bowled in Guwahati, it is unlikely that Kohli will make changes to the playing XI, having picked three specialist pacers and two spinners for the series-opener.

Washington Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav were the chosen spinners with Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravindra Jadeja missing out. Kohli had taken that call keeping the significant presence of left-handers in the Sri Lankan line-up.

Manish Pandey and Sanju Samson, who has been warming the bench series after series, are likely to sit out again.

India are being experimental ahead of the World Cup in October-November but the management has so far not given an opportunity to Pandey and Samson.

Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah's comeback after four months was highly anticipated in Guwahati but rain and subsequent wet outfield played spoilsport. He is certain to get game time on Tuesday with clear weather predicted in Indore.

The Holkar Stadium has hosted only one T20 International so far and the visiting team happened to be Sri Lanka.

It was a high-scoring game in December 2017 with Rohit smashing 118 off 43 balls and Rahul fetching 89 off 49 as India went on to make 260 for five in 20 overs. The hosts eventually won the game by 88 runs.

All-rounder Angelo Mathews, one of Sri Lanka's most experienced players alongside skipper Lasith Malinga, did not find a place in the playing XI in Guwahati with the visitors also going for three specialist pacers and two spinners. It remains to be seen if Mathews makes the team on Tuesday.

Sri Lanka, who have not won a bilateral series against India across formats for more than 10 years now, will have to produce a special performance to upstage the domineering hosts here.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (c), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur, Manish Pandey, Washington Sundar, Sanju Samson.

Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (c), D Gunathilaka, A Fernando, A Mathews, D Shanaka, K Perera, N Dickwella, Dhananjaya De Silva, I Udana, B Rajapaksa, O Fernando, W Hasaranga, L Kumara, K Mendis, L Sandakan, K Rajitha.

247,06-1-20,"Leaving injuries behind, Dhawan wants to be more impactful in 2020","Plagued by injuries in 2019, opener Shikhar Dhawan is aiming for a fresh start in the new year and wants to become a ""more impactful"" batsman in his quest to help India lift the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia.

Dhawan did not have a very good 2019 as he was in and out of the team because of injuries.

The left-handed opener was ruled out midway from last year's ICC ODI World Cup after sustaining a thumb fracture. Injuries continued to haunt Dhawan as he missed the home T20 series against the West Indies in December after hurting his knee during a Ranji Trophy match.

""Last year I had lots of injuries but that's part and parcel of our work. It's a new year and I am looking forward for a new start and it's gonna go a long way,"" Dhawan told 'bcci.Tv'.

""This year looking I am forward to score lots of runs for the team and for myself and be a more impactful player, win matches for my team and win the World Cup,"" he said, elaborating on his goal for 2020.

The ICC T20 World Cup will be hosted by Australia from October 18 to November 15 this year.

Asked how difficult it was for him to be in and out of the team, the 34-year-old dasher from Delhi said: ""I am always positive, I always take things in a positive manner.

""Injuries are quite natural, so I just take it in my stride. I don't make a fuss about it. I make sure that I always stay in a positive mindset and that helps things to heal very quickly. ""

Dhawan, who is back in the Indian team for the three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka, believes the ongoing rubber is a great opportunity for him to be back among runs.

""I am really looking forward to this series. It's a good opportunity for me to come and express myself and score big runs,"" he said.

""I am always developing my game, developing new shots. I always make sure that I do my preparation well and come on the ground and enjoy myself.""

The first T20 of the series against Sri Lanka was washed out without a ball being bowled here on Sunday night.

248,06-1-20,"Ind vs SL: '9:30pm inspection a mystery, most players had left at 9'","The last inspection for Sunday's T20I game between India and Sri Lanka at the Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati might have been conducted at 9:30 p.m. -- 24 minutes before the match was officially called off -- but Assam Cricket Association (ACA) Secretary Devajit Saikia has revealed that the majority of the players had already left at 9 p.m.



Speaking to IANS, Saikia said even he was surprised how the last inspection was done by umpires Chettithody Shamshuddin, Nitin Menon, Anil Chaudhary and match referee David Boon at 9:30 p.m. when most of the players had left the stadium at 9 p.m.

""Well, that is a mystery to me and I will have to find it out because most of the players had left by 9 p.m. That announcement (calling off at 9:54 p.m.) was strategic to ensure that the crowd didn't turn unruly. That is the usual protocol that is followed. I have given you the hard facts,"" he said.

In fact, Saikia said that the match officials had made it clear to the groundstaff that the ground had to be ready for action by 8:45 p.m else the game would have been abandoned.

""For one hour and three minutes there was heavy shower and umpires said we need to get the ground ready by 8:45 p.m. otherwise the match will be abandoned. 57 minutes was given to the groundsmen to get it ready. If we had some more time, we could have readied the ground. There was dampness throughout the pitch due to reverse osmosis system and what was said on commentary, I can't comment on that,"" he explained.

The ACA secretary also said it was not expected that rain would play spoilsport at this time of the year.

""This was an unseasonal rain as we don't get any such rain in Guwahati in January. Yesterday also we had heavy rain in the afternoon, but we got the ground ready in time for the toss and it happened at 6:30 p.m. Then, the match was supposed to start at 7 p.m. At 6:50 p.m. there was heavy downpour and hailstorm. This continued till 7:53 p.m.

""After rainfall there was a lot of humidity in the atmosphere. After 6:30 p.m. the ground is with the match referee and the umpires and they dictate the terms and our curator team followed their instructions. If we had been given an hour or half an hour, the ground would have been ready,"" he rued.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ind-vs-sl---9-30pm-inspection-a-mystery--most-players-had-left-at-9--2020-01-06.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/ind-vs-sl---9-30pm-inspection-a-mystery--most-players-had-left-at-9-.html
