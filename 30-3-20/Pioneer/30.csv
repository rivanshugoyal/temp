0,30-3-20,Friendship in trouble,"If COVID-19 does stall/delay Chinese ‘aid’ to Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on it, the latter could be saddled with incomplete projects and unsustainable interest payments

As the inevitability and magnitude of the impact COVID-19 would have on global economies sinks in, with estimates worsening day by day, there is no denying the fact that those economies substantially dependent on China will be poised precariously. The traditional Chinese Sinosphere stratagem had been to bankroll, financially and diplomatically, desperate regimes with the help of readily available, uncomplicated and “non-judgmental” Chinese largesse. The dragon leveraged its treasury to systematically ensnare alienated regimes in Pyongyang, Islamabad and Tehran among others to even include financially gasping countries in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, right across to Polynesian Islands, all under its tutelage.

The Chinese economic juggernaut funded its hegemonic instincts and Beijing rapidly connected the dots with “win-win” infrastructural projects like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), supporting inter-linkages like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). For this purpose, it even used the ports around the String of Pearls, which vassalised nations and made them directly susceptible to Chinese whims as also fate.

Pakistan is among the most hinged nations within the Sinosphere, which is poised to feel the direct squeeze of COVID-19. China will inevitably recalibrate its priorities and focus on protecting itself from immediate damage before being concerned about others. Extreme paranoia about managing the expectations of its 1.4 billion population, to avoid a USSR-like implosion, haunts the regime. Such are the insecurities faced by the single-party Government over there. China deploys a combination of fear, opportunities, populism and nationalism to willfully or unwilfully get its populace to accept one-party rule. The bargaining assurance is continuous societal progression of the Chinese masses and their lifestyle.

Undeniable progress on various socio-economic parameters has allowed that bargain between the regime and the Chinese people to maintain the status quo. Now, this economic miracle runs the real risk of a very hard landing as the entire Chinese ecosystem goes into a COVID-19 “containment mode,” which will necessitate a pullback from internationalist priorities. Top Chinese priority would now be on a domestic stimulus package that entails a slew of Government-led spending, investments, subsidies and all sorts of deliberate financial pumping that will automatically shrink budgets for external endeavours, at least temporarily.

Meanwhile, the Pakistani economy is on a ventilator mode. It has partaken a record 22nd bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) besides the many “aid packages” from China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the conditionalities of the IMF’s $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) will be subject to unpopular economic reforms and would be doled out only in tranches, the Chinese have been the single most generous source, donating $4.6 billion in the form of deposits and commercial loans.

Ties with the US are circumspect. Though the Taliban peace deal may force optics of a thaw but hopes for any meaningful financial aid from Washington, DC, are highly unlikely. Not only has Pakistan maxed out its deals with Saudi Arabia and the UAE but it has unendeared itself to both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi recently by cozying up to a rival “bloc” within the Ummah ie, the Turkey-Malaysia-Qatar-Iran combine. This leaves limited scope for any more substantial inflow from the Arab Sheikhdoms. Pakistan has extremely limited manoeuvring space. The only viable option is/was China.

Our neighbour has survived embarrassing defaults in the balance of payment timelines by borrowing more. The singular hope that is described by the establishment over there as the “game-changer” is the China-funded CPEC. This $62 billion infrastructural hope is mired in dangerous opacity with credible murmurs of disproportionate pro-China terms, sovereignty compromises and an eventuality of China’s fabled “debt trap.” All of this leads it to abject surrender to Beijing. Law-makers had earlier likened the CPEC to a modern-day East India company, yet with no alternatives for an economic revival in sight, the CPEC is the sole sovereign punt.

Such are the stakes involved that the Pakistani military has raised and deployed a dedicated division to protect the CPEC imperatives. It is now raising a second dedicated division level force. The gargantuan investment in CPEC is “aided” by China. The CPEC project has just completed phase-I but the forthcoming phase-II is predominantly about industrial cooperation, agriculture and trade — essentially the component that is more relevant to the Pakistanis than the Chinese.

The timing of COVID-19 could not be worse from Islamabad’s perspective as phase-II and its benefits are key to its economy’s survival. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had openly warned the IMF a couple of years back against bailing out Pakistan. He feared that such an aid would be used by it to repay Chinese lenders. Today, the bill for full Chinese “aid,” if it were still to be given, could compound to a crushing estimate of nearly $100 billion over the next three decades. If COVID-19 does stall the Chinese “aid”, then Pakistan could be saddled with incomplete projects and unsustainable interest payments for the “aid” already taken.

Beyond bailouts and commerce, “all-weather friendship” has seen China provide invaluable diplomatic and military provisioning. While this could continue, the material wares may not necessarily come on terms as “soft” as earlier, given the financial angularity. Islamabad is also over-indexed in trade with a whopping 18 per cent of its total trade with China. This also accounts for over 31 per cent of the total imports by Pakistan. This disproportionate tilt exacerbates the Pakistani situation with looming disruptions from China.

While the exact long-term impact of COVID-19 is still unknown and China is known to have sufficient economic buffers, wherewithal and a strategic commitment to withstand setbacks with speedy recalibrations, the health of Pakistan to withstand even a temporary “switch-off” is suspect. Pakistan is too dependent on China to manage without its “aid”, especially given its recent relationships with other potential donors.

Unsurprisingly, Pakistan has pitched countries like Turkey to sell the CPEC dream and incredulously so, even the US. American diplomat Alice Wells nipped the idea in the bud by sounding out the alarm bells on CPEC per se, even without accounting for the new curve-ball of COVID-19. This could be the proverbial last straw. As of now, all global economies are mired in untellable uncertainties of post-Corona revival, some completely China-hinged like Pakistan, worse so.

1,30-3-20,Lessons from the East,"Prolonged lockdown can’t be a solution and we need to learn from control models in Japan, South Korea and China

Let there be no doubt that India, which had probably misread the extent of the COVID-19 explosion at home, desperately needed to hold the upward curve by way of a lockdown. It looks draconian at the moment but given the huge humanitarian crisis it has generated, with the exodus of daily wage earners back to their villages on foot — a heaving mass of humans that can accelerate the spread — it can only be a stopgap. Dragging the economic slowdown further would mean the country would barely manage to pull along and its vast unorganised labour force would have to live in penury. Which is why all stakeholders concerned should use this lockdown to plan alternative containment strategies. Hereon, India, like any other country in the world, would have to learn to live with the virus. China, Japan and South Korea have already executed templates that work as both our Government and private stakeholders are now planning to ramp up testing kits and facilities on a war footing. Without this, we would not be able to make head or tail of the subterranean monster at work, which might be sleeping during a lockdown. All three nations have resorted to an aggressive testing protocol and enforced quarantine during the early onset of the disease, thereby arresting it, and codified a new lifestyle with military precision. The latter may seem like an insurmountable challenge in India but given the innovative distancing and no-contact models developed in some Government ration shops in some of our smallest towns, might not seem an impossibility. A vaccine isn’t coming till the second half of 2021 and till then only a practicable and implementable containment model can work.

Both Japan and South Korea, despite being so close to China, have evolved containment models and have not locked down either the economy or airports, although they’ve limited civic movement by encouraging work from home possibilities. In South Korea, once the country with the worst outbreak outside China, there is some semblance of normalcy around COVID-19, considering that it had internalised lessons from the first outbreak of a virus causing respiratory syndromes. It has one of the lowest casualty rates from COVID-19 in the world, just one per cent, simply because it is transparent, has mass-tested people (at accessible points like drive-throughs) enforced quarantine and traced contacts. It has even prepared itself for a relapse scenario by stockpiling on supplies like masks and other equipment. It has tested early and it has been swift. There was a time when medical experts were diagnosing more than 900 new cases a day. Yet it flattened the curve. It continues to remain vigilant through data analytics, looking for newer hotspots as they emerge and going for precise and targetted action. At the same time, the South Korean Government created a GPS-enabled app to monitor those under quarantine and set off an alarm if they ventured outdoors. Travellers entering the country are also being asked to record their symptoms on a state-sponsored app. In fact, the term “social distancing” originated here, with the Government codifying and marking spaces for use at public spaces like railway platforms and aggressively propagating guidelines on minutiae like using lifts and common spaces even in apartment complexes. China has used mass surveillance and algorithms to trace contact circles, quarantine them, monitor their daily activity and identify potential hotspots. Apartment blocks have scanners to monitor and screen every resident. Japan is unique, too, simply because it has ensured that 80 per cent of identified cases didn’t pass on the infection. No matter how badly it handled the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it targetted infection clusters at a comparatively early stage and contained the spread. Of course, Japan’s hygiene standards are impeccable — most people wear a mask at public spaces round the year and use sanitisers frequently. Washing hands works better for us and we have a habit that can be built upon. Besides with a culture that is not effusive about hugs and shaking hands, Japan has the advantage of having internalised a social distancing protocol longer than us. That’s why Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that his nation did not need an emergency. Like us, all these countries have high population densities with a high propagation possibility. And like us, they all belong to an Asian culture. It is from these examples that we can draw as, though we are frail on health infrastructure, we can leverage technology to work out enforceable pre-emptive protocols. And use our popular culture media to disseminate the idea of a new way of living.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lessons-from-the-east-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/lessons-from-the-east.html
2,30-3-20,Animal farm,"Wild animals straying into city streets during the lockdown show how we have stifled our biodiversity

They say the Coronavirus is Nature’s way of reclaiming its space on its terms for all the degradation of its splendour and resources by humans. So cities across India, that are at a standstill, with no vehicles or people across vast swathes, are witnessing unfamiliar sights of wild animals straying from the natural sanctuaries they have sought out around the peripheries. From Italy to Japan to Thailand and even in India, the roads, that perhaps were once their transit corridors, are now part of their return journeys. In Japan, herds of sika deer, that you got to see only at the tourist hotspot called Nara Park, were seen wandering the streets. In Italy, one of the worst-hit countries by COVID-19, people spotted sheep and horses wandering around without a shepherd or rider. In Spain, more wild boars are having a free run in quiet, deserted streets. Back home, too, there are plenty of videos of animals frolicking on city roads. In Punjab’s Chandigarh, a sambar deer was seen walking on a zebra crossing. And in northern Kerala’s Kozhikode, the critically endangered civet, a species not seen since the 1990s, casually strolled past police patrol. Closer home, in Noida, nilgais are literally wandering the street in front of an otherwise busy mall. In the mornings, the twitter of the heron, the mynah and unseen birds soothes our souls.

While the wild animals may be testing newer territories, most of the urban species like street dogs, cats, monkeys and stray cows are not having it so good. Dependent on food waste generated by eateries and restaurants and home clearances limited in a time of crisis, these creatures are going hungry. Except for some samaritans, city animals and birds have been forced to fend for themselves foraging in garbage dumps. They are also a vulnerable lot as they could get the virus from humans instead. We cannot ignore them as they are part of our eco-system too. This is our wake-up call, for co-existence, co-dependence and the dire need to reverse our relationship with the sentient world. We care little for the natural world though ancient texts tell us about protecting and nurturing every creature or jiva, not exploiting them selfishly. Can a Coronavirus-free world ensure that endangered species do not go extinct? Can we limit indiscriminate human action that is causing much damage to the entire ecosystem and biodiversity? Can our cities develop mini sanctuaries and forests within them so that the animal world can thrive? Predatory food chain behaviour is not working, we must change that to accommodating the lesser species for our well-being.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/animal-farm-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/animal-farm.html
3,30-3-20,"Migrants to be lodged in govt, pvt buildings","

With a view to accommodating the migrant workers coming from Delhi and other states, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to put them in quarantine in government or private accommodations before allowing them to go to their families.

A government spokesman said that these accommodations would be used as shelter homes.

“Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has given directives that people coming from Delhi or other states need to be put in quarantine for 14 days for medical check-ups. Government and private buildings could be used for quarantine,” said Shalabh Mani Tripathi, media adviser to the chief minister.

The beginning was made in Noida where the UP government took over vacant townships on Yamuna Expressway to accommodate the stranded migrant workers and their families.

“JP Sports City has been acquired to set up shelter homes for migrants. The people here will be provided clean beds, toilets and food,” District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar, BN Singh, said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrants-to-be-lodged-in-govt--pvt-buildings.html
4,30-3-20,FIR against AAP MLA for ‘malicious’ tweet against Yogi,"



|

The dispute between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi governments over rush of migrants at the UP-Delhi border on Saturday could escalate after Noida police registered an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chaddha early Sunday morning.

On Saturday, the Delhi and UP governments had blamed each other for triggering panic among the migrants staying in Delhi, leading to their exodus from the national capital.

However, the situation worsened when AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha tweeted that the UP chief minister was behind chasing and beating up of the migrants and asking them why they had gone to Delhi for work.

The tweet, which was later deleted, however angered the UP leaders.

Mrityunjay Kumar, media advisor to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said that the statement was in bad taste. “An FIR would be lodged against the AAP MLA,” he said.

He said such acts of the AAP leaders were deplorable when the country was fighting the coronavirus scare.

“Thousands of people came to Delhi-UP borders violating the lockdown norms but the AAP government did nothing to stop them. On the other hand, the UP government did everything by providing them (migrants) buses and food,” he said, adding that it showed the real face of the AAP government.

But AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh blamed the UP government for the chaos.

“On March 26, the UP chief minister had announced that his government would provide all facilities to the migrants staying anywhere in the country to return to their villages in UP. This announcement created the problem but now the Bharatiya Janata Party is blaming us for it,” he said in a statement here.

On Sunday, an FIR was lodged against AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha at the Sector-20 police station in Noida by senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Kumar under sections 500 and 500 (2) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 66 of the IT Act.

The FIR (number 0292) says that as per the complaint of the lawyer, the accused has tweeted a malicious message against the UP chief minister and it is a deliberate attempt to create law and order problem.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fir-against-aap-mla-for----malicious----tweet-against-yogi.html
5,30-3-20,Migrants entering UP to be put in quarantine,"Directing officials to put all migrants entering Uttar Pradesh in 14 days’ compulsory quarantine, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered all industries and business establishments in the state to give full wages to their employees for the lockdown period and assured all assistance to the people during this period.

The orders were issued by the chief minister during his daily review meeting with his core team here on Sunday. The team comprises 11 committees of senior officials looking after different issues during the lockdown in UP.

The chief minister asked the officials to make arrangements for medical check-up of people entering UP. “The state will not compromise with the health of the people and every person entering UP will have to be put in compulsory isolation or quarantine for 14 days. It is the responsibility of the district authorities to ensure that people follow the health protocol,” he said.

More than one lakh migrant workers who have entered UP during the past couple of days are expected to be put in quarantine.

The UP government has asked all people returning to the state from abroad after March 1 to inform the district administration about their travel history and their health details. “If such people do not inform the authorities, the government may lodge criminal cases against them,” Yogi said.

The chief minister also ordered all industries and other commercial establishments in the state to pay full wages to their employees for the lockdown period. He also asked the district administrations to pay Rs 1,000 to all daily waged labourers in their jurisdictions. He also asked landlords not to force their tenants to pay their rents during the lockdown period.

Yogi assured all the people living in the state that his government would look after them and provide food and other essential commodities.

“I appeal to all migrants from other states to stay in UP during the lockdown period. The state government will provide them all facilities,” he said, adding that movement at this time was not good.

Later, in the evening briefing, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters that the chief minister went up to the Agra-Lucknow Expressway to monitor the flow of migrant workers.

“The chief minister has asked the people of UP staying in other states to stay where they are and officials of the state will solve their problems if any,” Awasthi said while announcing the names of the nodal officers appointed for every state by the UP government.

Awasthi said that the chief minister also directed officials to increase community kitchens. At present, over 1,000 community kitchens are being run and they are supplying food packets to around three lakh people. Now police lines will also have kitchens to supply food packets.

The additional chief secretary said that 29 sugar mills in UP had been given licence to produce sanitisers while over 7.75 lakh registered daily waged workers had been provided Rs 1,000.

He said 5,183 FIRs had been registered for violating lockdown norms and 35 FIRs for black-marketing",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrants-entering-up-to-be-put-in-quarantine.html
6,30-3-20,COVID-19 cases mount to 7 in U’khand,"The cases of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Uttarakhand are showing no signs of abatement. On Sunday, the health department reported seventh case of the disease in the state. What is a matter of great concern is that the latest patient of the disease is an armed force personnel deployed in Dehradun. The patient, a 47-year-old Subedar is said to be a native of Rajasthan. He had returned to his unit in Dehradun on March 10 from his home town.

On March 26 he was admitted in the Military Hospital (MH) Dehradun with the symptoms of the disease. His swab sample was sent to the laboratory of the Government Medical College in Haldwani.

On Sunday he was found positive for the disease. The State control room for COVID-19 received reports of 27 samples on Sunday out of them 26 were negative while one was positive.

The director general (DG) of State health services, Dr Amita Upreti said that the department is working on marking the people with whom the patients of the disease had came into contact. She said these people are being kept at home quarantine or facility quarantine. The department has also kept 1730 people in observation, who have recently returned from the foreign destinations. She said that the department has fully trained 1479 doctors, 952 staff nurses, 170 lab technician and 1751 pharmacists on controlling the infection of the disease. Apart from them, the personnel of the police, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), PRD, home guards, GMVN and KMVN have also been trained.

The DG added that the department has also finalised the hospitals where treatment of the disease would be done and in these hospitals 774 beds in isolation wards have been prepared. The department has also reserved 903 for the suspected patients of the disease while 1687 beds have been prepared under quarantine facility.

10,30-3-20,Adapt to remain alive,"Businesses across the world and in India are facing unprecedented shutdowns and many may not survive the Coronavirus’ economic impact. However, those who remain alert and pliant will endure

Covid-19 has caused worldwide disruption and all countries are desperately battling this virus. From the most developed nations of the world to the least developed, all are sailing in the same boat. Businesses across the world, both small and large, are facing unprecedented shutdowns and many may not survive this global pandemic. Given the scale of the economic damage being inflicted by the Coronavirus, it is absolutely necessary to understand the risks faced by our businesses in these times.

Social distancing may become a norm: According to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the time flu-like activity peaks between December and February, although activity can last as late as May. So, in times to come, during the December to March period, it is possible that some virus or the other may rear its ugly head. We may have to get used to the concept of social distancing during these months, which means lower footfalls in malls and shopping areas and a decline in consumer purchases during these times.

Lower employee productivity: The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated the annual mortality burden of influenza to be between 2,50,000 to 5,00,000 globally. Based on the 2019 research paper of Gianino and other researchers on the Italian industry, the economic burden of absenteeism due to influenza and other virus-related infections was studied. According to them, the highest number of working days lost were reported in the 40-49 age group, accounting for 37 per cent of the total costs. So, every business may be impacted with employees taking long leave due to sickness, either directly or indirectly. Businesses in future may need to adjust to flexible working hours due to several reasons — sickness and tending to children due to school or day care closures.

Stressed logistics network: Globalisation and integrated business have increased the length, complexity and vulnerability of supply chains. Now most companies rely on vendors located in Asia for their businesses to function normally. With the entire world affected by Covid-19, we are already facing delays in the logistics network and the same situation can arise in the future, too.

Economic instability: The world is going through major economic turmoil. Consumers have started spending less and industries are feeling the impact, particularly as more and more nations go into lockdown to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Investors are pulling money from markets and corporations are cutting back their investments. Since the economic engine of growth is driven by continuous investment as well as consumption, any cutback in any one or both aspects may lead to recession or economic instability. In fact, economists are already warning of the possibility of a recession in the near future due to the lockdowns.

With these risks facing the business world, how should organisations prepare themselves for these unpredictable times? Here are some strategies.

Safety first: Safety, of both employees and customers, should be the logical requirement of any organisation during any crisis, particularly during a pandemic like the Coronavirus outbreak. Even before the 21-day lockdown began in India, many companies began allowing people to work from home. Once the lockdown is lifted, people will return to their offices. Here are some of the strategies that businesses can employ to ensure that their employees are safe. They can spread the correct information about Covid-19 and the way to stop its spread in the office. Going forward, organisations have to make relevant changes in their sick leave policies and encourage people who are sick to take leave and not come to office due to anxiety over job loss. Formalise this situation by creating new policies for your organisation like an incubation policy, where employees suspected of contracting the Covid-19 virus, can take time off and quarantine themselves. This could be an added policy for your organisation to refer to during any future epidemics. Allow employees to take time off if their relatives or family members are sick. Consider all non-essential travel and use technology to its maximum potential. In addition, make sure that the entire workplace is sanitised before the employees start working again. Showing compassion towards your employees can help both the organisation and employees in these difficult times.

Business continuity: After ensuring the relevant safety for your employees, the challenge is to ensure the continuity of business operations during this pandemic. Some technology-driven organisations may continue operations from remote locations but other traditional manufacturing companies may have to shut their operations temporarily. The impact is not only economic but also social and cultural. For example, Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Toyota and Hyundai have shut their factories in the US. Ford and Daimler have also suspended their production in European factories. The airline industry is bearing the brunt of this virus, with both international and domestic travel severely restricted. All industries are affected with sporting leagues across the world being shut down, the Olympics being called off, major gatherings, including technological events and music festivals cancelled and restaurants and malls closed. To make sure your business continues, establish a reliable communication process with your employees and actively involve them in developing and updating your plans. Unpredictability is the unfortunate reality of the pandemic that the world is facing now. The way it impacts your business is not known, it may show an immediate effect or the financial distress may take months to become apparent. Protection of your business should be the ultimate goal and a proper scenario analysis that addresses several situations should be created by business owners. Analyse how operationally efficient you are. Are you lean enough to pull this off without a severe impact? Identify your critical operations and key resources that would enable the critical business functions. So focus on mainly three things: Key personnel, important clients and raw materials/supplies required. After identifying critical success factors, create contingency plans for each category. Training of employees to act as back-up for key personnel is crucial and make sure that raw materials/inventory are stocked to tide over any disruptions in supply chain networks.

Prepare your organisation to survive: For many organisations, the first and foremost way to deal with any crisis is development of risk management policies which are detailed contingency plans to assess and respond to any pandemic/disaster. But in these VUCA (volatile, unpredictable, complex and ambiguous) times is simply having guidelines/frameworks/plans or policies sufficient? Or is there a need for companies to be ever-alert and agile, with a keen sense of the changing environment and the ability to respond quickly and efficiently?

The answer is that only companies that can respond quickly can survive in these unpredictable times. To do this effectively, the structure of the organisation may require some changes. An organisation which is hierarchical in its structure with centralised leadership, driven by strict policies with a concentrated workforce of specialists, will definitely have problems in changing, whereas a networked organisation with distributed leadership, driven by flexible and simple policies with dispersed workforce of generalists will be less rigid and springy and will be able to adapt and survive these unprecedented and unpredictable times.

Collaboration is the key: The uncertainty created by Coronavirus does not have any precedence in contemporary times. No one has any clue as to how long this crisis will continue and what would be the cumulative impact of this virus on the global economy. In this situation, collaboration, co-development and cooperation of organisations with other institutions and members of the community, would be the key to survival. All of us have to tide over this crisis together.

Add a new source of revenue: Winston Churchill once famously said “Never let any crisis go waste.” Organisations should take this opportunity and try and create new revenue streams. A cue can be taken from airports, which transformed themselves into entertainment hubs by adding restaurants, shops and so on, after the September 11 attacks and in the process added to their revenue streams. The same goes for banks as they added different fee-based services after the 2008 financial crisis.

Covid-19 has stopped the global economic, social and cultural wheel. As individuals are working from home, have stopped or cut down their social gatherings and binge-shopping to find solace at home in the company of their loved ones, business leaders have to take crisis management as a priority and work towards creating resilient organisations to withstand the unpredictability of the current economic environment. However, at the same time, they have to be flexible and agile enough to adapt to these fast-changing times. By doing so, organisations can try and protect themselves against a range of threats, both natural and man-made, including the Covid-19 pandemic that we all are facing now.

11,30-3-20,Pandemic not the first nor the last,"The present experience forms a part of the collage of this planet’s history. How we respond will determine how the future shall emerge

Clearly the planet is passing through challenging times. However, this is not the first time in the history of mankind that, what is now being termed as a “pandemic”, has struck. From plagues, to floods to various viral threats, the Earth has periodically witnessed humongous disasters. It is all chronicled for anyone with a curious mind who wants to update his/her knowledge about the Blue Planet. This is also not the first time, nor will it be the last, when a disease has struck to which there is no known, tested and established antidote available. However, such experiences in the digital era acquire a completely unique aura and dimension. News travels at a speed which has not even been mapped.

A comparative perspective emerges as never before in history. When the nationwide lockdown was announced, one of the questions that was uppermost on everyone’s minds was: Has a complete shutdown ever been attempted at such a scale, to include all 1.3 billion people, all together? Add to it the unique dimension of the period over which it will be spread: Three weeks.

To the singularity of the situation add the diversity of the ethnological clusters, which make up the composition of this country. Compound this lay of the land with the reality of the distances people travel to make a living.

Remember, the announcement of the lockdown was based on the expectation that people would stay put wherever they were. The trek that some people have undertaken, in certain cases over several hundred kilometres, to get back to their places of origin can only be an act of desperation brought on my heartless, unscrupulous employers/businessmen. This aspect of the ground condition was not factored in for sure and is not amenable to debates and arguments.

Times such as these, unleash a barrage of perceptions. Kathleen O’Meara’s poem And people stayed home written in 1869 has been evoked: “And the people stayed home. And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.”

Some philosophising has been met with some re-envisioning. The wise are shaking their heads and saying that things will never be the same again. The nature of resources will have to be recalibrated, the nature of work shall change, nature of skill-formation and education will have evolved paradigms.

With the aviation sector down to less than half of its normal operational strength and seafarers almost left to stare at the empty blue wilderness, based on no movement on their part, self-isolation has acquired many more overtones than what the dictionary had so far granted.

Clearly we are passing through seminal times. There can be no discussion of this without some reference to climate change or speculation over nature having its “revenge.” The full imprint of the experiences of the last few weeks on the present and future of the Earth will take time to become evident. Yet, it does not take a genius to realise that the contribution of the human species to the present plight of the planet has not been insignificant.

Typically, a research by Alexander Kotch and his colleagues is reported to indicate certain theories. Of them, one is that climate change did not begin with industrialisation. They propose an alternate theory to an understanding of climate change. This was projected for publication in 2019. The study holds that changes in the environment, of the territorial focus of the study, (the Americas), began with the disease and war which the European migrants brought there. By their reported estimates, 90 per cent of the indigenous populations were wiped out by pestilence, warfare and the after-effects of this movement. With Christopher Columbus pioneering the route to the Indies in 1492, began the process which altered the character of the population there, in a hundred years, by simple decimation. Colonisation, virulent or otherwise, altered the character of the ecosystems they ventured into. Most colonisers were essentially “soldiers of fortune.” They may not even have been aware of what they could be triggering but the “innocence” of the culprit does not change the fallout of the nature of the act.

The reported media findings hold that this ushered in new vegetation which “preserved” heat. It trapped carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other researches have thrown up differing theories. There is one attributing the phenomena, this time, of severe cold, to weak solar activity and heightened volcanic activity.

Irrespective, the consensus seems to be that study of the history of mankind must begin with the recognised date of presence of mankind on this planet and not have a beginning, marked with a bias towards “records” of history.

The present experience forms a part of the collage of this planet’s history. How we respond will determine how the future shall emerge.

12,30-3-20,Of contagions and conspiracy theories,"In societies hardwired to understand life through the lens of faith alone, it is a challenge for the Government to impose certain restrictions during outbreaks like the one the world is facing right now

A worried colleague at my office asked another if it was okay for a Muslim to use hand sanitisers that contained alcohol. The second colleague took a step back from the inquirer and sardonically replied: “Were the Saudis using juice to disinfect the holy sites?” Later in the day, I saw the worried colleague washing his hands with an alcohol-based sanitiser. Personally, I did not feel any annoyance towards him. There are many like him whose minds have been bombarded with numerous, often contradictory, ideas about faith and morality. According to Andrew Newberg, the Director of Research at Philadelphia’s Thomas Jefferson University, overtly religious people “have more tissue in the frontal lobes, or regions of the brain associated with attention and reward.” Therefore, they are what they are not only due to doctrinal reasons but also due to a physiological variance.

In societies that have been hardwired to understand life through the lens of faith alone, it is a challenge for the Government to impose certain restrictions during pandemics. For example, how to tell people not to gather at mosques, temples or churches? A scientific explanation alone does not cut it. That’s why one often sees Governments utilise clerics and priests in such societies to wrap the scientific rationale in theological justifications.

The March 14 issue of The Guardian reports that a cleric of a major mosque in conservative Kuwait changed certain words of the azaan (call to prayer). Instead of inviting people to come pray at the mosque, he asked them to pray at home due to the Coronavirus scare.

Thousands of miles away, in the otherwise constitutionally secular US, newspaper reports suggest that instructions to the people by the authorities to avoid attending church services in the so-called “Bible belt states”, have increased anxiety levels in regular church-goers. In India, a country recently in the grip of Hindutva nationalism, a Hindu organisation invited fellow Hindus to a “party” where cow urine was served to the guests as a serum against Covid-19.

Psychologists believe that a crisis that may restrict people from engaging with their faith in a normal manner can also cause anxiety within the caretakers of faith — they may become more brazenly exhibitionistic to remain relevant or to “save faith” from eroding.

On March 16, a video clip of a Muslim cleric in Pakistan went viral in which he was inviting people to a large rally and claiming that “God will never allow anyone at the rally to be infected by the virus.”

To secularists and even moderate believers, such acts may seem bizarre. Yet, these acts are not emitting from the lunatic fringes of society as such. They are taking place within mainstream segments that have been hardwired to understand reality from a religious point of view — or rather, from their particular religious point of view.

At the same time, there are numerous believers in Muslim, Christian and Hindu societies who do not see any dichotomy between faith and science. In fact, they maintain that their respective faiths are flexible enough to better harness science. Then there are the usual conspiracy theorists. Once relegated to the confines of the so-called lunatic fringe, the mushrooming of social media outlets, in the last 20 years or so, has lobbed their ideas and claims into mainstream discourses.

One of the stickiest conspiracy theories about the outbreak of Covid-19 doing the rounds is that the virus is in fact man-made and/or it is a “biological weapon” gone astray or — worse — it has been deliberately deployed by China or the US or even that it has been spread to enrich pharmaceutical companies.

There is not an iota of evidence to substantiate these claims. But conspiracy theorists do not deal in evidence, only in connecting disparate dots which may make sense in minds plagued by fear and uncertainty. Viruses have been around for millions of years. Humans have continued to develop antibodies to fight them through the natural evolutionary process or by developing vaccines which introduce new antibodies in the system to ward off what virologists call “Novel viruses.” The dreaded Covid-19 is one such virus. It’s a “flu virus” but it isn’t the first, nor will it be the last. There have been at least six flu or influenza pandemics in the past. There may have been more but scientists so far have been able to trace just six in the last century and a half. Virologists trace the viruses of each of these pandemics to infected birds who transferred the virus to a mammalian animal before it entered the human body. Bird viruses are largely unable to stick to human cells and when they do, are often slain by human antibodies. However, sometimes, through the evolutionary mutation process, a flu virus from a bird manages to stick to a cell of a mammal. There, it further mutates and is then able to stick more easily to human cells. Further mutations help it fight off human antibodies rendering them obsolete, and this is when the virus becomes “Novel.” The natural development of new antibodies, or antibodies triggered through a vaccine, are the only means to neutralise it. The Covid-19 outbreak has been traced back to an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. An infected bat infected a pangolin from which a human handler caught the mutating virus. Many outside China have demanded that the Chinese stop eating “strange animals.”

But do they really? Yes, some do. Why? According to Frederick J. Simoons in Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry, China has a history of eating rats, snakes and dogs during famine. The practice receded in the early 20th century but returned when Mao Zedong’s radical economic policies in the late 1950s triggered widespread famines. But even after the famines receded in the late 1970s, the practice of getting meat from unusual sources continued in some quarters.

Nevertheless, shops dealing in “unusual meat”, are now likely to be closed down for good.

13,30-3-20,Posters of ‘missing Sonia Gandhi appear in Rae Bareli,"



|

A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked the Rae Bareli district magistrate to use her Local Area Development fund to fight coronavirus spread, politics started to hot up in her parliamentary constituency as political opponents tried to raise the issue of her absence during this hour of emergency.

On Friday night, much to the chagrin of Congressmen, posters terming Sonia Gandhi as ‘missing’ from Rae Bareli found their way to the city walls. The posters titled ‘Chitthi na koi sandesh’, questioned the Congress president for not giving any financial aid to her constituency, despite being one of the richest MPs.

The posters further said, “Tumhara haath, nahin hamare saath/sabse badi bhool, tumko kiya kubool” (Your hand is not with us /accepting you was our biggest mistake).

Incidentally, the posters were put up within hours after Sonia Gandhi wrote to the district magistrate of Rae Bareli, asking the officer to draw out funds from her MPLAD fund for combating coronavirus in her constituency.

Surprisingly, those behind this poster war chose not to identify themselves and the posters also did not have the printer’s name, which is mandatory.

Congress Legislative Party leader in upper House, Deepak Singh, criticised the move. “When the opposition parties, especially the Congress, made it clear that this is the time to shun political differences and fight jointly to defeat coronavirus pandemic in the country, a few leaders are still playing dirty politics. These posters only indicate the mindset of the political rivals who are trying to cash in on the emergency situation to settle scores,” Singh asserted.

“Sonia Gandhi has always been connected to her constituency. Just a day ago, she pledged all her (MPLAD) funds for the fight against coronavirus crisis. People of Rae Bareli know the truth and will not be misled by this low level of politics. The Rae Bareli administration should take cognisance of the matter so that the faces of the perpetrators could be exposed,” the Congress MLC said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/posters-of----missing-sonia-gandhi-appear-in-rae-bareli.html
14,30-3-20,Sugar mills revv up sanitiser production,"Even as the domestic cane crushing season (2019-20) continued, sugar mills have simultaneously ramped up hand sanitiser manufacturing capacity to almost 100,000 litres per day to cater to the rising demand due to coronavirus outbreak.

Besides, grain-based distilleries too have revved up an additional capacity of 100,000 litres per day, taking the total capacity to 200,000 litres per day.

Responding to the advisory by Union and UP governments for increasing the production of ethanol/ethyl alcohol based hand sanitisers, sugar mills have moved fast to supplement supply with greenfield facilities at their distilleries.

“The Union and state government departments and agencies, including sugar, excise, drug controllers, have worked in perfect sync leading to speedier sanction of licences and subsequent hand sanitiser production,” said an official of UP Sugar Mills Association.

“While the production data was being collated, nearly 50 sugar mills across India have created sanitiser capacities totalling 100,000 litres per day with the majority producing roughly 2,000 litres each. Those who have already forayed into the segment in Uttar Pradesh, include firms like as Balrampur Chini, Bajaj Hindusthan, Dharmpur, Triveni, Dalmia etc,” the official added.

While, some sugar mills are producing and marketing hand sanitisers or supplying it to other firms for bottling and marketing, others have firmed up contracts to supply its raw material viz. ethanol/ethyl alcohol/extra neutral alcohol (ENA) to external sanitiser units.

Besides, other grain-based distilleries have also set up additional 100,000 litres per day hand sanitiser production capacity to supplement domestic demand.

UP Sugar Mills Association sources said that there were no reports of any disruption in crushing due to lockdown over coronavirus and there was no reason yet to revise the seasonal sugar production estimates pegged at about 33 million tonnes (MT).

The official said there was a little disruption with lime quarries in Rajasthan and lime transportation to mills but that had been sorted out with the intervention of relevant Union and state authorities.

Even as the cane crushing season draws to a close, more than 35 metric tons of sugarcane is still standing in fields across the sugar producing states, especially North India and UP.

“If the lockdown caused disruption in the movement of cane to mills and the transport of sugar to market, it would result in loss to exchequer in the form of payment of compensation to farmers. Therefore, the entire value chain viz. cane, sugar, ethanol etc and also labour have been put under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) providing for seamless operations,” he said.

Most mills are providing temporary stay to labourers and their families inside factory premises so that they did not have to commute outside during the lockdown period.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sugar-mills-revv-up-sanitiser-production.html
15,30-3-20,"Migrants being sent to Purvanchal, Bihar, borders","

Thousands of migrant labourers who arrived on buses in Lucknow from Delhi and National Capital Region of Ghaziabad, Noida and Agra, were being taken to Purvanchal and Bihar border by UP State Road Transport Corporation buses on Sunday.

Lucknow Divisional Commissioner Mukesh Meshram, who was monitoring the situation, said in Lucknow that more than 100 buses had been arranged in the state capital for taking these migrants to Purvanchal and other places on Sunday.

“We have distributed food packets, water and other essentials to the stranded passengers at Alambagh, Charbagh and Kamta bus stations in Lucknow, “ he said.

UPSRTC Managing Director Raj Shekhar too was present at the bus stations to monitor the availability of buses for the passengers.

Earlier, more than 200 buses loaded with migrants from Ghaziabad and other places reached Lucknow early Sunday morning. The migrants were given food packets and water. The incoming people were also checked by doctors at the bus stations and authorities noted down the details of each passenger.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier ordered that these migrants would have to be put in quarantine for 14 days in their native districts before being allowed to go to their homes.

Meanwhile, Ghaziabad district authorities claimed that the problem due to migrant workers eased late Sunday night after around 500 buses were arranged to ferry them to different destinations in the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrants-being-sent-to-purvanchal--bihar--borders.html

As the lockdown exodus continued from Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), four persons died either in mishaps or due to hunger and thirst.

In Agra, a man who had walked over 200 kms from Delhi to the Taj City en route his native village in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, died midway. Ranveer Singh worked as a delivery agent in New Delhi and after the exodus started, he walked from Delhi to Agra and collapsed there. On noticing him, a local shopkeeper tried to stabilise him by offering tea and biscuits. But Singh suffered a heart attack and died.

Elsewhere, in Kannauj, three youths working in Haryana left for their homes on a bike after the lockdown. Early Sunday morning, the youth driving the motorcycle lost control and the two-wheeler hit a road divider in which Basant Giri of Chapra in Bihar died on the spot while two others, Sonu of Chapra and Mohit from Gonda, were critically injured. They were shifted to District Hospital and later referred to medical college in Kanpur.

In another incident in Aligarh, Vinod Tewari (32) of Siddharthnagar used to live with his family in Naveen Vihar Colony of New Delhi and eked out a living by selling biscuits and snacks.

After the lockdown was announced, he found it difficult to make two ends meet and decided to return to his native village. Vinod, his wife and two children left New Delhi on a moped to reach Siddharthnagar. He was accompanied by his Delhi-based brother who was on a separate motorcycle. While passing through Aligarh, Vinod suddenly felt pain in his chest and stopped at Sikendrarau area on Saturday, but collapsed soon after. His brother tried to call an ambulance but the victim died before getting any medical aid.

Surprisingly, the local authorities did not even provide the bereaved family any vehicle to take the body to Siddharthnagar. Later, a social worker came to their rescue and gave Rs 15,000 and arranged a vehicle after which the family left for their native village.

Elsewhere in Moradabad, some workers of a shoe factory in Haryana were returning home on a pickup and as their vehicle was passing through Pakbada locality of Moradabad, one of the labourers, identified as Nitin of Ladupur hamlet of Milak in Rampur, fell from the vehicle as it was overloaded with passengers.

The victim’s brother Pankaj said that they sought help from the police but as no one came to their rescue, his brother died on the spot.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrant-workers-die-in-mishap.html

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the window for the inter-district travel has been withdrawn as part of measures ordered by the Home Ministry to stall the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

The lockdown has to be enforced strictly. This may cause some inconvenience but these measures are in public interest for the containment of the spread of COVID-19, he said. The 7 AM to 1 PM window provided daily for securing essential commodities will continue, he added.

Meanwhile, chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh sent the Home ministry order to all district magistrates, SSPs and other officers concerned for effective implementation. The order states that state governments shall ensure adequate arrangements of temporary shelters and provision of food etc for the poor and needy people, including migrant labourers stranded due to lockdown measures. The migrants who have moved out to reach their home states/home towns, must be kept in the nearest shelter by the state government quarantine facilities after proper screening for a minimum period of 14 days as per standard health protocol. All the employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishments, shall make payment of wages to their workers at their work places, on the due date, without any deduction, for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown. Where ever the workers, including migrants are living in rented accommodation, the landlords of those properties shall not demand payment of rent for a period of one month.

The renowned actor appealed to the people that through social isolation one can fight against Coronavirus and to spread this message among poor people she is distributing food grains including wheat and rice.

Singh informed that the arrangement for essential commodities for poor have not been made by the Government so far due to which black marketers started selling food items and medicine at high prices in the markets. “There is arrangement for one month’s food grains for ration card holders’ in Bihar but those people, who don’t have ration card and they lost their employment due to Lock Down, have no other alternative than suffering. In this situation the Government should take immediate action to sort out their problems,” said Singh.

There are a large number of cases of Thalassemia and Sickle Cell in Jharkhand.

Due to lack of medicines and blood transfusion facility, their problems have increased as parents of the children are facing problem in bringing them to hospitals during the lockdown. According to experts, the children suffering from Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia need medication and blood transfusion every 15 to 20 days.

Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) Blood Bank was providing free 550 units to 600 units’ blood every month to patients suffering from Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia. At present it is giving only 300 units because the blood bank doesn’t have enough blood to give for free. There was only 60 units’ blood available at blood bank on Saturday where 110 units were collected from blood donors.

Due to the ongoing lockdown, the plying of vehicles is prohibited due to which many patients are not able to reach the day-care centers of RIMS and Sadar Hospital from different districts of the State.

At the same time, some people are reaching 100-km distance from their bikes and scooters to show the child at RIMS to get medicine and blood transfusions.

People belonging to below poverty line section of the society are forced to keep children at home. Even after pleading with the District Administration, they are not able to get a vehicle. Director of RIMS Dr Dinesh Kumar Singh informed that such families are calling the office and demanding to provide the vehicle to bring their children to the hospital.

He said that the parents are being asked to contact the local administration.

“On Saturday, three families called and demanded to provide the vehicle from RIMS. At the same time, the patients of Hemophilia are also having difficulty in transfusing the factor. Hemophilia suffering patients are also not able to reach the Hemophilia day-care unit,” said Kumar.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Delhi land lords to cooperate with migrants and don't force them to vacate homes. ""I am requesting to you all (landowners), please don't compel migrants to vacate your houses, we are fighting against corona spread and as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said stay where ever you are, these people should have stayed in homes,"" ""You can ask migrants to pay house rents in installations later as the priority should be to fight against corona, we may lose battle against battle as thousands of people have come out to return their native.""

Appealing landowners and industrials to take care of daily wagers by giving relaxation in paying rent and provide them food, Kejriwal asserted that Delhi Government may take stern action if they force tenants to vacate houses.""

""Request the landlords, do not collect the rent and postpone it if your tenants are poor and are unable to pay the rent. If your tenants fail to give the rent later, my Govt will compensate it. But don't harass the tenants If you have earned wealth, this is the time to use it and help those in need,"" Kejriwal said.

While social distancing method is being encouraged by both Union and State Government conveyed to masses, thousands of migrants were seen leaving their homes and thronged at Anand Vihar inter-state bus stand.

Anticipating the lockdown period may extend, these workers want to spend time with their families as many of them have lost their work due to shutdown of manufacturing chains.

However, the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) has claimed that the Delhi Government has opened schools, stadiums and transferred them into shelters, Kejriwal urged labours not to leave the city as this may trigger Corona spread.

""Beside the distribution of ration, pensions, we have initiated food distribution up to four lakh people daily; Delhi Government is responsible ; we will serve food to all migrants,""Kejriwal assured.

It may be noted that political representatives in Delhi claimed that an announcement had made about the transport facilities at Anand Vihar ISBT for the migrants.

21,30-3-20,28-day paid leave for COVID-19 patients,"Any worker or employee infected with coronavirus and in isolation for treatment will get 28 days of paid leave from their employer across Noida and Greater Noida, the Gautam Buddh Nagar district administration has ordered.

In an order passed late on Saturday night, the administration also said that shops, industries and factories closed because of the lockdown will have to give daily wage along with leave to their workers and labourers during the closure period.

The order has come amid reports of thousands of daily wage earners leaving for their homes, towns and villages due to a 21-day countrywide lockdown called by the Centre.

Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate B N Singh said the Uttar Pradesh government has already declared the pandemic as a ""disaster"" and the lockdown has been called with an objective to contain the virus from spreading.

""Workers and employees who are infected with COVID-19 and kept in isolation for treatment will get 28 days' paid leave. This will be done only when such patients produce a certificate of treatment to their employers upon being discharged as healthy,"" Singh said.

""All such shops, commercial facilities and factories, which have been closed temporarily because of the order of the state government or the district administration, will provide paid leave to their workers and labourers for the duration of the closure,"" he said in the order.

Arrangement should be made by such establishments to dole out the payments to their workers and labourers on March 30 and 31 or April 3 and 4, depending on their situation to make the payment, the order stated.

Singh said he has invoked the powers vested in him as the district magistrate under the National Disaster Management Act 2005 to issue this order and any violation of it would attract legal action against the offender.

Action would be ensured against the offender under Section 51 of the Act which provides for one year of imprisonment or financial penalty or both and two years of jail if violation of the order causes any loss to life or property, according to the order.

People can use the administration's integrated control room number (0120-2544700) to report any related violation, the magistrate said

Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 26 cases of coronavirus of which four patients have been treated and discharged till Saturday, a Health Department official said.

Indian Railways has also offered its unhindered services of parcel trains for nationwide transportation of essential commodities and other goods required to meet the needs of citizens of the nation.

“Transportation of essential items like medical supplies, medical equipment, food, etc in small parcel sizes is going to be very important during the lockdown in the wake of COVID19. In order to fill in this vital need, Indian Railways has made railway parcel vans available for quick mass transportation across the nation for the needy e-commerce entities and other customers including state governments to transport such goods,” it said in a statement.

It may be noted that Ministry of Home Affairs has already removed the restrictions on movement of goods and commodities in the country during the lock down period. “Provision of parcel trains and rapid transportation of goods will further bolster the efficiency of supply chains. The decision to run such trains will help in movement of small quantities as well of essential items viz. Dairy products, medical equipments and medicines, groceries, edible oil and other necessary items etc,” it said.

Different zones of Indian Railways are working out their own plans for running these parcel trains. They are reaching out prospective clients through various modes of communication including advertisements.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/special-parcel-trains-to-ferry-essential-items.html

Delhi Congress president Chaudhary Anil Kumar said “if the Kejriwal Government had done its home work well in time by distribution the food items to the poor and needy at their door step, this situation would not have arisen in which thousands of people have to risk their lives for spread of the coronavirus ( Covid-19) by gathering at a single place like Anand Vihar bus terminal.

The party also released a control room numbers 011-43534325 & 9625777907 for the help of the people during lockdown.

Chaudhary further said that the poor people were charged at higher rates even for going to Anand Vihar bus depot despite the fact that DTC buses were plying empty on the roads.

He demanded that the municipal Corporations should also declare not to charge house tax from C,D,E and F categories along with A and B categories considering the gravity of the matter.

Chaudhary also demanded that the kitchens which prepare mid-day meal should be used to prepare food for poor and needy people and this food should be packed and be distributed to the poor and needy people at their door steps so that these people remain in their houses during the lock down.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-responsible-for-exodus-of-workers--cong.html

46,30-3-20,K’jhar vulnerable as hordes of migrants return,"The minerals-rich Keonjhar district has become vulnerable in the context of the coronavirus spread. The Government has declared mining and industries of chromite, coal, iron ore, manganese and some other minerals as essential, for which the production of all this continues in the district.

With the mining and industrial activities continuing involving thousands of workers, the workers are at a high risk of the disease. Besides, the return of thousands of migrant workers to their villages is another great threat for the spread of the disease.

Earlier studies reveal that about two lakh labourers migrate outside the district for work and it is found many such migrant labourers are back following the nationwide lockdown. But the exact statistics are unknown both to administration or other agencies. Hence, health checkup and other remedial measures for these people are yet to be done. By the time any patient is detected, infection would have spread to thousands in rural areas where the healthcare system is the weakest. Absence of any transport system also makes the situation further grave for the patients to reach the hospitals except by ambulances.

The mining areas of Joda, Barbil and Champua are considered to be more sensitive. According to the district health information centre, only 37 recent travellers have registered themselves through the toll-free No. 104 out of which 10 have completed their quarantine period and 27 are still under home quarantine.

49,30-3-20,Brave leadership in corona era: : Infecting people with positivity & responsibility,"Learning, adapting and collaboratively battling the unforeseen on-the-go. This is the biggest leadership lesson drawn from the Coronavirus pandemic. Online education spurt, remote working, e-commerce is the ‘new reality’—in a time where human contact could mean illness or even death. In this scenario, brave leadership has acquired a new meaning. It’s much more than being reactive or adapting to new technologies for the business-of-life to continue. It’s about every person being a responsible leader in their own right- for their family, friends and co-workers. Brave Leadership today means unshackling the chains of negativity and taking the first steps a new reality. Acknowledging and accepting the new normal and not lamenting over a tragedy but rising above and displaying the mettle of human spirit. It’s about valuing the humane and infecting people with positivity and a sense of responsibility. It is the display of bravery in a cloud of vulnerability.

We are living in fear. This fear is overpowering us. The constant urge to share the latest statistics, news (fake or real), magic cure is making us spread several facts that are often pieces of fickle fiction created by those who are not realising the damage caused. We are playing into these hands and allowing fear to spread. Bring a stop to it. Stop discussing it with all your loved ones. Stop watching TV channels continuously, Stop being the first one to know and spread everything. Do not allow fear to dictate your action. Fear can only win, if we let it.

Who are the Brave Leaders? These leaders care about their people, are gutsy to envision and execute novel idea in a world ravaged by competition for limited resources and the sustainability pressure. These new age ‘mavericks’ are open to ridicule, failure, unseen challenges and are backed with a team of believers who are adaptive, innovative, talented, materialistic, pragmatic but also empathy driven. The recent response of top corporate leaders of India---from providing relief measures to corona patients to feeding the needy—bear testimony to a significant fact. They have shown humanity is transitioning from the age of ‘I’ over ‘We.’Today brave leaders are no longer inaccessible doors, but reflect collaborative mindsets who with their flaws, are human. They are the silent warriors and not the megaphone carriers. Last week as India grappled with Coronavirus’ march across the states, it was not difficult for institutes like Pearl Academy and University of Petroleum and Energy Sciences (UPES) Dehradun to switchover to virtual learning, as they have done this years ago. But this has also been a learning-of-sorts for everyone:Like everyone else across the world, for us also it has underscored the need to be more humane and empathetic, even if its virtual.

Human beings are social entities. With the imposed isolation feelings of dread, anxiety, depression, negativity, loneliness manifesting, swiftly. The question is how much of television, creative activities and books can one read in this time? With the harsh reality unfolding around us, leadership must step up and bolster the morale of everyone including employees, working class, students, faculty, business segments, future changemakers and leaders.

Today, virtual dance parties, fitness classes, stand-up comedy acts, hilarious memes, jokes, amateur family videos etc are manifesting to ensure well-being of humans in a digitally trapped world. These novel ideas have erupted from the minds of people who value people and emotions. These are brave leaders, in themselves

Where there is a mood of despondence around the brave leaders make a change and do for others to follow . Some actions that become important:

. Communicate from the front. Let everyone one that you are there, and they are not alone

. Empathy is important. Let your humane side show

. Break routine workday for live interaction where everyone voices their fears and anxieties.

. Be directive. Crisis needs a leader who can give a clear direction and purpose

. Be there and show the light at the end of the tunnel. The darkness of the tunnel needs to be blinded by the rage of the light

The world around us is beautiful. The smell of roses, the breath of sunshine, the smile of your beloved and the music of your own thoughts are still around you. Open your heart to them with hope and positivity. Let romance, mirth, love triumph over negativity, that is your power. Every morning when you get up make one-person smile – by a joke or a hug (maybe virtual at this time) or perhaps with a look that says ‘My world is beautiful because you are in it. Be grateful and positive and be brave !

56,30-3-20,How to manage stress during corona pandemic,"It’s natural to feel stressed during a difficult time. At present, the whole world is challenged with coronavirus and there are many concerns. Number of people with the infection is increasing fast, so also the number of people who have died of it.

There is no effective treatment or a vaccine, which may get available in sometime in future. Current effective measure of prevention is social distancing and self-isolation, which has led to the secondary issue of a major economic crisis. While Governments are trying to manage by locking down cities and countries, most citizens are also trying to do their best to decrease the spread of the virus. The situation is understandably tense.

In these circumstances, most people may feel stressed. Currently, it has been advised to stay at home, in most countries. It should be reassuring that it will decrease the spread of the virus, decrease the chance of more people getting infected, decrease the load on hospitals so that the healthcare system can cope.

There are various things you can do to manage stress during this unusual times. As many of the relaxing activities outside the home or in social gatherings are not be possible at this time, one can still have ways to deal with the situation. Here are some of the suggestions.

Talking and venting out the worrying thoughts help. Spend time doing some joint activities with family members.

A minimum of 30 minute session a day would be advisable; however, you can go for as much as is comfortable for your body and build it up. You should consider Yoga which is helpful in managing both mind and body optimally.

Take care of the physical health, take the medication regularly and follow the advice for your existing illnesses.

Avoid smoking, taking alcohol, or substances. They do not help in managing stress, rather they create more issues.

Plan the day ahead, as the usual routine is not there at the moment, plan to do some activities which will keep you occupied. Also plan for the days ahead and continue your work for the future. Be an optimist and do not feel hopeless.

Do something that you enjoy; think what you have enjoyed doing in the past and you should be able to find some activities. It is important to keep specific time for these activities in your daily schedule.

Have positive thoughts and actions;think about something positive that has happened to you and your family.

If there is a problem that you are struggling with, seek helpful solutions from family and friends. Sometime it may be helpful to think about all possible solutions, and pick the best one to try first. This exercise is best done by writing the problems and solutions on a paper, rather than keep worrying in the mind.

If you get negative thoughts, challenge them. Reflect with reasons, accurate information, and positivity. Discuss them with your close family members of friends.

If the stress is still a concern, seek expert help. This may be particularly relevant for persons with existing mental illness. Most of them may see the increase in their symptoms during the stressful time.

Anxiety disorder, panic disorder and depression may become more common. Some patients with obsessive compulsive disorder with obsessions of contamination and washing ritual may find the current situation very distressing. Health related anxiety and hypochondriasis may also increase, as people may worry whether they have the coronavirus infection.

Help can be available from a professional internet site, reading about various stress management strategies may give you additional tips; or check if it is possible for the doctors/psychologists to assess and advise over phone or video considering current social distancing measures.

Professional counselling even psychotherapies are available online, sometimes free.

With effective strategies, you can emerge more confident and positive from this stressful time. You may learn new ways of dealing with stress in your own individual specific way.

The fear of community spread of the virus is looming large as a 60-year-old man with no history of travelling abroad tested positive for COVID-19 Thursday and emerged as the State’s third positive case.

Two dedicated hospitals for COVID-19 patients with a total of 950 beds would be set up at the SUM Hospital and the KIMS here. The Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) and the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) would provide financial support.

A similar facility with 700 beds would also be established at Tangi near Cuttack.

The district administration has identified Tata Memorial Hospital, Sitalapalli, Science College at Chhatrapur and Women’s College at Bhanjanagar to convert these facilities as COVID-19 care units.

The third confirmed case having no history of visiting abroad has indicated a possibility of the outbreak moving into stage-3, which is community transmission, said State Government Chief Spokesperson on COVID-19 Subroto Bagchi. What is “really alarming” is that the man visited as many as three hospitals in Bhubaneswar, he pointed out.

Steps are also being taken to put in place a large number of additional beds with proper facilities in other parts of the State for treatment of COVID-19 patients, said a Health Department official.

The Government has set up 7,276 temporary medical camps in all the 6,798 gram panchayats with necessary facilities to tackle any emergent situation, he said.

“To receive the prestigious Filmfare Award has been a dream come true. It is humbling and at the same time also very encouraging to be acknowledged for your hard work. It thrills me to know that people are fond of my voice, enjoy and love listening to my songs,” said the ecstatic singer.

Since starting her musical career in 2007, the singer has come a long way in a short span. In 2009, Rao received the Star Screen Award for ‘Khuda Jaane’ from ‘Bachna ae Haseeno' while in 2014 she got the Global Indian Musical Academy Award for ‘Dum Dum’ from Coke Studio season 2. Rao has also lent her voice to television serials and has got the Indian Television Academy Award for the show ‘Navya Naye Dhadkan Naye Sawaal’ in 2007.

“It’s been more than a decade since I have been a part of this industry and it’s a great learning curve. During this journey seeing the changes and advancement in the music industry has been very enriching. The song ‘Khuda Jaane’ is very close to my heart and so is the number ‘Javeda Zindagi’ from Anwar (2007) which was also my debut song,” added Rao.

Rao has also sung other popular songs like ‘Shabashiyaan’ from Mission Mangal (2019), ‘Kalank duet’ from Kalank (2019), ‘Aaj Jane ki Zidd na karo’ from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), ‘Malang’ from Dhoom 3 (2013) and ‘Gustakh Dil’ from English Vinglish (2012).

Recalling the days when she had started learning singing as a child, Rao said that she had never thought of making a career as a playback singer in the film industry.

“Even though my Dad is a singer, I never wanted to make a career in music. I got an inspiration to learn the art form after I met my mentor Guruji Hariharan and that’s when my journey as a singer began. I am glad that I started learning singing at the age of 10 and after being trained for many years I got an opportunity to be a part of the biggest film fraternity of the world,” she remarked.

Born and brought up in the Steel City, Rao has completed her schooling from Loyola School, Jamshedpur. She also has a post graduate degree in statistics from University of Mumbai.

“I have very fond memories of my days there. I am an absolute foodie and love the local food of the region like litti chokha, pittha and rugra. I also have very fond memories of Jamshedpur with friends and family,” recalled Rao.

The singer feels her parents R Shyamala and SV Rao who now live in Mumbai have been her strength and supporters. “My parents have always encouraged me to do whatever I want and today they are very proud of my achievements. They have always believed in me and somehow knew that I will choose the right path for myself,” said Rao who feels that her parents and Guruji Hariharan have been her biggest inspirations in life.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jamshedpur-girl-bags-filmfare-award-for-best-playback-singer.html

75,30-3-20,Mixed voices on police’s community kitchen in State,"There are mixed voices about police’s community kitchen across the state under directive of the DGP M V Rao.

Sources said Chief Minister Hemant Soren took cue from the police of other states like Delhi, Maharashtra, UP who were shown to be distributing food packets among the people in the streets.

However, sources said the masses in the street were of those people who were away from their work places and were equally far away – some 200 to 400 kilometers – from their native homes. And these masses which were forming a human island in the streets and in transit truly needed to be fed.

Sources said Jharkhand police jumped to make a replica of it here only to find itself locked in a battle against hunger which will continue to gnaw despite such feeding as local hands are reaching the food more than the real stranded people here.

Sources said Jharkhand police are feeding mostly locals and a handful of such people are in a state of transit. A police official requesting anonymity said the purpose behind police’s community kitchen was to feed the hungry in transit but here people have home and roof.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Locals outnumber the people in transit in partaking police food. I know there are around two dozen people from West Bengal’s Malda district who are stranded here in Palamu. I have asked my cops to give them ration to help feed themselves.” Sources said cops gave them dry ration.

Linda said, “Similarly police of Nawa Bazar came across a bunch of daily wagers who were enroute to Bihar on foot. Our police took care of them.”

He said, “I have asked OCs to direct the chowkidars to keep a tab on labourers who have arrived haggardly in their houses falling under chowkidars’ beat to rush food to such travel sore people.”

One of Linda’s deputies Sandip Kumar Gupta said, “Under order of our SP we are trying to segregate the needy people in dire straits to have our food.”

Civil society activists have suggested police to first locate and identify pockets where people are stranded or people who have nothing to survive.

These activists urge police to offload itself from reaching food rather it should go for providing dry ration so that the family may get engaged in preparing food for themselves where there will be less of leftover of food.

Sources said large scale feeding sees no less leftover food too which either is thrown across the roads or are left to rot in open as cattle too do not like it anymore.

One has not as yet heard or seen any action or role of the Red Cross Society either in providing food to the needy or to cater to the medical needs of the people anywhere in the state said civil society activists.

Sources said government’s other departments like forest, mines, irrigation, education, public works department etc are just spectator to this great tragedy only.

Chief secretary designate Sukhdev Singh speaking to the Pioneer said “It is a very challenging time for all of us and together we will face the challenges.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mixed-voices-on-police---s-community-kitchen-in-state.html

He said only the bigger post offices like General Post Office, Head Post Office and Mukhya Dak Ghars may be opened in skeletal mode with minimum number of staff on roster basis keeping in view the guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Unicef and WHO with full preventive measures to provide the basic services. And this can only help to maintain social distancing and contain spread of COVID-19.

Samal said in Odisha, out of 8,172 post offices, all the 6,976 Rural Branch Post Offices and all bigger offices like Mukhya Dak Ghar, Head Post Office, General Post Office numbering 220 are ordered to be kept open. While use of biometric devices has been dispensed with by Government of India, in a recent order issued by the department on March 25, the department has emphasized to ensure financial transactions in biometric mode and for booking and delivery of accountable articles.

The federation said that there is higher risk of infection as 25,000 postal employees working in 8,172 post offices across Odisha are interacting with hundreds of customers daily in each post office at the counters and handling lakhs of mails coming from various sources including foreign mails.

The condition is same for 5 lakh postal employees in 1.55 lakh post offices across the country. The federation said that opening the postal services and booking of articles is meaningless at a time when there is absence of any transport facility including rail, air and road.

After several days in their 'temporary home', the workers were on Saturday ordered to come down by the local administration.

The workers, all residents of Bangidiha village of Purulia district under Balarampur block, said as they live in one-room mud huts with their families, there is no way they can keep themselves in isolation, which is a must to ensure not a single villager contracted the Coronavirus infection from them.

However, none of them have displayed symptoms linked to COVID-19, nor have they undergone any test for the disease.

“At present we don't have any health issues. But in case we are detected positive for the disease at a later date, then at least none of the villagers will be infected because of us,” said one of the workers Bijay Singh Laya.

The workers reached Kharagpur junction station on Sunday last from Chennai and underwent thermal screening and tests but the doctors did not find any symptom of the disease. “However, they asked us to live under self-quarantine for 14 days as a safety measure”.

“But we don't have any separate personal room in our home. So, we decided to live on the branches of the banyan tree just outside our village,” he said.

The seven labourers tied their beds to the branches of the tree, and used a mosquito net to prevent themselves from bites of insects.

Their family members brought them daily ration of rice, pulses, and vegetables, along with other cooking implements and left after keeping those under the tree, while strictly maintaining the norms of social distancing.

“We get down from the tree, cooked, and then again went up,” said one of the workers.

Villagers on their part kept night vigil by turn to ensure the tree-dwellers are not devoured by wild animals from the nearby forest or bitten by venomous snakes.

On Saturday, however, the local administration got to know of the incident, and asked the workers to return to their village and left in isolation there.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wb-migrants-lived-for-days-at-quarantine-centre--banyan-tree.html

With independent sources saying the official number of infections is understated, the spread of COVID-19 could prove devastating for a country whose economy is crippled by hyperinflation and whose social health care systems are crumbling.

Poor rains have exacerbated the crisis, with half of the 15-million-strong population facing severe food shortages.

“We are not against the lockdown,” said Isaac Sayeed, who runs a stationery stall in the capital, Harare.

“But 21 days is rather too long. We already have shortages of basic foodstuffs,” he said.

The looming lockdown has triggered panic-buying and a spike in prices, adding more upward pressure to an inflation rate that currently stands at 540 percent.

Price of cooking gas shot up almost 50 percent overnight.Long queues have formed in supermarkets as people rush to buy whatever they can afford.”

We are supposed to stock up enough things to last us 21 days, but most of us live on what we earn daily, so we only manage a few groceries. I can see us facing tough times ahead,” said Sayeed.

The cash-strapped government will not be able to cushion businesses against the lockdown.

“If they failed to buy ventilators for the treatment centres, where will they get the money to shore up small businesses which are in the majority?” Sayeed asked.

Sayeed said his business would take a knock, but he did not dare ignore the lockdown, which will be imposed with both police and military patrols.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/zimbabwe-braces-for-21-day-lockdown.html
100,30-3-20,"For peace, accept life as it is, dispel fear","Phantasm and illusion are the misapprehensions of life. Reality of life is something very different from all these. In the present scenario, we need to come out of this mirage and frame an existential life. All the human experiences such as anxiety, alienation and depression imply the presence of mental illness in every individual. But the existential psychotherapy sees these experiences as natural stages in a normal process of human development and maturation. In facilitating this process of development and maturation, existentialism involves a philosophical exploration of an individual’s experiences stressing the individual’s freedom and responsibility to facilitate a higher degree of meaning and wellbeing in one’s life.

No matter what happens around the world or in our individual lives, there is always a look for a place of stability. Searching for a purpose or wondering if anything in life really matters or even if they matter, people seek out a sense of identity, an inner knowledge of who they are. There are a few who hunt for a relationship with God, or a deepening sense of spiritual connection in whatever forms that might take. Many search for connection with other human beings, whether that is friendship, deepened intimacy or someone with whom to grow old with. And a few are those who are searching for a way out -- a way out of pain in all its forms, a way out of disappointment, regret, shame, anger, sadness, loss, anxiety and fear, and at times in the mundane too.

There is exploration for other things that are really nothing at all, like the requirement of ample time, more relaxation and more confidence, less stimulation, more beauty, more happiness, information, knowledge or skills. Maybe peace of mind isn’t something we have or we need to find, but something we do nurture and cultivate in ourselves. Maybe, it’s right under our nose.

Living our lives in alignment with what truly matters to us isn’t about searching, trying to be something other than we are. It is living with ourselves, our histories, and going forward to create a life worthy of our time on this planet. That kind of peace is durable.

We end each day with the news that the stock market is tumbling. The number of corona virus cases is increasing.

The reach of the virus is widening. And it’s creating a kind of preemptive hysteria. The root of these thoughts is that they are “negativity bias” of the brain. It’s an evolutionary trait that served us well while living on the savannah thousands of years ago.

Fear sparks a deep desire to be in control. Inner peace comes not from control, but from letting go of the illusion. There is a direct correlation between the intensity of our resistance to this reality and the amount of suffering that we are experiencing.

In this regard, it’s very obvious to remain confused and automatically the stress moves on searching for a point of releasing the depth of anguish in the form of a trust with something that can purify the stress and can add calmness to mind; or else severe anxiety and stress can result in a complete meltdown. This response can cause long-term damage to our health and lower the ability to perform optimally.

At a point, certain degree of mental and emotional detachment is very much essential to start focusing about the peace of mind. To accept what cannot be changed, can bring back a sense of happiness and freedom. Inner peace eventually leads to external peace. By creating peace in one’s inner world and own life, the same inner peace can be easily shared to the external world and to other people’s lives.

When one is composed, sufficiently practiced and self-assured, one is poised for success. A coping strategy needs to be developed where both our mind and heart need to develop the adjustments for a social connectivity. The time is knocking where we need to end the dilemma that we should not lose ourselves in the labyrinth of the little streets.

108,30-3-20,Take more nuanced approach: Rahul to PM,"Extending his and his party’s support in the fight against Covid-19, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to “consider a more nuanced and targeted approach” given the complex realities of people; spell out the timeline for speedy implementation of the financial package announced by the Government, start setting up dedicated hospitals; and engage small and medium businesses and farmers in rebuilding the economy.

He also called for extending the social safety net to support and shelter the working poor.

The former Congress chief in his letter to the Prime Minister urged him to seriously consider the devastating impact a nationwide coronavirus lockdown would have on the people society and the economy.

Rahul said it was critical for the Government to understand that India’s conditions were unique and may be total shutdown may not be necessary as it was likely to create more trouble.

“We may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy,” he said in a three-page letter to PM Modi.

The Congress leader further said that the number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for the government to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. “The consequence of a complete economic shut down will disasterly amplify the death toll arising from the covid-19 virus,” Rahul said.

The Centre last Tuesday had announced a three-week lockdown across the country to break the transmission chain of highly contagious coronavirus. The shutdown was necessary keeping the rising positive Corona cases in mind and during the week it pushed lakhs of migrant and daily wage workers across the country out of job in one stroke.

Rahul's letter comes couple of days later after party chief Sonia Gandhi had extended her party's full cooperation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to combat COVID 19 pandemic. Sonia had though urged the PM for financial package which the government did and addressed the concerns of larger segment of the country particularly the poor people.

It is in this backdrop that Rahul Gandhi too has suggested that the Government should consider a more nuanced a targeted approach that takes the complex realities of Indian people into consideration.

“Millions of India’s elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. This will result in catastrophic loss of life,” Rahul Gandhi said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/take-more-nuanced-approach--rahul-to-pm.html

110,30-3-20,Waive recharge fees of migrants: Priyanka to mobile operators,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday requested the mobile operators to waive off the recharge fees of the citizens, particularly the poor migrants who are criss-crossing the country to reach their destinations amid the coronavirus outbreak.

In separate letters to all the heads of mobile operators, Priyanka said that lakhs of poor people are in transit mode and they don't have even money to feed themselves and thus extending their incoming and outgoing calls validity will certainly help them to stay connected with their near and dear ones in this hour of crisis.

Priyanka wrote to almost all telecom operators like Reliance Jio chief Mukesh Ambani, Airtel’s Sunil Bharti Mittal and Vodafone Idea boss Kumar Mangalam Birla, urging them to make incoming-outgoing calls free on their networks for at least one month for migrant workers during coronavirus lockdown. She has also written to BSNL chief PK Purwar, making the same request.

Congress shared the letters on Twitter. In one such letter to Ambani, she said she was writing to him on humanitarian grounds about the plight of the millions of migrant workers across the country who were trying to find their way home to their families battling hunger, thrust and disease.

She said that it was ‘our national duty to help our countrymen in this hour of crisis’. “There is one way in which your company Jio Telecommunications can make a huge difference at this moment. Many of the people going home have run out of money on their phone recharges. This means they are unable to call their families and their families are unable to receive their calls due to financial and mobility restraints,” Priyanka wrote.

The Congress leader further said urged Mukesh Ambani to make “incoming and outgoing call facilities on your service in the relevant areas available without charge for the next one month”. She wrote similar letters to other service providers such as Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and BSNL. This comes amid reports that thousands of migrant and daily wage workers were trying to rush back to their native places as they had no job in the cities anymore due to complete lockdown.

Taking up the cause of migrants' exodus a day earlier, Priyanka lashed out at the Centre for the ""human tragedy"".

Sharing some photos of thousands of daily wage workers and labourers at Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border on Saturday, waiting in long queues to board buses at the Anand Vihar Interstate Bus Terminal in Delhi, she said ""India deserves better"".

""A human tragedy in the streets of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Anand Vihar. Women, children and the elderly have been left to their own devices.

115,30-3-20,TN positive cases mount to 50,"A total of 50 patients have been tested positive for coronavirus in Tamil Nadu till Sunday evening. Though by late Saturday night, the number of coronavirus cases stood at 42, eight persons who were in contact with religious preachers from Thailand tested positive on Sunday, according to Dr C Vijaya Baskar, Health Minister of Tamil Nadu. All have been admitted to hospitals in Erode district.

The Department of Health officials confirmed that the reason for the death of three patients in Kanyakumari district was not due to corona virus. The news about the deaths had caused anxiety in the minds of people in the district and the disclosure by the administration was welcomed with a sigh of relief. Beela Rajesh, secretary, department of health, told reporters that the Tamil nadu was in stage-2 of COVID 19 transmission. “Our aim is to prevent the progression to stage -3, that is community spread of COVID-19.Stage-2 is when the infection is transmitted to the first-degree contacts of COVID-19 positive patient with travel history,” said Rajesh.

Elsewhere in the State , the Police have tightened the rules governing the total lock down and curfew. Police deployed along thoroughfares and arterial roads were seen pleading with two-wheeler riders who were freaking out on Sunday morning to stay back in their houses and not to come out unless it was unavoidable. The pictures of cops pleading and requesting with the “freekers” have gone viral and this has brought in public sympathy for the law enforcers.

Habitual offenders were asked by the police to perform Thoppukaranam, a kind of brain yoga performed in front of Lord Vinayaga idols in the State. Persons who were caught violating the lock down and social distancing laws were asked to perform the “sit-ins” in Chennai, Tiruchi and other major cities ion the State.

Compared to other south Indian States, Tamil Nadu is doing a commendable job according to health experts and management professionals.

116,30-3-20,"Ramayan re-run gets mixed response in TN, Kerala","Ramayan in the time of corona has brought mixed reactions from people in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The re-run of the popular TV series produced by Ramanand Sagar which was first aired by Doordarshan in 1987 (when terms like satellite TV channels, Direct To Home Service and even local cable TV opetrators were unheard of in these parts of the country) is being telecast by the National channel of the Doordarshan twice in a day.

“Media is hounding us with corona news throughout the day and night. So Ramayan is soothing to our confused state of mind with the impending corona threats hanging over our heads,” said Vijayasree Ramesh, a social activist in Chennai.

But leaders of Dravidian outfits in Tamil Nadu (barring AIADMK) have not taken the telecasting kindly. They accuse the government of spreading communalism and Brahminism through public broadcaster.

“Ramayana spreads unbelievable irrational superstitious stories which make the people idiots and against the constitutional guarantee of scientific thinking which is enshrined in the Constitution of India. Ramayana encourages upper caste and lower caste system in the society. Brahmins are placed at the top and the lower caste soodras are portrayed as untouchables and have been created to serve the Brahmins,” said S Doraisamy, vice president, Thanthai Periyar Dravida Kazhakam, an offshoot of the Dravidian movement launched by E V R Naiker.

In a statement released to the media, Doraisamy said that telecasting of Ramayana was against Constitution of India. “It preaches unequal and slavery treatment to women. The epic encourages illegal intimacies and prostitution. The story itself was authored by Valmiki, a one time thief and sexual offender. Fomerr Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nahru had said that Ramayana was a mythology and fairy tale,” said Doraisamy. According to Doraisamy, Ramayana spreads unbelievable irrational superstitious stories which make the people idiots and it was against the constitutional guarantee of scientific thinking enshrined in the Constitution of India.

Ali Akbar, movie maker and an authority on the great epics rejected the Dravidian theory. “Both Ramayana and Maha Bharat are works authored by depressed classes and both have relevance even now. The allegation that they are promoting Brahminism and Hindutwa is nonsense. Show me an instance in these books which promote communalism or hatred. There are certain forces in India who do not want the new generation to know about Ramayana or Maha Bharata and they are the ones degrading these epic books,” said Akbar.

Jaya Raman, a class nine student in Ernakulam who watched both the episodes aired on Saturday was gung ho and was eagerly waiting for Sunday’s episodes.

“This is the first time I am watching it. I liked the parts in which the four brothers are taught the ancient Indian traditions by Sage Vasisht like getting up early in the morning, respecting one’s mother, father and teacher and to be punctual and disciplined,” he said.

Viewers dependent on local cable operators were in for disappointment as the latter are not relaying the DD National channel in their bouquet. “Only people in cities and towns get to watch all DD channels because they have DTH services. We are at the mercy of local cable operators who decide which channels should be seen by us,” said Palaniswamy of Padavedu village in Thiruvannamalai.

DD Bharati, another channel of Doordarshan is airing Maha Bharat, an equally popular epic serial produced by the House of B R Chopras. With the public broadcaster scheduling to air some of the evergreen serials of the 1980s vintage, there is a general feeling that cautions like 21-days Lock Down, Social Distancing and other restrictions may yield results provided the State electricity boards are in good mood!",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ramayan-re-run-gets-mixed-response-in-tn--kerala.html

In a tweet, actor Richa Chadda urged users of the social media platform to draw attention to the situation in Goa. “Goa needs food supply. Please draw attention to his, tweeple,” Chaddha tweeted on Sunday.

Authors Richa Kaul Padte and Mihir Sharma also highlighted the lack of food and underlined the sense of chaos in the coastal state, which has witnessed panic over lack of supply of essential goods including rice, wheat flour, and cooking oil.

“Journalists, twitter folks, etc: pls.. pls... can you draw attention to what is happening in Goa? We have been on COMPLETE (surprise) lockdown all week. No groceries, no markets, no provisions. cops are patrolling the streets. People have no way to access food. It is getting bad,” Padte said.

“All worrying news out of Goa is odd. It is India's most developed state, it's geographically compact, has a solid welfare system - why is it breaking under lockdown? Why are there no groceries, and why is the CM asking for central paramilitary forces?” Mihir Sharma said. Local resident Lyndon JP, a working professional, paints a grim summary of life in Goa on the eight consecutive day of the lockdown.

“Current situation in Goa: Increase my chances of contracting #COVID_19 or go mad at home due to hunger or go out to get supplies & get beaten by the cops! So many helplines, but no one answers or there's no stock. Thanks for the brilliant organization @goacm #COVID2019india,” Lyndon says.

While smaller 'mom and pop' grocery stores are virtually out of stock in most places, the Chief Minister's decision to shut down major grocery stores super markets and instead bank on a network of politicians and their volunteers to home deliver essentials has further added to the chaos, with allegations of hoarding by ruling politicians creeping in.

“Sir Chairman NDMA, @PMOINdia. Giving control to MLAs in Goa over groceries distribution isnot mitigating but leading to bigger disaster. Pl get @goacm to go by Disaster mgt Act, instead of unleashing CRPF on people,” Goa Aam Aadmi Party convenor Elvis Gomes tweeted.

Both, the state Bharatiya Janata Party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and the Chief Minister Pramod Sawant have urged calm amid the increasing chaos and said that efforts were being made to strengthen the home distribution network.

132,30-3-20,IIT-B develops app to track corona violators,"Amid reports of patients with history of international travel jumping quarantine, the department of the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) of Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has developed a mobile application which can be used by the officials to track violations by the people placed in isolation as a precautionary measure taken to check the spread of coronavirus.

Developed by a CSE team led by Prof. Bhaskaran Raman and Prof. Kameswari Chebrolu, the Mobile App “can potentially be used by officials for checking quarantine adherence”.

“SAFE has 3 dimensions of verification: location, identity, and time. SAFE is capable of detecting cases where the person may leave the phone and go outside quarantine himself/ herself (this is unlike a few “new” solutions for quarantine checking),” Prof Raman and Prof Chebrolu said.

“Also, SAFE is time-tested: it has been in use since the last 5 years, and has been used for classroom attendance by thousands of students in various courses,” they said.

“The SAFE is ready for deployment. The IITB team will provide support free of cost. The personal data collected (name, email, selfie photos, location) in SAFE are sensitive. The data must be accessed only by explicitly authorized personnel. The data must not be revealed to the public through any means. The data must be used ONLY for the purpose of verifying quarantine adherence,” the two professors said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/iit-b-develops-app-to-track-corona-violators.html
133,30-3-20,"Forces out to create unrest, say CM on migrant workers hitting streets in Kerala","As migrant workers his roads in the State violating lockdown, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said there was a conspiracy behind it and lashed out at “forces” which were trying to create unrest in the society by provoking the working class during the coronavirus pandemic.

Hundreds of migrant workers in Chenganassery in Kottayam district came out on the street, violating the 21-day lockdown restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, demanding that arrangements be made for their travel to native villages in northern States. Vijayan said all arrangements have been made for medical assistance to them and the government was constantly engaging with the “guest workers”, as he calls them, to ensure their well-being.

“Yet there were attempts to stir up misunderstandings among them and it’s a move against the State,” Vijayan said adding that there “are clear indications about those forces” which had “misled and provoked” the working class.

He requested such people to “stay away from the heinous acts challenging people during the period of crisis”.

The Chief Minister said such an incident should have never happened in the State which has “extra care and concern” for the guest workers.

He also said a senior IAS official has been assigned to coordinate the efforts and the state has opened 4,603 camps where 1,44,145 guest workers are lodged.

“In one place, some workers have expressed a desire to travel to their home states. Unfortunately, this is not possible since we are in a nationwide lockdown. Traveling at this juncture will be dangerous and counter-productive to our efforts against Covid-19,” Vijayan said in a tweet.

In a statement issued later, he said those who conspired to gather the guest workers in the street will be brought before justice.

“The Prime Minister had declared that none should travel and asked everyone to stay wherever they are. We cannot allow them to travel back and everyone knows it. We need to identify those who stirred up hopes, among the guest workers, that they could go home,” Vijayan said.

He said it was the responsibility of the contractors to provide food and accommodation to the labourers, but still the State has been taking care of it for many in this period of crisis. “Kerala, a state which performs well in health support, cannot accept such acts by which a group of people taking it to the streets and that too without the mandatory social distancing during this Covid-19 scare. We will take steps to ensure that such incidents would not be repeated,” he said.

Vijayan said the state hosts a large number of workers from other States and “considers them as guest workers”.

“Kerala has opened 4603 camps for the state’s guest workers. 1,44,145 guest workers are in these facilities. Masks, soaps and sanitisers have been made available in these Covid-19 camps,” he said.

Community kitchens were providing free cooked meals in locations across the State and in other places the authorities have delivered provisions to the workers. He also said that in order to create awareness among the guest workers, brochures and short videos in Hindi, Odia and Bengali languages are being circulated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/forces-out-to-create-unrest---say-cm-on-migrant-workers-hitting-streets-in-kerala.html
134,30-3-20,India to grow fastest among G20 economies: Report,"India will emerge as the fastest growing economy among the G20 countries even as Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has slashed Indias GDP growth forecast to 2.1 per cent from 6 per cent in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.

India’s growth at just 2.1 per cent may be a huge downgrade but given the projected recession in other regions like the US, Europe and Latin America, India will show the highest rate of GDP growth and will be only among three countries in G20 along with China and Indonesia, both at 1 per cent growth, to avoid a recession this year. Italy will be the worst hit at a negative growth of 7 per cent.

The EIU said in a report that Covid-19 is likely to send almost all G20 countries into a recession.

“Following the coronavirus outbreak, we have revised our growth forecasts for all countries across the world. The results paint a bleak picture. Across the G20, all but three countries will register a recession this year. The global economy will contract by 2.2 per cent,” it said.

The EIU has called the picture “bleak” and any recovery may be hit by future waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The global economic picture is looking bleak, with recessions in almost every developed economy across the world. We assume that there will be a recovery in the second half of the year, but downside risks to this baseline scenario are extremely high, as the emergence of second, or third waves of the epidemic would sink growth further,” the EIU said.

It has also warned of an impending debt crisis and no clear exit strategy from the lockdowns.

“At this stage, it is also hard to see an exit strategy from the lockdowns, which means that uncertainty will remain high. Finally, the combination of lower fiscal revenues and higher public spending will put many countries on the brink of a debt crisis,” Agathe Demarais, EIU’S Global Forecasting Director, said.

The EIU has forecast that the US economy will contract by 2.8 per cent this year. The administration’s initial response to the coronavirus was poor, allowing the illness to spread quickly.

“This puts Donald Trump’s re-election bid at risk, as unemployment looks set to rise sharply,” the EIU said.

The impact on China’s economy of the Covid-19 outbreak is set to be much deeper than that of SARS. Assuming that the virus does not flare up again, the EIU expects China’s real GDP growth to stand at only 1 per cent in 2020, compared to an estimated 6.1 per cent in 2019.

The eurozone will be one of the hardest hit regions, posting a full-year recession of 5.9 per cent. Germany (-6.8 per cent), France (-5 per cent) and Italy (-7 per cent) will register full-year recessions.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-to-grow-fastest-among-g20-economies--report.html

On average, the daily supply of cooking gas has gone up by at least 35-40 per cent since the lockdown, in spite of working with minimal staff, the companies said.

The collective assurance of uninterrupted supplies of all oil products, especially LPG cylinders, by Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL, come amidst panic booking of cooking gas by consumers since the national lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.

This, coupled with staff shortage, has led to some delays in the initial days of the lockdown but now it has been normalised, they added.Talking to PTI in Mumbai on Su shortage of any oil products at all. All the more let me assure that there is absolutely no shortage of LPG at all. In fact, our LPG plants are working at over capacity to meet any spike in demand. I request all not to engage in panic booking of cooking gas,” Surana said.

Explaining how HPCL has augmented LPG supplies, he said at the national level the daily supply has gone from 12 lakh cylinders to 15 lakh a day for his company.

In Mumbai, HPCL has supplied 56 per cent more cylinders on Saturday, from 34,000 to 51,000, while in Pune the spike in supplies is 54 per cent, he added. Surana also said, HPCL has equipped all its delivery boys with masks, sanitisers and also trained them in social distancing.

The production is likely to be at 602-603 million tonne in 2019-20, they said.

The miner is also likely to witness a decline in off- take in the current fiscal as compared to its 608 million tonne supply in the previous year, they said.

“Till March 28, the coal output was 591 million tonne and the company is likely to produce another 12 million tonne in the next three days, given the average output trend at present,” sources told PTI.

Of late, the miner had ramped up daily production to reach closer to its target, they said. Coal India had set an ambitious target of 660 million tonne of production and off-take for FY’20.

“The off-take was at 576.80 million tonne till March 28, registering a decline of 4 per cent over last year,” the sources said.

The coal behemoth had supplied 608 million tonne of dry fuel to its consumers during 2018-19.

The coal off-take was less than what was projected in the current year due to a slowdown in the economy and as a result of which, the pit-head stock increased, they said, adding that the coal production was also hit by prolonged monsoon this year.

Of its seven coal producing subsidiaries, Northern Coalfields and Western Coalfields, however, had already surpassed their respective annual production target.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coal-india-may-register-de-growth-in-fy---20.html

In letters which will arrive through the post for nearly 30 million homes along with a leaflet outlining the UK government’s advice, at an estimated cost of 5.8 million pound, Johnson says he will not hesitate to impose stricter measures.

The British Prime Minister, who has been working from home with mild symptoms, warned that things are set to get worse before they start getting better as the UK’s death toll from the outbreak crossed the 1,000 mark to hit 1,019, with a further 260 deaths and 17,089 confirmed cases logged on Saturday.

“It’s important for me to level with you – we know things will get worse before they get better. But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal,” Johnson says in his letter to the nation.

“From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do,” his letter reads.

The 55-year-old Conservative Party leader goes on to express his gratitude to everyone who is “working flat out to beat the virus”, including the “truly inspirational” doctors, nurses and other carers.

“Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,” he adds.

The letter outlines the guidance everyone should follow and the measures the government has put in place to fight coronavirus and to support businesses and workers. The accompanying leaflet contains UK-wide information as well as directions about where to access online guidance specific to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

It includes clear explanations of symptoms, hand washing guidance, rules on leaving the house, self-isolating with symptoms and shielding vulnerable people.

The number of deaths late Saturday was 2,010, about a quarter of them in New York City, the country’s hardest-hit region, Johns Hopkins reported.

Confirmed cases in the United States topped 121,000, according to the tally. The surge came as President Donald Trump said he was considering a quarantine on the greater New York area to slow the disease’s move from the US epicentre.

New York has reported more than 52,000 cases, and 517 of the US deaths were in New York City.

“There’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short-term, two weeks — on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” Trump said, adding that it was important to protect Florida, a favourite winter destination for people in the northeast.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo objected to the idea, which he said Trump had not discussed with him.

“If you said we’re geographically confining people, that would be a lockdown. Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldn’t make sense,” Cuomo told CNN, referring to the city in central China where the virus outbreak began, which was almost totally isolated by Beijing.

Simon said that six out of a total 17 regions “have reached their capacity limit and three more are fast approaching that stage.” The toughening of the current lockdown conditions should help the situation, he added Spain also reported Sunday that 14,709 people had been cured of COVID-19, a rise of 19.7 percent in 24 hours.

“We’re going to have millions of cases,” he said.

149,30-3-20,Iran warns of lengthy ‘new way of life’ as virus deaths rise,"President Hassan Rouhani warned Sunday that “the new way of life” in Iran was likely to be prolonged, as its declared death toll from the novel coronavirus rose to 2,640.

The Islamic republic is one of the countries worst-hit by the virus, which first originated in China.

Iran announced its first infection cases on February 19, but a senior health official has acknowledged that the virus was likely to have already reached Iran in January.

At his daily news briefing, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 123 more people in Iran had died from the virus in the past 24 hours.

He reported 2,901 new cases of COVID-19 infection, bringing the overall number of officially confirmed cases to 38,309.

According to the official, 12,391 of those hospitalised have recovered and 3,467 are in “critical” condition.

“We must prepare to live with this virus until a treatment or vaccine is discovered, which has not yet happened to date,” President Hassan Rouhani said in a cabinet meeting.

“The new way of life we have adopted” is to everyone’s benefit, he said, adding that “these changes will likely have to stay in place for some time”.

After weeks of refraining from imposing lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided Wednesday to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.

Without an official lockdown in place, the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay home “as much as possible”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-warns-of-lengthy----new-way-of-life-----as-virus-deaths-rise.html
150,30-3-20,Virus makes it harder for campaigns to ask for money,"White House candidates aren’t usually bashful about asking supporters for money.

But as the coronavirus upends everyday life, inundating hospitals, tanking financial markets and putting 3.3 million Americans out of work, President Donald Trump and his likely Democratic rival, Joe Biden, suddenly find themselves navigating perilous terrain.

What used to be a routine request for political cash could now come across as tone-deaf or tacky. The two also run the risk of competing for limited dollars with charities trying to raise money for pandemic relief. With a recession potentially on the horizon, there’s a question of whether wealthy donors are in a giving mood and whether grassroots supporters who chip in small amounts will still have the wherewithal to keep at it.

That presents a delicate challenge as both candidates try to stockpile the massive amounts of cash needed for the general election campaign.

“It’s hard to have a conversation with someone right now to ask how they’re getting by, and then ask them for financial support in the next sentence,” said Greg Goddard, a Democratic fundraiser who worked for Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaign before the Minnesota senator dropped out of the Democratic race.

To Tim Lim, a Democratic consultant who worked for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, “it’s a world where no one has a good answer.’’

He said that “on the fundraising side, we are going to take some massive hits as a party.” The task is particularly acute for Biden.

The former vice president is trying to pivot from the primary to the general election in a race essentially frozen by the virus. He lacks Trump’s reelection cash reserves, which were built up over the past three years of his presidency. Biden also has yet to clinch the nomination and won’t be able to do so until postponed primary contests are held in the months ahead.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his sole remaining 2020 rival, has given no indication that he will back out, despite Biden’s virtually insurmountable lead in the delegate race. The pandemic has put all big-dollar fundraisers on hold, like all in-person political events. That’s forced Trump and Biden, for now, to rely on online fundraising.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-makes-it-harder-for-campaigns-to-ask-for-money.html
151,30-3-20,"Mali votes despite virus, security fears","Malians voted in a long-delayed parliamentary election on Sunday, barely a day after the country recorded its first coronavirus death and with the leading opposition figure kidnapped and believed to be in the hands of jihadists.

There were security fears about the vote to elect new MPs to the 147-seat National Assembly even before the war-torn West African country recorded its first coronavirus infection on Wednesday.

But then late Saturday, just hours before polls opened at 0800 GMT Sunday, the country’s first coronavirus death was announced -- a 71-year-old man recently returned from France.

“I came to vote, but I’m afraid,” said Souleymane Diallo, a 34-year-old teacher voting in the capital Bamako.

“As you can see there’s nobody here. Maybe because it’s the morning, but it’s also not surprising because of the situation.” There are fears that the impoverished state of some 19 million people — where large swathes of territory lie outside state control — is particularly exposed to a COVID-19 outbreak.

Prime Minister Boubou Cisse admitted that turnout was not very large so far.

“I appeal to the voters: remember to respect the barrier gestures and use the sanitary measures,” he said as he voted, adding that turnout was “sufficiently satisfactory”.

It is the country’s first parliamentary poll since 2013, when President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s Rally for Mali party won a substantial majority.

Parliamentary elections were meant to take place again in late 2018 following Keita’s re-election, but the poll was postponed several times, largely due to security concerns.

Some 200,000 people displaced by the near-daily violence in Mali’s centre and north will not be able to vote, a government official has said.

Very few people showed up to polling stations in the northern city of Timbuktu in the morning, but attendance had somewhat increased by midday, an AFP reporter observed.

While the distance between people in lines was too close, voters did wash their hands before entering polling stations, the reporter said.

Polls are to close for Sunday’s first round vote at 1800 GMT, with first results not expected for several days. A second round is scheduled for April 19.

Casting a shadow over the vote is the fate of veteran opposition leader Soumaila Cisse, who was kidnapped on Wednesday while campaigning in the centre of the country.

Cisse, 70, who has been runner-up in three presidential elections, and six members of his team were abducted in an attack in which his bodyguard was killed.

It is “likely” he was being held by jihadists loyal to Fulani preacher Amadou Koufa, who leads a branch of the al-Qaeda-aligned GSIM active in the Sahel, according to a security source and a local official.

Cisse and his entourage were probably now “far from where they were abducted,” the security source told AFP.

The government’s election spokesman, Amini Belko Maiga, has admitted that voting conditions were not ideal.

“It’s true that we cannot say that everything is perfect, but we’re doing the maximum,” he said, referring to the threat of coronavirus.

He added that hand-washing kits had been distributed in the countryside, while in Bamako, authorities would make masks and hand sanitisers available.

Cisse’s Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) on Saturday urged its supporters to turn out in even greater numbers in reponse to the leader’s ordeal.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/mali-votes-despite-virus--security-fears.html
152,30-3-20,US-led forces pull out of 3rd Iraqi base this month,"The US-led coalition withdrew on Sunday from a military base in northern Iraq that nearly launched Washington into an open war with neighbouring Iran.

The K1 Air Base is the third site coalition forces have left this month in line with US plans to consolidate its troops in two locations in Iraq.

A rocket attack on the base in late December killed one American contractor and lead to a series of tit-for-tat attacks between the US and Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups.

The attacks culminated in the US-directed killing of top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Coalition forces handed over the K1 air base in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk to Iraq’s military, according to a coalition statement.

At least USD 1.1 million of equipment was transferred to the Iraqis as 300 coalition personnel departed.

K1 has hosted coalition forces since 2017 to launch operations against the Islamic State group in the nearby mountainous areas.

Areas south of Kirkuk, and north of neighboring provinces of Diyala, Salahaddin and Nineveh remain hot beds of IS activity.

The stretch of territory is also disputed between the federal Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which has created security gaps benefiting IS militants.

The coalition’s presence had at times been a mediating presence between the two competing authorities.

A senior coalition official earlier this month claimed IS forces weren’t as able to exploit the “security gap” between Iraqi and Kurdish forces as the militants did in the past.

“That doesn’t necessarily mean that Daesh is free to operate in the way that they wish,” said the official, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group.

“They’re still pretty constrained.” The coalition official was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

154,30-3-20,Born free but in chains,"Shalu Agarwal documents the journey of a young girl’s fight against honour killings in western Uttar Pradesh

The sun was out, not in its blazing glory but tentatively, as the four men convicted in the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young paramedical student were hanged on Friday, March 20. The execution received mixed reactions from people of different school of thoughts. Many hailed the decision and celebrated the hanging as a step towards justice while others believed that death penalty doesn’t ensure that crimes against women will decrease.

The national data on crime released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 2019 reports that while the incidence of rape has reduced, the overall crime against women continue to rise. The cases of rapes reduced from 63 per million people in 2016 to 52 per million in 2017. But a total of 3.5 lakh cases of crime against women were registered including murder, rape, dowry death, suicide abetment, acid attack and kidnapping. In these crimes, however, no data was provided for honour killings, which means murdering young couples for marrying outside their caste and community. These crimes attack the concept of love and the idea of women’s autonomy in our country.

With increased awareness, many organisations and people from different strata have started raising their voice against these crimes that find their roots in our patriarchal system. Adding strength to such efforts is the voice of a group of young girls in western Uttar Pradesh, which had reported 16 cases of honour killing in 2016. The idea behind forming this ‘Army’ — as they like to call it is to ensure safety of girls who choose to love.

According to these girls, if a boy marries outside his community, he is often spared by their families but when a girl exercises her freedom to choose her life partner, parents either kill her or her partner and in many cases — both.

The group known as ‘War Against Honour Killing’ was started by Nisha along with her friends in the Kankerkhera area of Meerut city. Nisha, a student who works part time, believes that our society has always discriminated against women who are subjected to inhumane atrocities whenever they demand fair and equal treatment. She questions these atrocities. “Is choosing life partners on their own such a big crime for our society that they prefer murdering their own daughters? The whole purpose behind establishing ‘War Against Honour Killing’ is to ensure that we stop this heinous crime. I lost two of my dear friends to this unjust practice. No one listened to them as their parents murdered them mercilessly. Even the police did not take any action against them. I want to make sure that no other girl is killed. This is a war against all those parents who have murdered girls just for choosing a free life,” shares Nisha.

As expected, when she had started the group, the first resistance had come from her own family. The whole idea of questioning the patriarchal social norms and talking about rights of girls was rejected by her family. “My family is a part of the system and the idea of women being a second-class citizen is so deeply rooted in their lives that they could do anything to stop me from getting down to streets and challenging this patriarchal system,” says Nisha. When they couldn’t stop her, they tried to stop her friends from supporting her.

“Her parents tried to stop us from participating in the initiative. They said that we will get trapped in this mess,” Nisha’s friends share. But gradually the families too came around after seeing the immense courage these young girls showed.

Today, 70 people from different walks of life are a part of this group of which more than 30 are young, fearless girls like Nisha. Besides organising rallies, protests and awareness campaigns, this group has also started utilising the social media platforms to create awareness among masses. The initiative has received a fair share of both criticism and appreciation from different people at different levels. More people are getting associated with the cause. Students from schools, colleges, coaching institutes along with working girls and boys have joined in the efforts.

What Nisha started as a personal fight for justice for her friend has today become a symbol of hope for many young girls in the conservative society.

155,30-3-20,Listen without prejudice,"When opportunity knocks at the door of a biased person, he does not answer or open the door, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

It’s a fact that most of us are prejudiced or have an opinion on everything even before knowing the actual facts. One of the earliest psychological explanations of prejudice is described as — an antipathy based on faulty and inflexible generalisation towards a group as a whole or towards an individual because they are a member of that group. The first thing that this explanation tells us is that prejudice is not something logical but rather based on a series of assumptions, half-truths and guesses. Second, it tells us that prejudice is based on generalisation — on a whole host of characteristics and qualities that we assume a person has, based purely on the fact that he or she is a member of a particular group.

We often talk of giving up anger, ego, pride and attachment but, perhaps, we do not put proper emphasis on giving up prejudice, biases and jealousy. In practical life, however, we find that because of biases and prejudice, a person does not listen to spiritual knowledge and, if at all he does, he looks at it with suspicion, fear, hatred or a feeling of opposition. Many a times, he misinterprets and criticises it unjustifiably. The result is that the person does not derive benefit from such precious knowledge even if he is offered this with love and goodwill. He disregards this offer and considers it as a strategy of some selfish people.

The opportunity knocks at the door of this prejudiced and biased person but he does not answer or open the door. Not only does he reject fortune so graciously offered to him but he does not allow others to grab the gift as well. The doctors may not be able to identify the virus that has infected his mind because a prejudiced person does not consider himself to be a patient and opposes all attempts to cure him. However, we cannot leave him in the cruel hands of the strange disease. We have to perform the operation rescue in the moral theatre of virtues with the surgical instruments of yoga after putting him on anaesthesia of love and glucose of good-will. Later, treating him with the curative preparations made from spiritual knowledge and using the therapy called yoga.

Jealousy too, like prejudice, is a dangerous disease. A jealous person cannot digest facts of life nor can he tolerate the truth. It weakens a person’s soul so much so that he cannot stand it when he hears that another person has been praised. Isn’t it a strange disorder, which reduces one’s level of tolerance and appreciation or approval when it should actually enhance it? The news of another person’s success causes nausea and spoils his mood. He becomes a person who suffers from the toxin, called ‘selfishness’. Such a person is always sulking, fretting and fuming. He is in a pressure-cooker, making hissing sounds and whistling as he is boiling in the steam of jealousy. He wants peace and, unlike a prejudiced person, he wants to be cured or relieved. Meditation helps him feel relieved and it builds in him a reservoir of goodwill and love that finally cures him of jealousy which is the generator or sustainer of hatred. If a person wants to be free of hatred, he has to banish jealousy because this emotion cannot live with peace. Universal love is the antidote to jealousy. It can be generated and nourished only through meditation. So let’s start meditating from today.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/listen-without-prejudice-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/listen-without-prejudice.html
156,30-3-20,How to train plants?,"Experts say that red currant espaliers need pruning twice a year. In contrast, pear or apple espaliers require monthly or more frequent sessions

Espalier is a way of training and pruning plants so their branches lie in an orderly and ornamental two-dimensional form. The beauty comes from the tracery of the branches. It is a way to create a living border in a garden or decorate a fence or wall.

Hang fruit on those branches and you have a plant offering superb flavour as well as beauty. The reason for that good flavour is that the espalier form allows leaves and fruits to bathe in light and air. Espaliers have a long tradition in northern Europe, and have mostly been applied to apples and pears. In North America, the climates and day lengths are quite different, and so attempts at espalier here often fall short of expectations. Sure, you can bend branches in all sorts of designs but they won’t be thoroughly clothed in the requisite flowers and then fruits.

ESPALIERS THAT WORK HERE

No need to abandon espalier on this side of the Atlantic: One fruit plant that works very well as an espalier everywhere is red currant. Red currant espaliers have the additional advantage of only needing pruning two times per year. In contrast, pear or apple espaliers require monthly or more frequent pruning sessions.

A real plus for red currant espaliers is their fruits. They’re beautiful! The bright red fruits, dangling from the branches like translucent, red jewels, add much to the show. The espalier technique I will describe can also be applied to white currants and gooseberries.

My red currant espaliers decorate the fence enclosing my vegetable garden. Each currant plant is trained to the shape of a T, with a single trunk capped by two fruiting arms that grow in opposite directions along the fence, which provides support.

HOW PLANTS TICK

Knowing a little about what makes plants tick helps in growing an espalier, and makes doing so all the more interesting.

“Apical dominance” is the tendency for the uppermost shoots on any plant to grow strongest. Plant hormones, produced in the growing tips of upright stems and at the high points of arching stems, suppress growth of shoots lower down.

By merely changing the orientation of a stem you can influence how strongly various parts of that stem grows. The plant also has a say in this, and may turn a growing stem upwards in an attempt to gain apical dominance over other stems.

Also keep in mind that horizontally oriented stems are weaker growing, more fruitful, and develop more side branches than vertically oriented stems.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION

Use these concepts in training and maintaining any espalier. To initially develop a strong trunk on my red currant, I chose the strongest shoot on my plant, removed all others, and then tied that retained shoot to the fence to keep it upright and vigorous.

Once this trunk-to-be grew just above the top of the three-foot-high fence, I cut its top back to the three-foot height, releasing the remaining buds from the suppressing effect of apical dominance. I selected two shoots that started to grow from the upper portion of the trunk to become fruiting arms, training them along the fence in opposite directions and removing all others.

To keep these developing arms growing vigorously, I left their ends free to turn upwards as I tied portions closest to the trunk to a horizontal position. As the shoots lengthened, I kept tying down the older portions.

Maintenance pruning and fruiting began even as arms were developing. The arms, because of their horizontal orientation, exhibit little apical dominance, so side branches develop freely.

Two simple cuts keep the form neat while encouraging abundant fruit production. First, just before the berries start reddening, I cut each side branch back to about five inches long. I perform the second cut in winter, cutting those side branches back again, this time to about an inch.

The only problem I have with my red currant espaliers, which hang onto their beautiful berries for weeks, is picking the fruits. To do so would ruin the plants’ appearance, so I don’t. I have some other plants, growing as bushes, for the fruit harvest.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-to-train-plants--2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/how-to-train-plants-.html
157,30-3-20,BFI start online coaching for Olympic-bound boxers,"Their training halted by the coronavirus-forced national lockdown, India’s Olympic-bound boxers will be provided online classes by their coaches from Monday to ensure that aspects such as mental well-being and nutrition are taken care of.

Nine Indian boxers — M C Mary Kom (51kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Lovlina Borgohani (69kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Manish Kaushik (63kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg) — have qualified for the Tokyo Games, postponed to 2021 due to the global pandemic.

In a conference call with these boxers on Sunday, Boxing Federation of India (BFI) President Ajay Singh took stock of their preparations amid a national lockdown till April 14 to fight the pandemic.

“This is a challenging time for all of us and is all the more a reason for us to take care of ourselves...Stay fit, continue with the exercises as directed by the coaches and try to maintain your weights as much as possible,” Singh told the boxers.

“We will tide over this crisis soon and get back to the ring but staying motivated in the meantime is absolutely necessary,” he added.

Elaborating further on the 45-minute discussion, BFI’s Executive Director R K Sacheti said that the areas of concern are diet control and mental health.

“They are at their homes right now where diet can go for a toss. So the idea behind these online classes starting tomorrow (Monday) is to ensure that they are kept aware of their nutritional needs,” he said.

Sacheti said India boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva, who is now in Patiala after completing a 14-day self-isolation period in Delhi, will be conducting classes for men.

The classes for women will be conducted by their high performance director Rafaelle Bergamasco.

“Santiago is the only boxing coach who is in Patiala right now. He will have access to the boxing hall where he will educate the boxers on technicalities. The idea is to keep them connected and aware,” he said.

“We hope things improve and the lockdown ends but we can’t start from the scratch when that happens. We have to have something going so that when it ends, there is a seamless transtion,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bfi-start-online-coaching-for-olympic-bound-boxers.html

159,30-3-20,Tokyo organisers eye July 2021 for delayed Olympics,"Tokyo Olympics organisers are eyeing next July as a start date for the postponed Games, Japanese media reported on Sunday.

Given the ongoing pandemic and need for preparation time, the most likely plan would be for the Games to begin on July 23, 2021, public broadcaster NHK said, citing sources within the organising panel.

It came after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike raised the idea on Friday of moving the event to a less hot and humid time of year.

She argued that this would make marathons and other races easier to endure, meaning they could be held in the capital instead of in northern Sapporo city, where the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had decided to move them.

The Tokyo 2020 team led by Yoshiro Mori is currently discussing possible dates with the IOC, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.

On Saturday, Mori told a Japanese TV station that “some kind of conclusion” would be reached within a week.

The Olympics were scheduled to open on July 24 this year with the Paralympics on August 25, but Japan announced last week it had secured agreement from the IOC to postpone the Games — a decision unprecedented in peacetime.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they would be held in around a year instead as a testament to humanity’s victory over the pandemic.

The decision had been seen to open options for Tokyo, with IOC chief Thomas Bach saying that “all the options are on the table” and rescheduling “is not restricted just to the summer months”.

Meanwhile, NHK said the Olympic flame would be displayed for a month at the J-Village sports complex in Fukushima, which was used as a base camp for thousands of relief workers in radiation protection suits during the 2011 nuclear disaster.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tokyo-organisers-eye-july-2021-for-delayed-olympics.html

161,30-3-20,"Saudi intercepts Huthi missiles over curfew-locked Riyadh, border city","Saudi air defences intercepted Yemeni rebel missiles over Riyadh and a city on the Yemen border, leaving two civilians wounded in the curfew-locked capital amid efforts to combat coronavirus, state media said on Sunday.

Multiple explosions shook Riyadh late Saturday in the first major assault on Saudi Arabia since the Huthi rebels offered last September to halt attacks on the kingdom after devastating twin strikes on Saudi oil installations.

The Iran-aligned insurgents claimed responsibility around 15 hours after the attacks, with a rebel spokesman calling it “the largest operation of its kind” as the Riyadh-led military intervention in Yemen enters its sixth year.

“Two ballistic missiles were launched towards the cities of Riyadh and Jizan,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing the Saudi-led coalition that is fighting the rebels in Yemen.

Their interception sent shrapnel raining on residential neighbourhoods in the cities, leaving two civilians injured in Riyadh, a civil defence spokesman said in a separate statement released by SPA.

At least three blasts rocked the capital, which is under a 15-hour-per-day coronavirus curfew, just before midnight, said AFP reporters. Jizan, like many other Saudi cities, faces a shorter dusk-to-dawn curfew.

The Huthi spokesman said the rebels struck “sensitive targets” in Riyadh with long-range Zolfaghar missiles and Sammad-3 drones.

The rebels also claimed to have hit “economic and military targets” in the border regions of Jizan, Najran and Assir.

The assault comes despite a show of support on Thursday by all of Yemen’s warring parties for a United Nations call for a ceasefire to protect civilians from the coronavirus pandemic.

Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni government and the Huthi rebels all welcomed an appeal from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for an “immediate global ceasefire” to help avert disaster for vulnerable people in conflict zones.

The call coincided with the fifth anniversary of Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen’s civil war, which was launched to shore up the internationally recognised government against the Huthis.

Yemen’s Government condemned the attack, which it said undermined efforts to scale down the conflict amid the coronavirus outbreak. Information Minister Moammer al-Eryani said in a tweet that the strikes also confirmed the “continued flow of Iranian weapons” to the Huthi militias.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi-intercepts-huthi-missiles-over-curfew-locked-riyadh--border-city.html

“The national Attorney General learned that Mr Cliver Alcala surrendered to US authorities,” the Colombian prosecutor said in a statement, adding there was no arrest warrant when he gave himself up.

Alcala turned himself in on Friday to the Colombians, who in turn handed him over to US authorities, the El Tiempo de Bogota newspaper said.

He is among several current and former top Venezuelan Government officials, along with Maduro, indicted by Washington on Thursday for “narco-terrorism.” The US offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture.

164,30-3-20,Interpreter of classics,"AND Haksar, a former diplomat, has become synonymous with translations of lesser-known Sanskrit texts. In conversation with Saimi Sattar about his new book Chanakya Niti, he discusses what spurs him on and how he embarked on this journey after retirement

The tones are clipped. Every syllable carefully pronounced. The accent is old school. It is during the lockdown that I connect over a phone call with Aditya Narayan Dhairyasheel Haksar, the well-known translator of Sanskrit works. Over the call, he tells me that he has found the quietest corner to sit down for the conversation so that we can proceed unhindered and undisturbed. When another phone threatens to invade the carefully cultivated mindfulness of the discussion, he pauses and shuts it out. He does not desist from making a precise point, pronouncing each word clearly while stressing upon every syllable. The attention to mindfulness and being focused seeps through even over the call and stands in stark contrast to an age where multi tasking is so glorified. While he is eager to talk about his latest translation, Chanakya Niti, but he is equally curious if I am related with another writer who shares my surname and has often reviewed his books.

During the course of the conversation, he touches on a lot of aspects, which concern his 20 translations beginning with Tales From Panchatantra in 1992, the language, which he has mastered and what makes it relevant in present times.

When it comes to Kautilya/Chanakya, Arthashastra is definitely the more talked-about text. So where did the germ of the idea to translate Chanakya Niti come from?

In the course of my translating Sanskrit classics, I have taken up all kinds of literature which I feel need public exposure. I came to the conclusion after looking at texts and their commentaries that the Arthashastra is very much in the public mind. There are books about it and people make speeches based on it too but the other work, Chanakya Niti has become a little obscured in recent years. Public knowledge and popularity of Arthashastra is based upon the discovery of manuscripts a hundred years ago in South India.

Moreover, there are in existence six main versions of Chanakya Niti. Of these, one, the Vridha Chanakya, has become better known. I thought if we are going to have a new translation it should reflect the whole corpus to give the reader a better sense of the whole corpus.

What is the appeal of Chanakya Niti in today’s day and time?

While Arthashastra is a scholarly treatise on politics, economics, diplomacy, running the government and more which is concerned with technical information directed at scholars and experts, the Chanakya Niti has verse maxims and aphorisms on life and everyday living. These are addressed to common people who are interested in knowing something about everyday worldly life namely the social, ethical and economical aspects. It is about how to get along with friends, family and others. They are addressed to individuals. As compared to other Sanskrit verses, which are embellished, these are exceedingly simple. That is why they attract common people.

Since these had become obscured over time, I felt the need to put it out in the public domain.

Is the fact that Arthashastra has often been compared to Machiavelli’s Prince the reason for its popularity?

The interesting thing is that both Arthashastra and Prince are addressed to technical expert audience. But Chanakya Niti verses are more like the advice of the kind that Socrates or Plato gave about everyday living which appeals to people. It doesn’t need deep understanding.

Is there any particular verse here that resonates with you the most?

Some verses resonate more. In fact there are two-three verses which attracted me to the whole. There is a verse that says, “Spoil him for the first five, for the next 10 discipline him, but once the son becomes 16, treat him like a friend.” This is something which was said 2,000 years ago and I think it is as relevant today as it was earlier. The other one says, “He speaks before you sweetly but spoils the word behind your back. Always discard such a friend. He is a poisoned pot with milk on top.” Both these verses are couched in such simple language and you don’t need a dictionary to understand them.

Since you’ve translated the works, what do you say to Amit Shah being called Chanakya?

The name or epigram Chanakya has from time to time been used for clever and determined political leaders and Amit Shah is not the only one. This has been going on for a long time. It has been used by every generation. But the Chanakya referred to here is more the one who wrote Arthashastra.

Your last translation, A Tale of Wonder, was a mix of cultures and religions. But in today’s times we see everything being compartmentalised separately...

In this particular case, even though it mentions Hindu gods, Chanakya Niti leaves out all considerations of organised religions as you have it. It mentions the caste system in social terms and it also points out that a person from a particular caste might be doing something else. The adjectives, religious and secular, are used very loosely these days but the Chanakya Niti is a really secular text.

The last two works which I’ve done, A Tale of Wonder and Suleiman Charitra are based upon stories derived from Arabic or Persian Middle Eastern sources. In today’s time, when everything is being compartmentalised and seen from a particular point of view, these two works depict cultural confluence and intermingling of culture.

How did you get into translating works from Sanskrit?

When I was a student, 60-70 years back in school, I had to study a classical language. My parents chose Sanskrit. My connection with the language loosened over the years. I spent 35 years as a career diplomat. When I retired I had more time at hand and thought I should get to know the language a little more. I came to a conclusion that a good way of learning a language was by translating it. So I looked at the texts which I had studied as a school boy. Over the years, it went on to include more complicated ones. The very first translation was of the Panchtantra fables that was picked up by National Book Trust more than 20 years ago. It is still in circulation. These are simple tales. I tried to concentrate on translating texts that are not in the public domain. The Tales of Wonder has been in existence for 600-700 years but it was definitely not in the public domain. No one associated Sanskrit literature with retelling the story of Yusuf and Zuleikha in terms of a parable of soul in search of God.

Did your stint as a diplomat influence the interpretation and the choice of Sanskrit?

There is one section of Sanskrit literature which is very well-known as it has been written about, translated, discussed over the last 200 years. This literature concentrates more or less on religious and philosophical texts like Gita and the Vedas. But these are only a tiny part of the vast literature that exists. There are some satires in Sanskrit about corruption in government, hypocrisy in religion and greed in business. These are facts of life and should be read.

Many of your translations have further been translated into Persian, Turkish, German, Malay, Mongolian, Newari, French, Greek, Hungarian, Polish and Russian as well as several Indian languages. What do you attribute their global appeal to?

At one stage, Sanskrit literature had spread wide from India to neighbouring regions. It was translated in other languages. In colonial times, Sanskrit literature was translated into not just English but all colonial languages. In earlier times, Chanakya Niti verses were found in Indonesia and Iran. So they do hold an appeal.

Translations can be tough as there are not enough words that can be equated with a particular one in a language? Also, the context for the verse needs to be seen in perspective of the time. Does that affect the quality of translation?

You are asking me deep questions, I am glad. There are two types of translations where the attempt is to translate from word to word and the object is to give to the person reading the translation a better idea of the exact words of which the translation is being made. That is one kind of translation. In this, very often if you read only the translation and not the original, it may not even make sense.

The other kind of translation is where you try to convey not the literal meaning but the literary meaning. In other words, you are combining both the literal and literary aspects because there is also the spirit behind it. This is the kind of translation I try to do. The difference between literary and literal is very limited in Chanakya Niti. I’ve translated two works of Kalidasa and I am also doing Vikram Urvashiyam at the moment for the Kalidasa classic series for Penguin. The language there is full of embellishment.

How do you select the text initially? Did the previous text influence it?

The first work I translated was Panchatantra as they were simpler to understand. I happened to know the editor of a newspaper and he asked me to send one every week which was published. That was encouraging as it went on for a year. Then I picked up a collection of works by the playright called Bhasha who lived 1,500-2,000 years ago. He wrote many plays, of which, some are based on stories from Mahabharata. He chose to make the villains, the heroes of his plays. These too were picked up by newspaper. Penguin had just started in India and they chose to publish it as the Shattered Thigh, which is still around. Then I got into more complicated stuff.

What kind of a schedule do you follow? How long does translating a work take?

It depends on the work you are translating from. After seeing my works getting published, I got interested and did more work. I have become a regular feature on the Penguin’s classics series. Earlier, I was sending proposals but, over time, they have been making suggestions. Kalidasa is famous as a poet and a playwright. I didn’t go anywhere near his works as I thought that would be too big. But it was the publisher that suggested that I should attempt translating the work. The first work took me a lot of time as it needed more drafting and redrafting.

How long does Chanakya Niti take?

The total verses attributed to Chanakya Niti add up to 2,000 but since that would be too much, we decided to select 300. One task was to select those and that involved a lot of reading, thinking and cross-questioning. But the actual act of translating was simple as the language is easy. While half the verses are from Vridha Chanakya, the other half from all the other five versions of Chanakya Niti. This translation gives the reader a sense of the corpus as a whole.

Children in school often do not find it an interesting language...

It seems that today, students are opting to study Sanskrit because the way it is taught and examined and the possibility of scoring high marks. Just like Mathematics. The grammar and tenses are emphasised upon. But to develop an interest in the language depends on individual temperament and also on the availability of works that could appeal to that temperament. If there were comic, erotic, heroics, colloquial works the language would have a larger appeal.

What are you planning to do next?

I am translating Kalidasa’s Vikram Urvashiyam and also, a collection of love poems which in my opinion deserves to be known better. I’ve had this text for long.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/interpreter-of-classics-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/interpreter-of-classics.html

Actor Kangana Ranaut who is currently in Manali, her hometown, spoke about the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus.

Talking about how the industry is coping, she said, “We have all landed in situation where this could be a potential bio world war and different countries are trying to bring down each other's economy.”

She added, “We have to reflect where we have landed as people. If this lockdown goes on for 21 days, we will be two years behind economically. But if it goes beyond 21 days, it is going to be a disastrous situation for our nation as we are a developing one. Right now, I have stopped looking at myself as an actor. I exist as an individual today.”

‘My character's name (in Netflix film Maska) is Persis. She is strong-headed, independent and very passionate about stories. You will always find her with a camera and a voice recorder. She talks to people and writes about them. She is working on a book about Irani cafes and their culture. That where she meets Rumi (played by Prit Kamani), and the story unfolds.’

166,30-3-20,Pilgrims of peace,"Virtual volunteers around the globe offer help to strangers amid virus stress

Sitting cross-legged in her living room, Donna Borak rested her palm on her heart as she guided a small group of virtual participants in meditation and deep breathing. Notice where you might be holding tension, she instructed.

“Send your attention to your head... maybe acknowledging it’s fine if you’ve been worried and scared,” she told them and added, “Maybe finding comfort that we are all in this together.”

From her Washington DC home, Borak has been hosting a free virtual meditation class daily for anyone who wants “a respite during such a moment of uncertainty.” Attendees are encouraged to bring children, loved ones or pets. “Even your plants.”

“Inhale, maybe even a little bit more deeply this time, slowly letting the air out of your mouth,” she added.

As social distancing has emerged as a key tool to staunch the spread of the Coronavirus, ordinary people around the globe have turned to technology to overcome physical barriers. In ways big and small, they are forging new connections and comforting others inundated by bad news about the virus or burdened by unpaid bills.

Borak wanted to carve out a space for togetherness — for a stressed-out parent, a manager or a laid-off employee to take a break. So far, attendees joining her class on Zoom video conferencing have mainly been friends and family, and she’s been sharing sessions on Instagram.

“While a meditation class for 15 minutes doesn’t solve financial stress or help to explain what will happen next or address serious health care concerns, to me, it’s an opportunity to not be alone and to not exist in isolation,” she said by phone. “I didn’t want anyone to feel alone.”

A journalist and who had been attending yoga teacher training, Borak draws lessons from such testing times.

“Going forward, for every time that we opted out at the last minute of attending an event or a happy hour or a dinner, we’ll hopefully feel differently about it when we come back together again,” she said. “We need each other.”

In Austin, Texas, Catherine Woodiwiss also took to online media to provide relief of a different kind. She knew that the cancellation of South by Southwest — a film, music and technology festival that attracts hundreds of thousands to Austin — could hit artists and small business owners hard.

Her first instinct to help by buying local wasn’t going to work amid the social distancing and various shutdowns. So she encouraged those who lost income to reach out online. “I can’t give a ton, but I can give something, and will as much and for as long as I can,” she wrote on Twitter.

She said takers included an 18-year-old pregnant woman who works as a cashier and said her store would be closed for a month and a musician whose shows would have covered rent and other expenses.

She used Venmo to send money directly after doing a “light vetting” of recipients by looking at their accounts. “I’m comfortable erring on the side of being of help,” she said. “In a moment of need, I am comfortable giving to who asked for it.”

There are “times that I have been very much in need of financial support from other people,” Woodiwiss said. “I am very lucky to be at a moment... where that’s not true.”

She’s been setting aside money for a while to help with different causes. Now Coronavirus is her cause — and she’s part of a bigger effort. On her social media feeds, she’s seen people come together in new ways, holding “singing circles” or sharing self-quarantine recipes.

Borak and Woodiwiss are among an army of virtual volunteers worldwide donating time and money. Some have used the internet to set up food delivery services to the elderly. One mother issued an international call for help celebrating the birthdays of her self-quarantined children.

“People are trying to figure out how to belong with each other... when we are physically separate,” Woodiwiss said. “In this moment of real, relatively unanticipated crisis, it’s been really great to see people show up.”

While unending global news about the effects of the pandemic of Coronavirus have become commonplace, so, too, are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pilgrims-of-peace-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/pilgrims-of-peace.html
167,30-3-20,Neymar would be ‘spectacular signing’ for Barca: Xavi,"Xavi Hernandez has reiterated his desire to coach Barcelona in the future but suggests he will not return until a different board brings a new sense of direction to the club.

Hernandez is in charge of Al-Sadd in Qatar and turned down an approach in January after Barca sacked Ernesto Valverde, which led to the appointment of Quique Setien.

In an interview with Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia published on Sunday, Xavi said Neymar would be a “spectacular signing”, and singled out former Spain defender Carles Puyol and the one-time Dutch winger Jordi Cruyff as people he would like to work with.

Yet the relationship between Barcelona’s board, led by president Josep Maria Bartomeu, and the players has remained tense, with Lionel Messi’s public criticism of technical secretary Eric Abidal among a number of off-field controversies.

“I am clear that I want to return to Barca, I am very excited,” said Xavi, who was asked if a change of board would be needed for it to happen. “Obviously I would like to be in tune with everyone,” he said. “In the dressing room there can’t be a negative or toxic atmosphere.”

“Everything has to fit,” Xavi added. “I would like to come in with people from my environment that could form a good team.”

Pushed on whether working with the current board would be a deal-breaker, Xavi said: “It wouldn’t be definitive but I insist I would like to have total harmony. I don’t know if that can happen... I have nothing against anyone and I don’t have a bad relationship with Bartomeu.

Xavi mentioned the likes of Puyol, whom he played with under Pep Guardiola, and Cruyff, son of Johan and former Barca and Manchester United winger, as the kind of people he would like to work alongside.

“I would like to work with people in whom I have confidence, with whom there is loyalty,” said Xavi. “We are talking about Carles Puyol, who was captain of Barca, and Jordi Cruyff, a very good businessman with a lot of experience as a technical secretary.”

He also said Neymar, whom the Catalans tried and failed to sign from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, would be a “spectacular signing”.

“Most of the squad seems extraordinary,” Xavi said. “The base is very good. I would sign forwards, like Neymar. I don’t know if he would fit in a social sense but in football terms I have no doubt he would be a spectacular signing.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/neymar-would-be----spectacular-signing----for-barca--xavi.html
168,30-3-20,"Messi confirms pay cut for Barca players, criticises board","Lionel Messi confirmed on Monday that Barcelona's players will take a 70 per cent pay cut and make financial contributions to ensure the club's other employees are paid in full during the state of alarm in Spain.

In a lengthy message posted on his Instagram account, Messi also took another swipe at the Barca board, led by president Josep Maria Bartomeu, whom he accused of undermining the players during recent negotiations.

Other Spanish clubs are expected to follow suit in applying temporary pay cuts, as football's hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic leaves a number of them fighting for financial survival.

Atletico Madrid have said the club will impose salary reductions on staff whose hours have been affected while Espanyol have also confirmed pay cuts, although for sporting staff only.

""For our part, the time has come to announce that, as well as the reduction of 70 per cent of our salary during the State of Alarm, we will also make contributions so the club's employees can collect 100 per cent of their salary while this situation lasts,"" Messi wrote.

He added: ""We want to clarify that our desire has always been to apply a drop in salary because we fully understand that this is an exceptional situation and we are the first ones who have ALWAYS helped the club when asked.

""Many times we have even done it on our own initiative when we thought it necessary or important.

""Therefore, it never ceases to amaze us that from within the club there were those who tried to put us under the magnifying glass and tried to add pressure to do something that we always knew we would do.""

Messi's message was soon posted on the pages of nearly all of his Barcelona teammates, including Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba, Antoine Griezmann, Frenkie de Jong, Arturo Vidal and Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

The relationship between Barca's players and board has been tense for several months, with Messi's public criticism of technical secretary Eric Abidal in February just one of a number of off-field controversies.

Barcelona released their own statement shortly afterwards on Monday, which said members of ""all professional sports teams and most of the basketball team"" had agreed to reduce their salaries.

It added: ""In the case of the football first team the reduction will be more than 70 per cent as agreed with the club. This additional contribution by the team, plus the contribution from the club itself, will guarantee 100 per cent of the salaries of all non-sporting staff, who will be subjected to temporary redundancy this week.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/messi-confirms-pay-cut-for-barca-players--criticises-board-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/messi-confirms-pay-cut-for-barca-players--criticises-board.html

""Another frightening picture of the government's efforts to save people from the corona infection. This arrangement of Nitish Kumar for social distancing and quarantine of the poor people reaching Bihar from many parts of the country after facing heavy difficulties is heart-rending. Nitish must quit,"" Kishor said in a tweet.

He tagged a short video clip of a group of people locked inside a facility with one of them crying while sharing his troubles.

With migrant workers arriving in Bihar, their home state, to be with their families and escape the hardship caused by the ongoing lockdown, the state government has set up quarantine facilities for them.

There have been reports that the government was forced to allow many of them to head to their respective villages due to their large numbers and the anger against any attempt to prevent their onward journey.

Kishor has been targeting the BJP-led Union government and the Bihar dispensation as well over their measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. He had recently alleged that the ongoing 21-day lockdown was botched-up.

Once seen by many as the second-most powerful person in the Nitish Kumar-headed JD(U), Kishor was expelled from the party earlier this year for his frequent criticism of the Bihar chief minister over the latter's support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kishor-demands-nitish-s-resignation-over-treatment-being-meted-out-to-people-arriving-in-bihar-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/kishor-demands-nitish-s-resignation-over-treatment-being-meted-out-to-people-arriving-in-bihar.html

172,30-3-20,Suspended JK police officer Davinder Singh sent to further custody till Apr 3,"Jammu and Kashmir Police officer Davinder Singh, who was arrested while ferrying two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen terrorists in a vehicle on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway earlier this year, has been sent to further custodial interrogation by a Delhi court till April 3.

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Jain extended Singh's custody after Delhi Police said that he was required to be confronted with other accused Javed Iqbal, Syed Naveed Mushtaq and Imran Shafi Mir arrested in the case.

Heard the IO (investigating officer) and peruses the record. Police custody is granted for further interrogation and identification of other accomplices and confrontation with other co-accused, the judge said.

The court also directed the police to conduct his medical examination after every 48 hours.

The police sought Singh's further custody, saying that the confrontation and further interrogation was required to unearth the larger conspiracy and role of the accused, to trace the details of financial transaction, to verify and trace other offenders.

It also told the court that the custody was required to establish the identity of main handler, defence advocate Prashant Prakash said.

Suspended DSP Davinder Singh was suspended from the Jammu and Kashmir Police in January this year.

The Special Cell had brought Davinder Singh to Delhi from Hira Nagar Jail in Jammu and Kashmir.

Earlier the court had sent Syed Naveed Mushtaq and others to police custody till April 3 after the police said that he and other co accused were planning to execute terror attacks in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected person.

While seeking Mushtaq's custody, police had alleged that the accused was commander of Shopian district of Hizbul Mujahiddeen through his handler based in Pakistan.

The police said the accused used to chat with other co-accused and militants through various internet platforms, including darknet chat.

The accused, along with other militants of Hizbul Mujahideen, were planning to execute terror attack in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected persons, police had told the court.

The Delhi Police has filed an FIR under Section 120B of IPC. The FIR said that the youths of Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab are being trained for carrying out terrorist activities.

175,30-3-20,Juve players agree to take pay reduction,"Juventus on Saturday announced that they had cut their players’ and coach Maurizio Sarri’s salaries after all Italian sport was suspended until at least April 3 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“The economic and financial effects of the understanding reached are positive for about 90 million euros ($100.5 million) for the 2019/2020 financial year,” said a club statement.

Juventus, who led second-placed Lazio by a point in Serie A before the suspension of the season, said they had agreed a “reduction” for pay from March until June.

Juve added that should the season be finished later in the year, the players could be paid extra in those months.

“Juventus would like to thank the players and the coach for their commitment at a difficult time for everyone,” Turin giants said.

Players at other big European clubs have also agreed to take pay cuts, including Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in Germany.

Juventus’ highly-paid stars include five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo and Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who joined from Arsenal on a free transfer last year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/juve-players-agree-to-take-pay-reduction.html
176,30-3-20,Laxman’s 281 among Chappell’s all-time great knocks against spin,"Former Australia captain Ian Chappell has picked his two all-time favourite innings against high-quality spin bowling and one of those is VVS Laxman’s iconic 281 at the Eden Gardens in 2001.

Thanks to Laxman and Rahul Dravid (180), India went on to win the game against Australia after following-on.

“The absence of any cricket gives me an opportunity to reflect on an aspect of the game I enjoy: watching a batsman utilise good footwork to combat top-class spin bowling. Two innings stand out: one played by India’s VVS Laxman, the other by Doug Walters of Australia,” Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.

Laxman and Dravid shared a marathon 376-run stand to engineer an unforgettable win for India. Chappell was simply in awe of Laxman’s batting as the wristy Indian batsman toyed with the likes of Shane Warne.

“Laxman’s incredible 281 at Calcutta in 2001 is the best I’ve seen against top-class leg-spin. At the conclusion of that exhilarating series I asked Shane Warne how he thought he bowled.

“I don’t think I bowled that badly,” he replied. “You didn’t,” I responded.

“If Laxman comes three paces out of his crease and hits an unbelievable on-drive against the spin and you then flight the next delivery a little higher and shorter to invite another drive and instead he quickly goes onto the back foot and pulls it, that’s not bad bowling. That’s good footwork.

“Laxman regularly did this during his 452-ball stay, in which he hit 44 boundaries. Therein lies a clue to Laxman’s success: he consistently hit the ball along the ground,” said Chappell, also praising Laxman’s temperament.

Talking about fellow Australian Walters, Chappell called him the best player against spin.

“Walters was the best player of off-spin bowling I have seen; he didn’t just survive against the very best, he occasionally battered them into submission,” said Chappell.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/laxman---s-281-among-chappell---s-all-time-great-knocks-against-spin.html
177,30-3-20,Smith again eligible for captaincy,"A two-year leadership ban slapped on Steve Smith after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa ended on Sunday, leaving the master batsman free to captain Australia again.

The 30-year-old captained the team until he was suspended for 12 months over a brazen attempt to alter the ball with sandpaper under his watch during a Test in Cape Town in 2018.

Part of his punishment included a further year-long exile from any leadership role, which has now expired.

Co-conspirator and former vice-captain David Warner was banned from any leadership role for life, although both have successfully resumed their international careers.

There have been calls for Smith to take back the Test captaincy from Tim Paine, but it remains unclear whether he wants to, with the 35-year-old seemingly intent on playing on.

Coach Justin Langer last year praised Paine’s leadership as “brilliant” and said Smith may not want the “burden” of captaincy on top of batting pressures.

Aaron Finch is skipper of the Twenty20 and one-day teams.

Smith told Channel Nine television on Sunday he was focused only on trying to stay physically and mentally fit during the coronavirus shutdown of Australian cricket.

He was supposed to be preparing for a big-money payday at the Indian Premier League, but the tournament has already been delayed until April 15.

With India in a three-week lockdown in a bid to contain a spread of the virus, Smith admitted the IPL appeared unlikely to go ahead.

“I think the country’s basically shut its borders until the 15th of April,” he said.

“It’s obviously not looking likely at the moment, I think there might be some meetings over the next couple of days to discuss what the go is with it all.

“But just trying to stay physically fit and mentally fresh,” he added. “If it goes ahead at some point, then great. If not, then there’s plenty going on in the world at the moment. Just play it day by day.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/smith-again-eligible-for-captaincy.html
178,30-3-20,Aus travel ban could affect India tour,"The Australian government’s decision to seal its border for the next six months owing to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect India’s Futures Tours Programme (FTP), including the much-awaited face-offs Down Under later this year.

India’s tour of Australia is to begin with a T20 tri-series in October and end with the Tests in December.

In between is the World T20, scheduled for an October 18 start, but the mega-event’s future is also shrouded in uncertainty due to the global health crisis.

In Australia, there has been over 2000 positive cases, prompting the government to seal the country’s borders.

The Sourav Ganguly-led BCCI, in all likelihood, might have to explore alternate plans amid the pandemic.

While the BCCI is yet to take a final decision on this edition of IPL, the international calender will be another cause of concern as there are tours of Sri Lanka (ODIs and T20s), Zimbabwe, Asia Cup (T20) and home a white ball series against England lined up.

A six-month travel ban means no teams will be allowed to enter Australia for the assignments lined up in the coming times, which includes the World T20 and the tour by the Indian team.

“Right now it’s too early to say anything. It’s a potential six-month travel ban. If the situation is under control, it could be lifted early also,” a senior BCCI office-bearer, privy to the developments, said.

But those who have an idea of the FTP calender admitted that the practical problem in such a situation could be the T20 tri-series, which starts in the beginning of October and involves Australia and England.

“If international travel ban in reality exists for six months, then it becomes a logistical nightmare. At least, for the T20 tri-series before the World T20.

“The processing of visa, tickets everything becomes a logistical challenge. Also not only Australia, England is supposed to tour India in September for their white ball leg. Will things be normal in the UK and players allowed to travel. These are big questions,” another BCCI source said.

If the World T20 is pushed back, then the four-Test series between India and Australia, which is part of the World Championship, could also get affected.

“The frustrating aspect is that you can’t even decide anything as the situation varies from country to country. However helpless it might sound, we can only wait and watch,” the source said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-travel-ban-could-affect-india-tour.html
179,30-3-20,Hanuma using break to sharpen skills for series Down Under,"Confined to his home due to the nationwide lockdown, India cricketer Hanuma Vihari says he will use the time to “sharpen” his skills for the Australian tour, scheduled towards the end of the year.

“I am going to use this time to focus on my fitness, sharpen my skills for county cricket as well as for the Australia tour in late 2020,” Vihari, who was part of India’s last tour of New Zealand, was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

Though there is a lot of uncertainty over when sport will resume, the middle-order batsman said he has has his “fingers crossed”.

“Mentally I am trying hard to keep myself positive and busy. My challenge is: there is no cricket for the next three to four months. I do have a summer to look forward to having signed with a team in the English County Championship, where my contract starts from late August. Fingers crossed about that.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hanuma-using-break-to-sharpen-skills-for-series-down-under-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hanuma-using-break-to-sharpen-skills-for-series-down-under.html
180,30-3-20,Turkish World Cup hero Recber hospitalised with coronavirus,"Former Turkish national team and ex-Barcelona goalkeeper Rustu Recber is in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, his wife said.

Recber took on hero status in Turkey as he kept goal at the 2002 World Cup, anchoring his team to the semi-finals and ultimately third place, their greatest ever performance in the tournament.

The powerfully built and poney-tailed goalkeeper was easily recognisable at the World Cup due to the black, anti-reflection product he smeared beneath his eyes like some NFL players.

""Rustu is in hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis,"" Isil Recber said on Instagram.

""We are in a state of shock after the symptoms developed rapidly while everything was normal. These are critical times and it's very difficult.""

She added that she, as well as their son and daughter, had tested negative for the virus.

The goalkeeper, now 46, enjoyed a brief spell at Barcelona in 2003 after starring in the World Cup a year earlier when Turkey beat co-hosts South Korea 3-2 in the third-place play-off.

He also played for Istanbul giants Fenerbahce and Besiktas in football-mad Turkey before retiring in 2012.

Last week, Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim said he also tested positive for the virus.

185,30-3-20,"PM sorry for tough steps, but says Lakshman Rekha needed","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sought forgiveness from the people who have to undergo hardship during the ongoing lockdown to combat the coronavirus spread. He also referred to reports of discrimination against coronavirus patients and those under quarantine and called for increasing emotional bonding while continuing to maintain “social distancing”.

He also asked patients who have recovered to make their fight viral on social media.

In his monthly Mann Ki Baat address, the PM said, “I ask for forgiveness from my country men especially the poor who have been asked to remain under lockdown and have to face difficulties. I understand their pain and suffering, but it is essential to fight the coronavirus pandemic.”

Modi said the measures were for the “safety of you and your families” and sought them to “respect Lakshman Rekha outside your homes”.

“I’ve told you to not to step outside... this is the time to introspect,” Modi said and cited examples where people have been using the opportunity and time to enjoy the hobbies or pursuits they had lost track of during their busy routine.

In order to know the capability with which the country is dealing with the pandemic at medical level, Prime Minister also talked to the doctors treating the patients of coronavirus, said, “Their daily activity is synchronous with that of their patients.’’

Modi also said, ‘’Today when I witness the sacrifice, perseverance and dedication on part of doctors, I am reminded of the touching words of Acharya Charak while referring to doctors. And it is so visible in doctor’s lives today.’’

“In order to ensure that India fights, does not have to face such a situation, we have to keep trying ceaselessly,’’ Prime Minister asked a doctor about some general queries related to coronavirus like, “When to call a doctor?”, “When to go for a test?”

Modi talked to several people who had contracted Covid-19 and were later cured over the phone during his Mann Ki Baat.

Modi said he spoke to several such people in the last few days to lift their morale and in the process, he learnt a lot about the respiratory disease, which has affected nearly 1,000 and killed at least 25 in the country.

Ramagampa Teja, an IT professional, was the first person to speak to the Prime Minister. Teja told Modi he was scared after he tested positive for coronavirus disease but felt reassured because of the doctors and hospital staff.

“I work in the IT sector and had gone to Dubai in connection with a job-related meeting. On my return I got a fever and after five to six days, the doctors conducted a test and I was found positive,” Teja said.

He added that he was admitted to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad and was discharged after 14 days. “All this was very scary,” he said.

When the Prime Minister asked about his steps after getting cured, Teja said he has followed the doctors’ instructions and kept himself under self-quarantine. Prime Minister also had a request to Teja.

“I would like you to make an audio of your experience and share it on social media. It will remove fear from people’s minds and at the same time make them aware of the necessary precautions to protect themselves,” the Prime Minister said.

Modi spoke against reports of some people seeking to discriminate those who are in self-quarantine or affected by the virus.

“It is not fair to discriminate against those under quarantine... they are taking precautions,” Modi said, addressing the nation, his first after the country-wide lockdown announced by him on March 24. The Prime Minister expressed his anguish at some cases of discrimination against those in self-quarantine or those infected by the coronavirus.

“Social distancing is not about ending social interaction... This is the time to infuse new life in your relationships.... Increase social distance but decrease emotional or human distance,” he said.

Modi said the country should take inspiration from those who are on the frontlines and who have defeated the virus.

He referred to several posts which he had received in his App which illustrating how people were spending their time during the ongoing three-week lockdown.

“Every Indian is locked for now. But we will emerge stronger after this fight against COVID-19,” Modi said. “This fight against COVID-19 is unprecedented but also challenging. In this fight, whatever steps Indians are taking, every citizen’s patience will help us. We also have to be sensitive to the needs of poor. India can do this,” he said.

On “behalf of the nation”, he also thanked all those working to provide essential services during this period of lockdown by “risking their own lives”.

The Prime Minister expressed gratitude to those who are working under these restrictions to make sure that people don’t have to face any difficulties under lockdown.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-sorry-for-tough-steps--but-says-lakshman-rekha-needed-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pm-sorry-for-tough-steps--but-says-lakshman-rekha-needed.html
186,30-3-20,Mass tests in India must as 50% China cases showed no symptom,"A research carried out by the Chinese authorities show that at least half of the 85,000 Covid-19 cases in the country displayed no symptoms. The study underlines the importance of random testing at a mass scale to identify the “silent carriers” of the disease, completely unaware that they were Covid-19 patients. The data reveals that around 43,000 people in China tested positive despite showing no symptoms.

In a report, the South China Morning Post said that around 43,000 people in China had tested positive for coronavirus by the end of February but had no symptoms.

These asymptomatic, silent carriers were placed under quarantine and were closely monitored by the doctors. However, they were not included in the list of officially confirmed cases which then stood at 80,000.

Scientists are not yet sure what role exactly a silent carrier or asymptomatic transmission plays in the spread of this new type of coronavirus. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days though the incubation period can stretch up to 14 days or even three weeks.

During this period, the asymptomatic patient can pass on the infection to others. A section of scientists are of the view that silent carriers play a vital role in infecting others with the Covid-19 virus.

These findings hold a great deal of importance for India which has been able to test only a fraction of its massive population.

India has been maintaining that cases of community transmission has not been witnessed so far and strict adhering to social distance for a certain period will help it win the war against the Covid-19.

The data available from the Chinese Government notes that asymptomatic carriers of the dreaded virus have been ignored by most of the western countries.

“The Chinese Government changed its classification guidelines on February 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The US, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus,” said the English daily.

China may not have been adding silent carriers on its official list, but it prevented the spread of the disease by isolating and monitoring them.

The approach helped the Government in swiftly containing the virus from spreading to other regions in the China.

In India, experts have been questioning the Government if cases have been underestimated as many people who did not show symptoms but had a travel history could be a silent carriers, if Chinese data is to be believed.

As the world now is witness to a dangerous spread of the virus, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated.

An in-depth research by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the disease, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on January 23, the English daily said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mass-tests-in-india-must-as-50--china-cases-showed-no-symptom-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mass-tests-in-india-must-as-50--china-cases-showed-no-symptom.html

Schaefer, 54, was found dead near a railway track on Saturday.

The Wiesbaden prosecution’s office said they believe he died by suicide. “We are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,” Bouffier said.

Hesse is home to Germany’s financial capital Frankfurt, where major lenders like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have their headquarters.

The European Central Bank is also located in Frankfurt.

A visibly shaken Bouffier recalled that Schaefer, who was Hesse’s finance chief for 10 years, had been working “day and night” to help companies and workers deal with the economic impact of the pandemic.

“Today we have to assume that he was deeply worried,” said Bouffier, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel. “It’s precisely during this difficult time that we would have needed someone like him,” he added.

188,30-3-20,3 Indians among 42 new coronavirus cases in Singapore,"Three Indians were among the 42 new coronavirus cases reported in Singapore on Sunday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 844, according to the health ministry.

Of the new cases, 24 are imported ones and have a travel history to Europe, North America, Middle East, Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other parts of Asia, the ministry said in a statement.

The fresh cases take the total number of people infected with the deadly coronavirus in the city-state to 844, it said.

The three Indians include a 35-year-old woman with a long-term pass, a 34-year-old man holding the Singapore work pass. Both of them have a travel history to India.

A 34-year-old Indian holding Singapore work pass was infected locally.

Another 43-year old man, a Singapore permanent resident whose nationality was not listed, is an imported case with a travel history to India.

Also, among the latest cases is a 42-year-old Singapore permanent resident who is a nurse at Sengkang General Hospital and has no travel history to the affected countries.

She reported the onset of symptoms on March 24, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on March 27 afternoon. She is currently in an isolation room at the hospital, according to a Channel News Asia report.

Contact tracing is underway for a total of 71 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions, the ministry said.

Of the 423 confirmed COVID-19 cases who are in hospitals, 19 are in critical condition. The others are stable or improving, it said.

Fourteen patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, the ministry said in its Sunday update.

In total, 212 people in Singapore have fully recovered from the deadly disease.

According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 32,000 people have died of coronavirus and 684,652 have been infected globally.

189,30-3-20,Boost immunity and don't fret over pH level of coronavirus,"Amid the new coronavirus scare are several health myths going viral on social media platforms and one of those is: Improve your pH levels as ""the pH for coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5"".

The message on WhatsApp reads: ""All we need to do to beat coronavirus is to take more of an alkaline foods that are above the above pH level of the Virus. Some of which are: Lemon - 9.9pH, Lime - 8.2pH, Avocado - 15.6pH, Garlic - 13.2pH, Mango - 8.7pH, Tangerine - 8.5pH, Pineapple - 12.7pH and Orange - 9.2pH"".

It further adds: ""Increase your intake of the above to help boost your immune system. Do not keep this information to yourself only. Pass it to all your family and friends"".

According to health experts, boosting your immunity is important but pH level of the new coronavirus is only misinformation.

""Around this time, it is very important to deal with any information cautiously. There is a lot of information available which has no basis medically or those that can't be authenticated,"" Dr Manish Mathur, Specialist-Internal Medicine on Lybrate, an online healthcare platform, told IANS.

""The World Health Organisation (WHO) hasn't released any data on the coronavirus' pH level. In general, alkaline food items are essential to build the body's immunity. The stronger the body's immunity, the better will it fight infections and diseases,"" Mathur noted.

pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water.

""Consumption of lemon, orange, pineapple and other alkaline food items are suggested by doctors. It, however, must not be perceived that consumption of these food items will prevent anyone from catching the coronavirus,"" said Mathur.

The total number of positive coronavirus cases in India reached 1,071 on Monday, including the foreign nationals, with 942 active cases, according to the Health Ministry.

According to Bimal Chhajer, Director, SAAOL Heart Centre in New Delhi, though it may not be a well-established fact that consuming foods above pH value 7 may help in fighting against it, but these foods are considered as good immunity boosters and aid in improving the immunity which can help the body to fight against any infection.

""Ten major foods to boost our immunity include eating citrus foods like orange, lemon, amla and kiwi. Broccoli, spinach, red Pepper (Shimla mirch), and other green leafy vegetables increase our immunity. A combination of apple cider vinegar, garlic, ginger, honey and lemon is also a very good way to increase immunity,"" Chhajer told IANS.

Probiotics like curd or yogurt taken at room temperature helps increase immunity.

Any fruit/vegetables, especially red ones like papaya, carrot and beet also provide Vitamin A to boost immunity.

All the schools in the city are shut due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced the government to announce a 21-day nationwide lockdown from the midnight of March 24.

With the shutting of the schools, students' education has been affected and to compensate the same, activities through recorded phone calls and messages will be given to the students up to Class VIII, Sisodia said.

191,30-3-20,"Dists sealed, 14-day quarantine for violators","Centre asks States to stop migrants’ exodus; SPs/DMs ordered to punish landlords evicting students/labourers; private firms asked to pay salaries

The home-bound exodus of thousands of migrant workers has posed a major challenge to the Centre, which, on Sunday, directed States/UTs to seal the borders of districts and cities to prevent movement of people across cities or highways.

The Centre also told the States that all those who have travelled during the lockdown period would be put under mandatory 14-day quarantine at Government facilities.

The Centre has tried to take into account the factors that triggered the massive exodus due to joblessness, pressure from the landlords to vacate their dwelling, and how to find their next meal, the like of which the country has never seen before in post-Independence period.

To address these issues, the Centre has directed SPs and DMs to ensure action against the landlords asking students/labourers to vacate rented accommodation. Home Minister Amit Shah and Home Secretary AK Bhalla spoke to many Chief Ministers and Chief Secretaries to ensure strict action against landlords who demanded workers to vacate their dwellings.

They also urged the States to ensure the private companies pay salaries to employers and workers. Both of them asked the State Governments to impose penal actions against those who violate the rules of the Disaster Management Act.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba also took stock of preparedness with State Chief Secretaries and DGPs.

“The migrant people, who have moved out to reach their home in States or towns to be kept in the nearest shelter by the respective State/UT Government quarantine facilities after proper screening for a minimum period of 14 days as per standard health protocol. All the employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishments, should make payment of wages of their workers, at their work places, on the due date, without any deduction, for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown,” said a circular issued to the States and Union Territories by the Union Home Ministry.

“It is to be ensured that wherever the workers, including the migrants, are living in rented accommodation, the landlords of those properties must not demand payment of rent for a period of one month. If any landlord is forcing labourers and students to vacate their premises, they will be liable for action under the Act. The order stated that in case of violation of any of the above measures, the respective State/UT Government, would take necessary action under the Disaster Management Act and the DMs /Deputy Commissioners and SSPs/ SPs/Deputy Commissioner of Police would be personally liable for implementation of the above directions and lockdown measures issued earlier,” the circular added.

Meanwhile, in a big development Uttar Pradesh Administration took over Jaypee Groups unused flats in Yamuna Expressway to rehabilitate the migrant labourers from Delhi who entered the State. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered to keep all those labours under 14-day quarantine at these flats and provide medical and food supply.

Noida District Magistrate has ordered all companies to ensure prompt payment of salaries to workers and employees. The DM in his order said errant employers will face strict penal actions, including attachment of personal properties if any violations found.

In Kerala also many migrant workers agitated demanding to go back to home States in Bihar, UP, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. Hundreds of migrant workers in Paippad town in Kottayam district came to street protesting, demanding the State Government to arrange travel facilities to go back to home States.

The Kerala Government urged the labours to stay back at homes and no point of transportation to distant home States as the entire country is witnessing lockdown. The State administration warned the contractors of these labours to take care and also assured free food and shelter if they face any such problems. Contractors also told media that they are assuring all services and somehow the labours are insisting to go home might be due to fear or homesickness. There were reports of migrant labours flow at Maharashtra-Gujarat and Karnataka-Maharashtra border areas also.

In the evening Group of Ministers headed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh monitored the situation across the country, including the supply of essential commodities supply. The high-level meeting convened at Singh’s residence was attended by Union Ministers Amit Shah, Piyush Goyal, Ram Vilas Paswan, Smriti Irani, Ramesh Pokhrial Nishank and Dharmendra Pradhan.

Meanwhile, PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister formed 10 empowered groups with focus on tackling various emergencies.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dists-sealed--14-day-quarantine-for-violators-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/dists-sealed--14-day-quarantine-for-violators.html
192,30-3-20,"Focus on Covid hotspots, community check","With coronavirus confirmed cases going over 1,100 and death count reaching 26 on Sunday, the Centre announced increased focus on high-disease burden hotspots across India and the State Governments intensified efforts to strengthen community surveillance, contact tracking and containment strategy.

The Ministry of Health confirmed 978 positive cases in the forenoon, but data collated from releases issued by various State Governments till late Sunday evening put the count of confirmed case to 1104.

Overall 26 people have died. Maharashtra has reported 6 deaths, Madhya Pradesh 2, Karnataka 3, Gujarat 4, and Delhi 2. One each person has died of COVID-19 in Bengal, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar.

“We are identifying emerging Covid-19 hotspots in the country and a rigorous cluster containment strategy is being implemented on a war footing,” Health Ministry’s Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said at a Press briefing here on the fifth day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown.

With over 200 positive cases each, Maharashtra and Kerala have emerged as the top two States with most number of infections followed by others like Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh where number of positive cases has gone past 50.

Agarwal said that the Cabinet Secretary held a couple of meetings with the Chief Secretaries of all States in the last 24 hours to review the situation and for the effective implementation of containment measures.

The Government has also set up 10 empowered groups entrusted to oversee the Covid related management and prevention strategy at various platforms.

Agarwal added that the Government was busy upgrading the health logistics, including procurement and manufacturing of PPEs (personal protective equipment) like masks, sanitisers and also separation of the treatment facilities for coronavirus cases across States.

Agarwal said the ongoing 21-day lockdown has resulted in some behavioural as well as mental health issues and NIMHANS has launched a toll-free number — 08046110007 — for consultation.

The officer said States have been told to ensure there is no intermingling of non-Covid-19 patients with the infected ones and the process of shifting non-infected patients to other hospitals has begun as the creation of dedicated facilities for Covid-19 cases picks up pace across the country.

ICMR’s Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, who was also present at the Press conference said there were a good number of tests of Covid-19 happening in the country.

“Our infrastructure is spread across the country, I don’t think we are testing less. We have conducted 34,931 tests till today. Capacity utilisation in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) network is around 30 per cent. We have increased some number of labs also. Now, 113 Government labs have been made functional and 47 private labs have been given approval to conduct the Covid-19 tests.”

Joint Secretary in the Home Ministry Punya Salila Srivastava said employers must be instructed to give full wages to workers on the due date without any deduction for the closed-down period and landlords cannot charge rent for this period.

She also said the workers cannot be forced to vacate the premises. “The SPs and DMs will be held personally responsible for its strict implementation,” Srivastava said, referring to the orders issued to stop the mass exodus of migrant workers.

Asked to provide the number of patients presently on ventilator, Agarwal said, “Data is being monitored at State level. High risk cases, which include age and contact history as criteria and which are found serious are monitored. Figures are not available with me right now.”

The one spot of good news is that across the country, 94 Covid-19 patients - nearly 10 per cent of the total cases reported so far - have recovered from the disease. Globally, there have been over 6.9 lakh confirmed cases of COVID-19. At least 31,000 people have died so far. The US now has the highest number of cases, followed by Italy.

196,30-3-20,Daily-wagers return as march stopped; Kejriwal offers help,"Hit by corona lockdown, thousands of impoverished daily wagers and labourers, including women and children, started returning to their “homes” in the national Capital on Sunday after the Delhi Police sealed arterial roads in the city, especially those leading to the border areas, hours after the Centre asked State Governments to ensure there is no movement of people across cities.

Cops are turning back migrant workers travelling by foot after Delhi Police Commissioner SN Srivastava strictly directed his personnel to stop movement of migrants.

Many people were seen trying to walk on the railway tracks at Anand Vihar to go their hometowns in UP.

All DCPs, ACPs and SHOs have been instructed to conduct extensive patrolling in their respective areas and deploy maximum number of vehicles for patrolling to check the movement of migrants.

In his tweet, Kejriwal said, “I assure you that the Delhi Government has made sufficient arrangements for your food and accommodation. For now, do not go to your villages in the country’s interest.”

Now with the border sealed, daily wagers and labourers are looking at administrative support for food and shelter. “I have not paid rent to my landlord this month and cannot pay it next month as the factory we worked is closed. We are left with no option except leaving the city by any mode of transport available,” said Rambhuwan, who along with with his wife and two children were returned from the bus terminal by the police.

Phulmati Devi (24), who works as a maid, said she was told by her owners not to come after the news of virus spread. “They are rich people but they are stingy. They refused to give me salary. I have three children. How can I survive in such a situation,” she asked.

“Where the food is being given free? I have been searching for it. Do you think people will travel two or three kilometers daily to have lunch and dinner at night shelters? We cannot even walk to shelters or schools during lock-down where food is being distributed as police will stop us. Who will care us then, no one actually,” said Bhima Mahto with tears welling in his eyes.

Panicked women and children, who reached Anand Vihar bus terminal on Sunday hoping to board the bus, started crying soon after the announcements were made that they have to go back.

“We are not financially strong to manage the daily affairs sitting at home. We are totally dependent on Government now for survival. We thought to return back to our village in Bihar so that at least we don’t die of starvation but now our only hope to rush to our home is dashed,” Kalawati told The Pioneer as she walked along the outer Ring Road carrying her belongings on her head.

Faizan Ansari, (24) said, “I just came in the city three months back. I started working in a factory at Shakurpur area. We were told that factory is closed due to some disease. We were not given salaries. I borrowed a few hundred from a friend and went to Anand Vihar to catch a bus to reach my village in Sitamarhi (Bihar) but won’t be able to do so as police did not allow us to cross the border.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/daily-wagers-return--as-march-stopped--kejriwal-offers-help.html

According Khan's advisor on information, Firdous Ashiq Awan, the Prime Minister will take people into confidence about delivery of ration and food supplies to deserving poor families across the country at their doorsteps.

Awan said due to the lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus, national economy is being affected and chain of daily use items has slowed down , which created fear of shortages.

The decision of the prime minister to address the nations came after reports of non-availability of wheat flour in some areas of Punjab.

On Saturday, the Pakistan government decided to keep its western borders with Iran and Afghanistan and eastern border with India closed for two more weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Security Moeed Yusuf said the move was taken in the wake of increasing COVID-19 cases in the country.

He also announced that all flights will remain suspended in the country till April 4. However, there will be exceptions if a country makes a special request to repatriate its citizens.

203,30-3-20,Silver lining in lockdown cloud: Clean air,"As many as 103 cities in India registered vastly improved air quality on Sunday due to the 21-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown.

According to the data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in as many as 61 cities have recorded “satisfactory”, level and 30 cities have recorded “good” level. The air quality of 12 cities has recorded at “moderate” category.

The lockdown has kept cars off the road and closed factories, commercial establishment, movement of private and public transport, improving air quality and letting people see blue skies instead of heavy grey smog.

Last year, India accounted for around half of the world’s 50 most polluted cities. The air quality in the national Capital and the financial capital Mumbai’s is presently at “satisfactory” level.

According to the CPCB data, the air quality level are at “good” category in Chennai, Yamunanagar, Thiruvanan-thapuram, Shillong, Satna, Rohtak, Patiala, Sagar, Narnaul, Muzaffarnagar, Manesar, Ludhiana, Kanpur, Ambala and Karnal are in “good” category. The air quality index value in these cities is less than 50.

Bhatinda, Bengaluru, Delhi, Agra, Ahmedabad, Alwar, Aizawl, Amravati, Kota, Amritsar, Kozhikode, Lucknow, Patna, Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai are among those cities where air quality is at “satisfactory” level and the air index value is between 50 and 100.

Muzaffarpur, Nandesari, Navi Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati Gaya, Dewas, Chandrapur and Bhiwani are in the list of moderate category where air quality index value is above 100.

CPCB officials said it is the lockdown impact. “Local factors like shutting down of industries and construction and traffic have contributed in improving the air quality. Rain is also helping, but the curbs on local emissions are playing a significant role,” officials added.

As per the CPCB data, the national capital, the world’s most polluted capital city, the air quality is presently in the “satisfactory” level and air quality index value is 62.

The air quality is likely to remain in good to satisfactorily level on Monday also.

The CPCB data said the impact of the measures taken due to the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in a drop in PM2.5 (fine particulate pollutant). The level of Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) pollution, which can increase the risk of respiratory conditions, has also reduced. NOx pollution is mainly caused due to high motor vehicle traffic.

According to the latest World Air Quality Report from IQAir, Gurugram was the most polluted cities in the world in 2018, with Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida, and Bhiwadi in the top six worst-affected cities. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2020 highlights the dangers posed by air pollution and records that 90 per cent of millennials (people born after 1980) expect the health effects caused by it to worsen in 2020.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/silver-lining-in-lockdown-cloud--clean-air-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/silver-lining-in-lockdown-cloud--clean-air.html

205,30-3-20,Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies from coronavirus at 70,"Veteran Japanese comic Ken Shimura, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus last week, has died at the age of 70.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actor was hospitalised in Tokyo on March 20 after developing a fever and being diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Shimura tested positive for COVID-19 on March 23.

The condition of Shimura, best known for Japanese variety show ""Shimura Ken no Bakatono-sama"", was said not to be critical.

A household name in Japan since the 1970s, Shimura was the first prominent entertainment world figure in Japan to test positive for the virus.

The actor was set to star in his first feature film ""God of Cinema"", directed by Yoji Yamada.

The film, which marks the 100th year anniversary of studio Shochiku, has been put on hold indefinitely.

Shimura grew up in the west Tokyo neighbourhood of Higashimurayama and he started his career in showbiz when he joined the Japanese rock band and comedy group The Drifters, famous for opening for The Beatles during their early tours of Japan.

He shot to fame with the group's prime time comedy show ""Hachijidayo Zeninshugo!"" (""It's 8 o'clock, assemble everyone!""), where he developed his signature brand of slapstick caricature, wacky bits and deadpan delivery.

American comedian Jerry Lewis was an initial influence on him, Shimura wrote in a late-career memoir.

On hit variety shows of the 1980s, he would go on to become a bigger name recognised for satirical characters like ""Baka Tonosama"" (foolish lord) and ""Henna Ojisan"" (weirdo uncle).

""I don't see how you look at those numbers and conclude anything less than thousands of people will pass away. Because remember who it's attacking, it's attacking the vulnerable, (with) underlying illness among other. And I don't see how you get past that curve without seeing thousands of people pass away. I hope it's wrong.

""And we will continue to see the number of deaths increase. In terms of most impacted states, again, New York is still number one,"" he said.

The grim figure of over a 1,000 deaths comes less than a month after the first known coronavirus infection was identified in the state on March 1.

A healthcare worker, who had recently returned from Iran, was the first confirmed coronavirus case in the state.

Just days later, a lawyer in the New York suburb of New Rochelle tested positive for the virus and was at the centre of one of the earliest US coronavirus clusters. Cuomo announced that the lawyer recovered sufficiently and has now gone home from the hospital.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US stood at 143,025 and 2,509 people have died in the country, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Over 7,000 additional coronavirus cases in New York state were recorded, bringing the statewide total to 59,513, Cuomo said.

New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the number of coronavirus cases in the city alone were 32,308, ""a stunning number. And we have lost, and this is so painful, 678 of our fellow New Yorkers. That means in the last 24 hours from this morning to Saturday morning, we lost 161 more people in this city. People of all walks of life, every kind of New Yorker"".

The mayor said New York City remains the epicenter of the crisis nationally.

""A day will come when I will be able to no longer use that word and we all look forward to that word. But right now, we are the epicenter and the numbers are staggering,"" he said.

A total of about 8,000 people are currently hospitalised in New York state, including 2,000 ICU patients.

Cuomo also pointed out that 3,500 patients have been discharged.

""We know - nobody really points to these numbers but this is good news. 846 people came out of hospitals yesterday, discharged after being treated for COVID-19,"" he said.

He told reporters that initially the hospitalisation rate in the state was doubling every two days, then it doubled every three days, then every four days.

""Now it's doubling every six days. So you have almost a dichotomy: The doubling rate is slowing, and that is good news but the number of cases are still going up. So you're still going up towards an apex, but the rate of the doubling is slowing, which is good news.

Earlier in the day, the Governor said in an e-mail that ""tragically we have now lost almost a thousand New Yorkers to this vicious virus. We mourn them deeply. Every life lost is one too many. We are fighting to save every life we can. You can help us by staying home and slowing the spread"".

Cuomo said he is extending the ""New York on PAUSE"" policy until April 15, which means non-essential businesses and schools will continue to stay closed.

Gatherings of any size for any reason remain cancelled and all New Yorkers continue to be directed to practice social distancing -- by staying home and keeping six feet of space from others when in public. The state will re-evaluate after this additional two-week period.

He said ""the increase on the trajectory of cases continues to climb"".

Cuomo notes as the state tries to reduce the spread of the virus, it is also preparing for the worst.

He said a 1,000 bed temporary hospital is opening at the sprawling Javits convention center on Monday, and other temporary hospitals are being built.

Three COVID-only facilities are also planned. The USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, will arrive in New York Harbor on Monday, staffed with 1,200 medical professionals.

On the travel advisory issued by President Donald Trump and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention for people of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Cuomo said the advisory was not for a lockdown.

""It is a travel advisory to be implemented by the states. In essence, it's nothing that we haven't been doing. Non-essential people should stay at home. So it's totally consistent with everything we're doing and I support what the President did because it affirms what we've been doing. It also affirms what New Jersey and Connecticut have been doing,"" he added.

207,30-3-20,"US won't pay for Prince Harry, Meghan's security protection in California: President Trump","President Donald Trump has said that the US will not foot the bill for Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle's security amid reports that the royal couple have moved to Los Angeles from Canada.

Last week, The Sun, a British tabloid, reported that the royal couple and their 10-month-old son Archie moved to Los Angeles, where Markle was raised. However, the report was not confirmed.

President Trump tweeted in response to such a report on Sunday.

""I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen & the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the US however, the US will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!,"" he tweeted.

In January, 35-year-old Prince Harry and Markle, 38, announced that they would step back from their Royal duties. They said they planned to split time between North America and the United Kingdom.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed the country would fund half of the USD 1.3 million in estimated security costs, but he has said the conversations are tentative, The Hill quoted Evening Standard as saying.

The royal family moved in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which has captured the world's attention, as hundreds of thousands of people have been infected, thousands of people have died, and many countries and states are banning people from leaving their homes except in certain circumstances, the Hill reported.

According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 32,000 people have died of coronavirus and 684,652 have been infected globally.

Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and sixth in line to the British throne, married American actress Markle at Windsor Castle in May 2018.

209,30-3-20,Italy's 'very long' lockdown to only end gradually,"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government prepared Italians for a ""very long"" lockdown Sunday that would only be lifted gradually despite its economic hardship and traumatic impact on daily lives.

The message from ministers and health officials came as Italy's world-topping toll rose by 756 -- well bellow Friday's record of 969 -- and the rate of coronavirus infections slowed to under six percent for the first time.

Yet the government appeared more focused on the nearing April 3 deadline to lift a national lockdown that had never been tried by a Western democracy -- and has since been replicated across Europe and the United States.

""The measures expiring on April 3 will inevitably be extended,"" Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia told Italy's Sky TG24 television.

""I think that, at the moment, talking about re-opening is inappropriate and irresponsible.

""We all want to go back to normal. But we will have to do it by turning on one switch at a time."" Italy is effectively sacrificing almost all forms of business activity to fight the pandemic that first emerged in China last year.

Deputy Finance Minister Laura Castelli said that the government's initial 25 billion euro ( 28 billion) rescue package for affected families and companies might have to be quadrupled in size.

""In my opinion, at least 100 billion (euros) will be needed,"" Castelli told the La Stampa daily.

Italy's death toll now stands at 10,779 and the number of officially registered infections is just under 100,000.

But officials brushed aside various data suggesting that both rates were slowing and that Italy might have already lived through the worst.

""We are in the midst of a pandemic,"" Health Minster Roberto Speranza told reporters.

""It would be a mistake to let our guard down."" Government medical adviser Luca Richeldi warned that data pointing to a slowdown ""are a reason for us to be even stricter.

""We are in a very long battle,"" said Richeldi. ""Through our behaviour, we save lives."" Ministers are expected to decide on the length of an extension in the coming days.

Conte has the right to keep the lockdown -- in full or in part -- until the existing state of medical emergency expires on July 31.

But there is nothing preventing his government from declaring a new one should restrictions be needed into the second half of the year.

Conte has indicated that he would like to see most measures lifted by June.

Yet the strains on Italian society imposed by measures that might have seemed unimaginable just weeks ago are gradually starting to show.

The starkest example came when armed police began guarding entrances to supermarkets in Sicily after reports of looting by people who could no longer afford food.

Newspaper stories about growing discontent in one of Italy's least-developed regions appeared to be at least partially behind Conte's decision to make another TV appeal to the nation on Saturday.

Conte used it to announce a food voucher programme that will cost the government another 400 million euros ( 445 million).

""We know that many suffer but the state is there,"" Conte said.

But this is only a stop-gap measure designed to help families cover grocery costs of between 25 and 50 euros on a one-time basis.

Projections from several global banks and think-tanks in the past week point to Italy's economic output shrinking by seven percent this year.

Those numbers are based on the assumption that the lockdown will not be extend far beyond April.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/italy-s--very-long--lockdown-to-only-end-gradually-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/italy-s--very-long--lockdown-to-only-end-gradually.html

A new domestic case was reported in Gansu province, it said.

The four deaths were reported from the virus epicentre Hubei province, it said.

It said that 168 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus, 165 of whom were from abroad.

By the end of Sunday, 641 confirmed cases including four deaths have been reported from Hong Kong, 38 confirmed cases in Macao and 298 in Taiwan including three deaths.

A total of 118 patients in Hong Kong, 10 in Macao and 39 in Taiwan have been discharged from the hospital after recovery.

China on Sunday resumed domestic flights in the coronavirus epicentre Hubei province, except for its capital Wuhan, as part of a plan to ease the lockdown in the region following a steep decline in the number of confirmed cases.

Hubei's capital Wuhan, which bore the brunt of the vicious virus for over two months, would begin its air services from April 8.

China began to ease its lockdown of Hubei province, home for over 56 million people, from March 25 by resuming local transport services followed by relaxation of travel for people tested negative for coronavirus.

According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 32,000 people have died of coronavirus and 684,652 have been infected globally.

213,30-3-20,Apple Watch Series 6 may feature touch ID fingerprint sensor,"Cupertino-based tech giant Apple is reportedly planning to include a touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the crown of its upcoming Watch Series 6.

The Apple Watch already unlocks when the iPhone is unlocked, but unlocking it on a standalone basis requires a numerical code to be entered.

It is not clear how the alleged Touch ID fingerprint sensor would be implemented, as the Digital Crown is already used for capturing an ECG in the current Apple Watch models, reports MacRumors.

Apple is also reportedly planning to bring blood oxygen detection and an improved ECG to its next Watch Series 6.

The technology for blood oxygen detection has existed in the Apple Watch since the first version, it has never been used, but now the upcomming Apple Watch may have the ability.

Additionally, Apple is working on removing a current shortcoming of the current electrocardiogram function.

Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 currently result in inconclusive ECG readings with heart rates between 100 and 120 beats per minute and new update will remove that limitation with an upgraded version of the ECG app.

220,30-3-20,Aaditi Pohankar on recognition post 'She': I feel empowered as an actor,"It is a surreal feeling for actor Aaditi Pohankar who is receiving congratulatory messages from people across the world after watching her Netflix original series ""She"".

The actor said she feels encouraged to do more work going forward.

Co-written and created by Imtiaz Ali, ""She"" features Aaditi as a timid Mumbai constable who realises the potential of her dormant sexuality after she goes undercover to expose a drug ring. The show also stars Vijay Varma.

For the 25-year-old, playing her character, Bhumika Pardesi, was an inspiring journey.

""When I was shooting for the film, it was another feeling of achievement because the script was giving me the power and that resonated with the audience. Today, when I relive my times as Bhumika, it gives me so much inspiration to work more and more,"" Aaditi told PTI in an interview.

The actor said playing the character has given her the strength, that she said, she can stand in front of anybody and say ""please give me the script, then we shall talk"".

""I feel so empowered as an actor today. I'm enjoying this completely without thinking what will happen next,"" she added.

For Aaditi, the journey of ""She"" started nearly two years ago when she met Imtiaz at the screening of ""Laila Majnu"" and asked him to check her showreel.

She had featured in Marathi blockbuster ""Lai Bhaari"", also starring Riteish Deshmukh, and had done two films down south till then.

When Imtiaz saw her showreel, he called her for a meeting, where to her surprise, designer Aki Narula was also present.

""He started narrating the script but said this isn't the kind of part I'd do, as I'm more on the rom-com side. He said the part is of an unattractive girl. But the second he started to speak about Bhumika, I could feel certain connection with the character.""

For the series, Aaditi had to get into the character of a cop who has to moonlight as a sex worker and thus, involved a certain intimacy which the actor wasn't sure she could pull off.

Coming from a family of Hindustani Classical musicians, the actor was a bit wary.

""I had told Imtiaz sir that I'm essentially a shy girl. When he asked me till what extent I can do things for the show, I said it isn't about the extent, I trust you completely and will do whatever you say. The best part about Imtiaz sir is that he never makes you feel uncomfortable about anything.

""There is nothing ever that you have to do. If you're able to do it, great, if not, we will do something else. Our jugalbandi (tuning) really worked. Nothing felt awkward, thanks to him and Vijay Varma who kept saying sorry after every take,"" she added.

Co-directed by Avinash Das and Arif Ali, the series also focuses on the complex equation between narcotics dealer Sasya, played by Vijay, and Bhumika.

The actor said the fear her character feels in front of Sasya was something she channelled from real life.

""The first day we rehearsed, I had called Vijay and asked if we could rehearse at his house. That day I was a little scared, because I had just met him and wondered what will he think. But I so wanted to get this out of my way, I said let's do this.

""We did a small acting exercise. That fear, the one I had that day, I used it throughout my character. I didn't know him, so as a woman I kept thinking what will he think.""

Post ""She"", Aaditi said, big producers have got in touch with her.

""I'm surprised that compliments are coming my way from across the world, from Los Angeles to South Africa... I can see myself doing commercial cinema.

240,30-3-20,"Coronavirus lockdown: Patrolling intensified on Delhi borders, says Kejriwal","Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said intense patrolling on Delhi's borders has been initiated to prevent movement of migrant workers in the national capital during the ongoing 21-day lockdown period.

He said an alarming situation had arisen after a large number of people gathered in Kaushambi bordering Delhi's Anand Vihar over rumours that buses were stationed there to take migrant workers to their home states.

The situation is under control now but some people are still trying to enter Delhi. Therefore, patrolling has been intensified in border areas of the city, the chief minister said.

Though all inter-state bus service were suspended following the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night, thousands of daily wagers and labourers from Delhi, Haryana and even Punjab had been reaching Anand Vihar, Ghazipur and Ghaziabad's Lal Kuan areas since Thursday after arduous treks on foot in a bid to ride buses to their respective native places.

Kejriwal said police and civil administration officers have been directed to ensure that people do not come out on roads.

He also asked people to stay indoors terming it an act of ""biggest patriotism"" and urged them to not pay attention to rumours.

Kejriwal said the government is working towards providing ration to the needy who do not have ration cards and ensured strict punishment against fair price shop owners if they indulged in malpractices.

Appealing to all ration shop owners to show humanity as country is going through difficult times, Kejriwal said following his directions, a ration dealer in Janakpuri was arrested for stealing ration.

So far, 72 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the national capital.

243,30-3-20,DRDO developing ventilator prototype,"The Defence Research Development Organisation has developed a prototype ventilator that can be used for multiple patients, its chief Satheesh Reddy said on Monday, amid a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the country.

He added the model is being improved to include changes suggested by medical researchers and doctors and the new version should be ready by next week.

""We are attempting to take the output of one ventilator. The mechanism makes it usable for multiple patients. We have developed the first model. We have seen it is working. There are some medical researchers, doctors who have advised us to incorporate features. We are working on it,"" he said.

Reddy said this is a “last-minute resort” if the number of coronavirus patients increases and there is shortage of ventilators.

“By next week it should be ready with the suggestions made by the doctors and medical researchers,” he said.

The DRDO has prepared ventilator designs in the past and passed it on to the industry.

Separately, the Ministry of Health said the DRDO will begin manufacturing 20,000 N-95 masks per day from next week.

245,30-3-20,"'Staggering': New York virus death toll rises above 1,200","A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday in New York City as the number of deaths in the state from the outbreak climbed quickly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said President Donald Trump's suggestion that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals is “insulting” to front-line medical workers.

The number of reported coronavirus deaths in New York shot up by 253 in a single day to just over 1,200, a number Gov. Andrew Cuomo called ""staggering.""

""That's a lot of loss, that's a lot of pain, that's a lot of tears, that's a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling,"" the governor said at a briefing in Manhattan.

Cuomo sounded the mournful note even as a Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived in New York City.

State officials expect the number of deaths to continue to rise as the outbreak reaches its projected peak in the coming weeks.

""Whatever the numbers is, it's going to be staggering,"" Cuomo said. “We've lost over 1,000 New Yorkers.” ""To me, we're beyond staggering already,"" he said.

The state has already confirmed more than 66,000 cases, mostly in New York City. There are 9,500 people in New York currently hospitalized for COVID-19.

A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday morning in New York City to help relieve the coronavirus crisis gripping the city's hospitals.

The USNS Comfort, which was sent to New York City after 9/11, will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters the ship will relieve stress on city hospitals as the massive white vessel pulled into a cruise ship terminal off Manhattan.

In addition to the 1,000 beds, the Comfort has 12 operating rooms that could be up and running within 24 hours.

The ship's arrival comes as New York state's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed Sunday above 1,000, less than a month after the first known infection in the state.

Most of those deaths have occurred in just the past few days. New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. Outbreak, reported Sunday that its toll had risen to 776.

The total number of statewide deaths isn't expected to be released until Monday, but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning, the state's total fatalities was at least 1,026.

Two more New York City health care workers have died of the coronavirus, days after the first confirmed death.

De Blasio announced Sunday the deaths of Freda Ocran, a psych educator at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx, and Theresa Lococo, a pediatric nurse at Kings County Hospital.

Ocran was previously the head nurse of the psych unit at Jacobi and was working, in part, to support her mother in Africa, de Blasio said.

On March 20, Ocran changed her profile picture on Facebook to include a mantra familiar to people on the front lines of the coronavirus fight: “I can't stay home ... I'm a healthcare worker.”

Lococo had worked for the city's hospital system for 48 years, de Blasio said.

Last week, Mount Sinai West emergency room nurse Kious Kelly died Tuesday after a 10-day bout with the virus.

De Blasio and others criticized Trump for suggesting with no clear evidence that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals.

At a Sunday briefing, the president told reporters they should be asking, “Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door?”

Those remarks are “insulting” to hospital workers on the front lines of the city's coronavirus crisis, de Blasio said Monday.

“It's incredibly insensitive to people right now who are giving their all,"" he said.

""I don't know what the president is talking about.” Hospitals had warned staff early on during the outbreak to not take masks home with them, but no evidence has emerged of large-scale looting of supplies.

Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said in a statement that the workers “deserve better than their president suggesting that protective equipment is 'going out the back door' of New York hospitals.”

Police in New York City have caught the first bar owner to violate a coronavirus shutdown by running a speakeasy, according to a news report on Monday.

The New York Post said that officers arrested 56-year-old Vasil Pando after they found a dozen people drinking and gambling at a Brooklyn sports bar that was supposed to keep its doors closed during the crisis.

It said Vasil was facing illegal sale of alcohol and other criminal charges. A name for an attorney wasn't listed in court records on Monday.

The report comes a day after Blasio warned of more stringent social-distancing measures, including fines of up to $500 if they refused police orders to disperse. New Yorkers have “been warned and warned and warned again” and deserve fines ""if they haven't gotten the message by now,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-staggering---new-york-virus-death-toll-rises-above-1-200-2020-03-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/-staggering---new-york-virus-death-toll-rises-above-1-200.html
