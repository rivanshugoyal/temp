0,21-4-20,Innovation during a crisis,"The countrywide lockdown has catapulted an archaic industry such as law to adopt technology at a never-seen-before pace

With the country being in the midst of an extended lockdown, businesses and individuals are feeling the anxiety and stress brought on by uncertainty regarding the future. Though India Inc. plans a partial exit strategy but to jumpstart a stalled economy is an onerous task. It is, therefore, a valid assumption that economic disruptions caused due to a nationwide lockdown might give a two-fold rise to disputes. The closure of courts and tribunals to curb the spread of the virus has understandably delayed justice to companies and individuals alike. Although the Supreme Court is hearing important cases via videoconferencing, lower courts lack the infrastructure to keep up with these advancements. Therefore, in such times, traditional reliance on litigation is a far from optimal way of dealing with conflict.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. Fortunately, Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADS) is at last beginning to emerge as a response to conflict in its myriad forms and to the challenge of building a more peaceful world. ADS mechanisms prescribed by the Civil Procedure Code (CPI) under Section 89(1)-(2) include arbitration, mediation, conciliation, judicial settlement, judicial settlement through Look Adalats (people’s courts). ADS, being an informal process, provides quick, interim solutions to parties of a dispute, thereby mitigating conflicts by large. The arbitral institutes can broker an agreement between the parties in two or three successive meetings. In comparison to this, the other dispute resolution methods would take several months, if not years. At the outset, if time is on the claimant’s side, a well thought out, well-crafted demand with factual statements and even detailed legal analysis may help the client avoid the prolonged stress of litigation dispute escalation and yield an early influx of settlement funds. Some of the most compelling reasons for choosing ADS are high litigation expenses, time-consuming adjudication and most importantly, an appropriate method of carrying out dispute resolution whilst following social distancing amid the pandemic.

Though it started with trying to resolve disputes via e-mail, it went on to incubate an online dispute resolution (ODR) platform, known as the Centre of ADS Excellence. This method of dispute resolution was made a reality by marrying ADS mechanisms with technology. Typically, an ADS meeting or conference can be called at a short notice and if both parties are in agreement with the arbitration rules, an arbiter is appointed and time-stamped intimations are sent via e-mails, WhatsApp messages and SMSs (Short Messaging Services). This platform facilitates communication via video calls and eliminates the need for face-to-face communication. The question of its legality can be put to test by going through Section 19 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which states that the tribunal is not bound by provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) and may decide upon the procedure to be followed in conduct of such proceedings, thereby making online or live conduct well within the legal domain. No one can challenge such proceedings merely on the ground of being an online resolution proceeding. International Commercial Arbitration rules, which serve as a guideline to arbitration institutions around the globe and have been adopted by the India Council of Arbitration, also mandate that arbitration tribunals have the power to conduct proceedings via videoconference, telephone or any such other means of communication as may be deemed fit. This transposed the concept of ADS towards a highly advanced and a far more cost-effective method of ODR. The ODR also helps overcome jurisdictional issues, eliminate geographical barriers, automate administrative tasks, improve productivity of professionals, promote eco-friendly processes and finally, deliver a quick, economical and effective solution to disputes. The need for use of modern technology in courts was emphasised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Supreme Court in the matter of Meters and Instruments Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. Kanchan Mehta while hearing a petition on expeditious settlement of cases, especially those relating to business like the Negotiable Instrument Act.

The question of time-bound proceedings had already been answered by the Supreme Court vide its order dated March 23, by freezing the limitation period from March 15 until further orders. For instance, Section 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 stipulates passing of award within 12 months of commencement of proceeding, which may be extended by six months upon agreement of parties to the dispute.

It is necessary that technologies be effectively implemented in regular course of business and move away from the Supreme Court’s “urgent only” requirement for using videoconferencing and delve into full swing application of online proceedings for all cases and promote ODR, wherever applicable. The COVID-19 crisis has catapulted an archaic industry such as law to adopt technology at a never-seen-before pace and is believed by many to be the way forward.

1,21-4-20,Cops locked up in Sonebhadra lockdown,"Close on heels of attack on a police party trying to enforce lockdown, the Sonbhadra cops were up against a unique protest by a shop owner when an entire team was locked inside a shop after the owner was asked to close it down on Monday.

The team remained locked inside the shop for over an hour before being rescued by senior officers.

A case was registered and efforts were on to arrest the trader.

As per reports, Pannuganj Station House Officer Mahendra Pandey and four policemen went to enforce lockdown in the area on Monday morning. The team found a shop doing business in Ramgarh area. As the SHO along with cops went inside the shop to record the goings on on his mobile phone, the shop owner walked outside, pulled down the shutter and escaped.

The news of the police team being locked up spread soon as the ‘captive’ SHO informed the Police Control Room.

Later senior officers along with police personnel from Robertsganj and Raipur areas rushed to the spot. While they were figuring out how to unlock the shop, the shop owner’s daughter reached there with a duplicate key and opened the shop.

Meanwhile in Jhansi, a police team was attacked after it stopped some local youths from gambling in a public place despite lockdown being in force.

The cops later used force in which an old man was injured.

The hospitalised victim later alleged that the police opened fire on miscreants in which he was injured.

However, senior officers denied the charge, saying that they were probing the matter.

A police team from Ruxa police station went to Dali hamlet upon learning that some locals were gambling in a public place. As they reached there and tried to nab the accused, the gamblers started pelting stones. Later the cops cane-charged the gamblers. While the miscreants escaped, an old man was injured in the process and had to be hospitalised.

A case was registered and investigations were on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cops-locked-up-in-sonebhadra-lockdown.html

3,21-4-20,Man ‘sacrifices’ daughter in hope of bright future,"



|

In a bizarre case, a man, under the influence of a tantrik, sacrificed his toddler daughter in the hope of brightening his future, in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday.

However, the man’s wife informed the police about the murder after which he was arrested and put behind the bars.

As per reports, Wajid of Sikanderpur area used to work as a labourer in a brick kiln and had five children. On Sunday, he suddenly strangled his 30-month -old daughter and slashed her neck with a spade. He later buried the body in a nearby field.

However, the man’s wife came to know about the gruesome act of her husband after Wajid told her about the ‘sacrifice’. The shocked wife immediately approached the nearest police station and intimated the cops about the incident after which Wajid was taken into custody.

During interrogation, Wajid told the police that he had been worried over his financial condition for the last few months and hence he contacted a tantrik. He said that the tantrik told him to make a ‘human sacrifice’ to better his condition and so he killed his daughter.

A case registered, the girl’s body was exhumed and sent for autopsy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/man----sacrifices----daughter-in-hope-of-bright-future.html
4,21-4-20,75 pc coronavirus positive cases asymptomatic in UP,"



|

With three more districts being declared coronavirus infected, the Uttar Pradesh government claimed that around 75 per cent of positive cases were asymptomatic, indicating a tough fight to contain the infection that has been spreading steadily.

Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that with coronavirus positive cases being reported from Mau, Etah and Sultanpur, these districts were declared coronavirus infected, taking the number of affected districts to 52.

The state has 75 districts and is inhabited by 23 crore people.

Prasad said that it was found in a study that around 75 per cent of coronavirus positive cases were asymptomatic, forcing the government to speed up testing and set up more hospitals for COVID-19 patients.

The principal secretary said that 3,268 samples were tested on Sunday while over 32,000 samples had been tested in the state till date.

Prasad said the government was attaching additional 10,000 beds with Level 1 hospitals at temporary buildings for suspected patients with no symptoms of the virus.

An asymptomatic patient does not show any symptom of the disease because of various factors, including a strong immune system, despite being a potent carrier of the virus, if unchecked.

Doctors give many reasons for patients being asymptomatic but testing positive. “It depends on a patient’s age and immunity. If the virus is not virulent and the load is not high, the afflicted person may not show any symptom. But if tested, he can be coronavirus positive,” said Dr SK Pandey from RML Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow.

Dr Pandey said that younger patients with good immunity may not show any signs of the disease. “Therefore, the need of the hour is to go for random testing, which the government is doing now,” he said.

Meanwhile on Monday, the Health department released the report of the survey of age group of infected people. As per the report, patients in the age group of 0-20 years accounted for 19.39 per cent while figure was the highest at 48.04 per cent for the 21-40 years age group.

Besides, 24.06 per cent of the infected persons are in the 41-60 years age group, and 8.5 per cent in people above 60 years of age. Last week, the incidence was 9.4 per cent in 60 years and above group.

“The decline in infection among elderly persons shows that people are taking good care of their parents, which is a very encouraging sign,” a Health department official said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/75-pc-coronavirus-positive-cases-asymptomatic-in-up.html
5,21-4-20,No industrial activity in Punjab containment zones,"A day after announcing that Punjab would not give any relaxation in curfew till May 3, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday made it clear that no industrial activity is allowed in the containment zones or hotspot areas.

The Chief Minister, in line with his decision not to ease state-wide curfew despite relaxations allowed by the Centre, clarified that industrial units being permitted to function in non-containment zones would be required to align to the State Government’s earlier orders besides the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

The MHA guidelines are in consonance with the State Government’s decision to allow certain units to function with labourers staying on-site, the Chief Minister pointed out, adding that the Centre had accepted Punjab’s suggestion on this count.

Capt Amarinder on Monday asked the Deputy Commissioners to immediately clamp down on all activities that are contributing to the spread of Covid-2019 pandemic in the containment zones and any other areas where the local administration sees a hotspot developing.

At the same time, he asked the Deputy Commissioners to facilitate opening of industrial units in non-containment areas by meticulously complying with the detailed instructions issued by the State Government on April 18 to facilitate opening of such industrial units that can operate in the light of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) orders.

All MHA guidelines and conditions should be strictly complied with by the district administration, he added.

“Conditions, laid down by the State Government with regard to arrangement for stay, transport and food, should be strictly met, along with meticulous compliance with all health advisories relating to the pandemic,” the Chief Minister instructed the DCs.

Capt Amarinder said that the State Government was deeply concerned about the plight of labour, including migrants, and of Punjab’s industry, most of which is tiny, micro, and small. “At the same time, we are fully conscious of the need to ensure that curfew imposed in the State has helped contain spread of Covid-19, and therefore needs to continue for some more time,” he said.

The detailed instructions issued on April 18 were in this background and aimed at facilitating the opening of industrial units as permitted under the new MHA guidelines of April 15, he added.

The MHA guidelines said that bulk passes may be issued for the industrial and other establishments or activities that have been permitted with effect from April 20, 2020. These have been allowed to commence operations with stringent compliance to conditions regarding stay and transport of workers.

Notably, as many as 11 different categories of industrial establishments have been allowed to operate with the condition that in case the industrial establishment employs 10 or more persons, it shall make arrangements for stay of workers within its premises as far as possible or adjacent buildings.

The transportation of workers to work place shall be arranged by the employers in dedicated transport by ensuring social distancing.

Similarly, construction projects have also been permitted subject to some conditions, which implies that the related activities of stone crushing, mining of sand and gravel its transport, sale out-lets of cement, steel are also permitted though their working norms can be regulated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-industrial-activity-in-punjab-containment-zones.html

7,21-4-20,"Start mapping of land assets in green zones, Haryana CM directs officials","Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday directed the officials to start the mapping of land assets in the green zones of Mahendragarh, Rewari, and Jhajjar districts of the State through the Survey of India following the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs during the lockdown period after obtaining necessary permission from the Government. The directions were issued by the Chief Minister in a meeting while reviewing the project of mapping of land assets of the State by Survey of India through video conferencing with Surveyor General of India Lieutenant General (Retd), Girish Kumar.

Khattar also directed the officers to develop a dashboard in coordination with the National Informatics Centre to keep track of the mapping, for which the first phase of survey has been completed and the Chief Minister will personally monitor it. Ministry of Home Affairs has given permission to the states to carry out industrial and economic activities during the lockdown period with some conditions from April 20 onwards, except in containment zones, and in the first phase, Haryana too has started some activities. The work of mapping of Survey of India is also a part of this. Three districts of Haryana, Mahendragarh, Rewari and Jhajjar have been declared green zones as positive Covid-19 cases have not been registered in these districts.

Khattar was also informed at the meeting that data acquisition using drones has been completed in 75 villages of 15 districts, while the process of data collection is underway in Karnal and Sonepat districts. A preliminary base map of the population (Lal Dora) has been prepared for three villages in Sonipat, five villages each in Panchkula and Karnal, four villages each in Sirsa and Panipat and five villages in district Faridabad, he added.

Khattar said these 26 villages have invited objections or suggestions and are ready to resolve or settle such objections within seven days. He also said that a District Development and Panchayat Officer will be designated as the Nodal Officer for the activities related to the Lal Dora region. In addition, a unique ID will be provided to every property or residential land on the lines of the ID provided for urban areas by the Urban Local Bodies Department, he added. He said that necessary directions have been issued by the Department of Development and Panchayats in this regard.

8,21-4-20,COVID can grease the Indian economy,"This is the time for the country to take advantage of the falling world oil prices due to reduced demand in order to strengthen its position and fiscal parameters later

The countrywide lockdown necessitated by the Coronavirus pandemic has had a huge impact on the economy, robbing millions of people of livelihoods and also requiring additional expenditure on healthcare. However, amid this gloom and doom, there is a silver lining for the fiscal situation. This is the time to take advantage of the world oil price scenario to strengthen India’s position and fiscal parameters later. The petroleum sector is the single most important one in terms of revenue and expenditure for both the Centre and the States.

India spends about 30 per cent of its import bill on fuel sources and a majority of it is petroleum or crude oil. As per the all-India report submitted to the Delhi-based Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), 70 per cent of diesel and 99.6 per cent of petrol are consumed in the transport sector alone. Hence, the slightest change in the global oil market will impact our current account significantly. According to the PPAC, a decline of crude oil price by $1/bbl improves the current account by Rs 965 crore and if the rupee strengthens by one against the dollar, it improves the oil bill by Rs 553 crore. On the revenue side, petroleum has generated a whopping Rs 5.7 lakh crore in 2018-19 for the Centre and States.

The price of oil is hovering around $20/bbl and its major consumers (US (20 per cent), China (14 per cent), Japan (four per cent), just like India, are currently battling the pandemic and not likely to push prices soon. Some projections suggest that crude oil price could hit $12/bbl in the coming months. Today, the US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, has fallen to $15 for the first time in 21 years due to falling crude demand. To add to this, global oil storage is reaching its limits. The situation is so dire, in fact, that the Department of Energy is considering paying domestic oil producers to keep crude in the ground.

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Association (IEA) predict similar trends for crude. Its lower price bound is hovering around $20/bbl and other predictive values lie between $30/bbl to $40/bbl.

Now, let us look at three scenarios to see how India’s fiscal situation can improve, banking on this fall in oil prices. For the sake of our argument, we will consider only two petroleum products i.e. petrol and diesel, which are a major source of revenue for the Government in the petroleum segment. We are assuming one financial year (FY) i.e. April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 for our calculation.

Back to normal but less activity: To simulate this scenario, we will use oil consumption data of 2016-17, or the demonetisation year data. The reason for taking the demonetisation demand and not last year’s is that economic activity will return to the level of a bad financial year. Under this scenario, India will enjoy a huge price advantage. The price of crude is hovering around $20/barrel and according to sources, it is expected to remain at that level for the next six months. Thus we assume an oil price of $20/barrel for six months and $30 for the rest of the year. In this scenario, additional oil revenue generated for the Government could be Rs 1.4 lakh crore.

Slow and staggered normalcy: Under this situation, India will slowly recover and go back to normal economic activity. To simulate, we assume only 10 per cent activity in the first two months, 30 per cent activity in the next two months, 50 per cent in the following two months and business as usual in the remaining six months. The price situation would be the same as in scenario one. In this situation, the Government can get an additional revenue of up to Rs 90 thousand crore.

India lags in controlling COVID-19 and the US recovers: The pandemic has hurt the US the worst. Significantly, the US is also the largest consumer of crude oil. If the US recovers quickly from the current pandemic and resumes normal economic activity it will make the crude oil price shoot to $30 for the first three months, i.e. April to June, then $40 for the next three months and $50 for the rest of the year. In India’s case the demand situation will be slow in recovering and experience a staggered improvement, like in the second scenario. In this situation, the Government can raise an additional Rs 23,104 crore over the FY.

Our calculations show that India’s advantage varies from Rs 1.4 lakh crore to a few thousand crores. This shows how current actions can shape up our fiscal situation in the next year and so.

Conclusion: The three scenarios described above suggest that starting economic activity before the European Union and the US will give India a comparative advantage internationally and more importantly in domestic business. It will also provide a window of opportunity for the Government to improve its fiscal situation.

India can use this opportunity to improve its current account deficit (CAD) position and exchange rate. Less pressure on imports and huge export opportunities in the healthcare-related sectors should strengthen the rupee and improve the CAD.

On the employment front, return to normalcy can create huge job opportunities in the petroleum sector. A few other sectors, like business services, education services and pharma can also give comparative wage advantage to India, which according to economic researchers Dingel and Neiman, can completely shift to the work from home (WFH) mode. They used two Occupational Information Network surveys to estimate share of jobs that can be done at home in each occupation type. Combining these facts and adding information into the social accounting matrix (SAM) framework can observe an additional 11 lakh employment opportunities. SAM is a comprehensive accounting framework within which the full circular flow of income — from production, to factor income, to household income to household demand and back to production — is captured. These estimates show that petroleum, pharma and the business service sector can add 6,89,616 and 81,092 and 4,04,630 new jobs respectively post-Coronavirus. These estimations are based on moderate expectation of five per cent growth in exports in these sectors.

For all these to happen, India needs to start some economic activity as soon as possible, preferably by May 3, even if partially. Hotspots can be identified and locked down till the spread is contained. The Government should not shy away from providing relief to vulnerable sections. The important thing is that as soon as India can get back to normalcy it can reap the advantages of a slack in global demand in a number of sectors. Petroleum is the prominent one but there are sectors like pharma and services which will have a comparative advantage in the post-lockdown period. The need of the hour is to identify such domains and quick-start those activities.

Again, in a nutshell, India’s strategy should be to get back to normal as quickly as possible by using more resources; spending entire resources on the hotspots (tests, tracking and isolation); providing wage-coupons to daily wagers to contain them in the hotspots; inter-sectoral transformable skilling; identifying potential sectors and encouraging start-ups to harness WFH advantage to boost exports.

9,21-4-20,Set the record straight,"When we are fighting one of the deadliest viruses, nations must act responsibly. It’s time to scrutinise every Western media report that has run down India for its handling of the crisis

Novelist and activist Arundhati Roy told Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany’s public broadcaster, recently that the situation in India was “approaching genocidal.” The novelist claimed that Muslims were being stigmatised because of COVID-19 and that the Narendra Modi Government was exploiting the pandemic “to ramp up its suppression of Muslims.” Shockingly, she compared the Government’s tactics to the one used by the Nazis during the holocaust to use the outbreak of typhus to stigmatise the Jews. Finally, came this horrendous charge: “Indian mainstream media is genocidal — TV anchors are like single-member lynch mobs.” This is probably the most reprehensible statement made by anyone with regard to India, the biggest and the most vibrant democracy as also the most diverse nation in the world. No individual, who wishes to be taken seriously, would bandy the “G” word so recklessly.

Equally shocking is the decision of Germany’s public broadcaster to lend itself to such invidious propaganda against the world’s largest democracy. We all know that as a nation, Germany is well acquainted with the dreadful consequences of a genocide. This nation has struggled for 75 years to live down that terrible past and build a robust democracy. Likewise, senior editorial staff and news anchors in DW, who take editorial decisions, would certainly be acquainted with India’s glorious struggle for freedom and the secular, liberal and democratic Constitution that has been guiding its destiny since 1947. It is, therefore, inexplicable that Germany’s public broadcaster should take such liberties while talking about India.

Needless to say that Roy’s allegations are baseless. The truth is that currently in India a Muslim organisation — the Tablighi Jamaat — is in the news for its act of irresponsibility last month. It flouted State Government orders and went ahead with a conference in the heart of the nation’s capital, which was attended by people from Malaysia and Indonesia among others. Hundreds of delegates have since got infected with COVID-19 and are being treated in hospitals across the country. They have fanned out to various States and become the super-spreaders of COVID-19. The Union Government and Governments in 28 States are working overtime to trace the unfortunate victims and treat them. Misled by some clerics and by individuals like Roy, many of these patients are attacking healthcare workers and resisting treatment, thus endangering themselves, their family members, the entire Indian population and humanity itself. Indian newspapers and television news channels are full of stories of the attacks on doctors and nurses by these patients and their relatives, many of whom have been hospitalised. And this, according to Roy is “genocide!” It is unfortunate that DW did not even make rudimentary checks before running an interview that was full of blatantly false assertions.

We shall now turn to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). On April 14, it ran a story on how India was “underreporting” the Coronavirus outbreak. What was the basis for this report? Two faceless, anonymous doctors, who are too willing to air their views but lack the spine to identify themselves.

The BBC said “the reality is far more grim than what statistics show.” One doctor claimed that six patients with respiratory problems were brought in dead but they were not tested, implying that they were all probably COVID-19 victims. This is a serious allegation. The doctor must now identify himself and publicly make this claim so that the health authorities can verify and initiate suitable action. Otherwise, he will open himself to the charge of abetting the spread of the virus.

Ever since the epidemic hit India, television news channels back home have been talking to top doctors and heads of medical research in the country. These experts are just a phone call away and deem it their duty to keep the people informed but all that the BBC could find were two anonymous doctors. It claimed that one of the doctors, who works in Maharashtra, wanted anonymity because he feared “reprisal from the Government.” Which Government?

One fact that is hidden from readers and viewers across Western media platforms, including DW and the BBC, is that India is a federation and a large number of political parties run the federal Government and the 28 States. It is indeed a political kaleidoscope, with over two dozen political parties engaged in governance at just these two levels. But this fact is hidden so that whenever there is an insinuation that democratic traditions are flouted, a finger can easily be pointed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as if he heads a nation ruled by a single party.

The question one must pose to the BBC is: How responsible are you when you withhold such basic information about India’s democratic system? Also, all that you could get to further your unprofessional assumptions were two anonymous bytes in this nation of 1.3 billion people with top class experts in the field of medical science?

In the days ahead, one hopes the BBC will turn its special focus to the human tragedy that is unravelling in thousands of care homes in the UK in which hundreds of elderly citizens are dying every day of COVID-19 for want of adequate Government support.

Then you have the New York Times, which is doing its best to paint India’s decision to go in for a complete lockdown in dark shades. Its correspondents in New Delhi are claiming that India’s “already fragile economy will collapse” because of the lockdown. Meanwhile, there have been two developments, which show how motivated and biased these assertions are. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial institutions are unanimously declaring that India will have the highest real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2020-21 among all the G-20 nations. India’s GDP is expected to grow at 1.9 per cent as against minus 5.9 of the US, minus 6.5 of the UK etc. Obviously, India is doing something right? Also, an Oxford University study has declared that India is one of those countries where the lockdown was the strictest.

The time has come to scrutinise every report put out by these media corporations and to call out prejudice. Obviously, there is more to it than just irresponsible journalism. There is a deliberate attempt to run down the world’s largest democracy, which, despite under development, social and economic issues and political diversity of the kind that no other nation has experienced, has displayed phenomenal unity, confidence and discipline to tackle the pandemic. These reports constitute an affront to the 1.3 billion citizens of India.

In recent years, there have been incidents of violence against the immigrant Turks in Germany and the German Interior Ministry has reported that there are 26,000 radical Right-wing extremists in Germany, of whom 6,000 are neo-Nazis. The Islamic Human Rights Commission has said that the “British Government is responsible for the alarming rise of Islamophobia.”

But let us not say that the fascists are back in Germany, or that Britain, the cradle of modern democratic traditions, has forgotten all that has happened since the days of the Magna Carta and is now seeking solace in its medieval practices. We must behave responsibly.

10,21-4-20,"Needed, exit codes","As States relax restrictions, recklessness among Indians is not a good sign for the time when lockdown is completely lifted

Traffic on the roads of Mumbai, contradictory orders in Kerala, social distancing a casualty...the first day of the new week, one when things were supposed to get a bit more organised, as some people would be allowed back to work because of the Government’s decision to partially lift the restrictions for select sectors, highlights the challenges before both the Central as well as State Governments. There is no doubt that people are desperate to get back to work and so is the Government. State and Central Governments are facing huge revenue pressures and only getting the economy rolling can help ease this anxiety. Companies are desperate to restart work so that they can help their employees pay the bills. The partial resumption of work will help the workers get payments. Those self-employed, too, will be able to get back their source of income. Most importantly, the partial exit will come as a relief to the farmers. With the Rabi season reaching its peak this month, the free flow of labourers and transport system will mean they will at least be able to sell their produce and not incur losses. While all of this sounds good, the exit formula has to be well-planned for the spread of the virus in our country is still high; its scale cannot be ascertained yet. Different States cannot have separate sets of norms. For example, many people need a haircut but without putting into place safeguards, salons cannot be allowed to open. There needs to be a proper, deliberate nationwide procedure in place before salons, restaurants, bars and even large-scale public and private transport are allowed to re-open. Also, who will monitor compliances?

The continued lockdown till May 3 did at least establish that this country, as many others in the world, decided to keep the needs of public health before the economy. This is despite the fact that millions of Indians will probably lapse into poverty and destitution. In fact, many more might die from poverty than will actually directly be killed by the disease. Balancing this fact with the inevitability that India’s already overwhelmed public healthcare system will be brought to its knees by the Coronavirus is not something that any Government, either at the Centre or in any of the State capitals, would have ever thought they would have had to deal with. Despite the public clamouring for plans and the media criticising the way they have been put together, it would be correct to acknowledge that these are unprecedented times for administrators across the world. But that will not excuse a detailed set of codes to lift the lockdown, whatever it might be. The confusion of the initial days of the lockdown and the continuing stories of economic migrants, mainly from the eastern States stuck in industrialised parts of the country with little or no food or money, should entail that at least there is a uniform exit code.The chaos in the streets in some parts of the country today is an indication that an unplanned lifting of the lockdown will lead to an unmitigated disaster for the country, both on the public health front and on the economic front, and would have defeated the purpose of the past four weeks. The population is getting desperate but is still following rules to a large degree. Without proper planning and rules written down on paper, we should be aware of what is coming next.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/needed--exit-codes-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/needed--exit-codes.html
11,21-4-20,Double trouble,"If COVID-19 wasn’t enough, Uddhav’s chair is at risk as he is yet to be nominated to the Legislative Council

When Uddhav Thackeray became Chief Minister of Maharashtra after a political drama last November, one which saw Shiv Sena snap ties with the BJP and helped him emerge as the consensus choice of the alternative coalition he engineered with Sharad Pawar and the Congress, he had not bargained for the thorns in his way. First, the BJP, the ideological anchor of the Sangh Parivar, was extremely upset with its junior partner for stealing the thunder on the basis of its improved performance and negotiating chief ministership with the Opposition. It was but expected that it would place hurdles along the way of a coalition that was more about convenience of numbers than conviction of purpose, that was about power play than about a legacy of governance. If there was any legacy at all, it was only about Sena supremo Bal Thackeray’s wish of seeing a Sainik as Chief Minister. In his first administrative role, Uddhav had no time to settle in as the State recorded its first COVID-19 case on March 9, posing a severe challenge to the State’s healthcare system. And before he could get a grip on it, Maharashtra became the State with the highest number of COVID-19 patients across India. Then the exodus of migrant labourers caught him by surprise, a fact played up by the BJP as an example of his administrative ineptitude and poor foresight. Still, Uddhav did not lose his cool and went in for aggressive containment, testing and medical protocols as Asia’s biggest slum, Dharavi, has put him on trial. But he can clear that test provided he is allowed to. His major worry now is retaining the chair of the Chief Minister as his six months are almost up and he is yet to get nominated or elected to the House. In this grim scenario, he would have to resign his post.

Since he had not contested the Assembly election, according to Article 164 of the Constitution, he has to be elected as a legislator within six months from the date of appointment as CM. Uddhav will be completing six months on May 28. And though he could have been elected to the legislative council, polls for which had been scheduled for March 26 along with the Rajya Sabha election, the outbreak stalled everything. Assembly is no option either with the Election Commission suspending operations till further notice. Of course, the Maharashtra Cabinet resorted to the last strategy, recommending that Uddhav be nominated to the legislative council on the Governor’s quota. But BJP Governor Koshiyari, who technically cannot overturn a State Cabinet proposal, is yet to act on it and can by delaying, give the Chief Minister some anxious moments. According to Article 171 of the Constitution, the Governor can use his quota to nominate one-sixth of the total strength to the legislative councils, and can nominate Uddhav too. However, there is no timeline mentioned. This is so not desirable at a moment of crisis but if the time period lapses, then the Governor would have to again invite Uddhav and administer an oath. That would be not just a procedural nightmare in times of COVID but also politically, make Uddhav eat humble pie. Would the BJP let him know of its upper hand in the matter? Koshiyari had acted against Uddhav before, too, hurriedly administering the oath to Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar as Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister before Uddhav could stake his claim. But political posturing now, at the State’s gravest hour of crisis, would not show Raj Bhavan in a good light. The Sena is already whipping up a campaign against the delay. But one thing is clear, the BJP and Shiv Sena are not going to let each other rest easy going forward.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/double-trouble-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/double-trouble.html

The chief minister said that those engaged in door-to-door delivery should also be checked and asked to wear masks. He said that those coming from other places should be tested and pool testing should be encouraged.

Yogi said that the committee set up to ensure employment to labourers who had returned to the state should convene its meeting at the earliest. “The committee should prepare an action plan for exploring job creation for labourers, particularly in National Livelihood Mission and MNREGA,” he said.

He reminded officials that some industries were allowed to start operations but it should be made sure that social distancing and other protective measures were in place. He also asked the principal secretary (rural development) to ensure that there was no potable water problem in Bundelkhand region.

The chief minister said the expressway projects were also going to start with the rider of full safety measures. He asked the nodal officers for different states to solve problems of the natives of UP at the earliest.

13,21-4-20,BJP leader’s son misbehaves with lady doctor,"



|

The son of a senior leader of Bharatiya Janata Party and district panchayat chairperson misbehaved with a doctor in Kaushambi district hospital on Sunday evening.

Irked by the incident, the doctor lodged a report with Manjhanpur police. While the charges were being probed, no action was initiated against the accused so far.

As per reports, a woman from Maheva Ghat area was admitted to Kaushambi district hospital for delivery on Sunday evening and was being attended on by Dr Rekha Singh.

On Sunday evening, BJP leader and District Panchayat chairperson Awadh Rani’s son JP Singh reached the hospital and claimed that the admitted woman was his relative. Later, he had an altercation with Dr Rekha Singh over the time of delivery.

It was alleged that Singh misbehaved with the doctor and also threatened to get her dismissed from service.

On hearing the unsavoury exchange, other health workers reached the spot and they intervened and somehow defused the situation.

Anguished over the misbehaviour, the lady doctor lodged a report against JP Singh with Manjhanpur police and investigation were on.

Meanwhile in Bulandshahr, a sub-inspector extorted money from a cloth merchant by threatening to set him up in a fake case.

The matter was brought to the knowledge of senior officers after which the sub-inspector was suspended and an inquiry was ordered.

As per reports, Asheesh Agarwal, who owns a ready-made garment showroom in Bulandshahr, was sitting at the grocery shop of his younger brother as his shop was closed due to lockdown. On Saturday morning, Sub-Inspector Yashpal, posted at Ramghat police station, took him to the police station and threatened to book him in a case for selling pan masala which has been banned during lockdown.

The cop demanded Rs 1 lakh from Agarwal but a deal was struck for Rs 30,000, out of which Rs 20,000 was paid immediately and Rs 10,000 was to be paid later on.

Soon after being released by the sub-inspector, Asheesh Agarwal informed a local MP and local BJP leaders about the police excess . With their help, they met Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh and narrated the incident. The SSP immediately summoned ASP (Rural) Harendra Singh and asked him to find the facts. After the charge was confirmed, the SSP suspended sub-inspector Yashpal and ordered a departmental inquiry against him.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-leader---s-son-misbehaves-with-lady-doctor.html
14,21-4-20,"Congress, Irani spar over relief in Amethi","

|

The ongoing war of words on Twitter between the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Amethi, Smriti Irani, over extending support to locals during lockdown took a twist on Monday when the former alleged that Irani was obstructing distribution of relief materials sent by former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi for locals in an attempt to hide her failure.

The Congress alleged that Irani was unnerved with Rahul’s act of helping the people of Amethi and hence got Rahul Gandhi’s campaign office in Gauriganj raided by the Amethi district administration on Sunday.

Irani was quick to join the war on the virtual world and dumped the news of raid as fake. Instead, the Union minister charged Congressmen with unnecessarily hindering the Amethi administration in implementing lockdown and distribution of essentials to the poor and needy.

Congress MLC Deepak Singh claimed that Rahul had sent six trucks of wheat, five trucks of rice, 16,400 ration packets, 70,000 masks, 20,000 bottles of sanitisers and 20,000 soaps for the people of Amethi and party workers were distributing them. He alleged that Rahul’s initiative was being appreciated by Amethi’s people and the media and this became a thorn in the flesh for Irani and Amethi district administration.

“The BJP MP, who has been unsuccessful in hiding her failure, is now exerting pressure on administration to raid Congress office and harass party workers,” he alleged.

UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the Congress had a family-like relationship with Amethi and in this hour of crisis the party was serving the needy round-the-clock.

Lallu said that Amethi Congress president Pradeep Singhal was engaged in distribution of relief material and the people of Amethi were all praise for Rahul and so was the media.

“This has worried the BJP and it has been working in a vindictive manner by getting Rahul’s poll campaign office in Amethi raided and harassing party workers. An ADM quizzed Congress district chief, the office was raided despite being closed and the office watchman was threatened,” he alleged.

Lallu further alleged that Irani was disturbing relief material by misusing government machinery in a fit of frustration. .

“While the Congress denounces such autocratic acts, no one can stop us from providing relief to the poor. The people of Amethi will surely reply to the BJP government and Irani,” Lallu added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress--irani-spar-over-relief-in-amethi.html

The Administration issued an order in this regard stating that the cases of outbreak of Covid-19 in Chandigarh are seen as scattered, non-contiguous and sporadic in nature and spread, thus the entire city is declared as “containment zone”. The order, which came into force with immediate effect, will remain valid till the midnight of May 3.

With the entire Chandigarh declared as “containment zone”, 15 out of total 38 outer borders of the city have been closed till further orders, in a bid to contain spread of coronavirus.

“After consultation with the medical experts, the Chandigarh Administration is of considered opinion that the entire city of Chandigarh needs to be kept under strict measures of containment of spread of the Coronavirus,” it added.

Manoj Parida, Adviser to UT Administrator said, “Since in Chandigarh, Coronavirus outbreak is scattered and not confined to a specific pocket, area, village or cluster, entire union territory has been declared as containment zone.”

“The containment zone is basically to contain the spread of infection by focusing entire energy and resources of Government on steps including regulated entry to the city, intensified testing, quarantining, closing offices, non-essential items shops, transport social events, many of which are already done under curfew order,” he said.

Among various measures taken by the Administration, it has banned spitting at public places, banned the sale of chewing gum, bubble gum, pan masala and other allied products for the next three months and made wearing of face masks mandatory at public places.

19,21-4-20,Students should get ITI certificates along with Class 12 certificates: CM,"Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday said that to promote employment-oriented education in Chhattisgarh, ITI and higher secondary school curriculum will be integrated to provide students of Class 12, ITI certificate along with the HSC certificate.

The move, the CM said was to make students employable after clearing the Class 12 board exams.

Taking a major initiative in this direction, the chief minister has instructed the state school education department and the technical education department to formulate a scheme for integration of professional education curriculum of Class 11 and Class 12 with the ITI course.

Baghel has directed both the departments to jointly prepare the scheme and present it as soon as possible.

He said that the initiative will help the students of Class 11 and Class 12 to get high-level skill development training in the trade of their choice.

“This will make them more employable and help them get jobs easily,” the CM said.

He has also issued guidelines to both the departments regarding the action plan.

The chief minister has given instructions that although the vocationalisation of education is being talked about across the state since long time, and vocational education has been included in the curriculum to certain extend, but the desired outcomes could not be achieved.

For many years, it has been observed that despite completing formal education, students find it difficult to get employment, he said.

The Main reason behind this is the lack of workshops and skilled trainers in the schools, the CM added.

23,21-4-20,‘Home Away from Home’ quarantine facility for cops on duty,"Fighting on the frontline of Covid-19 battle, the Punjab Police personnel will now have a ‘Home Away from Home’ type of facility in districts, where they are working, equipped with all essential amenities, for home quarantining, in case of possible or suspected infection.

Besides, all police personnel deployed on high exposure duties will also be provided full body protective wear, such as personal protective equipment (PPEs), N95 and triple layer masks and gloves, to ensure their full protection from any risk of infection.

That was not all! All the Commissioners of Police (CPs) and Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs) were also directed to put in place effective measures for early detection of any flu or Covid type symptoms among the police personnel deployed in their district to ensure early care, treatment and rest.

These key welfare measures were taken during a video conference meeting by the state DGP Dinkar Gupta to review the situation in the state with all the district police chiefs and IG/DIG Ranges, as the second phase of the nationwide lockdown came into effect on Monday morning.

The meeting was also attended by top brass based in the State Headquarters, and the seven ADGPs who had been placed in-charge of Police Ranges for monitoring the district police functioning and the curfew enforcement in the light of the Covid crisis.

It was decided that instead of subjecting the families of police personnel suspected to be infected to any risk by sending them to their homes for quarantine, District Home Quarantine Centres would be set up for these cops. For the purpose, adequate number of locations or buildings would be identified in each district.

Whenever a police official is identified as a primary or secondary contact of a Covid positive patient, he or she will be placed under quarantine in these facilities, which will also be used for quarantine of those whose testing has been done but the report is awaited.

There may be cases of an officer coming-up as primary or secondary suspect of confirmed Covid case, thus necessitating quarantine between the date of sampling and the availability of viral load test results.

These centres will also be used for the very high risk contacts who are supposed to be quarantined for a period of 14 days (from the date of exposure) even if the result is negative, said the DGP.

The facilities will be well equipped to cater to the basic needs of the quarantined personnel, such as lodging, nutritious food arrangements, maintenance of cleanliness and hygiene, regular health checkups, emergency transport, emergency medical assistance, recreation etc.

Medical doctors posted with the District Police by the Health Department shall be made in-charge of such facilities, and doctors posted with Battalions will also be used and nominated for this purpose, wherever required. The centres will also have adequate paramedical staff. Assistance can be taken from private sector, if needed, said Gupta.

DGP said that ADGP Welfare V Neerja has been nominated as State Level Coordinator for ensuring proper and regular monitoring of the health and safety of police personnel working on the frontline across the State.

She would also monitor establishment and functioning of ‘District Home Quarantine Centres’, which will be personally supervised by ADGPs in-charge of Ranges and Commissionerates, as also Range IGPs or DIGs. Every District Police Chief will depute one DSP or ACP rank officer as DSP Welfare in his district for ensuring proper coordination of various welfare measures for safety and health of the State Police personnel, he said.

Meanwhile, the DGP also conveyed to the police officers the Chief Minister’s directives regarding strict enforcement of curfew, while ensuring relaxations to industrial units, construction sites, road construction projects in the non-containment zones, as per the policy laid down by the State Government, while ensuring full compliance with social distancing norms, proper public sanitation and hygiene etc.

The CPs and SSPs were also directed to ensure that harvesting and procurement operations are carried out in a safe and smooth manner to contain the spread of coronavirus in the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---home-away-from-home----quarantine-facility-for-cops-on-duty.html

47,21-4-20,State hotel industry seeks a slew of sops from Govt,"Hoteliers of Odisha have sought a slew of relief measures including waiver of taxes from the State Government to tide over their crisis in the wake of the nationwide lockdown.

Hotel and Restaurant Association of Odisha (HRAO) chairman JK Mohanty said the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement for a three-month moratorium on loan repayments is “not at all adequate” for the State’s hospitality sector,

He said the hoteliers have submitted a memorandum to the State Government seeking a number of measures for survival of the hospitality and travel sectors. Tourism Secretary Vishal Dev has also held a teleconference with hoteliers.

“Our industry needs moratorium on repayments of all working capital loans and overdrafts for at least one year,” he said, adding, “There should be collateral and interest-free loans up to five years for SMEs in the tourism sector which will help them sustain and rebuild.”

The State Finance Department is expected to write to all banks for extending relief urgently to the sector. The hoteliers have also urged the Government to waive State GST until the situation becomes normal. “We want a complete GST holiday for the tourism, travel and hospitality industry for the next twelve months,” Mohanty said.

There should also be waiver of fees for licences or renewals for the hospitality and travel industry for the time being, he said.

The HRAO’s petition also said the Urban Development Department should provide a 50% discount in payment of all statutory fees for getting approval of the tourism projects from the planning authorities. The taxes, which have been collected or yet to be levied during the COVID-19 period, bar licence, groundwater and electricity fees should be waived for three months, it said.

The HRAO said the bills for salary payments to staffs account for 25%-30% of the revenue of a hotel while the Government has “requested” to hoteliers to ensure that there should be “no salary cut or no retrenchment”.

Under such circumstances, the HRAO urged the Government to consider extending interest-free financial assistance to the stakeholders for payment of salary, wages and ESIC from the Odisha Labour Welfare Fund for at least six months.

The hoteliers also demanded a comprehensive marketing plan for revival of the sector. There should be short- and long-term plans with a thrust on domestic travellers and Indian corporates with proper guidelines and various incentives for meetings, conferences and exhibitions, the HRAO said.

Besides, Mohanty said the Government should declare a tourism policy with incentives to boost the State’s infrastructure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-hotel-industry-seeks-a-slew-of-sops-from-govt.html

He said that obstacles seen in the implementation of this scheme last year, should be removed.

Chief Minister Chouhan said that about 1.5 crore poor labourers of the state are involved in the Sambal Yojana last year. The low amount spent on the last financial year plan is a proof of neglect and indifference of the then government.

Chouhan said that other states have also been influenced by the utility and importance of this scheme. Its implementation is the priority of our state Government. Last year attention was not paid to the implementation of the scheme. Therefore, a small amount has been spent in the plan last year.

The Chief Minister said that the Sambal Yojana started in the state from April 2018 has been considered as a special scheme in the entire country.

It should be started again to benefit the eligible class. Chouhan said that lack of funds will not be allowed to come in the way of implementation of the scheme. All eligible beneficiaries will be given the benefit while making necessary budget provision.

Chief Minister Chouhan said that the poor were ignored while giving benefits of the scheme last year, which is not justified. In the second year after the commencement of the scheme, due attention was not paid to the implementation of the scheme. Chouhan said that he was informed by public representatives and general public in this regard during the tour of various districts last year. He said that the provisions of the scheme will also be reconsidered and it will be given a more comprehensive form soon.

There is mainly a provision to provide assistance for the last rites on general and untimely death, ex-gratia assistance on various types of disability and assistance for planning for the upgradation of small business. This scheme was initiated to provide financial assistance to the poor and deprived from birth to death.

Apart from discussion on the Labour Department, there was a discussion on expanding the scope of the scheme in the interest of tax beneficiaries in respect of health, higher education, power related facilities in the meeting. It was informed that in the scheme commencing from April 2018, an amount of Rs 703 crore was spent under the Labour Department in the year 2018-19.

Chief Secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, Additional Chief Secretary Finance Anurag Jain, Principal Secretary Ashok Shah, Secretary Public Relations P Narhari and other officials were present in the meeting.

There is provision to benefit the unorganised workers under the MukhyaMantri Jan Kalyan (Sambal) Yoajan, which was started on the initiative of Chief Minister Chouhan in the year 2018.

Among the unorganised labourers, those who are holding less than one hectare of land, are not income tax payers, are not in government service, who do not get PF, Gratuity and ESI benefits are considered eligible. The scheme had provision for ex-gratia on premature death, assistance for last rites and financial assistance on disability. The scheme was implemented for the needy persons of the State.

In Sambal Yojana, an amount of Rs 5 thousand was given as assistance for performing last rites. A provision was made to give an amount of Rs 2 lakh on general death and Rs 4 lakh on accidental death to the family.

Similarly, a provision was made to provide ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh for permanent disability and Rs one lakh ex-gratia for partial disabilty. There is also a provision to give 10 percent of loan obtained from the bank for purchasing equipment for advanced business or Rs 5 thousand, whichever is less.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-for-effective-jan-kalyan-rollout.html

53,21-4-20,Tribals fail to sell forest produce at peak time,"The economic conditions of the tribal community in particular and the poor and marginalised in general in Odisha are deteriorating day by day.

The minor forest produce (MFP) /non-timber forest produce (NTFP) which largely support them economically are either left unsold or go for distress sale due to various restrictions for the COVID-19 crisis.

This is the peak season for collection and harvest of MFP/NTFP. But the tribals cannot sell their forest produces due to COVID 19 restrictions. As per a Union Tribal Ministry communication, Rs 4,621.17 lakh is presently available with the Odisha Government under the Pradhan Mantri Ban Dhan Yojana (PMBDY) for procurement of MFP/NTFP. But procurement is affected due to COVID-19.

Social activist and Team Leader of the Foundation for Ecological Security Swapna Sarangi has urged the State Government to seriously come forward to rescue the tribal community at this juncture by assisting them in selling and disposing of the non-timber minor forest produce under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) , failing which it will lead to a crisis for economic deprivation of tribals.

The tribals in Odisha mostly are landless and primarily dependent on minor forest produces and its marketing for their livelihood. Almost 70 percent income of forest dwellers depends on collection and sale of MFP. But due to the utter incompetence of the concerned implementing agencies including TDCCOL, the Central support meant for MSP could not be utilised fully since long.

Lakhs of tribal people migrated to the urban and industrial areas, primarily to work in unorganized sectors. As COVID-19 destroys economies, in absence of job, home and food, these tribal migrant workers are all set to return. However, due to expensive and also nonavailability of testing facilities in remote rural areas, these migrant workers' health risk is more. Reverse migration, carrying the COVID 19 disease, can have devastating impact on indigenous communities, Sarangi cautioned.

While lakhs of tribal migrant workers have been stranded without home and food in urban areas , there family members who are at their home in rural areas have lost there traditional livelihood in this harvest season of minor forest produces. This has led to food crisis among the indigenous communities.

Purusottam Singh Thakur, a journalist-activist told, ""Now most of the Hats"", which are life line of the poor people are closed and the tribals could not sail there forest produces. The middle man could not come to the village to collct MFP. As such there is no cash flow and increasing malnutrition among tribal people. ""

So I got the hang of his person...literate sans education !

Okay...he could stand a chance to justify his school of thought had we been in the 80s - 90s or dissevered owing to dearth of network.

I make this statement above only to assure him a benefit of doubt...given it might not be as convincing if we wring it in a discussion.

So , I kept mum and smiled away. ...and all they see is...us living in old Brit mansions... and sir's bodyguards ! ...and feign blindness to the hardwork put into getting here.

Okay... so here this is...for those who know me... are so aware that 'm always ready to allow myself in a quarrel...fight...battle... and let me tell you...none is spared... not even my husband and incase he happens to know that I wrote this... since he is not on facebook... he must also learn straight that it is definitely not to please him and again not for him alone !

This service welcomes you only after you've been tested of your patience and hardwork... the quantum of stress you can endure and still be stressless...is that even a word....anyhow...!

So ya , dare forget the luck factor ! And you read and study and write and learn and stake your prime years believing that ' hardwork shall never fail you ' .

You are in the Uniform with others in the Uniform...Khaki !

Before you sprinkle your name on papers...

You are put in where you are responsible for the lives !

See... generally barring occupations like doctors , police and few more , we earn for ourselves with effecting little or more on to the life and property around... but that doesn't 'duty bind' us for the life of others.

You have already survived atleast one landmine blast targetted to wither your flesh fly into finding nowhere .

....while your wife is alone at home with her first time expecting a delicate foetus and she reads this on the tv and you are stationed at the back of beyond where the nearest hospital which is capacitated with performing a c-section in case of an emergency is atleast 2 hours away.

Past few years have seen ample communal wraths.

Festivals are less festivities with more fights and finding foes !

Now...Sir will step out of his air conditioned chamber into a podium for the next 48 hours at a stretch seating on a platic chair... and you know what he'll do... vigil over each of around 5 lakh people in the procession...trying not to bat his eyelid !

...such times...God forbid...may even see blood shed if Sir and his Jawans don't hold things in place.

Now come elections...given , a district...let's consider a ballpark figure... runs some 110 kms north-south and 80 kms east-west. Sir will have to ensure the safety of the polling parties and booths , inhabitants , jungles , animals and property around... of any naxal attack.

AND HE ALSO HAS TO KEEP IN HIS AEGIS , THE ONES WHO WILL GUARD AND PROTECT THE GIVEN ABOVE....HIS JAWANS !

And incase you get to have more such sirs and mams in your clan , you might also news to your knowledge that many of them could get only 1 day to perform the last rites of their parents . Not even garnering enough time to share the biggest grief in life with your family....sometimes not even a day...you bid adieu in your heart .

And this corona ! Would you have the audacity to step into the nucleus of a highly infected area...camp there for hours...cogent people into test for the ailment...somewhere...a dot your mind... wife back at home running high risk of nil immunity to carcinoma , 2 small kids and parents above 60 years...all on major peril of being passed on any speck of virus !

Wait ! How'll the virus reach them !?!

Sir forgot himself ! 'fcourse the N 95 mask , sanitizer and social distancing...besides other precautions... the travel of this virus...if you know is like a wild forest fire...if you are in the mean of the hotspot... no insurance is adequate !

When it has been announced 'n' times on the rooftops , in every lane and market...on the roads , in the slums , facebook...twitter everywhere... to keep distance and not mingle out of your house...YOU REQUIRE 1 COP FOR 1 CITIZEN... to make remember... keep a vigil.... Don't you.. !

Whilst your basic ammenities are being taken care of !

Be it elections , any natural-communal calamity or any law-order situation , Sir shall famish till he knows his Jawans are full.

The city has his number published on the corners... and the POLICE MANUAL reads the duty hours from midnight to the next... 24 hours effectively...so after a long everday , the phone keeps singing all night long...to what...

* mother in law is troubling

* landlord stole the commode knob

* neighbours are singing loud

* husband has an extra marital affair

Definitely , he chose this service and none forced him into this .

These cops need no such write ups in their worship. Their 'uniform articles' are already decorating them .

I wrote this to feed my feelings .

IN THIS WORLD , IF HUMANKIND COULD BE BOTH , 'HUMAN' AND 'KIND' !

I am open to all healthy feedback... 'an air conditioned room and sprinkle name'....is that all !?!

106,21-4-20,Army issues fresh directions to its personnel reporting for duty,"In order to comply with the guidelines during the extended lockdown, the Army on Monday issued fresh directives for its personnel set to rejoin duty after leave, reporting for temporary duty and courses. Priority will be given to personnel bound for the northern and eastern commands, responsible for the Line of Control (LOC) facing Pakistan and the Line of Actual Control(LAC) facing China respectively.

All personnel in the Army will be classified as Green, Yellow and Red.

109,21-4-20,High level of toxic nitrogen dioxide in air linked to mortality from Covid,"The presence of high level of toxic nitrogen dioxide in the air can be linked with a high number of mortality from Covid-19, researchers have said as they found that areas with permanently high levels of pollution have significantly more deaths than other regions.

The results published in the latest issue of journal ‘Science of the Total Environment’ inferred that persistent air pollution in the affected regions could have led to overall poorer health in the people living there, making them particularly susceptible to the virus which has infected over 24 lakhs people and claimed 1.65 lakhs lives so far.

It is known that nitrogen dioxide is an air pollutant that damages the human respiratory tract causing many types of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in humans.

""Since the novel coronavirus also affects the respiratory tract, it is reasonable to assume that there might be a correlation between air pollution and the number of deaths from Covid-19,"" said Dr Yaron Ogen from the Institute of Geosciences and Geography at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU).

He combined three sets of data. This included the levels of regional nitrogen dioxide pollution measured by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel 5P satellite, which continuously monitors air pollution on earth.

Based on this data, he produced a global overview for regions with high and prolonged amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution.

""I looked at the values for January and February of this year, before the corona outbreaks in Europe began,"" explained Ogen. He combined this data with statistics from the US weather agency NOAA on vertical air flows.

His premise: If air is in motion, the pollutants near the ground are also more disseminated. However, if the air tends to stay near the ground, this will also apply to the pollutants in the air, which are then more likely be inhaled by humans in greater amounts and thus lead to health problems.

Using this data, the researcher was able to identify hotspots around the world with high levels of air pollution and simultaneously low levels of air movement.

He then compared these with the data on deaths related to Covid-19, specifically analysing the data from Italy, France, Spain and Germany.

It turned out that the regions with a high number of deaths also had particularly high levels of nitrogen dioxide and a particularly low amount of vertical air exchange.

""When we look at Northern Italy, the area around Madrid, and Hubei Provence in China, for example, they all have something in common: they are surrounded by mountains.

“This makes it even more likely that the air in these regions is stable and pollution levels are higher,"" Ogen added.

""However, my research on the topic is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,"" he said.

Earlier, researchers at Harvard University in the US found that even a small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, can lead to a large increase in the death rate from Covid-19.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/high-level-of-toxic-nitrogen-dioxide-in-air-linked-to-mortality-from-covid.html

111,21-4-20,Mamata shoots off letter to PM over Center’s team,"A peeved Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioning the appropriateness of unleashing a Central team on the State for inspecting the alleged “violation” and “dilution” of lock-down guidelines without keeping the Bengal Government in the loop.

The letter was written within an hour of the Chief Minister asking the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah on the twitter to explain the Centre’s alleged arbitrary conduct defying all the federal norms.

In the letter Banerjee has drawn attention of the Prime Minister to how the Inter Ministerial Central Team landed in Kolkata within minutes of her Government being informed about its coming to the State, sources said, adding how the Chief Minister has reminded the Prime Minister that the central move is against all established traditions.

Banerjee is also known to have told Modi how Shah spoke to her at 1 PM about the Centre’s decision to send the designated team which had already arrived in Kolkata by then. Hours before writing the letter Banerjee exploded on twitter questioning the lack of clarity over the IMCTs’ (Inter Ministerial Central Teams) visit to various districts of the country.

She wrote: “We welcome all constructive support and suggestions, especially from the Central Government” in handling the corona crisis. “However, the basis on which centre is proposing to deploy IMCTs in select districts across India, including a few in West Bengal is unclear.”

Asserting that her government will not be able to cooperate with the Centre on the given issue if things are not explained in the manner it should be she urged “both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to share the criterion used for this. Until then, I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism.”

Two IMCT teams arrived in Bengal on Monday. While the first team would visit Kolkata, Howrah, East Midnapore and North 24 Parganas the second team that had landed at Baghdogra in Siliguri will visit Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts. The teams will assess the situation on the ground, issue necessary directions for remedy and submit a report to the central government, officials said. They will also take stock of the supply of essential commodities, health infrastructure preparedness, hospital facilities and sample statistics, safety of health professionals and test kits. The Mamata Banerjee government’s expression of protest assumed unprecedented scales with the State’s senior most bureaucrat Rajiva Sinha making adverse statements against the central action wondering why Delhi was behaving in a manner “as if we are hiding something.”

The Chief Secretary who summoned the central team hours after it arrived in Kolkata to meet him at the Nabanna (State secretariat) even went to the extent of saying that the government will “not allow them to move about like this if we are not convinced by their purpose of the visit.”

Questioning the manner in which the IMCTs have come to state, Sinha said, “We were told, not asked, about the visit of the Central teams. Two teams landed within 15 minutes of us being informed about their visits. One team landed in Jalpaiguri, another in Kolkata… They are behaving as if we are hiding something.

He said the “the State government is supposed to provide the logistics and other supports to enable the central team to visit the areas but here they are being escorted by the SSB and the BSF. We have said come and talk to us then decide if you need to go into the field… We will not let them roam around in the state.

The Monday’s development takes shape against the backdrop of continuous war of words between the State Government one side and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and State BJP leadership --- which had been complaining of dilution of lockdown norms and corruption in distribution of essentials --- on the other.

BJP State president Dilip Ghosh however welcomed the IMCTs’ visit to Bengal saying he had information how “the lockdown norms are being violated in select areas (read minority belts)” and how “the essential food grains are being stolen by the TMC leaders at the ground level.”

He said “the local panchayat at Kalaikunda complained me today how unknown truckers came from nowhere and carried away rice that was ferried in by goods wagons at the local railway yard.” He also alleged that the trucks carrying food materials were being half unloaded at the TMC party offices and misappropriated by their local leaders.

Meanwhile, in what continued to paint a grim picture of Bengal the State on Monday recorded a steep hike in the number of corona cases which went up by 54 in the past one day taking the total number of total cases to 245.

State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said that the State had witnessed 54 new cases in the past one day adding the total number of deaths reported were 12 till date. He also said that 5,469 people have been kept in government quarantine whereas about 34,964 people have been kept in home isolation. Among the infected persons are four doctors and two other officials of Calcutta Medical College Hospital. The Monday’s infection takes thetotal number of doctors getting infected in the CMCH to 7 in two days, sources said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata-shoots-off-letter-to-pm-over-center---s-team.html

113,21-4-20,"Police: Arrests in Jamia violence, Delhi riot based on forensic proof","The Delhi Police on Monday said all the arrests made in connection with cases of Jamia Millia and Northeast riot are based on the analysis of scientific and forensic evidence.

According to police, while investigating Jamia and Northeast riot cases, Delhi Police has performed its job sincerely and impartially. “All the arrests made have been based on analysis of scientific and forensic evidence, including video footages, technical and other footprints,” said police.

“Delhi Police is committed to upholding the rule of law and bringing the conspirators, abettors and culprits of Northeast riots to books and secure justice to the innocent victims.It will not be deterred by the false propganda and rumours floated by some vested elements who try to twist facts to their convenience. We continue to work tirelessly and relentlessly towards our motto,” said police.

Earlier, on April 13, following the arrest of two Jamia students in connection with the Delhi riots, a civil rights group accused the police of abusing the COVID-19 lockdown to silence those who oppose Government policies.

In a statement released by ‘Hum Bharat Ke Log’, which has been signed by 26 civil rights activists, the group termed the arrests by Delhi Police “arbitrary”.

Meeran Haider of Chhatra Rashtriya Janata Dal was arrested on April 2 while Safoora Zargar of the Jamia Coordination Committee was held on April 11.

“This is a time when the nation needs to be focused on the health and hunger crisis across our land; when our priorities need to be to stay united to fight this virus,” the group said in the statement.

Other activists like Gul Inquilabi, many Muslim youth from northeast Delhi and students of Jamia are being called for questioning by the Special Cell every day amid this lockdown”, the statement said.

“There is now an attempt to implicate them in false cases related to the Delhi violence... Now, weaving fictitious narratives about the Delhi violence, Delhi Police is abusing the COVID-19 lockdown to silence and arrest those who oppose Government policies, hoping that this abuse of state power will go unreported, with neither news coverage nor democratic protest,” the statement said.

Jailing activists and students in false cases amid the pandemic puts their lives in peril and with courts functioning only partially owing to the lockdown, those arrested are being denied proper legal aid, it said.

Calling the arrests “attempts to unleash fear within the large young democratic opposition that had emerged across the country against CAA/NRC/NPR”, the statement demanded the “immediate and unconditional release” of the activists.

The signatories include Yogendra Yadav, Anjali Bhardawaj, Annie Raja, Teesta Setalvad, Kavita Krishnan, Medha Patkar and Umar Khalid.

For this, a dedicated doctor helpline number has also been made operational which is 18005728283 and the doctor can be consulted on this number from 9 am to 9 pm.

Residents of the district can now consult an experienced physician regarding a coronavirus infection at home. The facility is designed in collaboration with Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). The administration has already asked all government and private doctors to register themselves.

According to the data provided by the GMDA, around 2,312 doctors of the district have hit the portal, out of which 1,353 doctors have also registered themselves.

Of those registered, 1,192 physicians are working in the private sector and 140 are working in the government sector. Of these around 324 physicians have agreed to consult telemedicine ie Covid-19 through telephone.

“We have appealed to all the doctors working in the district, whether in the private sector or in the government, to register themselves on the “COVHarA” portal. All physicians doctors of Allopathic Medicine, Homeopathic or Ayurvedic or Dental can register on this portal,” said Sonal Goel, additional CEO of GMDA.

The official said “If anyone dials the doctor’s helpline number, then he/she will be contacted through telephone by the coronavirus practitioner doctor, who will ask the person his/her name, mobile number, address etc. The person will then be questioned by the doctor about his or her illness and if the doctor feels that the person may be susceptible to a coronavirus infection, he or she will ask for a test,” Goel said.

The official also said that medical consultation will also be seen on the portal and as soon as the doctor recommends the test, its information will automatically reach the civil surgeon Gurugram.

“The doctor will ask the person that he wants to go to the lab or collection centre to give a sample for the test or the lab technician will come to his house to get the sample. If a person has to go, his curfew pass will be generated automatically and if the technician of the lab has to come.

“The sample will thus be taken and sent for testing. If the report is negative, a message will be sent to that person’s phone and if it is found positive, then the process will begin. Thus, this telemedicine facility will prove to be very beneficial for patients suspected of coronavirus infection in the Gurugram district,” Goel added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/telemedicine-facility-started-in-g---gram.html

A regular contact is being maintained with various stake holders particularly States/UTs, Oil Marketing Companies(OMCs), etc in providing information which is then updated on the dashboard link on MoRTH website.

Last week, the MoRTH came forward to take care of the journey requirements in terms of shelter and food of the migrants who took to roads after the unfortunate Mumbai railway station chaos early this week where they had gathered to board a train which however was a rumour. The large gathering was dispersed by police lathicharge and then people from Mumbai took to road and highways on their way to far flung areas of Rajay, Bihar, UP, West Bengal and NE States.

MoRTH has taken up the social responsibility of helping people on the roads during the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19. Soon after the announcement by the Prime Minister, the field units of the Ministry across the length and breadth of the country were urged to extend necessary help to their workers/ labours and the common people.

All the field units and offices of the Ministry, as well as the associated organisations NHAI and NHIDCL are coordinating to help mitigate the difficulties of the people on road network.

""Food, water, hand wash facilities are being provided to road and highway users on regular basis while taking care of social distancing and sanitation,"" added the official.

The Home Ministry has also granted permission to NHAI to resume toll collection Monday onwards. The Government had on March 25 announced temporarily suspending toll collection on national highways to ease emergency services in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

120,21-4-20,"Number of +ve cases cross 1,500 mark in TN","Even as the wide fluctuation in the number of persons tested positive for coronavirus in Tamil Nadu has dumbfounded medical experts in the State, two eminent doctors who are veteran medical researchers has charged the Union Government of being indifferent to the Indian system of medicine, especially Ayurveda, which have the capability to cure Covid-19. Tamil Nadu which had 1,075 coronavirus patients till April 12 saw the number shooting up to 1,520 by Monday evening, according to Dr C Vijaya Baskar, Minister of health .

The State saw 98 persons testing positive for coronavirus on April 13. The number came down to 31 on April 14 and increased slightly to 38 on ythe next day. On April 16, the State recorded only 25 positive cases and a visibly relaxed chief minister Edappadi Palanisami told reporters on Thursday that the worst was over for Tamil Nadu.

But the joy seemed to be short-lived as the number of persons tested positive on April 17 shot back to 56. Though on April 18 the figure came down to 49, on Sunday the State registered 105 positive cases. On Monday, 43 persons tested positive for coronavirus.

The death toll in Tamil Nadu is 16 and this continues to be in the safer zone. But the vast fluctuation in the number of patients testing positive for the virus has surprised the State Government.

Though it was expected that the Tamil Nadu government may announce some relaxation on Monday, it did not materialize. The Chief Minister had a lengthy meeting with the top bureaucrats and health experts on Monday morning and it was decided to continue the lockdown till May 3.

Meanwhile Prof B M Hegde (who had scientifically proved that the medicine for coronavirus lies in the Indian system of knowledge) said on Monday that the centre was not doing enough in encouraging Ayurveda research. “I am sorry to tell that the government is not at all serious about the potential and possibilities offered by Ayurveda and other system of medicine. We are not going to succeed with the overdependence on allopathic branch of medicine which has failed in all rounds,” Prof Hegde told The Pioneer.

Dr C V Krishnaswamy, Tamil Nadu’s leading physician, who is also the advisor to the high powered committee of Ayurvedic physicians appointed by the Centre to develop a cure for coronavirus said the regulatory bodies like ICMR were sitting on the findings submitted by the committee members about the potential of Ayurveda. “There is enough scope for us to make use of Ayurveda to come out with a holistic approach in curing coronavirus cases,” said Dr Krishnaswamy.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/number-of--ve-cases-cross-1-500-mark-in-tn.html

122,21-4-20,India has all the rights: Experts on FDI,"China cries: India's new FDI norms violate WTO's principle of non-discrimination

India has all the right to protect its domestic industry in such a crisis situation, and making government approval mandatory for FDI from neighbouring countries is not a violation of norms of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), experts say.

The reaction followed after a Chinese embassy spokesperson said, India's new norms for foreign direct investment (FDI) from its neighbouring countries violate the WTO's principle of non-discrimination and are against the general trend of free trade.

""There is no agreement pertaining to FDI in the WTO. The WTO norms do not cover investments related issues, so India is well within its rights to take such a decision for its industry,"" Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said.

He said there are provisions for investors only with regard to exports and imports such as local content requirements.

Explaining further, Dhar said a WTO member country can not impose the minimum local content requirements for certain countries as that would be violative of global trade norms.

""India on its own is liberalising FDI policy. Taking any decision to protect its industry does not cover under the WTO norms,"" he added. Sharing similar views, Professor at Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) Rakesh Mohan Joshi said in such a crisis situation, India has to take the decision to protect its industry from takeovers and acquisitions.

""There are no violations of WTO norms in this,"" he said.

An industry expert too said any country should not take advantage of this pandemic as domestic industries are facing severe credit flow issues due to lockdown on account of COVID-19 disease.

The government on Saturday made its prior approval mandatory for direct or indirect foreign investments from countries that share a land border with India to curb ""opportunistic takeovers"" of domestic firms following the COVID-19 pandemic, a move which will restrict FDI from China. Countries which share land borders with India are China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.

Under the government route, the foreign investor has to take prior approval of the respective ministry/department. Through the automatic approval route, the investor just has to inform the RBI after the investment is made.

On this, Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement. That: ""The additional barriers set by the Indian side for investors from specific countries violate WTO''s principle of non-discrimination, and go against the general trend of liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment"".

Sumit Kochar- Senior Wealth and Transaction Advisor, Findoc Group, said, this policy move by the government has come as a combat effect after China's central bank recently raised stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) to a little over 1 per cent, thereby picking stake in one of the biggest lenders whilst the stock is trading low. ""It may restrict Chinese investors from picking Indian companies at all times. The move may end up harming FDI inflows in future,"" Kochar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-has-all-the-rights--experts-on-fdi.html

A team at World University of Design (WUD) is working closely with IIT Delhi, AIIMS and the Chennai based Loyal Textile Mills to design and produce standard PPE for our healthcare workers. These institutions are collaborating and pooling their respective expertise to assist in the development of not only low cost but also easily available PPE kits.

“We are happy to share the patterns for the entire PPE with anyone who is contributing to meeting the shortage of the same. The design and production of these kits is open source, therefore any small or medium scale factory interested can take the design from us and start manufacturing them. The key feature of this design is the ease of doffing, where the garment can be taken off by the person without touching the infected outer surface.

The prototypes for these kits have been created following the required protocol and are presently undergoing a second round of testing at a hospital in Chennai,"" said Dr Sanjay Gupta, WUD Vice-Chancellor.

124,21-4-20,ISI adopts new terror technique: New outfit,"Post abrogation of Article 30 that granted special status to Jammu & Kashmir and disruption of the terror network in the Valley, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence has shifted its terror tactic by forming a new terror group under the banner of The Resistance Front that seeks to rebrand the jehadi movement as a political resistance in order to gain wider acceptance from Muslim politicians from mainland India.

The Resistance Front comprising sympathisers of the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Hizbul Mujahideen is an armed wing of a newly created political entitiy Tahreek-e-Azadi Jammu and Kashmir. These outfits were floated by ISI in March and seeks to create a new network of ultras and overground workers as the earlier ecosystem has been disrupted by the security forces even as the Hurriyat Conference has become operationally irrelevant in the wake of exposure of its dubious dealings in NIA probe and arrest of workers after the change in status of Jammu and Kashmir after scrapping of Article 370.

The outfit is targeting the workers of the mainstream political parties in the Valley who could be roped in for jehadi agenda under the garb of political resistance.

In a message to the people of the Union Territory, the mujahideen group headed by one Abu Anas Hamza claims that after the scrapping of Article 370 on August 5 last year even chiefs of political parties like National Conference and People's Democratic Front were not spared and put behind bars despite being loyal to India.

Hamza claimed that Kashmiri Muslims will not be spared despite being loyal to India. He also likened the mainstream politicians as profiteers who only understand the language of power and can compromise to any extent to grab power and money. Such politicians do not have any consideration for the atrocities being perpetrated on the people in the Valley as they are only hungry for money, Hamza claimed in his bid to wean away the political workers of these parties to its fold who could work as over ground workers.

Hamza also mentioned about former PDP legislator Altaf Bukhari who formed a new political party last month titled as Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party and said the mujahideens are conspiring against him as he is a worshipper of wealth and a culprit before God.

The outfit also exhorted the mainstream parties to learn a lesson from the crackdown post abrogation of Article 370 and continue to support India in which case the mujahideens will target them.

He further said all opportunistic politicians who continue to side with India will be targeted.

Counter Terrorism Expert Dr Rituraj Mate said, ""Following the scrapping of Article 370 and identification of the terrorist network and infrastructure in the sustained operations by the security forces, the jehadi tanzeems have been feeling marginalised and suffocated in terms of operational relevance. This has led the Pakistani Army-ISI combine to shift tactic by seeking to create a new network and brand the jehadi violence as a political resistance. The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front was created in the early nineties in a similar manner which acted outwardly as a political entity but was actually engaged in jehadi movement.""

On Sunday, the outfit in a letter sought to target the CRPF engaged in anti-terrorist operations and law and order role in the Valley.

""The IG of Occupational Indian CRPF Rajesh Yaadav has said that he will take revenge for yesterday's attack in which many CRPF men were killed and injured, we want to tell him that we did not go to Bihar(IG Rajesh Yadav's homeland) to kill CRPF men. It is you who have come from Bihar to our homeland as an occupational force. This is not your homeland. You do not look like us, you do not speak like us, you and us have nothing in common. Instead you kill our young men, you humiliate our elderly. You are planning to make colonies in Kashmir where RSS activists will be settled to change our demography as is openly being said by your Fascist BJP Political Masters,"" the outfit claimed.

""So do not threaten us with revenge. Bring all that you can. Bring more if 1 million combined troops strength against a few hundred resistance fighters is inadequate for you, and then you will see what lightning and thunder we will bring to you,"" reads the letter issued under the name of self-styled Commander Hamza.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/isi-adopts-new-terror-technique--new-outfit.html

133,21-4-20,Deal with US company puts Vijayan under shadow,"Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister of Kerala, who was on Cloud Nine following reports about his “effective handling” of the coronavirus pandemic in the State, finds himself under a shadow as reports about a deal signed by the Government and Sprinklr, a US based company, has generated a lot of controversy.

The ‘agreement’ reported to have been signed between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr was to make all medical data of persons tested positive for coronavirus and quarantined in the State would be made available to the US company which itself is facing legal action in that country for ‘theft of data’.

Vijayan in his daily press briefings at Thiruvananthapuram evaded all questions pertaining to the deal signed by the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr. Ramesh Chennithala, leader of the opposition, in a press meet, accused the chief minister of entering into an illegal deal worth hundreds of crores with the US company.

Though the allegations by Chennithala were played down by the Kerala media, things took a serious turn when former Chief Minister Oommen Chandi, who is also the General Secretary of the AICC entered the scene and said the deal was fishy.

“An agreement of this kind should have signed with the concurrence of the departments of law, finance and information technology. No such thing has been done. I am sorry to tell that there was no formal agreement between the Kerala Government and Sprinklr USA when Chennithala held his press meet,” Chandi told The Pioneer.

The former chief minister said that the whole deal smacked of impropriety. “The beauty of democracy is transparency. Sprinklr USA was brought into Kerala through the back door and the Chief Minister should explain why this was done.

We all know that the whole country was facing a pandemic in the form of coronavirus and we do not want to play politics. But violation of all norms and laws of the land at this juncture does not augur well for the Government. Mr Vijayan has a responsibility to come clean in this issue,” said Chandi.

Meanwhile Janam TV, a satellite news channel, made another astartling disclosure by alleging that US based Mayo Clinic and an Australian telecom company were involved in the making of this “illegal deal”. “Mayo Clinic is the place where Chief Minister Vijayan frequents for his medical check up and the it is the management of Sprinklr which takes care of his well being while he is in the US,” said G K Suresh Babu, chief editor of the channel. Suresh Babu is the journalist who brought to light the illegal deal signed between CNC Lavlin of Canada and the Kerala Government in 1996 when Vijayan was the minister for power in the then E K Nayanar-led CPI-M government.

The corruption case is being heard by the Supreme Court. K Shivsankar, the IT secretary of Kerala, who initially said that there was no deal with Sprinklr was forced to make a vault face and accepted full responsibility for the signing of the agreement with the US company. Interestingly, Mayo Clinic and Telstra, the Australian telecommunication company are clients of Sprinklr.

Sreejit Panickar, an IT expert with 15 years of global experience said the deal with Sprinklr was a blatant violation of all rules and regulations regarding sharing of data.

“Any agreement or tender made by the Government of Kerala should be signed by the Chief Secretary for and on behalf of the Governor. There was neither agreement nor tender in this case. The sharing of data involves so many legal procedures which have been violated wantonly,” said Panickar.

Ram Rajendrababu, a US based IT specialist, also concurred with Panickar. “A deal like this in US would have put the main antagonists in prison,” said Ram over telephone from US who described the data as New Oil. “It is that precious,” he said.

Though the CPI-M fielded all eminent leaders like Law Minister A K Balan and polit bureau member S R Pillai to safeguard Vijayan, their arguments are yet to convince the detractors. Balan said there was a deep rooted conspiracy against Pinarayi Vijayan by some sections.

He has not named anyone in particular, there are certain leaders in the CPI-M who are trying to put Vijayan in a tight corner.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/deal-with-us-company-puts-vijayan-under-shadow.html

So we must support countries’ efforts in calibrating their social policies to reduce inequality, protect vulnerable people, and promote access to opportunities for all,” said Georgieva, who has served the acting president of the World Bank Group in 2019.

“We need to have a better understanding of the specific challenges, risks and tradeoffs facing every country as they gradually restart their economies,” she added.

“I want to once again say that flight restrictions that are in place as a result of India’s fight against COVID-19 will be lifted once we are confident that spread of the virus has been controlled and it poses no danger to our country and people,” he tweeted. His comments came after media reports suggested some airlines had opened flight bookings starting May 4, expecting the lockdown to be lifted by then.

The minister said,”since some airlines did not heed our advisory and opened bookings, and started collecting money from flyers, a directive was issued to them on April19, restraining them from doing so. They were also informed that they will be given sufficient notice and time to commence bookings.”

While Government-run Air India stopped the bookings after the government’s advisory, private carriers ignored it and continued taking bookings for travel after May 3, prompting the aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation to issue a circular on Sunday.

“All airlines are hereby directed to refrain from booking tickets... Further, the airlines may note that they shall be given sufficient notice and time for restarting operations,” the circular said.

It said that the Government’s decision to permit e-commerce firms to deliver only essential goods will add to the public hardship for consumers in many ways, instead of mitigating them. It added that there are more than twenty thousand full time online sellers providing around two lakh direct jobs whose livelihood depends upon e-commerce.

“By not taking on board online-sellers’ and consumers’ interests, the government has made a clear deviation from the multi-stakeholder process of decision making, which it has been boasting about,” CUTS’s Secretary General Pradeep S Mehta said.

CUTS International strongly urges the government to not just allow but encourage e-commerce companies to leverage their infrastructure and help a large number of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to operate smoothly. This will also advance health safety for consumers, he said. E-commerce platforms, he added, must also ensure some measures to prevent inadvertent spread of virus, such as: proper social distancing in all its operations; frequent use of hand sanitiser; sanitising the parcel just before delivery; encouraging cashless payments; advising buyers to properly wipe the package on delivery, and wash their hands before touching anything else.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/cuts--govt-should-allow--e-commerce-players-to-deliver-non-essential-goods.html

150,21-4-20,Lockdowns ease worldwide,"Tattoo parlors and hair salons in Denmark. Beaches in Australia. Bookstores in Germany. Countries around the world that have seen coronavirus infections flatten out began easing their lockdowns on Monday. In the US, meanwhile, the debate took on an increasingly political edge.

Over the past few days, President Donald Trump openly encouraged protesters who have been demanding the lifting of the state-imposed stay-at-home orders, and some states — mostly ones under Republican leaders — have taken steps to relax some restrictions. But other governors have warned that they can’t move ahead without help from the federal government in expanding testing.

Around the globe, the game plan is to open up but maintain enough social distancing to prevent new flareups of the virus that has infected 2.4 million people worldwide, killed more than 165,000 and crippled the world economy.

The easing of the lockdowns “is not the end of the epidemic in any country. It’s just the beginning of the next phase,” the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told G-20 health ministers in an online meeting.

He sternly warned governments not to rush to return to normal, saying, “It is critical that these measures are a phased process.”

The death toll in the US, the worst-hit country by far, was more than 40,000 with over 7,50,000 confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of government reports. The true figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of limited and difficulties in counting the dead.

While Trump and members of his administration say parts of the nation are ready to begin a gradual return to normalcy, many governors say they lack the testing supplies they need and warn that if they reopen their economies too soon, they could get hit by a second wave of infections.

“We showed that we can control the beast and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down.’’

Egged on by the President, protesters have taken to the streets in places such as Michigan, Ohio and Virginia, complaining that the shutdowns are destroying their livelihoods and trampling their rights. Defying the social-distancing rules and, in some cases, wearing no masks, demonstrators have berated their governors and demanded the firing of Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert.

But on Monday, Fauci warned, “Unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not going to happen.”

“If you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re going to set yourself back. So, as painful as it is to go by the careful guidelines of gradually phasing into a reopening, it’s going to backfire,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

In the past few days, Florida gave the OK for beaches to reopen, and Texas on Monday began a week of slow reopenings, starting off with state parks. Later, stores will be allowed to offer curbside service.

Elsewhere around the world, Isabel Pennekamp, shopping in the German city of Cologne, was grateful that parts of the country reopened small stores. “Well, I think it’s good, because now people can get out a bit more and normality is a bit more possible again,” she said.

German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the gradual easing “is a step-by-step process where, after time, we will evaluate what consequences it has had for the infection.”

Cars will again begin rolling off some production lines in Germany, Sweden and Slovakia. In Australia, the production of the country’s longest-running soap opera, “Neighbours,” planned to restart by having separate crews for each key filming site. One city council in Sydney reopened beaches but stressed they were only for exercise like swimming, running and surfing, and not for sunbathing.

“Living along the coast, I know how important our beaches are to the mental and physical health of so many,” said Danny Said, mayor of Randwick.

Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach remained closed.

Hair salons, dentists, physiotherapists and even tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen in Denmark but it was not business as usual. Christel Lerche sprayed customers’ chairs with alcohol at her salon in suburban Copenhagen and provided hand sanitizer and plastic coat hangers — to be cleaned after each use — to clients keen to get their hair trimmed or styled for the first time since restrictions began on March 11. No magazines were left for customers to share.

Iran began opening intercity highways and major shopping centers Monday to stimulate its sanctions-choked economy, despite major questions about the country’s official infection figures and death toll.

But not every Government was ready to take its foot off the brake just yet.

In Italy, tensions have been growing between northern regions, which are pushing to reopen industry despite being hardest hit by the coronavirus, and the south, which fears contagion if the lockdown is eased. Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to outline what a “Phase 2” can look like this week, with the nationwide lockdown set to be lifted on May 4.

Still, Gucci on Monday restarted some workshops for leather accessories and shoes, agreeing with unions to provide “maximum security for workers.’’ The luxury fashion industry is a major part of the economy in Italy, and deadlines are looming to produce fall collections.

In Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still recovering from Covid-19 that saw him hospitalized in intensive care, a lockdown imposed March 23 is due to last at least until May 7, and ministers have cautioned that measures are unlikely to be significantly loosened in the short term.

France also is still under a tight lockdown, although starting Monday, authorities allowed families, under strict conditions, to visit relatives in nursing homes once again.

In some places, lockdown fatigue was on the rise. Dutch police broke up two illegal gambling events and fined dozens of people for breaching local rules. In Japan, authorities emphasized that the time is not ripe to loosen restrictions by mowing down tens of thousands of tulips in full bloom near Tokyo. The problem was that people were coming to admire the flowers.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/lockdowns-ease-worldwide.html

152,21-4-20,A few good things,"Here are some examples of acts of human decency to cherish in a world that’s currently strangled by Coronavirus. By Chahak Mittal

Over the past month, news headlines have reeked of sorrow. Life seems to have come to a standstill, almost failing miserably to even uplift us out of the morass. There’s no running away because stepping out of your house seems akin to stepping into a pool of danger. While some people are dying untimely or losing their loved ones, some are just struggling to reach their homes or living with fear.

But amid all this gloom and doom, there are some people who are trying to bring attention to that silver lining around the cloud. In various ways, they are taking some unheralded initiatives to benefit those in need in these trying times. Here are some examples of acts of human decency and ‘a few good things’ to cherish in a world that’s currently strangled by Coronavirus.

Call for the COVID SOS

The COVID SOS (www.covidsos.org) is a non-profit initiative to connect senior citizens and specially-abled people with volunteers from the neighbourhood who can help them with delivery of essentials (for instance, groceries, medicines). Due to the nationwide lockdown, there is a disruption in the delivery and availability of essential products and services. As per the WHO, older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to the virus.

Conceptualised by Bangalore-based IIT-Delhi alumni, Sidharth Jain, the initiative is supported by the Green Dream Foundation and Helpage India. The website, https://covidfyi.in provides consolidated information about nearby hospitals, doctors, government services and important helpline numbers. He said, “It’ll help wherever we get the volunteers. Currently, we have 500 of them spread across India. Just register yourself and you might also be able to help someone near you. It enables young people to assist senior citizens and those in need around them by doing simple tasks like getting medicines, groceries or food.” And the process goes like this. When they receive a request within walking distance of your address, you will be notified if you want to help.

Here comes the medical ferry

The ‘UberMedic’ is being used by hospitals in the Delhi-NCR region to ferry heathcare workers. Public hospitals like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital are getting free of cost taxis to transport frontline healthcare workers across the city. The initiative has come as a part of the 10 million free rides being offered globally as per the announcement made by Uber CEO Khosrowshahi earlier. It is being expanded up to 10 Indian cities — New Delhi, Noida, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow and Patna.

An UberMedic driver, Pawan Kumar said, “We transport doctors and nurses from their homes to hospitals and back. I feel a sense of pride in doing this because at the end of the day, we are doing our bit in this global crisis and helping protect the entire country. I feel proud. I feel like I am a soldier. Our doctors and nurses are already fighting this battle for the country and we want to support them so we are also, in a way, serving the country.”

All the cars are fitted with roof-to-floor plastic sheeting enclosing the driver, which acts as a protective barrier to limit contact between the driver and the rider. To ensure safety and hygiene standards, the drivers are being specially trained in safety procedures and equipped with personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, sanitisers and disinfectants.

Adopting indigenous social distancing methods

Bihar-based social activist Sarvesh Tiwari adopts indigenous social distancing methods to distribute masks to the needy. The distributors use gloves and sticks as precautionary measures while giving away the masks to minimise the chances of transmission. Having started his campaign from Musahar Toli, Sarvesh aims to supply these masks to 20,000 people in need.

The masks that are being distributed are of different colours, as it helps ensure that the masks aren’t exchanged within the family members, further ensuring their individual safety from COVID-19. For women, there are red and pink masks, for men, there are blue and black, while children are being given white masks.

“During a crisis, the marginalised communities are the worst hit. The first reason behind this is the lack of awareness among them and second is the lack of resources to avail precautionary tools and measures. Keeping this in mind, I decided to distribute masks among such sections of society as utmost priority while taking all possible safety measures. In these times that demand social distancing, this indigenous way of distributing masks using a stick is very easy to put into practice and people are adopting it very enthusiastically,” said Sarvesh.

Feeding the needy

Even though the government stimulus plans are in progress, families with no steady source of income are still waiting for aid to reach them. Coming forward in support of such families, Bhopal-based Chandni Asrani and a group of residents from the city have started the initiative — ‘Feeding Bhopal,’ which aims to provide meals to poor families and daily-wage earners. Since the lockdown, it has reached out to more than 1,000 families across the city and fed around 1,000 stray animals.

The initiative procures food grains with the help of donations that it receives and then, supplies one week’s ration to families in need. This includes two kg wheat, two kg rice, one kg dal, salt, turmeric, chilli, cooking oil and soap. In collaboration with Menses With Mansa, it is also distributing sanitary napkins. Providing essential items for a week to five families mainly covers slum areas (Bastis) with large populations of daily-wage labourers and people with no means to buy rations.

Flattening the curve through sanitisers

The Forest Essentials is stepping up in their efforts to eradicate the spread of the virus. Frontline healthcare workers were donated Ayurvedic hand sanitisers, surface cleansers and medicated soaps as a part of their initiative. Taking all the prescribed precautions, they are working to help flatten the curve and ensure safety conditions for all of the employees currently mobilised in their factories. The workers have been working in shifts to maximise the output.

They are also in constant touch with the local authorities and Uttarakhand state government for the formulation and production of sanitisers to meet its increasing demand. The hand sanitisers are being produced as per the WHO formula for alcohol content as well as aloe vera juice and glycerin to not dry out hands.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-few-good-things-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-few-good-things.html
153,21-4-20,Trend Blazer,"‘It has been thrilling eight years’

On his eighth anniversary in Bollywood with his film Vicky Donor, actor Ayushmann Khurrana opens up about his rise as a breakaway star and fondly looks back at his incredible journey.

He says, “It has been a gratifying, humbling and thrilling eight years and I would not want to change anything about it. I only have gratitude to the universe for enabling me to chase my dreams. It wasn’t easy, it had its share of tears and lack of self-confidence but it sure has been super exciting.”

The actor has had various hits such as, Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan, Article 15, and many more.

‘I was never a horror film friendly actor before Bhoot. I was the one who would step out of the room if a horror film was on. However, with this film, I was able to overcome my fear. The endeavour has been to bring out a true experience of the genre which is not just filled with thrills, but is honestly scary. I am happy viewers can now stream it on Amazon Prime Video.’

—Vicky Kaushal

Actor-comic Vir Das’ labour of love, Hasmukh, which he has produced and acted in, has the audience hooked.

Interestingly, the most popular show in India for the last couple of weeks was the Spanish-thriller series Money Heist but in just three days since its release, Hasmukh has toppled them on Netflix India.

Vir himself has been pleasantly surprised at the response. He says, “I’m not even sure how the numbers work. But as a Money Heist fan myself, even I was surprised to see us at Number one. This is all quite crazy.”

154,21-4-20,An ode to mother earth,"Leading artistes have collaborated for the song Dharti Ma, a tribute to our planet. By Shailaja Khanna

I wanted to cry hearing those beautiful voices. These were 10 of India’s most versatile singers, who had come together to sing Dharti Ma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of our network,” said the president of Earth Day Network, Kathleen Rogers.

Saluting mother earth which has sustained life for centuries, the seven minute track is accompanied by great visuals. The pathos with which the lyrics are sung, during a time when we are taking stock and realising how much the earth means to each of us, is hard to miss. The music has been composed by

Chennai-based singer Amrit Ramnath. Not having access to the recording studio during lockdown was a challenge. The recordings from all the artistes were processed at Amrit’s home studio.

Recorded in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and San Francisco, the song is sung by Bombay Jayashri, Shankar Mahadevan, classical Carnatic vocalist Abhishek Raghuram, Kaushiki Chakravorty, Mahesh Kale, Shweta Mohan, Abhay Jodhpurkar, MD Pallavi and Hansraj Hans.

Through the music, each artiste appeals everyone to do everything that we need to do to protect our earth. Kaushiki said, “We all have a responsibility to protect nature and give our younger ones a better planet, a better future.” Other artistes too were glad for the opportunity that the song offered. “To be able to pay gratitude to Mother Earth and, that too, through a song with such diverse set of artists is rare. I am privileged to be associated with this song,” shared Mahesh.

The youngest of all, Abhay had grown up listening to all the artistes he worked with on this one. He said, “I am really grateful for being a part of Dharti Ma as these are artistes I have literally grown up listening to. Plus, I feel, one hardly gets a chance to sing a semi-classical song these days and for such a cause, it can’t get any better than this.”

Pallavi hoped, “We all emerge from this pandemic as more sensitive beings. I am glad I am a part of such an amazing cause.” Mahadevan praised Amrit. He said, “I loved what Amrit has composed. It’s an honour to sing the same song as all the singers are stalwarts.”

Singer Shweta Mohan felt this song was needed now more than ever. Representing Kerala, she sang her lines in Malayalam. “I am a budding environmentalist, so I am really happy to be a part of this project. Sharing credits with some really big names in the music industry means a lot to me,” said she.

“Awaaz mein jo dard nikla hai, ye haalat ki wajeh se tha. Insaan phas gaya hai. Humme pray karna hai ki dharti ma humme bacha lo (The pain in our voice is on account of the fact that we all are stuck. We should pay that Mother Earth should save us),” said Hansraj Hans.

155,21-4-20,Salman sings for healing,"Superstar Salman Khan is again set to showcase his singing skills as he sung a song, titled Pyaar Karona, to cheer up people amid the Coronavirus lockdown.

Written by Salman and Hussain Dalal, Pyaar Karona was recently released on Salman’s YouTube channel.

Sharing the news among his followers, he took to social media and wrote: “So I’m posting from my handle to let you know that tomorrow on my YouTube channel, mine kya? It’s ours! A song will be out tomorrow, hope you can handle it.”

Along with it, the actor also shared the song’s teaser video in which he is seen singing, pyaar karona, aitraat karona.

Music composers Sajid and Wajid have composed the track. Apart from this, Salman has also been seen creating COVID-19 awareness among people through his videos on social media.

Recently, he came out with a very serious message for those who have violated the COVID-19 lockdown. He even called the violators “jokers” and said, “Appeal ye hai ki govt aapke liye aur hum sab ke liye bol rahi hai, isko seriously lo aur afwahein mat phailao (My appeal is that you follow what the government is saying and don’t spread rumours). Ye hamesha se problem hai, sabko lagta hai ke yeh hamare saath nahi hoga. Ye Coronavirus kisiko bhi ho sakta hai, bas mein, train mei, market mein, har jagah, to kaheko pange le rahe ho bahar jaana hai (No one is safe from Coronavirus and you can get infected anywhere).”

156,21-4-20,Proteas postpone Sri Lanka tour,"South Africa’s tour of Sri Lanka in June was on Monday postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is still not under control.

South Africa were set to play three ODI and three T20Is during their short trip of the island nation in the first half of June, Cricket South Africa stated.

“Our Proteas would not have been able to prepare properly taking our own lockdown situation into account and, more importantly, health considerations for our players, which are always paramount, were the over-riding factor,” CSA's Acting Chief Executive Jacques Faul said.

The ODI leg would have been South Africa’s first commitment in the ICC’s new one-day league.

“It is very sad that we have been forced to take this step and we will re-schedule the tour as soon as cricket returns to a sense of normality and our international fixture list allows,” Faul said.

He admitted that the postponement of the tour will hamper South Africa’s preparations for the T20 World Cup to be held in October-November in Australia this year.

“It is very frustrating for the players who want to build on the good form they showed at the backend of our home summer against Australia,” Faul concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/proteas-postpone-sri-lanka-tour.html
157,21-4-20,Can’t imagine Pak going into T20 WC without Amir: Arthur,"Former Pakistan head coach, Mickey Arthur says leaving out pacer Mohammad Amir from T20 World Cup squad would be detrimental to team’s title chances.

Amir had quit Test cricket last year, a decision which did not go down well with the team management.

It led to speculations that the pacer may be ignored when the squad is picked for the World Cup, scheduled to be held in Australia later this year.

“I wouldn’t imagine Pakistan going to the World T20 without Amir. He is a match-winner. If you leave him out of the fray you potentially are sacrificing chances of winning the tournament,” Arthur said in an interview on a YouTube channel.

“Amir spoke to me about it and he kept me in the loop on his decision. We discussed it many times. But maybe I was too hard on him playing him in every Test I could. I could see he was losing his hunger for Test cricket and his body was not able to handle the pressure of three formats.”

“Amir is a top class bowler and a match-winner. I love to watch him bowl. But by deciding to leave Test cricket I think he has given himself a chance of extending his white ball career.”

About Wahab he said the experienced bowler had also taken the right decision.

Pakistan cricket reacted angrily to the announcements by Aamir and Wahab last year that they were not available for red ball cricket. Head coach and chief selector, Misbah-ul-Haq and bowling coach, Waqar Younis had said they let down Pakistan cricket.

There have been doubts over whether Misbah would allow both in the national team even for white ball cricket but Arthur who coached Pakistan from 2016 to 2019 till last year’s World Cup said it would be a big mistake not selecting Aamir.

Arthur described coaching the Pakistan team as a fulfilling period of his career.

“The thing about Pakistan cricket is that the people are so emotionally attached to the game. Either you are king or you are down there. There is no middle way. I loved and hated that facet of Pakistan cricket. But I think people need to be patient you can’t get instant results. You need to give chances to new players to find their feet.”

He said the only way forward for Pakistan cricket was to rely and develop on the group of young players he had spotted and tried to groom in his tenure.

“Pakistan has some wonderful young players, Fakhar Zaman, Imam ul Haq, Haris Sohail, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Faheem Ashraf and of course Babar Azam. I think this is the core of players Misbah should depend on to carry Pakistan cricket forward.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can---t-imagine-pak-going-into-t20-wc-without-amir--arthur.html

Describing the novel coronavirus as a plague, Trump on Sunday said that he is not happy with China where the pandemic emerged in December last year in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province.

“We spoke to them (Chinese) a long time ago about going in. We want to go in. We want to see what’s going on. And we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that,” Trump told reporters.

The US has launched an investigation into whether the deadly virus “escaped” from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

US officials last month launched the new policy, saying it would be dangerous for Customs and Border Protection to detain people because of the potential spread of the virus in detention facilities. As a result, CBP has been turning away thousands of migrants, including asylum seekers.

165,21-4-20,Bowlers face saliva conundrum in post COVID-19 scenario,"Bowlers using saliva to shine the ball is common sight in cricket but in a post COVID-19 world, they might have to reconsider the practice, making their lives tougher in what, many believe, has already become a batsman’s game.

In the wake of the 2018 ball-tampering scandal, the scrutiny on ball maintenance has only increased but using sweat and saliva on it remains legal.

Given the worsening COVID-19 situation, it is unlikely that cricket will resume anytime soon and when it finally does, former players, including Venkatesh Prasad, Praveen Kumar & Jason Gillespie, feel the game’s custodians might have to suspend the use of saliva.

“When the action resumes, they should use only sweat for some time as safety of the players is paramount,” former pacer Prasad, who played 33 Tests and 161 ODIs for India said.

He reckons it will be tough for the bowlers to stop using saliva to work up the ball but it is the need of the hour.

“When you are in the thick of things, you tend to forget it. You have to get the upper hand over the batsmen as you can’t use anything else besides sweat and saliva.

“The question is what do you do when the batsman is pulping you? You need to swing the ball and what helps swing the ball is the aerodynamics,” the 50-year-old explained.

Without saliva, sweat remains the only other legal source to shine the ball but that can be tricky, according to Prasad.

“Because not everybody sweats. In that case, you have to keep throwing the ball to someone who sweats. I am someone who doesn’t sweat that much whereas Rahul Dravid does,” he recalled.

Praveen Kumar, known for his prodigious swing, said putting the right amount of saliva on the ball aided his art immensely.

“For the first few months after action resumes, they will have to ban the use of saliva. As bowlers, we will have to look for some other source,” he said with a laugh.

“...It is very important for the fast bowlers, also for the spinners, as it helps them generate drift. For an off-spinner, the shiny side on the left will drift the ball away in the air before coming back. It tests the batsman,” he reasoned.

“For me, saliva was of great help while opening the bowling as well as reversing the old ball,” said Kumar, who took a five-wicket haul at Lord’s in 2011.

The world will never be the same even when it is able to overcome the current crisis. In such a scenario, the way the game is played is also likely to change.

Former Aussie bowler Jason Gillespie said time has come to reconsider the use of saliva in the game. “I don’t think it’s a quirky question. It’s an actual genuine thing to be considered,” Gillespie, who took 259 Test wickets, told ABC Grandstand.

“I don’t think anything is off the table. It could be a point where at the end of each over, the umpires allow the players to shine the ball in front of them but you can only do it then. I don’t know. Is it just sweat? Can you only use sweat?

“I don’t have an answer to that but it certainly will be a conversation that will be had. If you think about it, it is pretty gross,” said the cricketer-turned-coach.

Prasad reiterated that the use of saliva should be stopped even though it would be difficult for the bowlers to let go of a practice they are so used to.

“For everyone’s safety, it should be suspended but if you are getting smashed, you will sub-consciously try to do your best to swing the ball and that might include (using) saliva.

“If you are not able to swing the ball like you used to, you risk getting dropped. How do you address that?” Prasad asked.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bowlers-face-saliva-conundrum-in-post-covid-19-scenario.html
166,21-4-20,Post-COVID-19 world could be blessing in disguise for Indian sports: Abhinav Bindra,"Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra reckons the post- COVID-19 world could be a ""blessing in disguise"" for Indian sports, with an opportunity to build local infrastructure and human resource such as coaches and support staff in the likely absence of foreign exposure.

Bindra was addressing the newly-appointed assistant directors at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and other senior officials in a special online session on Monday.

Speaking about how he sees Indian sport after the pandemic subsides, Bindra said, ""The post-COVID world could be a blessing in disguise for India. There may not be so much foreign exposure and this may allow India to build proper sporting infrastructure.

""We need to build our own coaches and our own support staff,"" he added while giving his perspective on the impact of the pandemic, which has caused lakhs of deaths and destroyed economies the world over.

Bindra said sports administrators need to work towards ""creating an alternate skill development programme"" for athletes to ensure their well-being in the long run.

""We need to look after athletes because the very nature of sport is that more will fail than succeed. It is important that athletes have backup plans in case their sports career doesn't work out,"" he pointed out.

Bindra added that sports administrators need to understand the psychology of athletes to be able to build them up through different phases, including the probability of failure.

For the young batch of sports administrators, he had some other important tips too.

""It is important to strike relationships with the experts and coaches that various federations have,"" he said, suggesting that they should undertake a one or two day workshop with the experts to understand processes.

""An expert can give a larger overview of the various elements that go into sporting performance and that's where you will understand where performance is built.

""Results at a competition cannot be the only denominator when planning for an Olympic Games or an Asian Games,"" the champion shooter said.

Bindra spoke at length about his experience as an athlete.

""The one per cent (of athletes) makes all the difference in sport, and as our sports ecosystem starts maturing, we need to start focussing on that one percent for all athletes,"" he said.

Stressing on the need to build a strong talent identification and nurturing programme, he added, ""Getting foundations right is important, a lot of work on that has already been started with the Khelo India programme and also emphasis placed on junior programme of different sports."" PTI AH

168,21-4-20,Will continue to pursue further legal remedies: Vijay Mallya on UK High Court ruling,"Embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Tuesday said he will continue to pursue further legal remedies a day after the UK High Court dismissed his appeal against a lower court order to extradite him to India.

Mallya, promoter of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines, insisted that as per the UK High Court ruling, the allegations against him and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crore in 2009, and not what has been reported that he has to face trial in Indian courts for Rs 9,000 crore fraud.

""I am naturally disappointed with the High Court decision. I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers,"" Mallya said in a series of tweets.

He further said, ""I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9,000 crores.""

Justifying himself, Mallya drew attention to ""paragraph 6 of the judgement which is available to the public"".

""Please note that the allegations against me and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crores in 2009,"" he claimed.

The beleaguered liquor tycoon claimed, ""This loan was subsumed along with loans from other Banks within the Master Debt Recast Agreement of 2010.""

He further said, ""Following the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) order for the payment of approximately Rs 5,000 crores by way of Principal and Rs 1,200 crores by way of unapplied interest making a total of Rs 6,200 crores.""

He said the banks have ""already recovered in cash a sum of Rs 2,500 crore which is 50 per cent of the Principal amount"".

Mallya said, ""I have repeatedly offered to repay the Banks in full but, sadly to no avail.""

On Monday, the UK High Court had dismissed his objections to a lower court order of December 2018 which prima facie made a case for misrepresentation to banks to secure credit, conspiracy and money laundering.

He has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court.

173,21-4-20,PCB start online fitness tests for its cricketers,"With the country under lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday started online fitness tests for its centrally contracted players.

The PCB went ahead with the online tests despite batsman Sohaib Maqsood suffering a leg injury during a similar exercise last week.

A PCB statement said that fitness assessments of Haris Sohail, Hasan Ali, Muhammad Abbas, Asad Shafiq, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Imad Wasim and Shadab Khan were conducted on Monday while remaining players will appear for their tests on Tuesday.

The board also started taking fitness tests of its contracted domestic players last week, where Maqsood sustained the leg injury. The PCB said strength and conditioning coach of the national team, Yasir Malik had designed the online tests and was supervising them with head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq.

Misbah had already emphasised that players need to remain in top physical shape and be ready for challenges whenever intentional cricket resumes post the pandemic.

Pakistan’s next assignment is tours to Holland, Ireland and England for T20, ODIs and Tests which is scheduled to start from early July but uncertainty looms large over these series with the deadly disease showing no signs of relenting across the globe.

174,21-4-20,Leagues ready to play behind closed doors: UEFA Prez,"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin on Monday said that leagues across Europe are ready to return to action behind closed doors in a bid to limit the damage caused by coronavirus.

Football leagues have been suspended since mid-March due to the global pandemic.

But the head of European football believes that playing would be an important step towards a return to normal life and avoid heavy financial losses for leagues.

“I believe there are options that can allow us to restart cup championships and to complete them,” Ceferin said in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera.

“We may have to resume without spectators, but the most important thing, I think, is playing games.

“It is early to say that we cannot complete the season. The impact would be terrible for clubs and leagues. Better to play behind closed doors than not at all.

“In such hard times it would bring happiness to people and a certain sense of normality even if the games can only be seen on TV.

“All activities are being organised to start again, everyone needs to find their lives.

“If safety measures are respected and if the authorities give the green light, the training could resume like the rest.

“Further consent will be needed for matches.”

Ceferin said that if leagues returned “soon enough” then Champions League and Europa League matches could “be played in parallel” with no date limit for the finals.

The Slovenian said he was not in favour of the season going into September and October as it “would have a heavy impact” on the 2020-2021 campaign.

“We can finish, but we must respect the decisions taken by authorities,” he continued.

“The priority is the health of fans, players and coaches.”

As for countries who have decided not to finish the season, Ceferin said that UEFA “will review the cases”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/leagues-ready-to-play-behind-closed-doors--uefa-prez.html
175,21-4-20,Bundesliga to resume without fans from May 9,"Germany’s top-flight football matches could resume from May 9, regional leaders of the country’s biggest states said Monday, although games can only take place without spectators to prevent coronavirus contagion.

Markus Soeder, state premier of Bavaria, said it remains “completely unimaginable to have spectators” in the stadiums given the need for social distancing to slow the virus spread.

But “we could perhaps from May 9 play such a round of ghost games,” Soeder told Bild, using the German term Geisterspiele for matches played in empty stadiums.

“A weekend with football is much more bearable than a weekend without football,” he added.

Likewise, Armin Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state which is home to Borussia Dortmund, said the league could resume “on condition that there is a thoroughly thought-out concept”.

The German Football League (DFL) has presented “safeguards” in recent days, said Laschet, adding that he “can imagine us returning to ghost games”.

The backing of the two state premiers could prove to be crucial to the league as it mulls a resumption of the Bundesliga.

A decision is imminent with a video conference due to be held on Thursday between the DFL and 36 clubs in the first and second divisions.

While Germany began easing curbs and allowing smaller shops to open from Monday, large public events have been scrapped through to August 31.

The DFL is desperate for the season to be finished by June 30 to secure an instalment of television money, reportedly worth around 300 million euros ($326 million).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bundesliga-to-resume-without-fans-from-may-9.html

However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men were on an 11-match unbeaten run before the shutdown with Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka beginning to repay the lavish sums spent on them last summer and January signing Bruno Fernandes making an immediate impact.

“I knew when I first came to Manchester United that Ole said to me loads and loads it’s a building process but we’ll be where we want to be.” Maguire told Sky Sports.

“There are plenty of aspects we need to improve to get to the top of where we want to be. We don’t want to be challenging for this Champions League spot, we want to be challenging for titles.

“We know there’s still a lot of improvement to get there, but we’re on the right track and I’m sure eventually we will get there.”

177,21-4-20,Hamilton ready to stick with Mercedes ‘dream team',"Lewis Hamilton has hailed Mercedes as his “dream team” as the world champion made it clear he has no plans to leave when his contract expires after the 2020 season.

The British driver was linked with a move to Ferrari after the six-time world title winner revealed in January he had yet to open talks over a new deal with Mercedes.

Ferrari chief executive officer Louis Carey Camilleri said in December that he was “flattered” that Hamilton had agreed to discuss his future in conversations with the team’s chairman John Elkann.

But the 35-year-old appeared to end talk of a switch on Monday when he said his future remains with British-based Mercedes.

“There is no dream of another team. I am with my dream team,” Hamilton said on Instagram.

“There’s not a thing in my way, as I’m not trying to move. I’m with the people who have cared from day one.”

Hamilton, who added that Mercedes were “the best team”, will have been aware that any opportunity to join Ferrari would be quashed if reports that Sebastian Vettel is moving towards a new contract are confirmed.

Four-time world champion Vettel, like Hamilton, is out of contract at the end of the season, while the German’s team-mate Charles Leclerc has a contract with the Italian team until the end of 2024.

Vettel last week said he had made it clear he wanted to stay at Ferrari beyond the end of this season.

“Whatever the deal will be like, it is whatever I and the team will be comfortable with. In terms of duration, normally the contracts I had in the past were all a three-year deal,” Vettel said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hamilton-ready-to-stick-with-mercedes----dream-team-.html
178,21-4-20,"ICC to discuss WTC schedule, ODI league in CEC meet","The ICC’s Chief Executives Committee (CEC) will discuss the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic over a conference call on Thursday in which the World Test Championship and the ODI league schedule will also come up for deliberation.

The ODI league was to start in June but the first series under it — South Africa’s away three-match rubber against Sri Lanka in the first week of June — was cancelled on Monday due to the pandemic.

ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said: “This meeting is the first step of a collective process as we assess the impact of this ongoing global pandemic and work together so the sport can emerge from it in a strong position.

“We need to share knowledge and start to build a deep understanding of what it will take to resume international cricket.”

It is clear that no concrete decision can be taken unless the ICC is able to figure out how many events it will lose due to the global lockdown.

“We are almost at the halfway point of the World Test Championship, and the Super League is yet to commence so we will consider a range of options for each with our Members. But it’s still some way to go before,” a senior ICC Board member said.

Sawhney admitted that they have a tough road ahead in uncertain times.

“The scale of this task should not be underestimated and will encompass a myriad of factors until the public health situation has improved to a point that it is safe for our players, our employees, our fans and in a way that will not impact the public health situation adversely.

“Countries will start to reopen at different stages and in different ways and we will need to respect that and have a holistic view of this to enable us to take well-informed decisions that mitigate the various risks as much as possible,” the ICC Chief Executive added.

Sawhney said that ICC is taking advice from Australian government with regards to hosting the World T20 in October.

“...We will continue to take advice from experts and authorities, including the Australian government. We will utilize all of the data and information available to us to ensure we can take responsible decisions around all competitions at an appropriate time that are in the best interests of our sport.”

The senior official, who has attended a number of ICC board meetings, made it clear that cancellation of another couple of Test series could heavily impact the WTC calendar.

“Look, we had to finish the league phase by March 2021 with final at Lord’s in June, 2021. India are more secured as they don’t have any cancelled series till now and their next Test series in Australia starts end of November,” the official said.

“But England already have lost one against Sri Lanka. Also you don’t know if West Indies and Pakistan can tour England this summer,” he added.

Although everyone is tight-lipped, an option of extending the calendar for the WTC might be explored where teams get to complete their bilateral Test engagements.

Add to that, the 13-team ODI league with points system, where each team has to play eight bilateral 50-over series (three-match series).

The ODI league will continue till March, 2022.

As per points table as on March, 2022, India as hosts (automatic qualification) and seven other teams will qualify directly to the World Cup.

The bottom five will play a Qualifier with five associates and top two from there will complete the 10-team World Cup in 2023.

“At this time CEC will discuss the collective process to consider impact of COVID-19 on the sport. The members would like to get an understanding from each other as to when cricket might restart in their respective regions and under what conditions,” a CEC member said.

It has also been learnt that as of now, the ICC won’t tinker with the existing World T20 schedule in October-November as save Big Three — India, Australia and England — the smaller nations might find it difficult to sustain without the event is expected to generate.

In case the World T20 is shifted, the revenue stream, especially cash-flow will be severely affected.

The Spanish government has extended the country's state of alarm until May 9, with the entire population confined to their homes except a small number working in specific sectors, leaving Nadal perplexed as to why he can't train.

""It's true I don't understand very well because we cannot play tennis when many people are going to work and even more so in our sport, where we keep at a large and safe distance and we play on opposite sides of the court,"" world number two Nadal said during an Instagram Live.

""But I understand that we are in a very critical situation, that the government is dealing with something unprecedented and I also understand that the last thing they think of is who can train and who cannot train.

""I understand the situation and obviously there are many things that are not logical but you have to accept the rules.""

Nadal treated tennis fans to an Instagram Live in which he spoke to both Roger Federer and Andy Murray about their experiences during lockdown. The men's and women's tours have been halted due to the virus, while Wimbledon was cancelled last month for the first time since World War II and Nadal's favourite Grand Slam the French Open was pushed back to September 20.

""It's OK, I had a really good first six weeks, then it was a bit slower, now it's getting better again but I have plenty of time.

The chief minister, while chairing a high-level meeting of officials to take stock's of the UP anti-COVID fight, also stressed upon the need for thorough testing of people living in and around the areas declared hotspots, said Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi.

He said the chief minister also appealed to the people, visiting hospitals for emergency treatment, to go to the only to the hospitals approved by the Medical and Health Department.

Awasthi said “the chief minister has pointed out that several news items on positive results of plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have appeared in media recently.”

""In view of this, the efficacy of the new treatment protocol should be examined and promoted in the state,” said Adityanath, while chairing the meeting in which, he also instructed officials to ensure availability of oxygen for the COVID-19 patients. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of the plasma therapy for COVID-19.

Nearly 100 institutes have shown interest to study how safe and efficient is the plasma therapy in treating COVID-19 patinets.

Several states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started to using plasma therapy for the corona-infected patients.

Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for COVID-19 patients.

In this treatment, plasma from a cured COVID-19 patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.

The idea behind this therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured coronavirus patient to treat another critical patient.

The recovered COVID-19 patient's blood develops antibodies to battle against COVID-19. Once the blood of the first patient is infused to the second patient, those antibodies will start fighting against the coronavirus in the second person.

The process for donating plasma is similar to donating blood and takes about an hour.

Several countries around the world including United Kingdom and United States have also started plasma therapy trials.

While the meeting, the chief minister also issued directions to halt inter-district and inter-state transportation, and ensure that ration is available to one and all, said Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awasthi.

Talking about the need to visitonly approved hospitals for emergency treatment, Awasthi said, ""If anyone falls ill, he/she should go to the hospitals, only approved by the medical and health department, and not to any other place. Do not go to non-approved hospital for emergency.”

“Going to the emergency units of non-approved hospitals will also pose a danger to the lives of other patients. Emergency services have been allowed in only those hospitals, where there are sufficient equipment and trained staff,"" he said.

He said the chief minister has also directed that people in areas which have been declared COVID-19 hotspots should be thoroughly tested, and so should be the people living in the vicinity of hotspots.

""Pool testing can also be done in areas, where it is needed. Special arrangements should be made for testing in Kanpur, were the burden of testing is high,"" he said.

CM Adityanath also laid stress on the need for the people, put in quarantine, to follow the social distancing norms, said wasthi.

Referring to COVID-19 cases in Rae Bareli, Awasthi said, ""People placed under quarantine in Rae Bareli had first tested negative, while in the second test, they were tested positive for COVID-19.""

Seeking to promote the use of Aarogya Setu app, Awasthi said the app keeps one aware of one's surrounding and the possible COVID threat.

“Aarogya Setu app has been downloaded by nearly one crore people in the state. This is a big achievement. The app generates alert, and almost 200 alerts have already come. This will be used by the health department and concern district magistrates,"" he said.

Sanitisation of shelter home and community kitchens too should be done regularly, and medical tests of those working here should also be done.

“The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases calculated using growth over the past seven days indicates that Indiavs doubling rate for the week before lockdown was 3.4 per cent and has improved to 7.5 as on April 19 for the last seven days,” said Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal at a routine presser here.

Doubling rate slows down to 7.4 days

He said the States and UTs where the doubling duration s less than 20 days are Delhi where it is doubling in 8.5 days, Karnataka in 9.2 days, Telangana 9.4 days, Andhra Pradesh 10.6 days, Jammu & Kashmir 11.5 days, Punjab 13.1 days, Chattisgarh 13.3 days, Tamil Nadu 14 days and Bihar 16.4 days.

Places where the doubling time is between 20 days to 30 days include Andaman and Nicobar Island where it was 20.1 days. In Haryana, the cases are doubling in 21 days, in Himachal Pradesh 24.5 days, Chandigarh 25.4 days, Assam 25.8 days, Uttarakhand 26.6 days and Ladakh 26.6 days.

States with doubling time more than 30 days are Odisha and Kerala which reported doubling time as 39.8 days and 72.2 days respectively, Agarwal said.

Apart from Mahe in Puducherry and Kodagu in Karnataka, Pauri Garhwal district from Uttarakhand too have not reported any fresh case of coronavirus infection during last 28 days, he said.

There are 59 districts in 23 States and UTs where no case has been reported in the last 14 days, said Agarwal.

At the Press conference, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) head scientist Dr R Gangakhedkar said RTPCR kits are US FDA approved and have good standards and these should be stored under 20-degree temperature for better result.

Dr Gangakhedkar said, “We have received a grievance that in West Bengal, RTPCR kits are not working properly. These kits are US FDA approved and have good standards. Only thing is that these should be stored under 20 degrees temperature. Otherwise, results may not be correct.”

He said the kit used at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) will be provided to West Bengal Government for a temporary period.

“We have informed the West Bengal Government that the kit used in NIV is capable of conducting 10,000 tests and are present in Kolkata. We will provide that kit to the government for a temporary period,” said Gangakhedkar.

Agarwal also expressed concern over the news of some journalists in Mumbai testing positive for the virus and said when they attend their call of duty, they should take the required precautions. “Follow the norms of social distancing and wear face masks,” Agarwal said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/doubling-rate-slows-down-to-7-4-days.html
182,21-4-20,Re-infection or relapse? Scientists suspect latter,"As the world grapples with Covid-19, numerous cases have come up in South Korea, Japan and India where the patients were infected again after being cured. Scientists are now investigating whether they were re-infected or had a relapse — and so far suspect the latter.

Recently two patients after recovering from the disease reported the infection again and had to be admitted in Noida hospital while another case of relapse was reported from Kerala. The Kerala patient died later at hospital.

Experts said that if a section of the patients who are already exposed to the virus continued to be at the risk of getting infected again, it may put extra burden on the already overwhelmed public health system in India.

“The reason behind it is that there are studies which have found the virus may replicate only within some of the surface cells of the respiratory tract and it may not be severe enough to actually allow the body to develop an immune reaction to it,” Professor John Nicholls of Department of Pathology from Hong Kong University said in a report.

Exposure to foreign elements like virus triggers a defence mechanism to fight the disease-causing pathogen. The anti-bodies thus generated remain active in our bodies as they continue to provide a protective shield even after the infection has subsided, thus reducing chances of re-infection.

But mild clinical reactions in patients may not induce strong antibody reaction to stop a second bout of disease on being exposed to the virus.

“And this is quite important because these patients (with mild infections) still potentially can get the infections the second time,” Nicholls further said.

So far, scientists have attributed second infections in Covid-19 patients to false negative testing and re-activation of the virus.

Last week, South Korea reported more than 150 Covid-19 positive cases among patients who had earlier fully recovered.

Some studies in China, though still open to peer review, suggest nearly a third of Covid-19 patients developed low level of antibodies. In some patients, the anti-bodies could not be detected at all.

The World Health Organisation has said nearly 25 per cent of Covid-19 patients in China have been asymptomatic while issuing a warning that there’s no evidence to suggest anti-body or finger-print fast tests can show whether a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming re-infected.

“These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of serology presence, that level of antibodies, but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies is immune,” Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases, clarified earlier this week.

Following reports of some Covid-19 patients testing positive for the disease after initially testing negative emerged, the WHO has decided to investigate the issue.

“We are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases. It is important to make sure that when samples are collected for testing on suspected patients, procedures are followed properly,” it added. Worldwide, more than 24 lakhs have been infected by the virus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/re-infection-or-relapse---scientists-suspect-latter-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/re-infection-or-relapse---scientists-suspect-latter.html
183,21-4-20,IMA seeks law against attacks; candlelight protest on Wed,"Outraged over growing cases of attack on doctors, the recent one at Chennai a day ago where locals obstructed cremation of a doctor, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called for enactment of a Central law to check violence against medical professionals across the nation.

“Our legitimate needs for safe workplaces have to be met. Abuse and violence should stop immediately,” the IMA said in a statement here.

The IMA stated that doctors and medical professionals across the country will light candles at 9 pm on April 22, 2020 as protest and vigil against the violence and abuse. The IMA termed it as “White Alert” to the nation.

IMA president Dr Rajan Sharma said, “It is a matter of great concern that these doctors who had died in their line of duty be treated shabbily and in such an uncivilised manner.”

He also slammed the Government for not giving proper attention to the issues faced by the doctors amid the pandemic situation.

“The doctors are rendering services at extreme risk to themselves. No nation sends its army to war without weapons. Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers of this country have been sent to fight against Covid-19 without PPE kits and they are dying young defending their people.

“If the value of such services are not realised, the easiest thing for the doctor community will be to sit at home. The bigger sufferers will be the community,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ima-seeks-law-against-attacks--candlelight-protest-on-wed.html
184,21-4-20,"Mallya loses plea, clock is ticking for extradition","Embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Monday lost a crucial appeal against his extradition to India with the UK High Court ruling that the ex-boss of Kingfisher Airlines did have a prima facie case to answer in the Indian courts over the alleged Rs 9,000-crore fraud associated with loans sought from Indian banks for his now defunct airline.

The dismissal of the High Court appeal effectively clears the decks for Mallya’s extradition to India to face the charges in the Indian courts, with 14 days for him to apply for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court.

If he does apply, the UK Home Office would wait for the outcome of that appeal. But if he does not, under the India-UK Extradition Treaty, it would then be expected to formally certify the court order for the 64-year-old Mallya to be extradited to India within 28 days.

“We have held there is a prima facie case both of misrepresentation and of conspiracy, and thus there is also a prima facie case of money laundering,” the High Court concluded.

This marks a major turning point for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) case against the businessman, who has been on bail in the UK since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017.

The ex-Kingfisher Airlines boss had appealed to the higher court against his extradition ordered by the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December 2018, and then signed off by then UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid in February last year, at a three-day hearing in February this year.

Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench at the Royal Courts of Justice in London presiding over the appeal, dismissed it in a judgement handed down this week remotely due to the current coronavirus lockdown.

“We consider that while the scope of the prima facie case found by the SDJ (Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot) is in some respects wider than that alleged by the Respondent in India (CBI and ED), there is a prima facie case which, in seven important respects, coincides with the allegations in India,” the judges noted.

They detail seven main points around which they based their decision to concur with Arbuthnot’s extradition order. Based on the documents setting out the Indian government’s case against Mallya, the judges said they found that the loans in question were disbursed as the result of a conspiracy between the named conspirators and that they were made despite Kingfisher Airline’s weak financials, negative net worth and low credit rating.

“The Appellant (Mallya) was party to false representations to induce the loans that funds would be inducted by way of unsecured loans, global depository receipts and equity,” they note.

“The Appellant was party to false representations about inward investment, an exaggerated brand value, misleading growth forecasts, inconsistent business plans. The Appellant’s dishonest intention not to repay the loans is shown by his later conduct in trying to avoid the personal and corporate guarantees,” they said.

Mallya’s legal team had sought to challenge the Indian government’s case on multiple grounds, including whether their client would be safe at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai where he is to be held on extradition.

Most of the grounds had already been dismissed by the High Court, with permission granted to appeal only on one ground — challenging the Indian Government’s prima facie case against Mallya of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans. “Mallya has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. If he doesn’t appeal — removal within 28 days thereafter. If he does appeal, we wait for the outcome on that application,” said a spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service, which represented the Indian authorities in the UK courts.

In February, Mallya had again reiterated his message for the Indian banks to take back 100 per cent of the principal amount owed to them. Reacting to the UK High Court’s ruling, the CBI said it was a significant achievement for continuing the war against economic fugitives.

“It is a significant achievement in continuing war against economic fugitives who have been managing to stay away from the judicial process in the country,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said in New Delhi.

Mallya, declared a fugitive by India, has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017. In her verdict in December 2018, Judge Arbuthnot had ruled that the “flashy” former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts. She found there was “clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds”.

India and the UK have an extradition treaty signed in 1992 and in force since November 1993. Two major extraditions have taken place under this treaty so far - Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel, who was sent back to India in 2016 to face trial in connection with his involvement in the post-Godhra riots of 2002, and more recently alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla, sent back in February this year to face match-fixing charges.

As India falls under the Category 2 set of countries within the UK’s Extradition Act 2003, any decision of the courts must be endorsed by the UK Home Secretary - who has the authority to order extradition. As Mallya’s extradition has been signed off by the minister at the time, only a formal certification will now be required once all avenues of appeal have been exhausted in the UK.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mallya-loses-plea--clock--is-ticking-for-extradition-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mallya-loses-plea--clock--is-ticking-for-extradition.html
185,21-4-20,Air condition with caution,"Living without ACs is a nightmare for many. Adding to the woes, is the relation between the spread of COVID-19 and home air conditioners. MUSBA HASHMI speaks with DR JASMEET KAUR WADHWA about the possible threat and whether it is a wise decision to use them

The scorching summer months are here and so is the anxiety and stress factor. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a chaos in everybody’s life with queries pouring in whether is it a good idea to sit and relax in home ACs without having to worry about the spread of the virus. Some say that the risk of infection increases in ACs while others say that it is the centrally air conditioned spaces that pose a threat and not home ACs.

Dr Jasmeet Kaur Wadhwa, Senior Consultant Paediatric Pulmonology & TB division, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute says that home ACs don’t pose any threat of infections where proper precautions are being taken by people.

“As summers have approached much concern has been raised regarding home ACs in the context of coronavirus pandemic, but home window or split ACs confined in a room do not pose any threat at home where required precautions are being taken and family members are infection free. But if any family member is suffering from respiratory disease or having a mild infection then try to refrain from using AC. Because the droplets left by the infected person can get recycled in the common duct of the AC and can infect others as well,” she tells you.

However, the challenge, she says, lies with the centrally air conditioned spaces. “The bigger challenge is with central ACs, which are placed in big offices, hospitals and essential food outlets, which are now supposed to be used with precautions. Since, COVID-19 is a droplet infection, it remains in the environment for a shorter time then get settled on the surfaces, hence it is more about coming in contact with an infected person then getting exposed to the recycled AC air which contains virus,” Wadhwa explains.

Studies are yet to confirm whether there is a significant effect of temperature on this virus but World Health Organisation and Indian Council of Medical Research have also stated that Coronavirus has no direct relation with temperature.

This means there is nothing to worry about much using ACs at home. Following precautions will keep you risk free. “Keep your AC filter clean, do not use ACs continuously for several hours. Practically, there is no threat in cleaning duct still do it with precaution. If any member in the family is suffering from upper respiratory disease or carrying mild infection, then don’t use AC for cooling, rather use exhaust fans for clear air. Keep windows open for fresh air and cross ventilation. Try not to be in a closed room with AC switched on for a long time, more so when a family member is facing any type of respiratory issues,” she advises.

Breathe in fresh air as much as possible to eliminate the slightest risk of infection, she adds.

Abhijeet Shakya, an engineer who is into the business of AC servicing and repairing says that when it comes to home ACs there are no risks involved because they cater to a limited number of people. But what makes centrally air conditioned spaces a threat is the large number of people who may carry the virus. “Recently, the Government issued an advisory for offices, hospitals and malls to avoid using ACs till the coronavirus pandemic. Since they are public spaces, the risk of infection increases. The AC vents increases the risk of virus spreading to the whole of the building,” he says.

Having said that, experts also suggest that the recommended temperature of the air conditioned rooms shouldn’t be less than 24 degrees Celsius. This will further help eliminate any risks involved.

However, to be on the safe side many people are restraining themselves from using ACs for the next 15 days atleast. “I usually spend most of the time in AC. Be it in office or at home, AC was a must. But amid the coronavirus threat, till date I haven’t switched on my AC yet. May be after 10 days or so, once there is a confirmation on the same, I will think about using them,” says Kiran Singh, a resident of Noida who is feeling the AC heat at the moment.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/air-condition-with-caution-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/air-condition-with-caution.html

No doubt, pregnancy is the most beautiful phase in a woman’s life. During this phase, a woman tends to experience immunologic and physiologic changes that often make them hypochondriac about their and the unborn child’s heath. And, when the world is fighting with deadly coronavirus pandemic, the anxiety and stress level increases in expecting mothers.

The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China in January, has rapidly spread across the globe, including to every State in India. As everyday so many people are getting affected by it irrespective of age and gender, it’s natural to have questions about the coronavirus and what it means for your pregnancy. Here’s what you need to know.

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coronavirus typically spread from an infected person to other people via respiratory drops that get into the air by coughing or sneezing, close contact with an infected person, like touching or shaking hands, or touching a surface that has been contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before you wash your hands can also spread the virus.

Symptoms include

Fever, cough, and breathing difficulties.

In more severe cases, one may also get pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.

What precaution pregnant women should take?

Since pregnant women are immunocompromised, therefore they are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections, flu and if not treated immediately it can impact their health severely.

Not only this, but pregnant women may also suffer from severe illness, morbidity and mortality compared to others. They have chances of getting other related coronavirus infections (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)) and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, during pregnancy.

A small study of nine pregnant women in Wuhan, China, with confirmed COVID-19 found no evidence of the virus in their breast milk and cord blood amniotic fluid.

Though there is no evidence that suggests that pregnant women are at the risk of miscarriage or even of the virus passing to the developing baby while the mother is pregnant, the research is still going on.

Pregnant women should take precautions in order to keep coronavirus away. Similar to other members, they should also wash their hands at regular intervals, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, avoid close contact, cover your mouth while coughing and sneezing or wear a face mask and disinfect frequently touch surfaces.

If you are pregnant and you feel sick then consult your doctor immediately as your baby may also be vulnerable to the virus.

As the virus has continued its spread across India, many hospitals and birthing centers have been enacting new measures to keep mothers and babies safe. They should restrict visitors from entering the delivery room. If a patient has been exposed to or test positive for COVID-19, they should be shifted to anisolated ward with doctors and nurses wearing protective gear.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/docyard---don---t-ignore-any-symptoms-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/docyard---don---t-ignore-any-symptoms.html
187,21-4-20,Extend a helping hand,"Elderly people are more vulnerable to coronavirus. KEWAL KAPOOR shares tips that can reduce the risk and prevent lockdown from taking a toll on their physical and mental health

Social connection is an integral part of elderly people’s lives, and with the lockdown in place, they need it more than ever. The pandemic brings with it a great degree of uncertainty, anxiety and fear. Now that face-to-face encounters are no possible, we must come up with creative ways to help them stay connected.

People over the age of 65 are more vulnerable to the outbreak. Their ageing immune systems make it harder for their bodies to fend off infectious diseases. Recoveries take longer than usual and besotted by complications. To add to the woes, most of them live alone on a fixed pension with undiagnosed depression. The risk of COVID-19 may end up amplifying their pre-existing problems. Here is how you can help them through this difficult time

Provide social support: If you have neighbours over the age of 60, check on them regularly. Call them, or send them a text message. If they are not comfortable with either, leave a note on their door asking them if they need anything. It is important to let them know that you are thinking about them. If possible, cook a little extra and offer a dish to them so that they do not have to go through the trouble. Make sure you put the food in a disposable container and wipe the outside of the container with a disinfectant.

Buy food and essentials: With panic spreading faster than the virus, even non-perishable foods like rice, sugar, flour, cereals and biscuits are fast disappearing from the shelves. A lot of seniors risk a trip to the local grocery store only to return empty handed. Consider shopping on their behalf, or help them with ordering groceries online.

Help getting medication: Either make the trip to the pharmacy on their behalf, or talk to the pharmacist to set up an ongoing delivery. If you are going to do the latter, you may have to place a conference call with the pharmacist. A lot of seniors also have trouble taking their medication on time; you can have the pharmacist pre-package their medication with labels, and you can set a reminder on their smartphone.

Help with dementia care: Seniors suffering from dementia are going to hit the hardest by the lockdown. If you have someone in your family who is suffering from dementia or know someone in your neighbourhood who is struggling with the condition, make sure you reach out to them. A lot of them use adult day care, which will not be available during the lockdown. Support groups they attend to cope with the condition will not be in session either. These services are essential for them, and their unavailability will only add to their stress. Set up video or phone conferencing with care partners who can help them come up with coping strategies.

Coming days will be difficult and we need to stand together during these testing times. Through clear communication and effective collaboration, we can prevent the lockdown from taking a toll on the physical and mental health of seniors.

188,21-4-20,Central team on COVID-19 claims lack of cooperation by Mamata govt,"A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed she was kept in ""dark"" about the visit of central teams to assess the COVID-19 situation, the leader of one of the panels claimed the state government is not extending adequate cooperation.

The central government has constituted six Inter- Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to make an on-spot assessment of the COVID-19 situation in these places and issue necessary directions to the four states -- Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal -- for redress.

The Union home ministry said on Monday morning the COVID-19 situation is ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and that the violation of lockdown measures risk the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Apurva Chandra, the leader of one of the two teams sent to the state, claimed its members were told they ""will not be going out"" on Tuesday.

Chandra, an Additional secretary in the Defence Ministry, said,""We have been deployed by the central government and our order of deployment says that the state government is to provide logistic(al) support to us... I have been in touch with the chief secretary and seeking his support since the time I landed here.

""I had also met him yesterday. But today we have been informed that there are some issues so we are not going out today. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him,"" he told a TV news channel.

Chandra said the team had made it clear that it would be moving out with state government officers in order to make the visit more productive.

""But now it is more than one day and we have only visited NICED (an ICMR facility) and the state secretariat only,"" he said.

Banerjee had on Monday expressed her displeasure in a series of tweets and sought to know the rationale behind the formation of central teams to visit the states.

She urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to share with her the criteria to be followed by the teams for the assessment of the situation, without which her government ""would not be able to move ahead"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/central-team-on-covid-19-claims-lack-of-cooperation-by-mamata-govt-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/central-team-on-covid-19-claims-lack-of-cooperation-by-mamata-govt.html

191,21-4-20,Day 1: Some resume work with caution,"Social distancing norms followed, workers stay on premises for safety

The phase of country’s ‘partial exit’ from coronavirus lockdown began on Monday as several States opened up some business activities with caution whereas Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Delhi, Odisha, Karnataka, Haryana and others decided to continue with the existing restriction.

Karnataka and Tamil Nadu joined Telangana and Punjab in not easing the lockdown restrictions till May 3. Telangana, Punjab and Delhi had on Sunday announced they would not give any relaxations from the lockdown.

In many industrial units in several parts of the country, workers are staying on the same premises on resumption of work as a measure of safety.

Mostly in rural areas, several activities, including construction and repairing of roads, labour work under the MGNREGA, were restarted with strict enforcement of “social distancing” and provision for labourers to stay back at the site.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the State Government has allowed some industrial activity in the green and orange Covid-19 zones. He added that only those industries that can provide accommodation to their workers during the lockdown period will be given foodgrain supply and will be permitted for raw material from the State. He further said all districts will remain sealed and only essential services movement will be permitted.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said no leniency is to be given in areas that are categorised as coronavirus hotspots and containment zones.

“All District Magistrates should decide at the local-level after seeing the circumstances to give exemption in certain activities during the lockdown, and then inform the State Government in this regard,” a statement released by the UP Government read.

The Government has allowed opening up of specified undertakings, banks and other units in the 56 districts that have reported less than 10 coronavirus cases

Karnataka has allowed the construction activities for workers with the rider that they will have to stay at the sites.

The West Bengal Government has issued guidelines for medical workers saying that those working in hospitals, especially Government hospitals, will not go home after they finish their respective duties as they will stay in their work headquarters. The circular said that all necessary arrangements have already been made for providing suitable boarding and lodging facilities to frontline medical personnel in the vicinity of their work places.

Goa which did not report a single positive case also continued with strict regulation of lockdown guidelines, allowing only those activities which have also been certified by the Centre.

The Centre also formed six inter-ministerial teams to make assessment in West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The two teams each will visit West Bengal and Maharashtra and one each will visit Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan’s most affected Covid-19 spots immediately.

A peeved Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi questioning the appropriateness of unleashing a Central team on the State for inspecting the alleged “violation” and “dilution” of lock-down guidelines without keeping the Bengal Government in the loop. The letter was written within an hour of the Chief Minister asking the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah on the twitter to explain the Centre’s alleged arbitrary conduct defying all the federal norms. In the letter, Mamata has drawn attention of the Prime Minister to how the inter-ministerial Central team landed in Kolkata within minutes of her Government being informed about its coming to the State, sources said, adding how the Chief Minister has reminded the Prime Minister that the Central move is against all established traditions.

The Centre’s inter-ministerial teams will visit Kolkata, Howrah, Medinipur East, 24 Parganas North, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri in West Bengal. Already the Union Home Ministry has red-flagged gross lockdown norms violations in the Trinamool Congress-ruled State by opening up pan shops, flower shops and even allowing Islamic congregations and meat shops.

In Maharashtra, the teams will visit Mumbai and Pune, which are the most affected spots. In Madhya Pradesh, the Centre’s monitoring team will visit the most affect spot Indore and in Rajasthan, the team will visit Jaipur.

“IMCTs to focus on complaints of implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines, supply of essential commodities, social distancing, preparedness of health infrastructure, safety of health professionals and conditions of the relief camps for labourers and the poor. It may be mentioned that if the incidents of violations are allowed to occur without any restraining measures in hotspot districts or emerging hotspots or even places where large outbreaks or clusters may be expected and pose a serious health hazard, both for the population of these districts and for that living in other areas of the country. After analysing the prevalence of such violations in major hotspot districts, it is clear to the Central Government that the situation is especially serious in the above mentioned areas and expertise of the Centre need to be used,” said the Centre’s statement explaining the functions of the inter-ministerial team.

The statement said that it was being emphasised that the IMCTs will focus their assessment on the compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act 2005. They will also focus on issues like the supply of essential commodities, social distancing in movement of people outside their homes, preparedness of the health infrastructure, hospital facility and sample statistics in the district, safety of health professionals, availability of test kits, PPEs, masks and other safety equipment, and conditions of the relief camps for labour and poor people.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/day-1--some-resume-work-with-caution-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/day-1--some-resume-work-with-caution.html

The total number of containment zones in the national Capital increased to 84, up from the 79 notified last evening.

Delhi Cabinet Minister Gopal Rai said the Azadpur Mandi in Delhi will remain open for 24 hours from Tuesday. The decision has been taken in the view of ensuring that the social distancing norms are being practiced and to provide relief to the fruit and vegetable traders, he said.

Fruits and vegetables will be sold from 6 am till 10 pm, while the truck movement will be permitted from 10 pm to 6 am in and out of the market. Entry of 1,000 people will be allowed every 4 hours, said officials.

“The Azadpur Mandi has been catering to the people and procuring produce from farmers across the country. There was a decline in the volume of fruits and vegetables flowing through the market. The arrivals in the market nearly dropped by 50 per cent post-lockdown,” said Rai.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi---s-azadpur-mandi-open-24x7--curbs-to-continue-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi---s-azadpur-mandi-open-24x7--curbs-to-continue.html
193,21-4-20,Kerala to roll back relaxations,"With Kerala exceeding the brief and allowing additional relaxation from the lockdown regulations, the MHA on Monday said States can take stricter action but can’t dilute Centre’s lockdown guidelines. Reacting to Centre’s observation, Kerala has decided to amend the ease rules.

The Kerala Government on Monday decided not to allow plying of buses in cities, opening of restaurants an pillion riding on two-wheelers even as it asserted that there will not be any compromise on heath safety precautions.

The decision in this regard was taken at a meeting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had with Chief Seretary Tom Jose this morning.

Day 1 of the relaxations saw scores of people hitting the roads in their four wheeelers and two wheelers in various parts of the State, including coronavirus hotspots, and there was confusion galore over the easing of nroms.

Speaking to reporters Vijayan said there was no conflict between the Centre and the State over the easing of lockdown protocol and the State Government was diligently following the directions of the Union Government.

“There was an argument that Kerala has diluted the lockdown protocol. But we had analysed the situation and decided on the lockdown restrictions. There will not be any compromise on health safety. We made certain changes on hotspots based on the situation in Kerala and sought permission from the centre for the same. There will be no public transport. Dine-in facilitywill not be allowed in hotels and restaurants and only parcels services (takeaway) will function,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kerala-to-roll-back-relaxations.html

Confirming the development, TV Journalists’ Association (TVJA) President Vinod Jagdale told The Pioneer that the swab samples of 167 journalists were taken at a camp held near the Mumbai Press Club on April 16 and 17 and the test reports came on Monday.

“Of the 167 journalists, 53 have tested positive. They have all been quarantined in a city hotel. All the infected journalists are asymptomatic. They will remain in quarantine for the next 14 days. They will undergo two more tests during the period,” Jagdale said.

Having cognisance of the fact that two journalists from Thane had tested positive for coronavirus, Jagdale had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to arrange Covid-19 tests for the electronic, web and print media journalists based in Mumbai.

196,21-4-20,Pakistan removes thousands of names from terrorist watch list: Report,"Pakistan has quietly removed around 1,800 terrorists from its watch list, including that of the 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind and LeT operations commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, ahead of a new round of assessments by the global anti-money-laundering watchdog FATF, according to a US-based start-up that automates watchlist compliance.

The so-called proscribed persons list, which is maintained by Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority or NACTA, is intended in part to help financial institutions avoid doing business with or processing transactions of suspected terrorists.

The list in 2018 contained about 7,600 names. It has been reduced to under 3,800 in the past 18 months, according to Castellum.AI, a New York-based regulatory technology company.

About 1,800 of the names have been removed since the beginning of March, according to data collected by Castellum.

Pakistan is working to implement an action plan that has been mutually agreed to with the Paris-based The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), part of which involves demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions.""

It is possible that these removals are part of Pakistan's action plan to implement the FATF recommendations, it said.

While Pakistan received a rating of low effectiveness from the FATF regarding terrorist financing preventive measures and financial sanctions, the FATF did note in February that Pakistan has largely addressed 14 of 27 action items, with varying levels of progress made on the rest of the action, it said.

The FATF will again evaluate Pakistan's progress in June 2020.

Currently placed on the FATF's grey list', Pakistan has been scrambling in recent months to avoid being added to a list of countries deemed non-compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations, a measure that officials here fear could hurt its economy, which is already under severe strain.

Several of the names removed from Pakistan's list appear to be aliases for designated terrorists listed on the US or United Nations sanctions lists, according to Castellum.AI.

The lack of certain identifiers such as dates of birth or, in some cases, a national ID number on NACTA's list makes it difficult to know for sure, the Wall Street Journal quoted sanctions experts as saying.

In the case of Zaka Ur Rehman, the difference between Zaka and Zaki fits within the parameters of an accurate phonetic translation, the company said.

Castellum.AI said it also searched for the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader's full name, Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, on the Pakistan Proscribed Persons list, and he was not on the list. This means that if the removed name is a false positive, that Pakistan has not added the Lashkar E Taiba leader to its terrorism watchlist.

According to the Wall Street Journal, no public explanation was given for the removals as they were made, but a Pakistani official said in an email interview that they are part of the country's ongoing efforts to comply with a commitment to strengthen its counterterrorism safeguards.

The size and speed of the removals is unusual, according to Peter Piatetsky, a former senior policy adviser for the US Treasury and co-founder of Castellum.AI. Removing close to 4,000 names without a public explanation is unheard of and it raises significant questions about the listing process, he said.

Global standards call for countries to communicate de-listings to the financial sector immediately upon taking such action. Pakistan, which designates entities and persons with suspected links to terrorism under its Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997, hasn't historically done so, the newspaper said.

199,21-4-20,Sonu Nigam trends over old tweets even as he is stranded in Dubai,"Singer Sonu Nigam has been trending all through Tuesday, but for all the wrong reasons. A tweet that he posted three years ago suddenly resurfaced on social media drawing online ire. A section of the media even erreonously reported that the singer has been forced to deactivate his Twitter account owing to the cyber onslaught.

The truth is Sonu had deleted his Twitter account long ago, in 2017, after facing massive trolling over tweet comments he had made back then criticising the 'azaan'. He has never been back on the social media microblogging site, though he does have an Instagram account.

Sonu is currently in Dubai, and has not been able to return to India because the lockdown happened. However, the actor posts pictures and videos on Instagram.

Sonu's controversial tweets had come around this time in 2017 and a section of the Twiteratti, probably without checking the date, posted screen shots of the old tweets. These screen shots started going viral on Tuesday.

Some of Sonu's fans feel the three-year-old tweet is being resurrected in order to harass the singer in Dubai.

""Wish he hadn't deactivated his account. I fully support him. #WithYouSonuNigam"" wrote a fan.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sonu-nigam-trends-over-old-tweets-even-as-he-is-stranded-in-dubai-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/sonu-nigam-trends-over-old-tweets-even-as-he-is-stranded-in-dubai.html
200,21-4-20,"101 arrested for lynching 2 sadhus, aide in Palghar","Acting sternly against the culprits behind the ghastly lynching of two sadhus and their driver in Palghar on Thursday, the Maharashtra Police on Monday arrested 101 persons, including nine minors, in connection with the incident, even as Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered the suspension of two policemen, transferred the case to the Crime Investigation Department (CID) and deplored the efforts to communalise the crime.

On a day when State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced the arrest of 101 persons in connection with the lynchings, the Chief Minister spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and briefed them about the incident.

Meanwhile, All India president of June Akhara Mahant Prem Giri threatened to stage gherao of Uddhav Thackeray after the lockdown is over and demanded action against the culprits.

Addressing the people across the nation through social media, Uddhav said, “Currently, we are waging a war against coronavirus. Some people are using the incident to vitiate the atmosphere. Though two sadhus were among the three lynched in the incident, please do not give a communal colour to the incident. I have spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah this morning in this regard”.

Dwelling upon the incident, Uddhav said: “This incident took place on the night of April 16 in the jurisdiction of the Kasa police station, which is on the border of the Centrally administered-territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli. The incident happened when two sadhus and their driver were returning to Mumbai, after being stopped at the border. They were attacked at a hinterland area. The incident was triggered by some rumours”.

“The Maharashtra police rushed to the spot and arrested more than 100 persons in connection with the incident. Of the arrested, nine are minor boys. They have been sent to remand home. The other arrested persons have been sent behind bars. We will take stern action against the culprits behind the incident,” the Chief Minister said.

Uddhav said that the State Government had suspended two policemen in connection with the incident. “I have spoken to both Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. There is absolutely no religious context to the incident. It is wrong for the people to give communal colour to the incident. The mob attacked even the policemen who had rushed to the scene. They also damaged their vehicle”.

It may be recalled that on the night of April 16, three persons were lynched by a 200-strong mob of villagers near Kasa town in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on suspicion that they were thieves.

The villagers first hurled stones at the van, prompting the driver to stop the vehicle. Later, they pulled three persons out of the vehicle and beat them to death in Gadhchinchale village on Dabhadi-Khanwel road, with sticks and rods.

The deceased --- identified as Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (70), Sushilgiri Maharaj (35) and driver Nilesh Telgade (30) --- were travelling to Surat. Of them one was the diver, while two are residents of Kandivli in north Mumbai. The place where the incident took place is approximately 120 km from Mumbai.

Earlier, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said: “The incident happened when the three persons were going to Surat in a car from Kandivli in Mumbai. The incident happened after rumours spread that these people had come to kidnap children. A large number of people gathered. .The police opened two rounds of fire to quell the angry crowds. However, they could not control the mobs. ... the inquiry into the incident has been handed over to the Special IG. We have so far arrested 101 persons in connection with the incident”.

Meanwhile, the CPI(M) Maharashtra State Committee strongly condemned the shocking incident of mob lynching incident.

“The CPI(M) denounces the absolutely false communal colour that the RSS, BJP are working overtime to give to this incident. The community that attacked does not have any history of communal enmity. The RSS-BJP leaders also know this very well, and yet they are indulging in this false campaign to discredit the State Government,” the CPI(M) Maharashtra said in a statement issued here.

“We also strongly denounce the downright lies and canards that are being spread on Facebook by RSS-BJP leaders Sambit Patra, Sunil Deodhar and others. They have said that the Dahanu Assembly constituency in which this incident took place is a CPI(M) stronghold, it now has a CPI(M) MLA, and they have then shamelessly alleged that the CPI(M) is behind these killings,” the CPI (M) added.

Interestingly, CPI(M) MLA Nikole Vinod Bhiva represents Dahanu constituency where the incident took place. Gadhchinchale village, where the incident took place is a BJP stronghold.

Dr. Ashok Dhawale, who is the president of India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) Central Committee Member, CPI(M), tweeted: “Sambit Patra and Sunil Deodhar are not only communalising, but spreading downright lies. The sarpanch of the Gadachinchle village where the mob lynching took place belongs to the BJP, her name is Chitra Choudhari. Many BJP men have been arrested for killing these sadhus”.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/101-arrested-for-lynching-2-sadhus--aide-in-palghar-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/101-arrested-for-lynching-2-sadhus--aide-in-palghar.html
201,21-4-20,Vir Das on spreading smiles amid COVID-19 crisis,"Actor-comedian Vir Das wants to spread smiles to raise funds amid the COVID-19 crisis, and he believes in fighting back with a sense of humour.

Vir is raising funds through his special ""Vir Das At Home"" gigs, where he performs for an audience online. The funds raised from the shows go to different causes.

Asked about the need to spread laughter, Vir told IANS: ""What's the alternative?""

""That's the way I look at it. I get a fair amount of hatred every day on Twitter. I have lots of people telling me ‘oh you are an anti-national', you are insensitive, inappropriate, disrespectful… I respond by asking ‘what's the alternative'. Is the alternative not to smile? Is the alternative not to crack the joke? Is the alternative not to laugh? I don't think it is a good alternative in these times,"" he added.

Vir continued: ""Right now you have two choices -- You can let coronavirus get you down or you can fight back with your sense of humour. I chose option B.

Vir, who is seen in Netflix's web show ""Hasmukh"", says that he is ""digging"" the lockdown period.

""We recently announced six shows and the proceeds of all the shows will go to different charities. I am spending my time trying to raise money to battle the virus… When you donate, it's a start and you can continue it by raising more money. So, I am trying to raise as much money as I can,"" he said.

For the comedy special, he sits in front of a computer and connects with his audiences.

""Nobody likes sitting in front of a computer for one hour. It's not the ideal environment. But it has raised money, and I will continue doing that,"" he stressed.

On the work front, the actor is currently seen in the Netflix series, ""Hasmukh"", which he has co-created and written with Nikkhil Advani.

""Hasmukh"" is about an ambitious comic who realises that the only way he can ""kill it on stage"" is if he ""kills off stage"".

Talking about the challenges he faced while working on the show, Vir said: ""The challenge was to convince people to let me do a show like this. I don't think had I not written it, I would get to be a part of it in this capacity as a lead of the show.

""I had to create the opportunity. What helped was that I did a short film with Milap Zaveri titled ‘Raakh'. That was dark. So, when that came out and got a good response, then I thought that it was a good time to go out in the market with an idea like that.""

202,21-4-20,Hilary Duff has weekly meetings for 'Lizzie McGuire' reboot,"Actor Hilary Duff says she is still having weekly meetings with the team about the ""Lizzie McGuire"" reboot set at Disney Plus.

The new series, which was announced in last August during the company's D23 Expo, was put on hiatus after showrunner Terri Minsky left the project over creative differences with the streamer.

The studio reportedly wanted a family-friendly programme, which Duff and creator Terri Minsky disagreed with.

The star said there were plans for ""a lot of"" familiar faces to come back, but she was unsure whether Lalaine (Miranda Sanchez) and Yani Gellman (who played Paolo Valisari) would star in the reboot.

Gellman's Paolo betrayed Lizzie when he tried to set her up to embarrass his fellow pop star, Isabella Parigi, a role also played by Duff in ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"".

""I'm still talking to (the team) weekly, I don't know. They were shooting and then everything was put on hold. And we're just kind of figuring out if we can make this happen.

""But there were plans for a lot of people to be in the show. So, I already know some of those things but I don't know about Paolo. I think she (Lizzie)'d probably be pretty mad to see him,"" Duff told Cosmopolitan magazine.

In February, the actor urged Disney Plus to consider moving the revival series to Hulu, days after production on the show was put on hold.

203,21-4-20,Exhale out negativity,"During these testing times, it is important to keep calm, positive and nurture our mental health, says PULKIT SHARMA

The World Health Organisation, in a recent report cautions us about the rising cases of psychological disorders in India. The most common disorders afflicting Indian population include depression, anxiety, addictions and suicides. Moreover, the emotional and economic mayhem created by the current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to push the situation from bad to worse. In such times, we must rediscover ways to keep calm, positive and nurture our mental health. Taking care of our mind is as important because our thoughts have the power to shape our life.

Whenever you are stressed, introspect deeply on the source of the problem. Most of us have a flawed perception which makes us worried, depressed and agitated over anything going wrong in our life. Under its spell, we tend to overreact to minor frustrations, losses and deprivations and wrongly conclude that there is an emergency-like situation. To be mentally healthy, this wrong perception needs to go. When faced with unpleasant circumstances, remind yourself that the situation is not as grim as it appears to you; reassure yourself that you have the strength to deal with such problems. Enhance your mental endurance by facing adversities peacefully and optimistically and consider them as hidden opportunities to refine your survival instincts.

Also, there is an intimate connection between our breath and the mind — a calm breath can pacify an agitated mind. Therefore, whenever you are feeling nervous or sad, just pause for a few moments, check your breathing and normalise it. Alter the pace of your inhalation and exhalation so that your breathing becomes relaxed, regular, diaphragmatic and quiet. This type of breathing ensures optimum levels of oxygen in your blood, improves your attention and concentration and induces a state of mental calmness and well-being.

Our busy and chaotic lives, erratic work hours and increasing distractions leave us with measly time and space for winding down. Although, it may seem desirable to be a go-getter, but we usually take it to an extreme and force ourselves to function like machines. Without the much-needed break from routines, our body and mind burn out and we become vulnerable to various physical and psychological disorders. Encourage yourself to slow down and reclaim such long-lost interests and passions. This will brighten your mood, uplift your spirits and help you enhance your immunity and mental health.

Our mind has a tendency to wallow in past memories around discomforts, losses, annoyances and irritations — big or small and it ignores the positive aspects of life. If we scan our memories carefully, we would recall many moments of generosity — when family and friends supported us through thick and thin, when the universe answered our prayers, when strangers went out of their way to helps us or when someone showered us with unconditional love. It is important to hold on to these happy memories so that we feel hopeful about the world we live in. Try keeping a diary of gratitude and express thankfulness for everything good, whether big or small that comes your way. During difficult moments, you can read this journal and firm up your faith that come what may, the light will outweigh the darkness. Remember that you have an innate power to be mentally healthy and happy. Trust this inner force and let it work freely.

204,21-4-20,STUDY CENTRE,"On World Health Day, April 7, Godrej Interio released an independent study: “Elevating Experiences, Enriching Lives’’. The World Health Organisation had chosen this year to celebrate the work of nurses and midwives, and remind the world of the critical role they play in keeping the society healthy. In line with the theme, the study by Godrej Interio discusses prevalent challenges faced by the nursing forces while delivering healthcare services in the country.

Caregivers face tremendous work-related stress, burnout due to workload, and long working hours due to the acute shortage of trained workforce. The job also has significant physical demands like standing for long hours, performing tasks in awkward and sustained postures, and handling patients while transferring them. This poses a high risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

The study revealed that long working hours, overtime and work overload affects the physical and psychological wellbeing of the nurses. While more than 90% of nurses have MSD (musculoskeletal disorder), 61% also experienced neck pain sometimes. Most recurring pain area (51%) is leg ache, followed by knee pain (51%). Similarly, 51% nurses complained of upper and lower back issues, 41% reported to have taken leave(s) for one-three days whereas 7% nurses have taken leaves for 4-6 days in a span of two months to manage the pain, indicating an evident productivity loss to the organisation.

Even before the onset of the pandemic, India was suffering from a shortage of 2 million nurses (WHO, 2019). The nurse to patient ratio for India is only around 2.1 nurses per 1000 population.

The study also explored the strain on the workforce due to the acute shortage of caregivers.

It revealed that 88% of nurses work for eight-10 hours a day along with doing overtime at least thrice a month. Similarly, 74% of the nurses stand for more than four to six hours a day at a stretch, causing stress on their lower limbs. While 20% of nurses reported performing double-shift duty at least twice a month.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/study-centre-study-centre.html
205,21-4-20,Screen time for babies linked to higher risk of autism-like symptoms,"Amid the pandemic induced lockdown across the globe when many children are at home all day sitting in front of a tablet or television due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, researchers have found that too much of screen exposure can be linked to a higher likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like symptoms in babies.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that 12 months of babies who spend large portions of time looking at screens were more likely to show autism-like symptoms at two years of age.

""The findings strengthen our understanding of the importance of playtime between parents and children relative to screen time,"" said senior author David S Bennett from Drexel University in the US.

""There is a great opportunity for public health campaigns and paediatricians to educate and empower parents to possibly minimize their child's risk of ASD symptoms, which may include increasing social interaction and limiting screens at an early age,"" Bennett added.

For the results, during babies' 12- and 18-months well visits, their caregivers were asked about how often their baby is exposed to screens or books, and how often they play with their child. Following this group of 2,152 children from the National Children's Study the team examined how watching television or videos, as well as social playtime and reading together, were associated with ASD risk and ASD-like symptoms at two years of age as measured by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT).

While toddlers generally are interested in interacting with others, those with ASD-like symptoms are less likely to show these social behaviours.

The findings showed that viewing screens at 12 months of age was associated with four per cent greater ASD-like symptoms, and daily playtime with a parent compared to less than daily playtime was associated with nine per cent less ASD-like symptoms.

The study backs recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics which discourages screen time in children younger than 18 months unless it is used for video chatting.

The authors noted that their study did not find an association with ASD risk, but rather with ASD-like symptoms. Future studies should explore whether this relationship is determined by children predisposed to ASD being drawn to the screens or screens contributing to ASD-like symptoms, they said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/screen-time-for-babies-linked-to-higher-risk-of-autism-like-symptoms-2020-04-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/screen-time-for-babies-linked-to-higher-risk-of-autism-like-symptoms.html
206,21-4-20,Sri Lanka postpones parliamentary poll for nearly 2 months due to COVID-19 outbreak,"Sri Lanka's Election Commission has postponed the parliamentary elections for nearly two months in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed seven people and infected 295 others in the country.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 dissolved the Parliament, six months ahead of schedule and called a snap election on April 25.

A gazette notice signed by the three members of the National Election Commission announcing June 20 date of the election was issued on Monday.

The EC has written to President Rajapaksa asking him to seek the highest court's opinion on a possible constitutional standoff arising from the postponement of the election.

It said that the postponement meant that parliament would not be able to meet on June 2, which is three months from the dismissal of last parliament on March 2.

However, Rajapaksa asserted that it was the election commission's job to fix the polls date and as such no need for the Supreme Court's intervention.

Earlier, the election commission met with the government officials and reviewed the pandemic situation affecting the election machinery.

On Monday, the government dropped its decision to relax the nationwide curfew and extended it to April 27 following a sudden spike of 41 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. On Sunday, the government announced to partially lift the curbs from Monday to boost economic activity.

The island nation has been under a 24-hour curfew since March 20 to combat the deadly viral infection.

All opposition parties and many civil society groups have urged the government to show caution in trying to rush through holding the election.

Sri Lanka has so far reported 295 COVID-19 cases, including seven deaths, and 96 recoveries, since the first viral infection was reported in the country on March 11.

The parliamentary polls were announced 6 months ahead of the schedule as Rajapaksa, who was elected as president in November, wanted a new Parliament to implement his mandate.

Rajapaksa is also under pressure to re-summon the dissolved Parliament in order to approve finances for government business from May.

The previous Parliament had approved funds till April 30.

207,21-4-20,Trump says will sign executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into US,"President Donald Trump has said that he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into America, amid the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 40,000 people in the US, the country with the most fatalities in the pandemic.

The number of people killed in the US due to COVID-19 has reached 42,094, according to Johns Hopkins University, and more than 750,000 cases have been confirmed.

""In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! Trump said in a tweet late on Monday night.

Details of the Trump's executive order were not immediately known. He also did not indicate when he will sign such an order.

While Trump talked about suspending immigration visa, the H-1B visa, which is more popular among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa. But his reasoning that he needs to protect jobs of American citizens indicates that non-immigrant work visas too might be on his target.

The United States, due to coronavirus, has experienced a record layoff. As off last week, a record number of 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.

Trump has already closed the Northern and Southern border that attracts a large number of illegal immigrants. Travel restrictions and closing of consulate services in many countries including India are already having an impact on issuing of new H-1B visas.

Last month, the United States suspended all routine visa services around the world due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

Globally, more than 2.4 million people have been infected with the virus and over 165,000 killed, according to the the univeristy tracker.

208,21-4-20,South Korea looking into reports about Kim Jong Un's health,"The South Korean government on Tuesday was looking into US media reports saying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was in fragile condition after surgery.

Officials from South Korea's Unification Ministry and National Intelligence Service said they couldn't immediately confirm the report. CNN cited an anonymous US official who said Kim was in grave danger after an unspecified surgery.

The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said it couldn't confirm another report by Daily NK, which cited anonymous sources to report that Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.

Speculation about Kim's health was raised after he missed the celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15.

Credible information about North Korea and especially its leadership is difficult to obtain and even intelligence agencies have been wrong about its inner workings in the past.

Normally Optimize users are able to run 10 personalizations on their websites at the same time.

""We have temporarily removed this restriction for the next 90 days so that you can make as many updates to your site as you need until July 31. If you don't already have an Optimize account, you can create one for free here,"" Google said in a statement late Monday.

According to the tech giant, once you log into your Optimize account, you can add a message to the top of your site by clicking ""Add a banner.""

""You can use our templated banner or customize it by editing the colour, size, and text. You can also select on which pages of your site the banner should be shown, for example only the homepage or on every page of your site,"" informed the tech giant.

Last week, Google introduced a new way to quickly post an informational banner at the top of the website.

The users can also tailor their messages by location.

""Let's say you're a clothing retailer based in San Francisco and are offering expedited shipping to customers located within the city. Optimize can help you display a customized banner that highlights faster shipping just to users located in San Francisco,"" said Google.

Other helpful tips are to avoid automatic product carousels or animation on your site.

If you have information about how customers can order from you on the same page, the carousel or animation could draw attention away from that message.

""Your frequently asked questions might be different than what they were last year. Make sure this page highlights what is currently top of mind for your customers,"" said Google.

Spotted first by WABetaInfo, a fan website that tracks WhatsApp updates, the latest WhatApp beta update has revealed the company is set to soon extend the limit of participants in a voice or video group call for its 2 billion users, including over 400 million in India.

224,21-4-20,UNICEF teams up with Microsoft for remote learning platform,"Microsoft has partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for expansion of a global learning platform to help children and youth affected by COVID-19 continue their education at home.

The platform, called ""Learning Passport"", which has been in development for the past 18 months, was due to start as a pilot programme this year.

When the global pandemic hit and schools were closed worldwide, the programme underwent rapid expansion of its reach.

Now, all countries with a curriculum capable of being taught online will be able to facilitate online learning for children and youth with devices at home, Microsoft said on Monday.

Kosovo, Timor-Leste and Ukraine -- which have closed their school gates in the past weeks to help halt transmission of the virus -- are the first to roll out their online curriculum through the Learning Passport.

The content available to schoolchildren includes online books, videos and additional support for parents of children with learning disabilities.

""From school closures, to isolation, to a persistent sense of fear and anxiety, the effects of this pandemic are impacting childhoods worldwide,"" Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director, said in a statement.

""We need to come together and explore every avenue to keep children learning and help them through this difficult time.""

According to the latest available data from UNESCO, 1.57 billion students have been affected by school closures in more than 190 countries worldwide.

""Just as COVID-19's impact has no borders, its solutions must not have borders, as it requires the collaboration across public and private sectors to ensure every student stays engaged and continues learning,"" said Brad Smith, President of Microsoft.

""UNICEF's Learning Passport is uniquely positioned as a scalable learning solution to bridge the digital learning gap for millions of students to bring their classroom into their home during the pandemic,"" he said.

Children and young people continuing their education online can do so through a country-specific platform, accessed via their country's learningpassport.unicef.org page.
